5.0,"Great shirt, thicker material and love the pattern."
5.0,I Loved the style & the Good quality of it
5.0,"These socks solved the swelling in my feet and legs from traveling by air. I have used other support socks but these are far and away better than the others. Much easier to put on and take off but work very well. After wearing these, there is no swelling. If your in the market for support socks, these are the ones to purchase."
5.0,"Love it, runs a little large and didn't shrink much after washing... which is a good thing."
5.0,Gorgeous...and it rained...
5.0,"The dress turned out to be a great selection for my daughter‚Äôs high school graduation. It did come with a small dark grayish stain that somehow got through the packaging, but it washed out well. I steamed out the wrinkles and it was gorgeous."
5.0,so confortable. thin and light weight but sturdy. These are my go to bras now. I will be ordering more
5.0,THEY WERE FOR MY GRANDSON
5.0,Excellent construction and quality
5.0,SOOOO cute!  These were just perfect for me.
5.0,"I think I already rated this, but I will do it again but this is by far one of the most beautiful rosaries I own!"
5.0,"Right now, my favorite LBD!"
5.0,"Love Reef Cushion flip flops, but I swear they have made some changes to their sizing!!  Their latest styles all seem to fit tighter and be a bit smaller/shorter than those from previous seasons.  I once had plenty of room, but now find that my heel is hanging off the back.  I wear a size 11, so if they continue to downsize, I may have to find a different brand, as I will no longer be able to fit in them.  A real shame, considering I have worn Reef for so many years now and really like the comfort and support, I have always enjoyed with their Cushion line."
5.0,These bands fit my Garmin Venu perfectly!  I love that they are fabric and not rubber.  They don‚Äôt irritate my skin at all.  The Velcro is strong and never comes loose.  I have a small wrist and these still fit good without the excess band being loose.  Have purchased many of these so I have them in different colors.  Great product!
5.0,"When I got these I thought they were going to be too small. I put one on and they don't suck up on your body but instead hang very nicely. Yes,they are very long,but that is what I was looking for. The top band easily and comfortably fold over."
5.0,And perfect for the cottage!
5.0,"I am trying to think of a woman who wouldn't like this. Perhaps one of the very rare women who dislikes all jewelry, or someone with severe metal allergies.  Any other woman would open the box and ""squee"" with delight.<br /><br />And then she'd put it on.  I have been wearing mine since the squee stopped reverberating around my house, and love it.  It rides just below the collarbone, and balances prettily on crew neck sweaters and tee shirts. My husband rarely notices jewelry, but he noticed this and asked me if it was ""real.""  I told him it was a real necklace, and really made by Swarovski. He has learned enough from my jewelrymaking that Swarovski is famous for crystal, not diamonds, so he calmed down and told me that it was very pretty.<br /><br />That's an over-the-top compliment from him, equivalent to a squee on my part.  If you give this as a gift, the recipient will show a similar sentiment."
5.0,Love this swim suit.  I wanted a 2 piece but not a super skimpy one.  This has nice coverage in the back as well!  Adjustable straps.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 125 lbs 34C and got a size small.
5.0,This outfit is adorable! Shipped quickly and my granddaughter loves it and looks adorable!
5.0,Good quality hat with a velcro size adjustment in back

5.0,I already had one of these and I use it for work. It's great on the job. It's inexpensive but very useful.
5.0,This rain coat is beautiful.  I got a lot of wear out of it.  The sizing is generous.  Snap closure is great and easy.
5.0,I love Carters‚Äôs. Their quality and style never disappoints. I like shirts to be a little roomier so my son doesn‚Äôt get hot. Size 2T was perfect. Would recommend to someone and/or purchase again.
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my brother.  He said very nice quality and comfy fit.  Plus washes well.
5.0,It‚Äôs definitely a must buy and it‚Äôs a nice stretch
5.0,I have purchased several necklaces similar to this one. All except this one took month's to receive and the detail was not worth the wait or money. I love that I can change the length of this necklace. I love everything about it. I wear it everyday and will definitely buy more.

5.0,love these glasses they're a little dark at night
5.0,"Really good product.  Low profile, and very securely stays attached once on and in the ear."
5.0,"Wow I can't say enough about these pants. I got 4 pairs of various workout bottoms for cycling and while I don't use these when I'm on my bike, I wear them constantly. They are so cozy and soft and even flattering."
5.0,Bought for my granddaughter. She just loves anything she can use on her hair.
5.0,bought several pairs. favorite sunglasses.  comfortable and light weight!
5.0,This band is a knock off but I‚Äôm impressed with it. A lot like the Nike band that Apple has.
5.0,I am a size 12/14 and I ordered the medium and I love the way it fits me. I weigh 175 lbs. and I can't even tell you how many compliments I received when I wore this dress. It is very comfortable. I am 5 ft. 2 inches and it covers my feet but I wore a one inch heel with it and it did not drag on the ground. I am already ordering 3 more üòä
5.0,Super cute. I get tons of compliments and it fits perfectly
5.0,Perfect for that extra ear piercing when you want just a touch of color.

5.0,My granddaughter loves these so much...almost too much...she didn't want to stop cuddling them. They are adorable and I am delighted!! Fit great and I like the stitching on them.
5.0,"So glad that I read all of the reviews.  I'm usually a small but ordered the medium. It fits perfect.  I'm a 34C and the top<br />portion fitting is just right not to small and not too big, just right."
5.0,"I was pretty surprised when I received it. I honestly wasn't expecting much for a suit at such low price. However, the quality is great, and the material is nice too. I ironed it and got the pants hemmed, it fits me perfectly. I wore it yesterday and got a lot of compliments on this suit."
5.0,Buffed my silver first and it removes the build up beautifully. Then tried cleaning with wieman silver wipes and then with the cloth to dry and buff with the cloth. The results were fantastic. Buy them!
5.0,Its a great bracelet for men. Makes a nice gift.
5.0,Thought this was really cute. I wore it to a Black History celebration I received a lot of compliments on the dress. The material is kind of thin had to wear some leggings. It was still a cute outfit. The fit is really good I got XL  and it fits really good.

5.0,"It fits in my smaller purses, where my regular sized wallet does not."
5.0,This is one of my favorite belts!!!
5.0,"Canceled due to the looong shipping time,  but recieved and canceled the return because it's literally exactly what I wanted.  The magnet is extremely strong and closes secure.  The phone case fits perfectly over my screen protector (not glass) and has very nice clicky buttons, and the wallet has enough space for all my cards and info.  It does work as a phone-stand as well but it took me a minute to figure that out.  5 stars despite the shipping because I completely forgot about it so it showed up with an element of surprise and turned out to be perfect for me."
5.0,I love these belts! They are very cute and you can't beat the price!!
5.0,"Where can I start ? I just had a baby & wanted something comfortable. I didn't want a waist trainer that would make  me feel uncomfortable or itchy like so many waist trainers do ( to me personally). So I ordered this one, out of the package I was like "" no this won't fit"" I was very wrong. I tried it and it was amazing. The fit was perfect ü•∞.  I did have a little trouble putting the waist trainer on. I have been wearing it for a week now since ordering it and I feel great. I would recommend this to other buyers. I will come back & post pictures with the waist trainer on. The order was fast & arrive perfectly."
5.0,Cutest bathing suit ever!!! Perfect size and looks absolutely adorable! I ordered two and I‚Äôm about to order a third one!!!
5.0,beautiful  great quality
5.0,"I love this cardigan! It's so cute and comfy!  Seriously don't hesitate to get this amazing, comfortable, adorable cardigan. I love the fit and feel. It's now my favorite cardigan. üíú<br />It does fit slightly big so depending on how you like the fit, I'd say go down a size  if you like a snuggier fit"
5.0,Worth it great gift
5.0,Good quality fabric..
5.0,Me agrad√≥ lo c√≥modo y ligero

5.0,I just absolutely LOVE this purse!!!
5.0,Purchased for my wife...she loves it and is super hot in it! I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I am waiting for another occasion to get her another one!
5.0,"I used this to cut for Jiu Jitsu. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 5‚Äù and 225. It fit me perfect.  Maybe a little big in the pants. If you‚Äôre trying to heat your body and metabolism this is the product. I can drop 3-9 pounds in water weight with it. You just have to gauge how hard and long it takes you by pound. Unless it‚Äôs for a couple pounds, I wouldn‚Äôt do it just before competition cause you‚Äôll be drained. It‚Äôs durable, doesn‚Äôt smell. Can machine wash and dry. I would avoid neoprene.  I tried both and the plastic is the way to go."
5.0,Beautiful colors and fit perfectly!
5.0,Beatiful skirt! Stretches at the waist and sizes 8-10 (US)
5.0,I was looking for something large and consequently visible for those in the cheap seats and this badge was impressive enough. It doesn't look or feel cheap and the price is great.
5.0,Nike Performance quality for half the price! Very soft and lightweight. Feel very comfortable and lightweight. Great value for the money!
5.0,"This is a verified purchase, and was paid for in full. The page I initially reviewed this exact BeLuring item was moved to here, and no longer exists. Original review for this item was written on March 31, 2016.<br /><br />This is a very cute babydoll dress that is a decent fit for plus sized women. It is both sexy and elegant at the same time. I am a size 18 with a DD breast size, and ordered the size XXX-Large. It has a nearly perfect breast fit, and covers them completely without falling out of the sides or center of the cups. There are numerous clasps on the upper portion of the back that really enable me to feel secure on the top side. My breasts are not perky due to breastfeeding multiple children, but the top portion held them up better than expected, although a tad bit tight. I also love that the breast area is not transparent to hide imperfections. As for the length, it just covers my bottom (I'm 5' 8&#34; tall), and was as long as expected.<br /><br />The body portion of the dress is not as transparent as I thought it would be, and shows through just enough to reveal the skin, while hiding imperfections. The only thing I was concerned about with this lingerie is the lace on the lower portion of it. It appears to be quite delicate like it must be handled with care; however, I wrestled around in it a bit, and slept a full night with it on, and had no problems with rips or tears. I was hesitant to purchase this in such a pure white color since it's said that white creates a larger body impression, but it actually makes me appear smaller than I am due to its amazing light flow in the body that enables it to not be too snug, and not too loose. It really is the perfect fit.<br /><br />I do love how the whole lingerie set feels against my skin. It's very soft and radiates sensuality. My husband adores it on me as much as I like it myself. It is a decent lingerie set with a great price point, and an attractive design. I have purchased other sets of this or lesser quality for much more. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"I ordered the black, and I love the unusual look! The ring seems true to size. I've worn it several days now and the stone seems secure enough, and the ring shows no signs of wear. I definitely plan on getting the silver colour, and maybe one of the others."
5.0,"These boots are gorgeous! They fit perfectly! They look expensive and have such a cozy lining! I would tell everyone to buy them! The price is right, too!!!!"
5.0,Great quality. Great value for the cost.
5.0,Amazed at difference while driving after dark.
5.0,"Lightweight, very well made for the price. Insane quality at this pricepoint."
5.0,"Pretty thin material but once steamed, it flowed and fit nicely. A little longer than I thought but very cute wrap dress. Windy days do not make good days to wear this. Lol"
5.0,Item is very pretty and well made!
5.0,I was hesitant to buy but it is super thick material and great stretch. Squat proof and is super flattering. I ended up ordering another set. I never write reviews but this set is amazing
5.0,"Great for fallen arches.  I love vionic.  These have a little higher arch built in, it seems."
5.0,Son is so excited
5.0,"This was my second best buy (the first was the ring, obviously) to propose with. Made my proposal that much more special as I know my fiancee loves lights and anything sparkly. Let me tell you, this made the ring sparkle like no other! The smooth matte black box feels ultra premium too. My fiancee now calls this box the rings &quot;house.&quot; I love it. She loves it. Oh! and great customer service too!"
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Very elegant pendant with lots of shine and sparkles. Great piece for your honey and sure she will love you for the gift.
5.0,"Very cute, same as pictured, it does shed until you wash it. Runs big."
5.0,"1st dress I've ever bought online. I took my measurements, followed their size chart upon ordering, was very worried it wouldn't fit but was relieved & pleasently surprised when it arrived & fit perfectly. And it's super cute with those heart shaped buttons. I love it!"
5.0,"Beautiful YELLOW dress! It received many compliments. Beautiful fabric and certainly designed to tailor the women's physique.<br />I have thicker arms so it was a little tight, however other than that I appreciated the fit.<br />36DDD<br />5'4&#34;<br />150lbs"
5.0,"These are my favorite wedges.. they are great with slacks, dresses or jeans and very comfortable. I have worn them to the office and they are comfortable but be advised I do not stand or walk a lot at work. Not good for stair climbing though which is why I only worn them to work once since I have to climbed stairs. Going up is fairly easy it's the walking down the stairs that are a bit scary but that is because of the nature of the high wedge not the shoe itself. The shoe is actually very stable. Will def order another pair of these."
5.0,ggood
5.0,It was great for shoveling snow etc but didn't last for more than a season. Maybe newer technology will be better. I would recommend.
5.0,Easy to keep on around neck
5.0,I like my bag it is a very comfortable bag. I use it for my work.
5.0,"Needed a cheap pair of googles for skiing, but ended up using them for snow mobile instead.  I was worried they would be too big for a full face helmet, but they worked out great!  The magnetic disconnect for the lens is great, but ended up not using it.  Lots of functionality for the price, was very happy.<br /><br />If you don't live near the mountains and don't want to invest in an expensive goggle, these are what you need."
5.0,Fit great. I have a big butt and sometimes am constantly adjusting my leggings but these stay put perfectly even when running during Peloton tread classes! Tummy control is very good. Feel way more expensive than they were. And the pockets of course are great!
5.0,Best watch for everyday use and price<br />Its light weight and classic
5.0,"My husband had elbow surgery and we had purchased a shirt at that time, it helped make dressing so much easier than prior surgeries without it BUT the real God send was having it on hand when he had a shoulder injury, just bought more! Not only are these genius but they are made with quality soft material too, won‚Äôt constrict or irritate. If you are a wife or caretaker trust me this will help everyone involved! ; )"
5.0,"I love this watch. I've worn it for all types of activities and it still works. The best waterproof watch I've had. I've worn it in pools and oceans and it still works great. Not the best looking watch but functionality is great, especially for the price."
5.0,I can't belive beatiful torsade and  wonderful price.
5.0,Nice boot knife. Is easy to extract.
5.0,"Awesome headbands! The braided design is very nice and well made. They secure and smoothe without tearing your hair or giving you a headache because it's too tight! I have naturally curly hair, 3b/3c curl type. I hope these lasts a while but I'm probably gonna order more for me and my daughters."
5.0,Love my new shirt! Received so many compliments on the 4th of July!
5.0,"Soft fabric, exactly what I wanted. Great product , great service."

5.0,My daughter loves this nightgown!!
5.0,Was a bit long but fit just snug enough. I recieved plenty of compliments!
5.0,These are very good quality and work perfect for making my pendants. I've ordered these trays from several places and these are by far the best. I will definitely order these again
5.0,"Great band! I love it. I‚Äôm a nurse so couldn‚Äôt do a leather band due to it being a little damp all the time due to handwashing. I can‚Äôt stand the wet feeling and eventually the leather bands start to smell. So when I got my new Apple watch, I ordered this silicone band ahead of time to switch them over. I ordered the navy band with a little pink. I love the color and it matches my scrubs."
5.0,"Bought both size 4 and 5. These are from prewalker line very soft. My older daughter used to have sneakers during pre-walker time they are good but not pretty when with dresses, glad LL has this product line providing nice but comfy shoes for babies"
5.0,Very good quality. Great value for the money
5.0,"I wore this for a performance I was in, and it was fantastic! The quality for the price is something you can‚Äôt beat."

5.0,comfy fit
5.0,"Got this for my little great granddaughter she‚Äôs very hard to please, but she loves these shoes and I love them so cute she got lots of compliments. Also very comfortable she could actually wear them to school all day and not complain"
5.0,Perfect for what I needed.  Thanks.
5.0,"I love these earrings, they are adorable.<br />personally, i wish the stud part were more in the middle,<br />but either way they are so worth it.<br /><br />and the cute bag they came in made me smile,<br />it was a nice little extra :)"
5.0,"Note: this is a set of *piercing earrings*. They come in a sealed, sterile case (along with 2 alcohol pads.) Each earring is loaded into a cartridge for a piercing gun.<br /><br />(My mistake - I thought I was just buying a pair of regular,  blunt titanium studs for already-pierced ears.)"
5.0,I really like this bra. It‚Äôs great for coverage but still looks feminine
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE my crisscross bralet! Fits great, super comfortable, and is great quality!"
5.0,"My son who is 23, really liked these socks.  Size fit perfectly."
5.0,It‚Äôs a bit small which I expected but it‚Äôs perfect for my personal use.
5.0,These masks were a great find. My daughter wears these to school daily and the carbon filter is great.
5.0,I purchased a pair of Lindsay Phillips flip flops and I like to get a variety of snaps to change the look of my shoes or to match an outfit.  Love these snaps.
5.0,Very high quality lenses!! Not difficult at all to DIY the replacement. Very happy to be able to replace my scratched lenses without having to buy all new glasses. Highly recommended!
5.0,These were perfect for a bachelorette on the beach
5.0,Bought it for my nephew away at college....said it was the best gift he ever received!

5.0,Fit great. Just as listed. I'll buy more.
5.0,Gift for niece.
5.0,"I purchased this for my teenage daughter, it‚Äôs part of her school uniform. It fit perfectly and comfortable to wear"
5.0,"Full disclosure: I also these at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.  Admittedly, I would not have purchased these otherwise - I didn't necessarily need two new sets of sunglasses.  That said, I am very happy with this purchase.  They fit comfortably.  They seem to be sturdy, even though there is some flexibility in them as well.  I have zero complaints and am now wearing these every day.  On top of that, the standard price is well below what I'd expect to pay for a product of this quality, having worn them."
5.0,Jacket is really cute but runs super small kadies
5.0,Looks great and a perfect fit
5.0,This is exactly what I needed. I can jump rope now and not injure myself because of my breasts. Going to order the black one as well soon.
5.0,This was a gift.  I was very pleased with the bracelet. I didn‚Äôt want anything too big. It‚Äôs narrow and exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Good quality and craftsmanship for the price.
5.0,I'm very pleased with the shoe shine kit. It is well made and has Amos amount of space for additional shoe cleaning items.
5.0,A must wear safety glasses at work and while wearing a Covid 19 protection mask this product keeps my glasses fog free! Best spray I've used ever!
5.0,"These socks are a great thickness, not too thick or thin. They are very comfortable, soft and stay in place well. The wolf logo is subtle and cool looking. The stitching on the toes doesn't bother my feet when I wear shoes. Stylish and nice quality socks."
5.0,Love these! It feels like you are wearing nothing and breathable.
5.0,"I have been allergic to pretty much every earring I have tried to wear, but these earrings have caused me no issues and are super light. I sometimes forget I am wearing them until they get bumped. I would by them again."
5.0,"Great quality, had no trouble putting them in. Received many compliments!"
5.0,"Everything being Nothing Carolina made it perfect. Fit, size design and color."
5.0,There was an issue with the sweatshirt I ordered and it was replaced promptly and to my satisfaction. The sweatshirt is very nice and is as described. Very responsive with great customer service. Would highly recommend.
5.0,"This is a very nice necklace, the owl is bright and the chain strong. What is important, because this was a gift for a very active young lady (10 y. o.) who would cry in case of damage to the item, if too delicate. This is bigger than regular necklace for such age. But the idea was - to give something easily visible, distinguishing immediately as the recipient is a true lover of cats and owls. Especially nice-looking when used with turtleneck sweater or one-color T-shirt. I highly recommend Seller's service, item sent promptly and package was well prepared for delivery. Many thanks!"
5.0,"Very pretty bracelet, It looks exactly like the picture!!"
5.0,I read the reviews before I purchased and as advised I bought then a bit larger.  1/2 size and they are perfect.<br />So they tend to run a about a 1/2 size small.  Just get the next size and you will love them.
5.0,"when I ordered these I thought they would be just like the speedo solar briefs except with stripes on the side. I was pleasantly surprised that the fabric on these is a lot thinner and stretchier than the solars, with a single ply in the back and a liner upfront. The cut is the same, but these are less restrictive and provide a little more coverage because of the thiness and stretchiness of the fabric. You will need to be comfortable with a little bit of a  swinging motion upfront because of the less restrictive fabric around your package.  (As far as I‚Äôm concern that‚Äôs a big plus.) Definitely one of my favorite swimsuits of all time. Order a size smaller than you usually get - I‚Äôm 6ft, you‚Äôre 200 lbs  and a size 34 fits me, but I might get another at 32."
5.0,"These earrings are gorgeous and and exactly what i was envisioning wearing with my wedding dress for our beach wedding, but didn't think it was possible to find what I wanted in clip earrings. The best part is they aren't heavy, I don't even feel them on.<br />I can't wait to wear them down the isle!"
5.0,My son is absolutely happy.  I paid $10 with a $4 off coupon. Crazy good deal. I'm not sure how they'll hold up but we're excited for how authentic they look and feel and they'll be great for his tactical FBI costume.
5.0,Good and cheap price
5.0,"I ordered these socks because I'd heard bamboo socks would not make your feet stink. Yeah, sure, I thought, we'll see about that, I thought. Well guess what- ITS TRUE!!! If you get stinky feet you have to try these socks. No more foot odor and my feet don't feel sweaty and clammy. They are durable- I've worn them every day for almost a year and no holes yet. Comfortable toe seams (I'm very particular about that) and they don't slide down my legs and bunch up in my shoes. Seriously worth the money. They take a little longer to ship but that's the only negative I can think of."
5.0,Very nice bracelet.  Bought it as a gift and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.
5.0,These are the best plugs I‚Äôve bought whether it‚Äôs from an actual store or online. Finally I‚Äôve found some that are a perfect fit!!!
5.0,I wear this shirt at least once a week! The quality and softness is amazing! I love the slightly oversized fit and that it‚Äôs long enough to wear with leggings. I‚Äôm shocked at how well<br />It‚Äôs holding up!
5.0,"This is my new Favourite purse! I have had so many compliments and great conversations about this silver purse. Everyone loves it and wants to know where to get it. I hope I've helped you sell a few more. Very lightweight, and the chain is great for a cross body fit. Thank you so much for the speedy delivery!"
5.0,i love this dress. just enough stretch and super comfy. i wear a size L and XL in nicole so i went with an XL and it fits great. i probably could have gotten away with a L but i like having a little more room
5.0,"Fits well, super cute"
5.0,I love this band! Just in the silicon version it‚Äôs easy to put on but without the skin sweats and irritation. Also easy to install. Would definitely buy again in another color.
5.0,Great gift my wife loved it.
5.0,Estoy muy satisfecha con mis compras gracias
5.0,Side rims help block sunlight from view.

5.0,Slippers are very nice.
5.0,"I haven‚Äôt even had these socks for a long time. Maybe 4 months. I barely go anywhere. To the grocery store when I absolutely have to.<br />Basically, I barely wear them and these already have a hole in them.<br />That‚Äôs some BS. I‚Äôm never purchasing these again. I was actually thinking about it, because I love colorful socks and they are comfortable.<br />However, if they can‚Äôt last through being worn only 5 times (yes, I know how many times I wear them because I don‚Äôt go anywhere unless I absolutely have to and I‚Äôm a minimalist) then they are in no way worth buying again.<br />Now I have to look for a more durable set."
5.0,My mom loves this product a lot. She is never an earring lady but she loves the earrings and the necklace so much she wears it whenever she goes out. What an amazing gift for your love ones!

5.0,"Love these earrings. They are very well made, and I wear them frequently."
5.0,"I love the feel of the fabric. It is perfect for the summer heat....not too long, not to short. I would purchase again from this seller."
5.0,I have gotten many compliments from wearing this beautiful Star of David scarf necklace.<br />This is a conversation starter anywhere you go. I ordered 6 so far and sold 4 of them myself easily.
5.0,"I wear these a lot of hours.  Very comfortable, and last fairly well."
5.0,"In spite of somw reviews, fit exactly right - and I wear size 12 shoes."
5.0,"This is a great deal - the construction of the glasses is reasonably strong, they arrived early, and the look great. Can't complain - I'll probably get all my reading glasses this way from now on."
5.0,The entire costume is perfect. We were pleasantly surprised. The tie is a zip up tie which is so easy and cute for our lil man to do himself. The sweater is great and the shorts and jacket are perfect. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for better
5.0,"Great quality, snaps securely. Very happy with it"
5.0,NOTHING but compliments given on this great Warriors bucket hat....very well made and generous amount of rim gives good sun screen.

5.0,Very comfy and looks great
5.0,"There‚Äôs a lot to,say about these Sorel Boots. First of all I love the look with jeans. I purchased the cattail brown color. Love the color. I always buy black but didn‚Äôt want to pay the high price and needed a pair of brown anyway. Very nice looking brown color. Different. Anyway, I think these run 1/2 size small. I normally size up 1/2 size in boots in winter and did so with these also. They fit but not in the usual way a 1/2 size larger fits me. You will not be able to,wear these if you have extra large calves either. I have small calves. The stitching that runs around the laces rubs on the inside of the boot. You have to adjust the laces to give yourself more width at the bottom foot area so they don‚Äôt pinch or rub and tighten at the ankle area and the rest of the way up the boot. At this point you can leave them and just use the zipper and they are comfortable. This is why I gave them a 4 star rating. They are lovely looking with my skinny jeans and sweaters. I have quite a number of pairs of pointed toe boots so this is a nice change and I have two bags that will go great with them. Love,the style. Won‚Äôt be wearing for warmth and haven‚Äôt a clue how warm they are as I haven‚Äôt worn them out yet. Comfort could be a bit better. If I hadn‚Äôt got a good deal I would try a 10 in these. A whole size up which is usually giant on me. I do have room though in the toe box. I have a very slightly wide foot. If your foot is narrow you more then likely won‚Äôt have to adjust the laces. Buy them you‚Äôll love them."
5.0,"The kids at our party, loved these!"
5.0,Kids love them and had no problem wearing them!!
5.0,Wore this shirt to a meeting at work and everyone loved it. Also nice for church.
5.0,Bought this mask for myself.  It is so pretty....purple in color üíú  and sparkle design with rhinestones.  I love it!  I get a great deal of compliments and being asked where I got it!  Highly recommend!
5.0,Good material and fits perfectly
5.0,I get so many compliments on this.  it's a decent length as i'm 5'11&#34;. Not too short.
5.0,This ring is super pretty. I‚Äôm in love with it. I was pleasantly surprised and it arrived fast!!!
5.0,"Nice leg warmers but slightly big. I have small calves, so that may be the issue. But I wore them and liked them during the cold winter days."
5.0,"Love this casual shirt!! Fits perfectly, feels great, well made. Gonna order more colors!"
5.0,Mido 5'2 130lbs 36b w28 h39 me queda perfecto ya que no me gusta que quede muy ajustado del busto
5.0,Needed for costume worked perfectly
5.0,Just as I expected. Great little gift
5.0,"This is a great dress - very forgiving. It's a heavy tee-shirt type material that drapes nicely. I'm 5'6&#34;, and the hem was mid-knee.<br /><br />I wore this dress to a casual outdoor wedding, and was very comfortable (and got lots of compliments, too!). You can definitely dress up or down in this dress.<br /><br />I purchased the blue, and it's true to color. It's such a great price that I intend to buy at least one more, in black, and maybe the burgundy too!<br /><br />My only frustration is that there was not a tag in my dress that identifies the material. It did, however, have a 'cleaning and ironing' tag."
5.0,I bought these as a birthday gift for a nine year old girl & she loved them!!!
5.0,"I love this tank top, wear it all the time. Good for going out in the summer with friends or staying cool and being lazy on a hot day. I should buy it in more colors...."
5.0,"Very warm and cuddly. you look silly wearing it, but you will be happy."
5.0,Extactly what I was looking for. Fits perfectly on my Oakley‚Äôs.
5.0,"Beautiful dress! I am a size M-L depending on the brand and I ordered a M in the apricot, it fits great and the dress quality is wonderful. I<br /> purchased it again in another color."
5.0,Loveeee this shirt so much ordered a second one!! Fit great and colors are gorgeous!
5.0,"BEAUTIFULL, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND VERY GOOD PRICE"
5.0,Great watch band with fast shipping!
5.0,FIT GREAT<br />COMFY<br />GREAT MATERIAL
5.0,As expected and I like them.
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter, it fit perfectly and is exactly how it was pictured."
5.0,My son wore the heck out of his
5.0,"I bought it for my friend who loves these kinds of hats. I was too excited to wait a month for her birthday so I gave it to her right away, ha!! She LOVED IT!!! I'm not into those kinds of hats but if I was I would wear it, the material is nice, it's just perfect!!"
5.0,Love this dress. You can wear it casually or dress it up!
5.0,Fits me just right...I'm normally a US 12/14 so just go by the sizing chart
5.0,"good sleeves for sun protection, seem well made. comfy while on. no complaints."
5.0,A beautiful watch band that will outlive me!  Very durable and the stitching is well done!
5.0,Fast shipping Thank You very nice item.
5.0,"We needed a sea-themed hat for our daughter who was a background dancer in a Little Mermaid number for a high school theater production. This fit the bill without being too expensive. Even with our over-sized craniums, the hat fit pretty well. It'd definitely be true-to-size for folks with normal-sized skulls. :-)"
5.0,"I needed a small gift for our granddaughter to give my husband.  She was excited to give it to him, since he wears caps all the time.  It was good quality & adjustable."
5.0,Slightly loose fit. Perfect to wear for theme days at school for a teacher.
5.0,"Purchased this dress last year for my teen's eighth grade graduation.  She loved the look, flow, length and feel.  My husband and I (and our teen) loved that it was not revealing yet elegant and classy.  She paired it with a white bolero."
5.0,"Love this band , love that the pins are not loose and there attached to band thank you , I ordered a small but believe this is a large on last notch could go tighter , but band is very nice !!"
5.0,The automatic movement impressed me for the price. After a manual wind of 30 turns the watch keeps time and with wearing the watch for only half a day the watch is still running fine the next day. Similar to much more expensive movements. The band and deployant clasp are of nice quality as well.
5.0,Flattering and fits as expected.  Stains easily though so be careful.  The button area bulges so I had to pin it and will eventually sew it shut.
5.0,Perfect fit on my stud muffin hubby. Can hardly keep my hands off of his camp booty
5.0,"GREAT purse/tote, love everything about it.  I have had so many compliments on this purse and it costs way less than any of my other ones.  The construction is great, lots of room.  I did have a pursfection insert for the inside to add stability so it will stand up straight when  I set it down.  With out that I think it would fall over.  Don't hesitate to purchase, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,"I love these big sunglasses! I can just throw them on whenever I go to the store, or if I don't want to put makeup on. Also, they were great at the pool!"
5.0,"These are super comfortable and look great. I kind of expected lower quality because they are less than $20, but I'm very happy with how well they fit, look, and move. I can buy 2-4 of these for the same price as  one pair of ultra-name brand pants. Sold."
5.0,Love this...very sexy.
5.0,Great for wearing under soccer jersey on chilly days.
5.0,Nice Crystals!!!
5.0,This top is so colorful and flowy! I love it!
5.0,To me it looks better then the picture
5.0,"wash separately!  color does bleed, but absolutely LOVE the top"
5.0,Veru cute
5.0,Very nice!  The birthday girl loved it.
5.0,These are wonderful quality for the value! They fit really good and don‚Äôt slide
5.0,"My teen daughter saw an outfit she loved on Pinterest.  We found this top and purchased it at a great price from Amazon.  It is so soft and comfortable.  It would fit true to size, but we ordered a M to get the desired ""look"" she wanted to copy.  The quality is great too.  My daughter has worn it many times since it was purchased and it still looks great."
5.0,Really helps with the headlight glare when driving at night. Great purchase.
5.0,"Just received these glasses yesterday, I love,them,very comfortable and see very clearly and everything looks very natural with uv protection. I am considering buying another pair in a different color.  The best thing is they  are very affordable since many things can happen breaking losing them,etc"
5.0,"Perfect fit, soft fabric"
5.0,"I had these in my cart for SO long, mostly because I have a difficult time trusting a product that is wildly inexpensive. However, I reluctantly bought them and I wish I did it sooner! The description tells you which stones are natural and which are synthetic, which I appreciate the transparency. My ears were recently stretched to 00g and I have historically had problems fitting double flared plugs in, but not with these; they fit like a glove.<br /><br />Anyway- they fit perfectly, they are GOOD QUALITY, and for that price, how could you not buy them?"
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace! Ther is nothing I don‚Äôt love about it.  Even if you dress up or down this necklace is so lovely you will get compliments and inquires into where you got it from.
5.0,"Comfortable, sure fix and look very good."
5.0,"The hat was a little small, but my kiddo has a big head. Lol.<br /><br />I attached a photo of my son in part of the outfit. üíú"
5.0,These are the perfect weight.  They can go in any shoe or boot.  So soft and warm and comfortable!
5.0,"Other people complained about the smell of this shirt when it arrived. It honestly, just smells like chlorine. The next day, even though I just put it in a drawer, it barely smelled like that anymore. I feel like everyone else was exaggerating if it's the same smell.<br /><br />I'm a plus-sized woman, 5'3&#34; and about a size 18-22 depending on the brand. I've had a heck of a time trying to find any button ups, none-the less chambray--which fits and looks good! This one does. It's flattering, long enough to tuck but not too long to leave undone. The perfect amount of stretch, great size selection."
5.0,"Love this dress!! Bought it for an upcoming trip to Mexico and it will be perfect. The length is perfect, I am 5‚Äô4 and not too long or too short. It runs a little bit big. I am usually a small or a medium and ordered a medium just to be safe."
5.0,"Very comfortable, breathable socks.  Silicon heel prevents them from slipping down and holds up well to washing.  Sit low as described and below most shoes, though will stick out above loafers if you are buying for that purpose."
5.0,I bought this for my grandmother's birthday and it's a great little bday present! For the price it's great product!
5.0,Great dress for a really great price.
5.0,"This is my second pair.  I put 22,000 miles on my first pair, before I wore through a thumb on my shifting hand.  Perfect for a leather wrapped steering wheel, as it eliminates the gunk that can build up from skin oils.<br /><br />After break-in, my first pair didn't fit as snug in the wrist as I liked, so I had a shoe repair shop add another snap next to the original one. Problem solved.<br /><br />Don't let a lack of lining dissuade you.  The deer-skin is soft enough that a lining is not necessary, allowing these to breathe and eliminate any over-heating problem.<br /><br />Be prepared for the strange patch of tanned skin on the back of your hands, though.  ;-)<br /><br />A very high-quality, exceedingly comfortable glove."
5.0,I liked the pattern of the dress and being the summertime around the corner. I wanted to have light casual dress to wear and this one seems just liked that. It's light airy and roomy with a cute bohemian pattern. It has a elastic upper waist which is a design feature that kinds make it more curvy and body hugging as well.<br />The pattern is all over the dress. The material  is also quick dry and doesn't shrink after wash as well. I already did washed it as well.. Sleeves are short almost shoulder length. So you can wear a cover up like thing if u r in sun for too long to avoid tanning... it's knee length in height. Overall a cute summer dress for anytime of the day !!!
5.0,Well made. Excellent customer service.
5.0,"Beautiful , spacious , lots of pockets inside . Good  quality ."
5.0,My boy friend is between a 36 and 38 and the large fit him with a bit of room.  The feel of the fabric is great.  I got him  all the colors.  Great for the price.
5.0,Great fit and very stylish. I got a lot of compliments.
5.0,"This unisex bracelet is beautiful in color and sturdy,  When I go on vacations,I wear this bracelet.  I often receive many complements from both men and women alike."
5.0,"Extremely comfy, non-sweaty, stay-in-place without strangulation!"
5.0,Much lighter than I expected looks fabulous
5.0,My daughter loves it. It is so easy for her to take it off and put it back on. It also helped with the rash that was caused by the original band.
5.0,"This belt is awesome. It‚Äôs a really good belt at an incredible price. Being a big guy my belt comes in contact with hard surfaces. So far no scuffs, or scratches. It looks really good to. Super easy to use.<br /><br />The only downside is that the buckle is quite heavy."
5.0,It came very promptly and is as cute as it looks!
5.0,I'm not using them as suspenders. We are using them to hold the sheets on our RV mattresses. So far they are working great.
5.0,I did not want a lot of very pink or girly things for my baby but my husband saw this hat and it was so cute we wanted to try it. I was a bit worried that it would be too girly. It is very subtle and cute and we are so glad we got it. The hat seems very well made! Can't wait for our little one to get here so she can wear it.
5.0,I love the shoe for my newborn son. They are so soft on his little feel. Great value for this product.
5.0,The dress was very cute. This was worn for my daughter's dedication ceremony. Everyone loved the dress.
5.0,"It is probably one of the best crossover shoulder bags that I have had.  Depth is perfect and fits a long wallet.  Not big enough if you are packing lunch or children's &#34;stuff&#34; in it, but perfect for phone, glasses etc. for one person."
5.0,I love this bracelet ! Very pretty! Its a little smaller than I thought it would be but I have a small wrist so its perfect!
5.0,Fresh product. It makes knotting and fly tying easy.
5.0,"Beautiful shoe for my granddaughter. She loves it. Will be wearing with black taffeta dress, silver bow to black tie wedding."
5.0,"Wash before wearing my baby broke out from this product. However, she has a skin allergy from coconut oil and maybe this dress was stored near coconut oil."
5.0,I thought it was small for me. But when I try it it fits me and too cute.
5.0,"The size 10 sandals perfectly fit my skinny, size 9-1/2D feet.  The one-piece construction looks sturdy and has no crevices to hold dirt or water."
5.0,"Great colors, nice!"
5.0,"I‚Äôd wear these always if it was socially acceptable! Butt looks great, breathable material, holds up in hot yoga and boot camp, great product & price!"
5.0,The best wallet I ever had. There were complaints about it being hard to remove cards but it only took about 30 minutes to loosen it up. The leather and stitching is excellent.
5.0,The ear rings are more beautiful than the picture. I don‚Äôt have anything negative to say about them.
5.0,Very nice set of earrings! I've started to wear a lot of rose gold jewelry lately and these match perfectly. So glad I ordered them
5.0,the Meaneor shirts are PERFECT.
5.0,I really loved this shirt!!!!
5.0,"This band was extremely helpful to me! I was able to attach it to my Fitbit and put it around my ankle, when I do my sit and pedal on my Cubii.  Otherwise, I would not get the steps I should have, since my arms aren‚Äôt going as fast as my feet!"
5.0,I did purchase another change for it
5.0,This is a great looking watch for the price! So comfortable to wear.
5.0,Good solid bracelet works as expected
5.0,i like it all
5.0,Very nice and has the potential for a lot of storage.
5.0,Ring is beautiful. I haven‚Äôt taken it off since I received it. Ring didn‚Äôt tarnish or change color. Order it you will not regret it.
5.0,Nice quality scarf
5.0,"100% Beautiful, my brother is certainly going to enjoy his Christmas this year"
5.0,Nice comfortable sporty watch.
5.0,Ordered this same shirt from a different vendor and it was not the same material. Found this for a couple more dollars but the material was as described. Fit well on my customers with no complaints.
5.0,"Its heavy so you know its not made of garbage materials. This is the most expensive umbrella i have ever bought. Never spent more than $7 on an umbrella but those didnt last very long( as expected). Currently living in a surprisingly windy city so gotta buy a legit one, finally. So far, not broken yet."
5.0,"It's very convenient to have this shoes in you car or you bag , in cause of raining"
5.0,"Very happy with the product. As described, elegant looking and a great value. Would order from you again!"
5.0,This necklace is beautiful.  I was concerned it would be of a cheap quality but it is actually quite stunning.  Purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother and she adores it!  Very large size and very detailed piece.  The little scarf around the neck actually swivels so that you can adjust the scarf to be in the front.  The seller was very good at communicating and let me know that the product could not arrive before Christmas and checked in to see if I still wanted it to be sent.  I'm very glad that I decided to have it shipped anyway because it is really a lovely piece of costume jewelry.  I am going to reorder this piece for my aunts.
5.0,It's sooooo adorable I love it!!!!!
5.0,"Love these shoes!!  So many compliments when I wear them, plus they really are comfy!"
5.0,This is the best summer cap I‚Äôve found aside from what I wear on float trips. I‚Äôm in the process of growing my hair out so I wanted a cap like this for summer wear to keep my hair from blowing all over creation and it does the job with the added bonus of letting my head stay cool. I want one for every day of the week. It fits perfectly.
5.0,"I was expecting them to come a lot later but got here within two weeks. They were same quality it seems as the ones I brought locally, so no complaints. Unfortunately I cannot wear them because after 6 years of leaving mine out it is just too uncomfortable and I feel like I out grown the look. But thank you."
5.0,Love the fit. I'm 5'6 160 and I purchased the XL
5.0,These eye. Glass holders so far are holding tight<br />Finally I can keep from losing my glasses<br />Thank you
5.0,Washes well. Use day and night. Keeps the chill away
5.0,Very cool masks.  Adjustable sizing.  The black mask fits over the red one.  The mask says a lot of phrases.
5.0,"Very warm, and beautiful."
5.0,Great fitting shirt that also helps prevent against rubbing
5.0,They are amazing and so warm. I love them they are my favorite pants to wear for winter.
5.0,I love the way it fits is warm
5.0,"Great value, 2 bands at a good price"
5.0,"The material is super soft with a nice stretch, the color is vibrant, I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Will recommend...."
5.0,They are so cute and soft. I expected them to be thin but they were thick and very lightweight. They are also double sides witch is amazing. Would highly recommend. I‚Äôd love to see more letters and colors available.
5.0,"comes w/ really cute packaging & is slightly scented which is good since it's not overwhelming. it hasn't popped after a few hours of playing so far (i know one of the other listings on amazon by someone else had bad reviews about that so i was personally worried about it easily popping too)<br /><br />i got strawberry & chocolate! (haven't played with chocolate yet since i don't want the powder to rub off)<br />personally, i prefer to just use it as decoration since it's so realistic but it's really fun to play with too!"
5.0,"I'm a size medium and ended up returning and getting the small. I need to wear as the top for a bridesmaid outfit I'm wearing in August. It will work perfectly. The only thing about the size small is that it's a bit short, which in my case is fine for tucking into my skirt at the waist, but if I wanted to wear it on its own it would be too short for me. Overall good buy."
5.0,"EXCELLENT WATCH ,LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT"
5.0,"My toddler loves these sneakers, cute color, sparkly, lights up at the bottom"
5.0,Loved! The headband broke in shipping but i superglued back together
5.0,"I love this dress!! The package arrived quickly, and I ripped it open right away to try this little number on! The fabric is a very nice quality, somewhat stretchy, and has a really nice feel to it overall. I am glad that I read the reviews and ordered based on my bust measurement, not my waist, but I still could have gone down another size. My measurements are 40-35-43, and I ordered the large. Ignore the hip measurement altogether; it's so full in the hips, size in that area won't really matter. A medium definitely would have worked for me, but I will make do with the large for now. I definitely plan to order this in the other colors.<br /><br />I purchased a 25&#34; petticoat to go with it, but I will try to find a longer petticoat. 25&#34; is too short for this dress in my opinion. The petticoat comes to the knees but the dress comes down to mid-calf.<br /><br />I will update my review once I have worn it a few times."
5.0,"listen, i love a chain. i have quite a few. this one is HEAVY. it feels so quality, i was honestly shocked. I have a few chains that i‚Äôve paid much more for that don‚Äôt even hold a candle to the quality of this one. 10/10 recommend"
5.0,Really love this ring. Wanted something simple but elegant and this fits the bill. Its a very delicate ring though and may bend easily so if you work with your hands a lot be sure to remove it so it doesn't get ruined. Perfect for the price.
5.0,"I have these in at least 5 different colors. The fit is a bit off sometimes though. I ordered my first pair in medium and it fit so well, then I ordered another in medium and it was WAY too big. Now the last three I‚Äôve gotten have been in a small and they are just a smidge too tight, but fit well otherwise. Wish the sizes were consistent because I love them."
5.0,My wife loves it!!  Fits great.
5.0,Just received.  Tried on at work right after receiving - fits perfectly.
5.0,Lo uso en la cosina
5.0,You can't go wrong with StrapsCo.
5.0,I liked the way it looked on. Accentuate all the curves.
5.0,Worked great for what I needed it to. Will buy again. Will they were in packs though of colors.
5.0,I love these! I found them in a store (tjmax ithink).  I lived in them while gardening that week.  I looked the brand up on Amazon and ordered another.  They're really comfortable and will definitely purchase more as needed.
5.0,Perfect for dressing up. Loved that they had a tab on the heel to help pull them on.
5.0,The sellers were super helpful in making sure this arrived on time for our event. It's super cute and my daughter loves it! Great product from great vendors.
5.0,Better than the picture! Fabulous!
5.0,I love this shirt. This shirt is sheer thin and is very comfortable. The material is very light. I recommended this shirt to all I know.
5.0,Fits great and looks exactly like pictured.  very warm. Love it!
5.0,This is the best batch of socks I have bought in  years.
5.0,Fits great. The length of everything fit just as pictured. My 70 year old mother loves the coverage and now has one her favourite swim suit.
5.0,"My first Oakley shades and I love it. It fits nicely on my face. The item came in a good condition. But I don't know why it is stated as XLJ, that it is actually not an XLJ lens. A lot of product description are misleading in Amazon."
5.0,I ordered a size smaller. I am normally a large and got the medium.<br />Love the dress. I am 5'5&#34; and dress came right above my knees.<br />Perfect with any pair of shoes.
5.0,"I'm pretty sure this is a knock off, not official, but it's still really great quality."
5.0,"Medium weight, T-shirt material.  Looks great with jeans, slacks or skirt.  Will keep the drafts from vents in the office or home from chilling shoulders and forearms, but not made to keep you warm in a brisk breeze.  With this being said, I'm glad I purchased this wrap, it's so attractive and unusual and I don't see anything like it when I'm out and about, and isn't that the reason to buy unusual items?"
5.0,"Love how these don‚Äôt budge. These are the best low rise socks I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of buying, I‚Äôm not sorry I bought two packs! Woo boo!"
5.0,"I ordered these gloves ions ago to usher, I have since had to get another but I am grateful. They served purpoe in my details. Thank you."

5.0,Prefect gift
5.0,Loveeee it
5.0,thick enough and still comfortable and I love the fact<br />You can adjust them.  Awesome<br />Patterns too
5.0,I love this pair of sunglass. They look classy.
5.0,"I love the red color of this nose ring, and the fit was great. Not too big but noticeable at the same time."
5.0,"My all-time favorite sunglasses are made by a company let's call Hawaii James. Unfortunately, a stiff breeze breaks my all-time favorite sunglasses. These are a little heavier, but they cost just a fraction of the Hawaii James version, look just as good, and can actually handle more than just being displayed in the sunglass dealer's display case. They way I go through sunglasses, these hold up much better than the overpriced vanity brands."
5.0,Fun & great for the money
5.0,This is a very nice scarf. Perfect for St. Patty's Day!
5.0,"I‚Äôm a tall woman and therefore, have a thicker neck than most women. Most small necklaces don‚Äôt fit, but these successfully extend them for me. It includes several sizes in both silver and black. Love them!"
5.0,"Well made - sturdy.<br />Purchased this item to replace the flimsy, torn plastic insert that came with my wallet. This seems much better made and I expect it to last much longer."
5.0,It was delivered right on time and looks just as it does in the picture!  Good quality.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for....fits perfectly....extremely comfortable.....just the right weight.
5.0,"Simply fab. Fits great & sexy. So wonderful, I am considering another color. Worth it 100%."
5.0,"I bought this dress for work and I love it. It fit me as I expected it to, and looks great! Good buy."
5.0,This bra is a great everyday bra with a little bit of spice thrown in.  As a woman it can be hard to find everyday bras that are sexy but this one fulfills that in every color.  The fit is great it provided support and full coverage which is no easy job for a woman who is &#34;blessed&#34; in the chest.  This bra is all that and more.
5.0,Once you get used to putting these on and off it becomes very easy to do and you can cut some corners. I couldn't find an easy way to make regular clothes fit - even with cutting them. They may get in the way when getting an x-ray (metal snaps). We did get a larger size to make them even easier to use and a looser fit for comfort.
5.0,Great purchase. It‚Äôs hard to find 100% cotton turtlenecks or mock turtleneck‚Äôs anymore! This Supima Cotton is so soft and comfortable! Very pleased - I bought 3 so far.
5.0,"As a middle eastern hipster it's easy for me to find old 80's American and Japanese technology at the local bazar. I spied this gem for a pittance of a chicken and HAD to have it. It was better then finding a fixie hauling PBR!! (If I were allowed to drink) No sooner had I strapped my retro classic to my wrist and checked the time that a black hood closed over my head. At first I hoped it was irony but I was wrong SO WRONG!<br /><br />I was soon moving in a truck, I could feel sweat beading under the rubber strap of my Casio F91W-1 and knew the timepiece was still attached to my wrist able to tell me how long I'd traveled. Alas I awoke in a haze, as my hands clenched behind me I could not check the time.<br />I couldn't distinguish the pain of the zip tie cuffs from my Casio F91W-1 smooth rubber strap but soon found my new watch dangling before my face as a man screamed ""WHY DO YOU OWN THIS WATCH!?!""  ""To know what time it is I muttered meekly,"" I could see it was 1AM, I was missing Adventure Time being broadcast from the United States. ""CAN YOU TELL ME WHY 32 OTHER TERRORISTS HERE HAVE THIS SAME WATCH!?!""  I searched my brain, 32? That sales man said I had the only one in the country, I wasn't unique anymore? I was going to need a new watch. ""They were all lied to by the salesman as well?"" I answered still thinking I was being persecuted as a hipster yet again *le sigh.  ""A wise guy eh? We have ways of making you talk""<br /><br />I was reluctantly given my watch back, I was told it was so I'd know which way to pray with my Casio F91W-1's compass feature but the man didn't believe that I wasn't religious but that my outfit was indeed chosen for irony. Seriously, robes in a desert, how do you not get that?<br /><br />I soon heard through the grape vine that I've be transferred to Cuba, Knowing little of the world from my antique text books I thought Cuba was still the Monte Carlo of the American corrupt and looked forward to my pleasant tropical extravaganza.<br /><br />What I underwent in Cuba was more horrible then `The Situation' trying to roast a Hummer H2 with Rebecca Black Singing Friday in the Front seat (or back) but despite years of agony and much water exposure my Casio F91W-1 still works keeping the time of my innocence alive."
5.0,"Everything was correct. Size, color, style."
5.0,Pretty bracelet good quality
5.0,"These are, by far, the most comfortable sunglasses I have worn in a long time. I am always breaking mine but these came with a really nice glass case which I truly appreciate."
5.0,I liked the item. It was worth the purchase
5.0,I was so excited when I received my delivery. These shooties are gorgeous and fit perfectly and comfortably.
5.0,I love this top more an more it's very fitted shows off my curves well ü•∞
5.0,"Lovely, swingy, heavy fabric. Wrinkles, though."
5.0,"Great shirt, and is what I would expect from under armour! The only difference that I see with other UA shirts is this one is made out of a stretchy material; however it still fits to my body just constricting. Its a great looking shirt will definitely buy more from UA!"
5.0,great necklace had the last one for over 7 years I replace the rope with a chain
5.0,"It is so hard to find decent sweats for women so I discovered men's sweats recently and puma to be exact. I love these sweats. They are thick, keep me warm and are so soft and comfy. I plan to order more in the future. All my sweats need to be men's puma. Why do guys get the thick soft sweats while Siemens are usually thin and low wasted and either wide bottoms and cropped. I work from home and always work in sweats. I want to be comfy not stylish. I wish someone would start making womens sweats like men's only to fit our waste. Although the only fit issue I have with these are they are a little roomy in the front but that doesn't really effect anything so I'm going to keep buying men's sweats."
5.0,Great product!  Perfect for traveling!
5.0,He loves it and never takes it off. We did put it on a better chain though
5.0,Like it very much. It‚Äôs a recovery gift for a friends tenth birthday.
5.0,"Size 2X was typical American size.  This top is very pretty and flattering to a plus size woman.  Color is brighter pink than shown.  Excellent quality.  Fabric is heavy enough for modesty, but lightweight enough for summer wear; fabric drapes nicely over midriff and waist.  Seams well sewn. Amazing price.  Item smelled like chemicals so I washed it before wearing.  Easily washed, fast dry top is perfect for travel."
5.0,"I was torn about whether or not to purchase this dress because I had never bought clothes on Amazon before but it worked out well! This dress is perfect to dress up or dress down. I used it to go to the horse races in Del Mar but it honestly would be great to wear even for a date night or wedding. The material is a good quality, the length is modest (but not too old school), fit perfectly and is very comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,Most new helmets nowadays use Mesh Technology leaving old Bluetooth communication helmets having to deal with limited connectivity. This gadget fixes these problems. Pair it with your non-mesh helmet and you will be able to communicate with all Mesh helmets.
5.0,I just had to rebuy this as my fitbit accidentally found its way into the washer and the strap broke. Watch is okay. I love this strap and the first one lasted forever! Like a year plus. The only downside to this product is that the black wears off into a copper color and I also ended up tucking the wrist connector ball into the band so it didn't dangle around. Still 5 stars with the wear on it and all. Definitely the most sturdy one I've found yet and I've gone through so many of these for my watch.
5.0,"Very nice for the price! I'm usually a size 6-8 and ordered a large, and they fit perfectly. Not at all tight in the legs and sits at the waist. A great find and perfect for outdoor activities. I'm going to get the black as well."
5.0,"Great product, very lightweight and durable.  Perfect for glasses, sunglasses; the strap is comfortable and keeps your glasses or sunglasses snug, so your hands are free to work or enjoy the outdoors.<br /><br />Kate C - Central Florida"
5.0,"This dress didn‚Äôt disappoint. Beautiful, comfortable. I hemmed it and pressed the bottom for full effect. I received so many compliments. Love it!"
5.0,Very sturdy and held up well.
5.0,Loved the look and style but was too small.  Ended up giving it to my daughter who looked beautiful in it.
5.0,These beauties are even better in person. I had ordered another version of these through amazon that I loved but took for ever to arrive so I thought I'd try these and love them even more. The heel is a perfect size because it gives a slight rise without compromising on comfort. Overall the shoes is made very well! Will def buy again.
5.0,It‚Äôs light weight. It‚Äôs really Sri Klee though. But it‚Äôs super cute. Size up
5.0,It came fast and was really cute! Thank you!
5.0,"The addition of the silver makes the earrings more substantial-looking than having only the stone. Nice green color which, to my surprise, matches my jade necklace.  Nice purchase."
5.0,"Butter soft yet tuff as nails! Five Stars! If they make these in gauntlets for the winter, I will be buying them too!"
5.0,"I am 5.2, 160 lbs. & I purchased the large based on other reviews. It fit perfect! I received so many compliments."
5.0,"I like the material. It's snag and comfortable. It's also very stretchy.<br />Unfortunately because I usually wear size XS & S, the crotch area is not a snag fit & waist isn't as snag for me, but this is because I bought a Medium. There was no S or XS.<br />For my measurements, I would recommend & I'm confident that the S or XS, would be the ""perfect"" fit. I'm 5'3, 108lbs, 26in waist, 34in hips."
5.0,I'm wearing the fingertoe socks and they fit they came as expected i love them. I have large feet women's.
5.0,It fit great but it was a little higher than knee length on me.
5.0,I wanted to wear them around the house. They gave me a pair at the hospital. Works fine
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my sister-in-law and she loved them.
5.0,"This has proven to be a Godsend. I had no idea how much I would wear it.  On days when I do a lot of housework,  go to the gym, or working at a hospital, it is the perfect substitute for my diamond ring. I don't need to worry about ruining the diamond or damaging the ring. Also, don't need to worry about the silicone ring getting clogged up with lotion or soap residue."
5.0,My husbands favorite shirt
5.0,Looks very real fits good and is cute! Recommend it for anyone!
5.0,High quality shirt.

5.0,"Great canvas quality. Good, strong zipper too."
5.0,Very nice hat with a great fit. I have had a few complements on it. A good buy.
5.0,I ordered this item for my thirteen year old son for a catered event. I was worried it would look more for a costume party. He looked absolutely amazing and received many compliments. He wore it with a bow tie and a white shirt with slacks to give it a formal look.
5.0,It IS magic!!  :-D  Absolutely LOVE it!!  Feel very comfortable in it! Beautiful material and color is even better than anticipated.. and it truly looks as tho I lost 10 lbs. upon trying it on! A win/win!!

5.0,It shows really well in the dark.  The cars can't miss you.
5.0,These shirts are so soft and comfy. Love them. So far I have ordered 4 in different color and designs. I wear medium and got a medium and it fits perfectly.they don't show your bra and are super comfy. I hand washed them and laid out to dry. Didn't want to chance the graphic peeling like a previous review.
5.0,It was beautiful. Nice quality for the price.
5.0,Very protective and fit hat
5.0,"Watch arrived promptly and as described.  There was one small scratch on the case back, but that was from the manufacturer.  There are tons of reviews about this particular watch (J1) as well as the K1 version online.  I'm very pleased with the quality at this price point.  I'll be adding a StrapCode super oyster band to complete the watch to my liking.  I'll probably wind up getting another."
5.0,I was going to return these because I didn't think I was cool enough to pull them off but then I decided I was. Keeping them and rocking the hell out of them.
5.0,"I love this dress! I will actually be buying more dresses from Miusol because of the great quality, adorable style and flattering fit at such an excellent price.<br /><br />Edit 4/2/16: I ordered a size X-Large, although the review says Medium."
5.0,I really like this. It‚Äôs pretty light weight and really good quality. It stays pretty well and pretty light weight.
5.0,Beautiful dress and highly recommend
5.0,"After buying a few others, this one was my choice.  Made well.<br /><br />It saves you from losing your mask.  Sometimes my mask falls off.  Once it hits the ground, in the trash it goes.<br /><br />It‚Äôs convenient to have especially when running errands or eating out.  Your mask is always with you when you need it."
5.0,I love my jacket!!!
5.0,"MADE IN USA!!!! Please order one size larger than you are.  I ordered several and I now have to return them.  I AM ordering the next size up as soon as I get through writing this review.  They are beautiful especially the black and the grey textured vests.  I WAS NOT disappointed with the quality.  I just need a size larger. I love these, in fact I will end up ordering 8."
5.0,"Haven't used them yet, but like them so far."
5.0,"My weight is 87 kg and my height is 1.85 meter and my size is L or XL. My size is L or XL depending on  sleeves length. Body fit is L, but depending on the length of sleeves XL must be sometimes, staying fit a little loose. I bought a size M and the fit is correct to use over a thin t-shirt .The length of sleeves is right for a tall person. Fabric is very good for the cold . I recommend buying a size M to use on a t-shirt thin to have a perfect fit, and L for use over thicker clothing for loose fit."
5.0,Just what I wanted!!!  These charms bring style to my Croc
5.0,Korea-Jiaen sell some really expensive looking earrings for a very inexpensive cost. These are so nice and delicate. Looks like a paid $100's for them. Fabulous!

5.0,"Excellent attractive and durable sun hat. Cool in the heat. When I packed mine for a trip, I did not protect the lower part of the brim and part rubbed off. Like the hat so much that I promptly ordered another. I will pack this one more carefully!"
5.0,"These shorts are fabulous.<br />They wash well, they feel comfortable, they are pretty breathable (when I was sweating in them I didn‚Äôt feel all nasty).<br />The fit is great - true to size. The pockets fit my iPhone nicely. Good size pockets.<br />Overall really really happy with them."

5.0,Awesome purchase that I recommend 2 all women!!!
5.0,I enjoy the look and quality of this coverup
5.0,I owed another pair of gloves like this and recently left them in the back of a cab! I had them for a number of years. I was crushed. I bought these because of the same zipper styling and these are even better than the ones I had. Super soft leather exterior and comfy soft interior the zipper a makes ease of putting them on. I get so many compliments and the zipper. So chic. So practical. Superior leather softness.<br /><br />I want to challenge someone to a duel. I hope the make these for my whole life so that I can always have them.  The best.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted to redo a boys bathroom. Not childish, not fancy. Just perfect."
5.0,"I bought these for myself .. I had seen them on someone else and commented how cute they were. I started looking for them locally and when that failed I checked amazon and found these.<br /><br />they are cute, fun , comfortable and not to heavy!  Perfect accessory on a blue jeans and T-shirt kind of day!!! Price was good too!! worth every penny!!!<br /><br />Update~<br />  The Backs that came on these earrings wouldn't stay put and kept falling off..They were too loose.<br />I lost one of the earrings not long after I got them. Now I have to buy a replacement pair of earrings. Kind of bummed about that. probably going to buy some different backs too!"

5.0,Fit like a glove. The color is just as vibrant as seen on the computer screen. You can't go wrong with this dress!
5.0,"These delicate earrings have a cute style that can be worn with a variety of outfits. The black bow with inset pearl is a nice touch above the dangling heart charm. They are small, but large enough to be seen and make an impression. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear."
5.0,Love this lightweight shirt!
5.0,Supporting my team.

5.0,"Love the beads!  A little larger size than I was expecting but it is entirely my fault for not checking the size prior to ordering.  Beautiful, sturdy, and perfect.  Not sandlewood or scented but great!!"
5.0,Pretty nice socks
5.0,These socks are so comfortable! The stay up well and give good support - easy to put on with boots.
5.0,"My granddaughter wore them to school and all her friends love the shoes, they look really beautiful. so I ordered another one in gold.."
5.0,My husband loves this! Warm and not itchy!
5.0,"Order size 8.5 and fits like a 8.5. Seem to be well made. They have a soft footbed and very cute. I've only tried them on, so i can't speak to how they will hold up. The straps across heal are elastic and covered in fabric. There is no buckle, but the elastic gives room for lots of adjustments. The color beads are awesome. They will go with summer dresses, jeans and skirts well. They come well packaged in their own shoe box."
5.0,Amazing! It's beautiful and looks just like the picture! We got it for a sweet 16 and were worried that it wouldn't get here in time. We emailed the sellers and they told us they would send it a hit quicker. They were very cooperative and are just AMAZING people. It's a bit big around the bust but that's only because the sweet 16 girl is really small (she's a size 0) and it's not too big it doesn't fall off or anything. Highly recommended.
5.0,Love it and shipped fast
5.0,I loved giving my husband this
5.0,bought it for my wife birthday and she loves it. It is very versatile so she can mix and match and look and feel sexy

5.0,It was exactly what I wanted. It was a little tighter than I expected but I was still able to wear it with no problem.
5.0,Fits great. I loved it!
5.0,"Since my drastic weight loss a few years ago, I became the guy who's always cold, especially in my hands and feet.  I bought a heated vest, a couple of different pairs of heated gloves (look for my reviews on all) and now my focus is on keeping my feet from freezing as we head into the colder months.<br /><br />When I saw the as for these socks, it had the word ""heated"" in it, so I assumed these might be warmed by battery power.  My mistake; they're simply thermal socks.  A bit disappointed, I put them on and headed out the door.<br /><br />All day long, thus far, my feet have been toasty!  Still being above freezing, they're almost uncomfortably warm.  A good thing - a hint that winter will be much more bearable.  On a side note, I like just a bit of compression on my legs so that I can stave off some of the problems that my peers are now facing as age takes its toll.  These deliver the perfect amount!  They're not diabetic socks, by any means, but much better than, say, a tight pair of leggings/meggings.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is that these work very well and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these socks.  As for the ad..."
5.0,Great bag that does what you'd expect. I've purchased two of these and both have held up under moderate use. They are great bags for a short trip. I would not recommend this bag if you are going to be carrying it for a long time.
5.0,Perfect crossbody for the phone and my accessories
5.0,Its Awesome
5.0,plenty of comps on bags.

I am an adventure guide for work to the watch has been in countless lakes and the ocean, and held up great. The only reason I replaced it because the strap broke both times, but still got a lot of use outta each one. You can‚Äôt turn off the alarm, but honestly THIS IS THE PERFECT WATCH FOR BIRTH CONTROL REMINDERS. you have to set the alarm to a certain time and it will go off once a day no matter what. Get this watch. It‚Äôs great."

5.0,Just recently received this.  Tried it on for fit and I love it!  I typically wear a size 6 or 4 in pants and it fit great and has room to adjust if too big.  Seems to be well made for what it is and by appearances it is very pretty and sexy.  This is the first body jewelry like this that I have bought and based on this I will probably buy a few more.
5.0,Love this sweater so much. It fits perfectly and looks great
5.0,Love the bag. It came quickly. Love the color.
5.0,Lightweight with excellent water protection. Well made too! Great fit.
5.0,Adorable and very good quallity.  I love Soufeel jewelry...very good customer service too!
5.0,Very cute and not too shot even at 5‚Äô11. I had to return mine because it really isn‚Äôt meant for large busts. I have 34D cup and it really looked trashy up top. That is not the fault of the dress. Just don‚Äôt recommend for large cups.
5.0,These gloves are very comfortable and warm. I bought these for winter shooting. The fingers are thick but are comfortable in the rifles trigger guard. I actually had to take them off a few times during the day because of how warm they were making my hands. Great buy! I didn‚Äôt get a chance to try the touch screen finger tips so cannot comment on that but fit and function are perfect.
5.0,Great quality and very good material
5.0,Loved this dress and got a lot of compliments. I'm large chested so this was a bit showy but in a classy way. The bottom is beautiful and it was very comfortable. Would recommend highly.
5.0,Earrings are very cute. Wish the detail was a little more clear. You have to really get close to tell what they are but they're cute just the same.
5.0,"Second time I bought this same sandal, great and comfortable for my daughter! Well made as well. I recommend Skechers anytime!"
5.0,Looked super badass for my masquerade party. I was looking like the black hornet from the old days of Bruce Lee.
5.0,I love them! Awesome!
5.0,Dress is perfect for a summer wedding!
5.0,Well crafted beautiful pink color. Just right size for necessities. Sleek. Many complications every time I carry it. Love it!
5.0,this is THE SOFTEST hat I have ever had.  10/10 highly recommend.
5.0,"I followed the previous reviews that we should order a size down from what you wear because it ran bigger, i did this and it was a keeper! love it. i bought a medium and i am 193 lbs, 5ft 9in and it fit great..."
5.0,"Whereas I used to need about 4 bags to lug around my beach stuff, I only need 1 now. The obvious drawback: it gets heavy and now I need to shop around for a mini forklift."
5.0,"I love this bright yellow. I am a person who lives bright vivid colors so seeing this dress be true to color was good. Then the fit was good it is thick tshirt material (usually, this type of dress furs snug and shows off every bulge). This dress is cute to wear alone or with a jacket.  I think this will be what I will wear to start my trip off with.  I ordered a XL I am 5'4 206 lbs. I could've got away with a L, but this allows for comfort and washing should there be any shrinkage. I will order again in another color."
5.0,Great shirt. Arrived when it was said to arrive. Brisco brands are great. Will order again.
5.0,My wife loves this set!
5.0,Just a little roll play.
5.0,Is tight
5.0,"Si buscas que sea una prenda ajustada, no es para ti. Es extra oversized, queda m√°s como outwear."
5.0,It's a very comfortable shirt. I love this shirt so much!
5.0,Turquoise and as discribed<br />Love it!!!!
5.0,Durable small reliable
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and weigh around 125. I ordered a small, and it fit perfectly. I was worried that it was going to be a little long, but with heels, it‚Äôs absolutely adorable."
5.0,Great quality‚Äô
5.0,"Great fit with room to grow. Although the color does fade out quickly, I think they're a very good buy for learning how to walk.  I was impressed with the softness of the leather. My grandson was able to feel the floor & walk without falling as opposed to the other shoes I had recently bought him which caused him to fall every other step due to the thickness of the sole. I will definitely buy again. As a matter of fact, I'm ordering another pair right now in the next size & a different color."
5.0,Just what I needed for packing for a 4 week trip living out of my suitcase
5.0,I just can‚Äôt find them like I used to these are the very best accurate and light weight. I want more colors and options available again. Please.
5.0,Bought these for my nieces birthday and she is obsessed!!
5.0,Very slimming and comfortable.
5.0,I have several pairs of pince-nez glasses and these are easiest to use because they don't fall off. I like them so much I bought 3 more pairs.
5.0,"Es lo que se ofrece, gracias"
5.0,Fast ship and super cute. Cant wait to wear them. Only disappointment was they did not come with the orginal sorel box
5.0,My partner says it feels like sticking his foot into a vagina. I guess that means they're super cozy and comfortable. He loves them.
5.0,My grandson ‚ù§ it
5.0,"Great long cardigan. Exactly like the picture shown. Love the quality of the fabric, and the way it drapes when worn. I've received alot of compliments on it. Took a chance ordering this since I'm not a fan of ordering clothes online, but I couldn't be happier that I did. Will definitely be looking into other pieces made by BytheR."
5.0,"Great deal.  Looks good, great fit"
5.0,Super comfy... just as good as UA at 1/4 of the price. Will be buying another pack for sure!
5.0,My wife and I host themed Christmas parties every year and this costume was inexpensive and came with dress and Cape. She was pleased with the costume. Remember to order a larger size. My wife wears 1X but I ordered a 3X and it fit perfectly.
5.0,My socks are really comfortable. They have extra cushioning on the soles and heels. The toes do not have the seam running along the very tips. The cuffs stretch enough to fit and yet are tight enough to stay up.<br /><br />The thickness is enough to wick away extra moisture for hikers or runners. The socks launder well.
5.0,Kids love them and they fit them good!!
5.0,Well built to last. Great product for the price. Ordered from them before and have been very satisfied!
5.0,I love these earrings! They are so lightweight I forgot I was wearing them. Not heavy and pulling on the earlobe. Color is magical with similar shades and pastels.
5.0,"These are so sweet! My little one loves playing with them. They're soft, and the perfect balance of brilliant color and translucency... A great addition to our play time fun."
5.0,perfect! just what my son needs for football!

5.0,Elegant dress! I got tons of comments on how good it looked.
5.0,Like them for all the colors I bought.

5.0,My wife loves cats and these were the whimsical touch she wanted for our anniversary.
5.0,"Coat is very nice. However, the buckle to the belt fell apart when i washed it"
5.0,Was bigger than expected. Perfect for beach use!
5.0,"Excellent product, the clamps are strong but do not damage my shirts or socks and the material they are made of do not irritate my often sensitive skin which is a huge bonus for me."
5.0,Great product. Very good at being water resistant. I‚Äôve had it for about two months and it still works very great it‚Äôs perfect for my work environment.
5.0,I'm very satisfied with this seller and item! Perfect fit for my shower and gorgeous colors!
5.0,"Love love love, this hat. It fit my big ole' head (wear a 7 1/8 size in hats) and I wear it mostly every day to work on cold days and bad hair days."
5.0,"This is a good boot that you can wear with jeans or even casual business if you tend to leave your office for a hike somewhere that might be a little muddy or scuff up your shoes.  They do not look like traditional cowboy boots, and you really cannot tell whether someone is waring shoes, hiking boots or motorcycle boots when you're pant legs are covering the top of them.  They are comfortable, useful and look good according to my wife."
5.0,nice weight for early Fall. Sexy shoulder!
5.0,"So wow this item it fabulous, its gorgeous. My teen daughter is going to cry when she sees it. Solid quality and worth the buy"
5.0,Love them I wish I could have a bigger selection of style  and color
5.0,"Definitely prefer their yoga pants version of the waistband, but still, okay. The silky smooth fabric more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Very flattering, very comfy. Waistband is meh. Still good buy."
5.0,"This is a pretty, quilted-look, ladies' zippered leather wallet, measuring approximately 7 5/8 long X 4 high X 1 inch deep. A full zipper covers top and both sides.  Inside, you will find slots for 8 credit cards, 4 on each side, plus 2 long slots, one per side, for cash or concert tickets. Three more long divided sections inside and a long, zippered change pocket for organized storage.<br /><br />Gold zipper and gold Protectif in gold letters against the black quilt add an attractive appearance. The RFID protection is an added plus to an already attractive wallet.<br /><br />Comes in a sturdy black box of heavy cardboard, ready for gift giving."
5.0,"Great deal!  They don't offer a lot of support, but neither do the Air Jordan's I bought him, so I assume kids this age don't need much support.  They aren't super durable (one of the loops came off, and we started to see signs of wear within a week), but they are my son's favorite."
5.0,Super light. Very easy to use
5.0,My daughter loves it very pretty
5.0,Love the Darth Vadar shirt. Worked great for a school costume.
5.0,Love them .
5.0,Great neck-piece.  Very flattering.
5.0,"These glasses are very stylish. I've received many many compliments on them. The look much more expensive than they are. They are good quality and are also functional. The glasses give a greenish tint which makes them suitable to wear in bright sunlight. The sides of the glasses look wooden and are very comfortable around the ear, you can easy wear these glasses all day."
5.0,I bought these before a trip to the beach. They are really cute and fit great. These shorts are comfort and can be casual or dressed up with a nice top.
5.0,I bought this for my teenage son as a wedding party gift and it was beautiful. It was light weight and the removable links were great.
5.0,I don‚Äôt know why people<br />Left bad review. It looks exactly like the photos and is soft and comply. Cute with tight tank top and skinny jeans.
5.0,"I received this dress today and I wore it today! As we are aware, Linen calls for a lot of ironing but it was worth it. üçä is one of my favorite colors. I received so many compliments! I felt glamorousüëç. I just ordered two more in different colors. Sorry for me because I was tricked when I ordered three more dresses, this time sleeveless, I was sent all three dresses in size 4XL! PLEASE before you just hang your dresses in your closet, MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THE SIZE YOU ORDERED! Don't forget to do this!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful watch, I loved it at the first glance! I highly recommend this watch to anyone. Quality made, well packed  and beautiful box."
5.0,He loves it!! Had one before and tried many others but this is the only kind we will buy now
5.0,Got this watch for my mother and she wears it everyday.
5.0,good quality as advertised
5.0,Bought this dress for my daughter‚Äôs purple themed birthday and got so many compliments!!!! It‚Äôs very flattering to the figure and very comfortable!!!
5.0,"LOVE this dress! I bought it last minute for a wedding and it was perfect. So soft and comfortable to wear for a long period. It's a regular maxi with pockets, but the ruffles on the sleeves make it seem way fancier than it is. So cute!<br /><br />I'm 5'4 and 150lbs and it fit perfectly! So flattering and doesn't highlight a tummy. It was slightly long, it grazed the top of my feet, but was enough that I didn't need to hem it. I just held it up as needed and it worked great.<br /><br />I love this dress so much and can't wait to wear this other places!!"
5.0,It is really nice. I loved it. It fits perfectly. It emphasizes my waist and hips. It looks so sexy but decent and elegant at the same time. The design is simple but unique.  I can even wear it in a job interview. Thumbs up.üëç
5.0,Used for a vbs dance worked great.
5.0,The colors in the picture is more Crimson and the actual product the colors are more vibrant. It's still very pretty but not my style.  I returned it and received excellent customer service.
5.0,"Fit well, looks great and well made. Very happy with it."
5.0,"These are great.  I use them free diving and snorkeling on our reef.  They are cut and stab resistant and provide a great deal of protection to the hands from lacerations on sharp coral, or from razor sharp oysters, as well as other sea dangers.  Great price for the pair.  I use the metal mesh gloves only, without the inner cotton gloves.  So, I bought a smaller size large which fits perfect.  Thank you."
5.0,my husband really likes this pin. he put it on his leather vest.
5.0,Groovy and elegant‚Äã<br />Beautiful Amethyst. Wraps 4 times around my wrist. Worn every day for a couple weeks so far and it still looks beautiful. I am going to cleanse and recharge the crystals one of these nights. (I do take it off at night) ‚òÖpeace
5.0,Great loved detail in print
5.0,Muy bonito tal y como la foto un poco largo
5.0,Love my case.
5.0,"This set of two necklaces is absolutely gorgeous! Generally, gold is not my favorite color, and I normally prefer silver or even black gold, but this is a pleasant surprise! The chains are delicate and shimmery, without kinks and twists. The CZ diamond pendent glistens under the light, and has a very expensive look. The gold bar is slim and hangs beautifully from the necklace, and the position of the hanging is adjustable from the necklace itself. Again, they're absolutely gorgeous. They will go well with both formal and casual fashion. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Wear them every day, wash them regularly but don't put on dryer. Good quality excelente price."
5.0,80s style that i was looking for<br />its heavy and made really good.
5.0,I'm allergic to pretty much every other metal like material so I love these titanium tongue rings. They arrived quickly even though I ordered them around the holidays and was expecting them to be a little late I was pleasantly surprised when they came right on time. They work as they should and they don't make my tongue swell. I'm sure I'll be buying some more very soon.
5.0,I absolutely love this! I'm 5`5 and a 145 lbs. This fits like a dream and is so flattering. It hugs all my curves and shows off my waist and peach!! I even wear the top to yoga. Needless to says it's durable and beautiful.
5.0,excellent cleaner
5.0,Very good value and fast shipping
5.0,"The overall of the necklace is very petite and dainty like. It's small but so elegant looking. With the hearts being on the ends of the infinity symbol, I think, it brings an added touch to it. The chain is actually attached to the charm so changing out the chain for a bigger one or if this one broke, would not be an easy task. You would need jewelry supplies to do that. From the bottom left corner up to the top right corner, on a diagonal, it is lines with CZs that bring just an extra something to the necklace. I like how it sits on my chest - it does lay flat. You can wear this dressed up or dress down and this would still &quot;fit the outfit&quot;. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received."
5.0,We do paranormal investigations and felt we needed extra protection. St. Benedict should take care of demons for us.
5.0,This coin purse was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a divider in it so that I can separate the pennies!
5.0,"Fits as expected, arrived quickly, colors are true, and suit itself isn‚Äôt see through. It‚Äôs somewhat supportive, flattering, and received many compliments."
5.0,These were a stocking stuffer for my Maryland born hubby! He loved them! They are great quality socks! Hubby wears a size 12 and they fit great!
5.0,Such a cute and good quality dress. My daughter loves it!
5.0,They are made of a nice thick glass. My son had knocked it off the table and I panicked thinking of the mess it would make. To my great joy it didn‚Äôt even crack!
5.0,"I love these glasses.  Theyvare exactly as pictured. These are not readers, just glasses with dummy lenses. Not heavy enough to convert to real glasses, but still fun to wear."
5.0,"These are wonderful workout shorts: comfortable, not see-through, just tight enough, a great length, a higher waist that stays up, very cool patterns, and POCKETS! I'm 5'6, 167, and wear a medium. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I have never really liked PINK in my wardrobe OR jewelry, until I saw this set!  It is  BUTTERFLY NECKLACE with earrings!  I will be wearing it with some of my summer clothes which have a lower neckline.  It was well packaged and arrived well prior to its expected delivery date!  I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
5.0,"Use these for my daughter's graduation... Had people write down their ""keys to success""... Very sturdy, cute keys"
5.0,Nice looking belt true to size

5.0,These socks are so striking in their colors and they are also warm!
5.0,It's beautiful. I was very impressed.
5.0,I like how this comes with a box (Tiffany color box). Inside it comes with a zip lock and dust cloth to wipe or wrap the jewelry. Great gift and price.
5.0,Great fit and firm compression. Love my new socks!
5.0,"The dress is cut very well and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of fabric. I wore this dress to a wedding and received lots of compliments. It does run small, so size up! Glad I read the other ladies' helpful reviews on sizing prior to purchasing."
5.0,Just perfect no complaints
5.0,Love it.  I use it every day to take gym clothes to and from the gym at lunch.  Best part is my clothes are all sweaty but dont stink as much because of the mash.
5.0,Love love love the company they were great
5.0,Laces fit perfectly! The color and quality was great! Now I can send my kindergartener to school and not worry about her laces coming undone. Thank you! Will be buying more!
5.0,"LOVE these L-O-N-G earrings! I have long dark hair, and they still show through and sparkle. They're so lightweight, I forget I'm wearing them."
5.0,"I was a bit leery about picking up a belt online without trying it on, but this was a perfect fit and really comfortable. Very high quality and durable product for the price. The little brown drawstring bag they come in was a nice touch."
5.0,"Nice thick material, but still breathable. True to size. Colors did not bleed in the wash."
5.0,love it! great quality
5.0,Arrived when and as expected. Love it! Would recommend.
5.0,Exactly as it‚Äôs described.
5.0,"Purchased for postpartum purposes ‚Äî healing, feeding baby, my comfort, etc. it checked all the boxes and was by far a better price than all gowns marketed as ‚Äúpostpartum‚Äù or ‚Äúbreastfeeding.‚Äù Already have 2 and will likely buy more. So soft, great length, love that it has pockets. It‚Äôs not a sexy look, but that definitely wasn‚Äôt my priority haha"
5.0,It was perfect for our Teddy Roosevelt costume.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous. It looks just like it does in the picture.  I am wearing this dress to perform in with some silver and black ankle boots and it is hot!  The material is great, but see through so you might want to wear a slip (do people still wear those? lol)."
5.0,Bought these for a Nerf gun birthday party. All the kids love them. Need a great gift for all the guests to take home.
5.0,Very nice sunglasses......vision is sharp and clear unlike my dollar store pairs!  would definitely buy again
5.0,"Very pretty. Small, but well made. Just what I was looking for."
5.0,"love this fits perfect and is very comfortable, i can wear it for long periods of time."
5.0,"I gave one of these to my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. She wore it first thing, and all her friends loved it too. She liked that the one big wheel turns a bit. It is fairly large and has a nice long chain, so it is a great accent item. I had asked a few questions before I bought it, and the company responded quickly and their answers were accurate. My daughter loves owls, and this one has that modern day techy steam punk feel to it. Very happy with the quality of this purchase."
5.0,Gloves fit nicely and they kept my hands from freezing while playing in the snow with my kids.
5.0,I love this item.  It is made well and looks good.  Has held up well so far.
5.0,"Three pair of black hose - they do fit well and I like them, but just as a wish, it would have been nice to have at least one pair be nude instead of black, but that's just a wish of mine.  These are nice, sheer black hose that fit my big size 4x body and that's the important part!  Even us big girls like to get dressed up for a night on the town once in a while!"
5.0,"I am a 19-year-old who is currently a bachelor and bought this hat so I could impress a girl but realized a propeller hat is a second date idea. Either way, it's attracted a lot of positive of attention and makes people smile.<br /><br />Propeller blows very well in the wind."
5.0,Bell√≠simos y muy finos
5.0,was better then in the picture it was just what i was looking for if anyone is looking for a good key fob this is it
5.0,"I purchased a medium and it fits great. I have 42 inch hips and a 29 inch waist. It doesn't come all the way up on to my waist though, it hits below the belly button."
5.0,I got it and it fits well.
5.0,Love these. Bought a pair for me and loved them so much I bought a pair for my grand daughter. Fit is exactly as expected.
5.0,Perfect for costume for halloween
5.0,Super cute and lightweight - these are my favorite pair of shades this summer. Love that the colors match with all outfits and the frames fit perfectly. Can wear for hours on end and they don‚Äôt fit tight or start to loosen up like other brands.
5.0,Fits as expected‚Äîjust right!  Soft & cozy cover up!  I got the purple & my hubby got the royal blue.  And if you don‚Äôt want to put it over your head you can use it as a huge blanket!!!  Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"Perfect summer dress. Cute, not see through, light weight."

5.0,Best deal in clamps. . these are so much better than metal clamps. I love the ease with which you can use these clamps. No more metal clamps for me ever. They are constructed from a sturdy plastic and of very high quality. Dont buy metal clamps anymore.
5.0,"This is a fabulous Bracelet very So, West."
5.0,I am so thrilled with this dress! I was so nervous ordering online with how it would fit but it's perfect! I wanted something elegant but not too crazy for my husband's marine corps ball and I believe this will be perfect! I am 5'4 and 138 lbs and I got a size medium! A small would've definitely been a little too clingy to certain areas. This still fits tighter fitting but is very stretchy!! I am so excited I got this for only $50!!
5.0,Slides right onto the arm protecting thin forearm skin perfectly. A big help while doing yard work.
5.0,I'm so glad I got the red one. It's so beautiful. This is a great alternative for a designer purse. I'll later get the green one too

5.0,"It tells time, has the right amount of style, and boasts tenacious durability."
5.0,Great fit and super comfy.

5.0,Cute and comfy! Love the length...
5.0,Perfect match for my mini speedy!!
5.0,These keychains are great easy to store and not bulky for your pocket.
5.0,I purchased the Vampirina shirts for my niece.  They are well made and adorable!
5.0,Great for the summer. Some reviews say it is loud....it is not.  Have had many compliments
5.0,"Fits perfectly! Easy to walk in. Comfortable enough to wear for a couple hours. Material squeaks a bit when I walk, but I'm hoping that's just because they're new and will go away with some wear. No grip on the bottom, but some grip tape can fix that. Overall very pleased."
5.0,Fits secure!
5.0,"Great purse!  It was delivered very well packaged.  The color of the leather is beautiful and the inside lining seems well made.  The purse is a bit larger that I was expecting, but that has turned out to be nice.  It fits all my stuff and still feels lightweight when I carry it.  The only negative is that the inside pocket for the cell phone is not deep enough for my Samsung 7.  But, other than that, I am extremely happy with this bag."
5.0,"Love these socks. They stay up, no saggy ankles, wash great. I would wish for more colors: blues and browns. Bought them originally at Costco and was happy to see them at Amazon since Costco no longer carries them."

5.0,My son loves them fit great
5.0,High quality belt. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy.
5.0,Lo compr√© para mi sobrino. Le encant√≥.
5.0,Excellent quality. Doesn‚Äôt shrink in the wash and comfortable as hell.
5.0,Everyday wear for my fitbit
5.0,This is the perfect hat for when I do my gardening spending a few hours at a time outdoors. It's a hat that can keep your head cool from the rays of the sun. It also has moisture wicking keeping me dryer than an ordinary baseball cap. The size I ordered fits me perfectly. I love the idea that I can just crush it up and slip it into my back pocket. When I pull it out its forms to its original shape. The hat also has a hidden mesh panel inside which helps to keep you cooler and the air circulating.<br /><br />This is a very versatile hat at a very reasonable price. Would make a great gift for the gardener in your life.
5.0,love the look of this bag! it has held up well thus far
5.0,It's soft inside and it fits just right. Whatever size you normally wear I would buy it for the hoodie cause I think it fits just right. I ordered a small and it's perfect! It isn't too small and the right kind of baggy. The hoodie also got delivered to me a week early so that was a plus!
5.0,Bought this hat for my stepdad's Charlie Chaplin costume.  I was a little worried it would be too small - his head is on the large side - but it was perfect!  Received it within 3 days of purchase and I'm very happy with it.
5.0,Me agrad√≥ su comodidad y el calce perfecto. El precio bien.
5.0,"This dress seems to favor pear shape ladies.  I have an apple shape and ordered extra large  and the top fit is snug.  I kept the dress because the material is a good weight, pockets, comfortable and drape is nice.  I usually take a large in most dresses so extra large is not a big leap for myself.  I am a short person and the dress is  at a good length as I prefer longer dresses.  I plan to be careful with washing dress as the linen material (not scratchy) may shrink with carelessness.  Dress can be accesserised in many ways (vests, sweaters, belts)."
5.0,Super Cute. Cleaned up great also
5.0,"These are wonderful leggings with that &#34;buttery soft&#34; feeling. I have bought a few pairs of the prints and now a solid color, and they have been great. I wash them inside out on gentle and let them air dry, like my pricier ones, and they come out great. I haven't had any issues with holes or rips or tears. Just as good as the big popular brand we all know and love!"
5.0,so soft and comfy. i could fall asleep wearing this!<br />the colors look so great in person!
5.0,Better than I expected! Plan on getting more
5.0,Loved this piece for an interview I got a large I'm 5'7 weight unknown lol not not much shape I have a bit of a tummy but in this dress I felt comfortable and a bit like a goddess with some curves ... definitely will be purchasing more .
5.0,"Excellent quality, thick, well stitched and nicely lined with Thinsulate material. The best wool gloves I've found at any price, they wash well in cold water (lingerie bag) in the washing machine. Fits both regular and large hands comfortably."

5.0,These stay in place as designed! Great for my Zumba class
5.0,divino
5.0,"I‚Äôd recommend purchasing a size up. Not sure if it‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs cut or just sizing but my normal size is snug. It‚Äôs also not made from cottony t-shirt material, it‚Äôs more ‚Äúsilky‚Äù. Kind of like a golf or sports shirt."
5.0,Love the colors and the weave quality. Pinned it from both sides to my dark brown hat. Wore it with my Frida Kahlo shirt. Everyone loved it.

5.0,use this beautiful chain to put  a heart of the ocean charms on for my niece as  a gift and token of our cruise

5.0,Perfect and silky. Love the feeling of them

5.0,"Unlike most of those buying this, I don't use it for lizards or other herps.  I teach a calligraphy and penmanship class, and we use this as a very fine ink-absorption tool to blot up excess ink.  Works very well, very old-school, and environmentally friendly."
5.0,Beautiful product but I ordered two and the other one was not the correct stone.  Very disappointing and never rectified.
5.0,It fit my husband great!! He wore them to a Halloween party as LMAFO and he said they were so comfortable!!

5.0,"I normally wear 3X's, but suspected I may wear a turtleneck underneath and wanted the extra space.  Went 5X, if we're being honest, 4X should of done it, but it's ok if it's a little extra big, just means I can eat more.  Like a lot more."
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE these heels! I wore them to work and kept them on all day. They are high, but comfortable. If you're used to wearing heels you won't have any issues. I got so many compliments on them. Love the vibrant colors. Great buy."
5.0,"Gift, I wish it was orange for MS."
5.0,It was a good prop.
5.0,This is a great little slip. Fits perfect. Material is thin and stretchy but not too thin or clingy. I'll probably buy the black next.
5.0,These acrylic keychains are very solid and durable. They are thick acrylic that is strong and doesn't break. They represent some of today's most famous characters. BTS and Stray Kids are all the rave right now in young adults do these are perfect for my nieces. They needed a keychain for their house keys and these seemed like the best choice. Great value for the money.
5.0,They're wonderful. I've been wearing one in my lip now for a few months and it's held up through all of my nervous biting without any damages. Plus I haven't had any issues with the balls unscrewing. Would definitely purchase again.
5.0,Good looking jacket and nicely made. It is lightweight and good for spring or fall.
5.0,"As I have aged I no longer need larg bags.  This one comfortably carries the escentials, but no more.  I like it very much."
5.0,I have been using these for about 1 month and so far they are fine.  I like small earrings and these are small.  So far I am happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Super cute! Exactly as pictured, it fits well. I am glad I sized up it is perfectly oversized and it would fit if I got normal size as well. Very comfortable as well"
5.0,Wife wears this out in town and it fits well but does cling. Compliments her figure nicely. Suitable for night out or work. Pasties also help.
5.0,My wife lost her all black Skagen and they no longer offer the same model.  This was the closet we could find to that.  Not as small or thin but she is quite happy with it.
5.0,Love these pants! Fitted exactly as I wanted. Great material. I actually order 4 pairs in different colors!
5.0,Very nice case.  Soft yet durable.  Clean look and protection at the same time
5.0,"I ordered this to wear blue for Autism Awareness Month at my school. The color is true to picture, great quality material (not see through at all, pretty important when you're the teacher). It is very pretty in person! It's also pretty long, which is what I was lookkkng for. I'm 5'7&#34; and the front hits right at the knees whiile the sides go up a little. I plan to wear it with a kimono/ wrap since it's sleeveless and that'll help cover the sides up a bit (it's not that short but I just want to cautious). Really cute! Planning to get other colors!"
5.0,Great for the price but the fabric is thin.
5.0,"I love these little pj‚Äôs. They are very soft and comfortable. I love ordering from them, they always arrive fast, and seems like everything I buy fits perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 100lbs, I ordered x-sm. They looked really small until I tried them on, perfect!  thank you shein I love your clothes!"
5.0,Like the adjustable ear loop and I can add filter

5.0,"I love these readers.  I wasn't sure how I would like them when I ordered them, and they are unusual, but I love the fact that they do not block my distance vision, and the reader portion is just in the right place. And I really love the look!  I've always liked something a little different, and these are!  I may order a second pair.  I ordered the Stella style, which I will also order when I get a second pair."
5.0,Just what I thought and ordered! Loved it!
5.0,"I really enjoy wearing this beautiful Yin Yang shell necklace and always get compliments. It is pretty big, probably a little bigger than a silver dollar, but it hangs nicely on the wire cord it's on. The different color shells are molded together nicely with no visible seam that can be seen or felt. It is a good deal for the price, and I recommend it."
5.0,Me encant√≥ el material la confecci√≥n .todo
5.0,I wear this to bed. And to events. No frills. Pure comfortable cashmere.
5.0,Very nice skirt. My boyfriend loved it on me!
5.0,These yoga pants fit well and I have had them for about a year now.  I love the fact that they have pockets so that I can carry my phone with me when go walking and running my errands. I have washed them  several times and they have held up very well. There has been no change in the fit and no change to the color of the yoga pants.  I would definitely buy them again.
5.0,"I wanted something that would be easy for me to carry with 3 children in tow. We are almost past the diaper bag stage, but not quite to the mommy can carry a fancy purse stage. This holds what I need along with an outfit and pull up for my youngest that is potty training. It also is a comfortable cross body that sits nicely and is easily adjusted."
5.0,"Love this dress, love the color, Very flattering. Since this dress is a wrap around dress it hides my mid section pretty well. I am 140lbs 5'2; I ordered a size  a medium, the dress fits slightly above my knees.<br /><br />Updated: Loved the green dress so much I had to order in another color. I've received many compliments on this dress.<br />I don't have to worry about ironing this dress. Simple but elegant."
5.0,"Cute cute cute, well made.  Granddaughter loved!"
5.0,"This is a nice sweatshirt for $25, especially when the retails over $50.  It is a little on the thin side when you consider its thickness, but all in all, a very good buy."
5.0,"For the cost it is a great deal, I use it to put my camp clothes in and it reduces the volume by close to 50%."
5.0,Bought these for my husband to replace his old pair and he loves them!  They look great and he wore them for the whole summer.
5.0,perfect fit and exactly what I was looking for!

5.0,This was really cute! Matched the product description and was a great price!
5.0,Beautiful Christmas gift for my daughter in law
5.0,"I just love this bag!  Clean lines, well-made.  Leather is a little softer than pictured, but still holds it shape nicely.  I did not notice a chemical odor that some other reviewers mentioned, only the very nice scent of leather. The size is perfect for all of my &#34;purse-type things&#34;, plus my ipad and any files or notebooks slide right in the center zip pocket, so I only need the one bag as I head off to work!<br /><br /> Because of the price, I was not expecting the handles to be so sturdy and was pleased with the neat stitching. Unlike other &#34;genuine leather&#34; bags I have bought on the cheap, this bag feels and looks expensive.  I will most likely be buying this bag in another color!<br /><br />ETA: (Nov. 29) I have been carrying this bag daily since I purchased it and it still looks new.  I had intended to change out bags, but I love this one so much and always get compliments on it, so I just use it every day!  Ordering 2 more today in other colors."
5.0,"It's a really nice leather belt, good price with the quality. The size is adjustable,quality of the leather is comparable with the branded belt!"

5.0,Love the look. Pretty fashionable and the colors are just great. Totally recommend it.
5.0,Love this thing entirely. The entire holeless belt threw me for a bit fit wise. Ended put taking a inch off the top so it went into all my belt loops. Smooth and sleek and very black..
5.0,I bought this for my mom she loves it.
5.0,Love this hat. It's huge and like having your own personal umbrella!
5.0,This is perfect. I am 5' and 135 lbs. No hemming necessary. Love it.
5.0,They look great but feel horrible like two left shoes. I cannot wear they hurt too bad.
5.0,This dress is very well made with cool comfortable material. I am 5'3 and weigh 120 and the 4/6 fits perfect.

5.0,Pretty good but you could kinda see the magnet

5.0,This product was exactly what I wanted and what I ordered.

5.0,thanks so much!
5.0,The stones have a beautiful color and are a nice size
5.0,"These are not for heavy clean up or for wearing more than 15 min because they will spring a leak. However, they are perfect for quick food prep of fruit, vegetables, meat before cooking. They are the only gloves I buy and I'm very satisfied with them."
5.0,"These collar stays are thick, not too heavy, good quality and do make your collars look very good.These are definitely better than the plastic stays. There are 4 different sizes (6 pieces of each).If you happen to forget the stays in your shirt they are sturdy enough to resist the washing machine cycle. I do not know if they would rust because I have been very careful with them so far. The plastic box is really cheap but this is not an object you have for display on your dresser so the box should not be a concern. This product includes a measure tape that is horrible but this is just a &#34;bonus&#34; I guess."
5.0,Very thin. So they make my head look fat.
5.0,At first i was disappointed due to straps when running and then when i decided to return i looked for another in this brand bcuz honestly it has everything i needed support comfort durability just as i jog strapps will work there way off shoulders so then i seen where the back is suppose to cross for added support.<br />Wow AAAAAA+++++++++<br />perfect worth every penny final test on outdoor run will be final verdict however cross trainer and low impact excercises A+
5.0,Not real leather but high quality. I actually like the material they wipe clean so easy! Our are worn daily and still look brand new! We get lots of complements. My daughter wears a 4.5-5 wide in stride rites. These fit perfectly even with thicker socks. I have no problem with her pulling them off or them falling off. LOVE it plan on ordering another pair!
5.0,"This is an excellent way to keep your Bible safe from the weather, everyday wear, and makes it easy to carry  around at the church."
5.0,I was really impressed with the stone setting. It is beutiful
5.0,"Fast shipment, packaged well, no complaints.  Love the stones!"
5.0,Great boy shorts.
5.0,My gear fits very well in the back pack. Going get more things to put in it.
5.0,"I was impressed with these.  Very soft and light but actually pretty supportive.  I love the pouch area fit that has a double sided open fly that keeps your junk separate but in place...up or down. I will be buying more for sure. I am 6'4"" 235 and bought the xl...fits a little loose but that was what I wanted."
5.0,I really like the way this fits on me. It is great with jeans or a skirt. Casual or dress. Love it!

5.0,Good quality material and comfortable fit.
5.0,As it was advertised. the pendant (the blue evil eye) is about 1cm ( almost 0.5‚Äù inches) diameter. I am happy with my purchase.
5.0,"These socks are exactly what I was looking for. They are high quality, very warm and knee highs. They are very cushiony and reinforced, perfect for slippers or boots. They are called high performance and definitely are. Glad I treated myself to these fine socks."
5.0,Love them!  Arrived in a timely manner..  The quality is nice for the price.  I've worn them numerous times since purchasing and they are holding up well.  Would purchase from this seller again!  Very satisfied!
5.0,I love the appearance of the watch much more when I got it in person.  It‚Äôs comfortable and stylish. Excellent price. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,very nice slippers you can put on with no socks and have plenty of grip to play tug of war with your dog or whatever. I will say to keep in mind that these stretch a fair amount. I bought a size down and they're beginning to get sort of roomy. Aslo they do not breathe so prepare to sweat and don't do what I did and keep them on all day several days in a row because they will smell. but not the shoes fault i recommend them.
5.0,"Great quality, excellent fit, beautiful stitch work!"
5.0,These are absolutely gorgeous!! I expect them to be very popular.
5.0,More beautiful then pictured; very delicate. A gift for my daughter; she loved it.
5.0,Great quality from the leather to the hook. Individually packed and all in excellent condition. Each design is unique and beautiful. Strong recommendation to buy. The only thing to watch is it does not contain earring stopper which is bit of a disappointment but I can neglect it for the quality and dazzling look!
5.0,It‚Äôs very comfy but a little long
5.0,Cute! Great material and quality. Considering buying more in other colors.
5.0,"Love this shirt!  Burgundy is actually more a good, deep red - not bright - and it‚Äôs exactly what I was hoping for. Has just a little stretch, and love the texture of the material. Purchased to go with a new pair of dress pants for the office. It‚Äôs a little long, but if you‚Äôre tucking in, no problem. In my case, I may or may not have it hemmed an inch or two. Fit me true to size, I‚Äôm a 38C."
5.0,"I love the three pack calf compression sleeves.  The calf sleeves are a great value for your money.  I wore them for eight hours straight, and the compression applied on  my legs and ankles felt just right, and were not to tight.  The swelling in my ankles went down when I removed the calf sleeves.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Also, I loved the colors red, blue, and black with gray stripes was just lovely to view. !Yes, they are really cute too.  I will give them a ten!These"
5.0,These arrived quickly! I got them for a friend. She absolutely loved them. I have no complaints! Good packing and good product!
5.0,Christmas gift for the wife but I like them and I know she will.
5.0,"There are a couple of nice 'galaxy' patterned bucket hats available at Amazon. I chose this one because it was more intensely orangey/pinky and has a few whitish and purple blotches. It is black inside, and so it it great for keeping out glare. Upon the base of the crown,  I rolled up a fabric tube scarf, like a pleated hat band or ribbon around the base of the crown. It snugs the hat a little closer, and upscales the look immediately. Now I have a place to clip a flower or fascinator.  I wanted cloth bucket hand for the oncoming summer glare to wear in the car, because  wide brimmed hats are awkward, and not as easy to tuck away as a bucket. The fit for me was about right, considering I have thin hair which makes any head gear slide off. Hence the scarfband accessory, like a Buff, which is so much nicer than the string under the chin type. My head is about 21.7 inches circumference. I think that runs to small/middle. The crown settles on top of my head. This is not reversible but I suppose one could try..The interior side of the hat is black liner, but it looks nice partially turned up in a rakish-sailor style.  The fabric of the crown is surprisingly soft where the pattern is in the fabric and won't crack. It's a lot of style and comfort for a great price."
5.0,"Adorable! Bought for 11 yo birthday. She loves foxes and her birthday is in July, so the red stone is perfect. Surprised with the decent quality for the price! Not too big for a pre-teen. Love it. Happy with the purchase!"

5.0,This is a beautiful scarf/necklace.  Very easy to wear and eye-catching. I got a compliment on it the first time I wore it!  The fabric is the perfect weight--not too warm and soft enough to drape.  And the price is definitely a plus!

5.0,Bought it for work
5.0,"I swim laps and had an allergic reaction to my first two pair of goggles, eyes swelled shut.  I tried these and no problems! Been wearing for long time now, they fit well, no bridge of nose issues.  They do stick to the skin pretty tight so no water leaks, but no so tight that they are uncomfortable.  Yes they do fog up but I have found that instead of using defogger which may have contributed to my allergic reaction, I just wipe the inside lens with saliva (yeah, I spit on the inside lens and rub it around) and no fogging and no swollen eyes. I would purchase again."

5.0,"Exactly what I need for the price. They stay put really well and are comfortable to wear. Nothing fancy, just a good neutral piece, don't cause pain when sleeping on the side."
5.0,A little bigger than expected but its amazing! Only wore it once and already had so many compliments.
5.0,This is a nice dress that's well made. Arrived promptly. Seller is responsive. A good buy.
5.0,Perfect for work. Great material. Just as described.
5.0,"I like the way this shirt fits! It's not too tight and not too loose - just right. It's a great workout shirt and gives me a little room to move in. It's one of my new favorite ""go to"" shirts. The material is not too thin (not see through) and also not too thick."
5.0,Very elegant.  Not disappointed at all.
5.0,"I bought the masks for my husband ,his gotten so much compliments on the mask, that I bought him two more extra of the same one. I have also bought other masks for my kids and grandchildren so they have a verities of mask thank you Amazon I just love this store."

5.0,Nice. Gave to daughter cause runs small.
5.0,This is doable. not bad. Material definitely feels cheap but that's the price you pay is what you get. Still looks cute when on.
5.0,Was a gift and they loved them.
5.0,"I really like these Shimano cycling shoes a lot. They are comfortable, and with the clips, make peddling very efficient. They are holding up very well after months of use."
5.0,"I ordered a Medium, and it fit great. Slightly tighter at the top but not stretched, loose at bottom like expected. I weigh 170 lbs all in my belly and love handles; and a size 38D up top(large top usually). Happy I read reviews and ordered a size down. I normally wear a large or XL in some clothes and they would have swallowed me. I wore it for family pictures and it was perfect."
5.0,amazing roomy bag for the price i love it
5.0,"These looks great on, jus like in pic! The size is a larger lense, in case you want a smaller, these may be to big. I prefer bigger shades so for me they are perfect! However after just a day of use i noticed a small crack/scratch like on one lense (might just been a &#34;lemon&#34; pair) so i contacted the seller. They were super great , n sent me a new pair right away! No hassle! You will love these!!"
5.0,Excellent quality and so comfy!!
5.0,My son is 6 in the 1st grade and these are great.  He never has to take it all the way off so he doesn't lose them.
5.0,Wish they still made these!  They keep you cool on hot and humid days in the Midwest!
5.0,FAST DELIVERY!!! LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE WOOD AND HOW THEY LOOKED WHEN I TRY THEM ON.
5.0,I needed them!
5.0,"I love it! I know my grandpa is going to love it too! I was pleased to see that it came with a cute blue gift box. My only concern is how sharp the hooks are on the accessory. I will tell my grandpa to keep it inside of the box so he doesn‚Äôt hurt himself. Overall, I am happy and this was the last thing that I needed to complete my grandpa‚Äôs Father‚Äôs Day care package. Thank you."
5.0,What could be better?
5.0,Great quality without the mental UA price (and politics).  I‚Äôve purchased a few packs now and these rock under suit/tie.
5.0,Really cute! Good quality!
5.0,"I am so impressed by how this bag arrived . . . in a nice box and within the box it was protected by a cloth bag and even then, inside the bag were nice layers of a type of foam that maintained the bag's shape.  Love the size and organization of the three compartments plus the side zip pocket that is nice for slipping house keys into.  This bag also seems made of a nice material and the strap looks like it will be comfortable (not too thin) to wear over the shoulder.  I am very, very impressed.  Especially by the inexpensive price charged for it.  What a deal!!!"
5.0,These are very cute! I love them! They're kind of tricky to get on but I'd say they're easier to put on than knee high socks. They look very good with my boots and no one can tell they're just cuffs! I'm very happy with these and would recommend them to others.
5.0,Very pretty and delicate bracelet that can be stacked or worn as the centerpiece. Sparkly crystal and the adjustable coil construction quarantees a good fit. I love wearing with my rose gold watch.
5.0,Absolutely great I do Disaster Response and a problem was always reaching into my bag and trying to find what I needed quickly even if it was a quick change of clothing. The simplify packing and finding stuff highly recommend it to anybody traveling or just needing to organize things in a go bag
5.0,Ouch!!!  This hurts my ear.
5.0,Love great product
5.0,I love this bag. It's really cool and pretty
5.0,Wore this to work for superhero day and the kids loved it. It‚Äôs comfy and fits true to size. Not very thick though so don‚Äôt expect much warmth if you‚Äôre going to be in a cold environment.
5.0,"I have been looking for AGES for the perfect grey jogger sweatpant. I've searched the internet only to find cheap & thin material pants. Why are women's clothes made so poorly these days?? I was also looking for sherpa-lined because I live in the mountains and need all the extra warmth I can get. These are PERFECT! I normally don't buy clothes from Amazon because I'm worried about the quality but I'm beyond impressed with theses! The material is SO soft and nice and thick - like how sweatpants used to be made. I'm also very impressed with the sherpa. It's really nice quality. It's more like fur rather than that cheap stuff they use on blankets & animal beds, you know the one. They are 100% cotton (which is somehow impossible to find) and the sherpa is 100% polyester."
5.0,Great dress for Father/Daughter dance m!
5.0,"Obsessed with these bibs! I‚Äôll be honest I mainly had my eye on the ‚Äúpeach‚Äù design because that‚Äôs my favorite but I‚Äôm so happy to have the entire pack of 6, these bibs are awesome. Very absorbent so I‚Äôm finally done changing my daughters onesie constantly throughout the day I can just change her bib. So many cute patterns to match with any outfit. Great price."
5.0,"This cape is  everything I wanted. The weight is not too heavy, not too light; the drape is beautiful; the interior finishing is perfect; and the color is a gorgeous hazel that complements almost any outfit.<br /><br />Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that the cape is not of a heavier fabric. Please keep in mind that full, long capes like this involve a lot of fabric ‚Äì ‚Äì if the fabric is much heavier than this, then the garment is overwhelmingly heavy. Also keep in mind that this kind of shape allows you to wrap it around your self sort of double if you are cold.  It also allows you to wear a layer or two underneath in colder weather. For this reason, I adore this item for travel to changeable climates.  And it looks amazing with tall boots!"
5.0,Awesome! I get so many compliments!
5.0,everything about this shirt is great!
5.0,Great badge holder!
5.0,These sock help so much if you are on your feet everyday.

5.0,Love t
5.0,So loved it! Well made! Great price
5.0,It was here early and my daughter used it for her graduation!! Love the material and the top mesh is soft
5.0,"After reading the reviews about the headband, I went ahead and purchased it knowing that I could be disappointed. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed at all. The fit is perfect and reviewers were correct about the fact that it looks much more expensive than the price suggests. It actually fits my head perfectly and I tend to think most headbands are not tight enough! It's less than $2, ships fast and the glitter is not overpowering or childish looking, so take the small risk and buy it. You will like it"
5.0,Great fabric! Great price!
5.0,This is a gorgeous very colorful broach (brooch?) It is larger than expected and that‚Äôs wonderful! I get so many compliments when I wear it! Great purchase!!!!
5.0,Nice fit for 6-7 years girl.
5.0,Good quality and fast shipping just what I was looking for and that 50 Watts makes a big difference it is real loud an the siren is ridiculously loud good product I'm happy with it
5.0,Fit perfectly without the bagging under the arms and the band does not have the uncomfortable elastic.
5.0,"good compression sox, not too tight, but enough compression to alleviate swelling.<br />launder well."
5.0,Beautiful. I love them SOOOOOO pretty
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:247d0f31bcb69c23f16d84f4ae75fa1b]] I received this Crystal pendant in a fancy little package, along with a couple other surprises. It is caged in an attractive hold, with an eyelet for a necklace chain I'll add to it.<br />It was just the size I expected. Not too large or small. The glitter shine is stunning. As much as I adore it, I think it's worthy of giving to someone special as a gift. I will be getting another, or more."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4ac9e2566e85600cbd1a6b090a89a1a]] This is my third therapy ring like this. I will continue to buy more of these as the gold fade or they get too big.
5.0,As expected. Nice bag.

5.0,I'm 5.11 and it fits perfect. happy with the price and the material. Thanks!
5.0,Worth the purchase. I work in the oilfield and this band has been really good and protects my watch.
5.0,A replacement for one that I carried every day for years and years.  The original one held up to years of use and this one will too I‚Äôm sure.
5.0,Love my new purse!  It fits everything nicely and I love the huge pocket on the back to stuff my keys and cell phone so I don't have to dig for them.  Shipped quickly and am very happy about my purchase!
5.0,I like it very brown and sexy
5.0,Were a gift
5.0,These are wonderful - I had no issues with them
5.0,Quality was exceptional. I will be purchasing abother soon.
5.0,"I ordered this ring when I saw that it resembled very closely my real gold and diamond ring which was stolen from my home due to a break-in.  This ring is beautiful and I am very very happy with my purchase.  I cant believe the price of this ring, it looks much more expensive and no one will know it's not the ""real deal"".  But I got a real deal on this ring.  The loss of my ring is a little less painful. Thank you to the vendor and also to Amazon.  Delivery was within 2 business days, I will definitely purchase from this vendor again."
5.0,"Got this charm in a timely manner and I like the look of it. My girlfriend had one of these, but it had broken from constant abuse. Hopefully this one can hold up better!"
5.0,Good quality and wonderful thought. This is my new motto!  How freeing!
5.0,Warm yet not bulky
5.0,"Even tho these were a tad small (I'm 5'4&#34; and 128 lbs., ordered medium) they are really soft and comfortable. Bright, nice colors and very sharp biking pants for the price."
5.0,Looks just like the Haunted Mansion wallpaper!
5.0,"I was intending to buy it for myself, but it is so beautiful, I decided to give it as a gift to a friend for Christmas, so I have started shopping early.  My friend has been looking for one,  and I think she will really love it."
5.0,Love love love these!! So comfy!! I wear a 9.5/10 normally and am always paranoid to order in med or large for fear of it being too small or big. But these are perfect!!! They're so cute and stylish. Great cushiony house slippers!!!
5.0,"Beautiful, well made, simple yet elegant.  Perfect price! True to size."
5.0,"Replaced my TOMS shoe laces with these, very pleased with them. No longer annoyed by loose laces. Great product."
5.0,"Beautifully crafted but they are not clipping type, as I thought"
5.0,I love the strong material. They do not bend or break. They have a good hold and look great. I have worn them in the shower and the finish does not come off. I really like the three different options and how they look on my skin. This has been a really great product to try and enjoyed doing so. I will be purchasing more because they are made of such good quality products.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.
5.0,"Bought it for my wedding to have something to keep essentials in. Inexpensive, which is great since I'm only going to use it once, and is a very close match to my dress."
5.0,Very pretty in person. Good quality for the price. Comes in a pretty bag. Purchased specifically because I have metal allergies and was looking for something with the 925 sterling silver. I like that the chain and back of pendant are smooth.
5.0,Bought for our grandson. He went and took a shower just so he could put this new robe on. He loved it. Great find. I hope it withstands it's use.
5.0,"This was a great purchase. It for true to size, looked beautiful, and was comfortable to wear. I bought it for a wedding and got compliments throughout the night‚Äîincluding from the bride herself. No one could believe I purchased it from amazon for less than $35. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Great sunglasses and were shipped extremely quickly! 2 Thumbs up!
5.0,Got these for a bachelorette party for the handlebar and we loved them! They are sturdy and so cute!
5.0,Found these on sale and decided to give them a try.  They are nice.  These are not &#34;el-cheapos.&#34;  They are an inch or two longer than typical boxer briefs and have a softer feel than my Jockey and Adidas.
5.0,Oh my gosh.  Bought this for my husband's birthday gift and he LOVES it.  Has been wearing it instead of his Rolex!  Strangers have been asking him where he bought it.
5.0,I like this Orient watch.  It looks sharp with the black face with gold number indicators.  For the nearly two weeks I have worn this watch it has kept perfect time.  I was tired of buying batteries for the quartz watches so this watch was what I was looking for.  If it should run down from not being worn for a while just move the watch in a circular motion for about 30 seconds to get it started and then reset the day and date as instructed. It is best to set the watch hands at 6:00 o'clock before setting the day and date to prevent possible damage to the gears of the day and date mechanism.  The date starts to change at about 11:30 pm with the day following in Spanish and then English and completes about 3:00 am. It is best to let the date and day mechanism complete it's rotation before doing any settings with it.  Mechanical watches are not quartz watches so you may lose some seconds when worn for a long while so just adjust the hands when needed.  The watch band is large for my small wrist so for now I have been wearing it up high on my arm and may shorten it later.  I do recommend this watch and I think you would like it too.
5.0,"Awesome reusable bags! They are sturdy, easy to clean, and hold a ton! The checkers at the grocery stores are always impressed by these. My town charges a fee to use store bags so it‚Äôs great to keep these in my car ready for whenever I go to the store. So glad I found these and am very happy with them."
5.0,Ok this is really elegant with tons of sex appeal. The burgundy red and vintage black lace goes so well together. The straps criss cross on your back and gives your breast that extra lift and support. I do not have very big breasts but the way this is designed it gives me more cleavage than I know what to do with. This is by far one of my boyfriends favorite there is just something about it that he could not keep his hands off of me and did not want me to take it off! Theasy fabric is soft and sheer everywhere but on the chest the lace keeps everything concealed and room for your partners imagination going. The lace is soft as well not itchy at all!
5.0,Granddaughter likes it.fits perfect but the material Pills after washing
5.0,Love the glasses. Had a pair years ago that the lenses were a little bit smaller but I can't find them anymore. These tho are very nice ty
5.0,There's not much to say. These are well made with attention to detail.<br /><br />The first time I've ever handled titanium items.
5.0,"My wife loves this dress and she looks smokin hot in it, what she likes best is the pockets."
5.0,"Good brought a XL, look a little small out the package but it stretches I‚Äôm 6ft and the length is good"
5.0,Colores duraderos
5.0,"this was my daughters 8th grade graduations dress, everyone loved it. thank you!"
5.0,Love this. Bought 2 for my friends twin girls. Very youthful and modern looking. I love that they're stainless steel for longevity.
5.0,"I have bought so many gloves that claimed to be touchscreen friendly, and none of them worked until I got these! The touch screen function work so well that it‚Äôs almost like your actual fingers that‚Äôs how sensitive it is! & on top of that; they‚Äôre SO SOFT! Definitely my favorite gloves, and they‚Äôre very warm! 10/10!"
5.0,"The dress was a perfect fit! Not too tight, not too loose. It hugged everything in just the right way. Not to mention it was incredibly comfortable, soft, and light."
5.0,"I just received it and quickly put all of my pens, markers, high lighters, cords and thumb drives in it. It fits perfect in my laptop bag for my 15&#34; macbook pro, and it also seems to hold everything securely."
5.0,"This top is very comfortable, washes very well and is brightly colored. It breathes well in a hot climate. Well worth the price."
5.0,"Comfortable band. Great value, will purchase again in the future."
5.0,"This was the perfect little &#34;thank you&#34; gift for the team's biggest fan.  It arrived right on schedule, and the quality is on par with the prices."
5.0,"This is one of those rare moments that I think the product looks better in person than in the posed pictures.  My daughter loves to wear this around the house, it's really cute and flattering. It does run a little small, so like everyone else around here has been saying, get a size up. Or maybe two sizes up if you want a loose fit. The Camo pattern looks really cool and my daughter says it is comfortable. Seems like a good value to me!"
5.0,Love this dress!!  Looks great with leggins.
5.0,Well made pretty size!
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted. Traditional fabric scrub caps, even the ones for women, could not collect all of my thick, long hair. Or if they did, I'd have to snug and tie it tight, which would give me headaches. This style contains all my hair and is not too tight. It is adjustable. Good quality. Love the pattern."
5.0,Great dress I've received so many compliments
5.0,"Love it! So does my 3 year old. Soft and cute,  just exactly what every little girl need!"
5.0,"I am 140 pounds and a 29-30 inch waist, trim but not buff. The small fit well. The quality is great and the material felt good. The thing that makes these different from others and sets them apart is that they have a front pouch that enhances your profile. It is comfortable too, as it holds parts out front away from you. I didn‚Äôt expect to like this so much and my wife, who is normally indifferent to clothing, liked them quite a bit on me even though she didn‚Äôt think she would care much for them when I was ordering them. These will be worn on an international vacation only, as I‚Äôd feel a little uncomfortable most places in the US."
5.0,Love the material and style. Just too small on me
5.0,"I love that it's small & compact. The window for the phone is awesome, no need to remove the phone to use it."
5.0,I absolutely love Nike shorts! I wear these at least once a week!
5.0,"They were bigger than what I was expecting and the frame was more transparent than I thought. I did really like how the lenses are dark and polarized. I am pleased with them, they don't pinch the bridge of my nose like some do."
5.0,"Great! I hate the feeling of restrictive business jackets. This is lightweight, comfortable, while still being professional and structured."
5.0,great blue blockers. like the glasses. fast delivery
5.0,EVERYTHING!
5.0,"They fit well. The arms hug your head, so they don't slide off."
5.0,Would buy Again
5.0,"The dress looks very classy and elegant, just a little too short for me. I will give it away to a shorter person."
5.0,"I got this baby for $5, no bells or whistles but it came with a 7 year battery, and I can't buy one of those for $5.  So far, she has been very accurate."
5.0,Love them. Especially the buckle.
5.0,"I once had a silver Casio watch that I absolutely loved that broke after enough use, lol. I saw this clear one and knew I had to grab it. Great quality, reputable brand and the clear strap matches everything! the backup lights it a bonus, well worth the money spent."
5.0,Love the purse but it was smaller than I expected. Probably will only use it for carrying my tablet!
5.0,Baller hat. Well made. I like it
5.0,Me llegaron en perfecto estado bien empacado y listo para utilizar
5.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend because he wanted a functional jersey to play painball. I never realized it had the Terry cloth sewn in at the bottom, but he just wouldn't stop freaking out by how awesome it is. Thank you Planet Eclipse for making such an amazing jersey. I'm pretty sure he is going to wear it forever üòä"
5.0,Material is light weight. Came with all the assoresies noted.
5.0,Super soft and warm!  Love the front pocket and draw strings.
5.0,One of my favorite pairs. I've had them for around three years now and I have nothing negative to say. The shape and style is timeless. Does get scratched but that's with anything if you don't take care of it!
5.0,Good quality and price. Very pretty.
5.0,"Very detailed piece- I bought it to wear as a pinkie ring (it will squeeze down to a size four), and I prefer pieces that are not too 'delicate' looking because my other rings are rather substantial, and I need something to balance them. Really nice piece of silver work."
5.0,Comfortable nice material
5.0,Boy did my wife like this  EXCELLENT  RECOMMENDED
5.0,"Very nice wallet, A tad larger than I wanted & is a very tight fit in the small bag I carry but it has every thing I was wanting. Very happy with it & tthe price was right."
5.0,Color is brilliant. And keeps the warmth unreal good. The zippers are<br />I‚Äôm a great location to make reading easy.
5.0,"My favorite bras, looks great, super comfy!"
5.0,"Material is light enough for spring days, but not at all see through! Good material for a thin material & the butterflies are as vibrant and beautiful as pictured!"
5.0,"Very cute high heel shoe pins. Add a hankie and you have a very special little gift, as I did."
5.0,Love.  This. Skirt  looks.  Nice.  And.  Confortable.  Going.  To. Order.  Another.  For. A. Gift.  Nothing.  Is.  Given.  For.  This. Review.
5.0,"These are great workout tops, especially for the price! I'd say they run a bit small. I am between a medium and large and the large was perfect for these. For context, a size medium Old Navy workout top fits similarly. The tops are soft and on the thinner side, which I enjoy for working out."
5.0,The dress was perfect for my granddaughter. Exactly what she wanted !!!
5.0,"JUST purchased this bag from the Rack, as they had it in-store for a little less than the price here and I could check out the small and medium sizes side by side. This bag is really awesome. I'm pretty amped about the shoe compartment, the water resistance, and the general size, shape, quality, and feel of it. We'll see how it holds up over time. I'm not particularly excited about the extra strap clip feature, but I probably just won't use that. I shopped like hell and did my homework before buying. If you're having a tough time deciding, here's what I've found.<br />-The small size is plenty big for most average gym packers. In mine, I can easily fit: one pair size 10.5 mens shoes, large bag gloves (16 oz), wrist wraps, a small towel, gym outfit (shorts, tshirt, tighty whiteys, socks, bandana), various small accessories (lock, headphones, keys, etc.) and it looks like I should still have space for a water bottle, extra jeans and hoodie, shower flip flops. I could get even more stuff in there if I crammed.<br />-The medium is even bigger. It can fit all of the above, plus extra pairs of shoes, more clothes, heavy jacket, hair dryer, extra toiletries, probably even a soccer or basketball. If used for travel it would certainly fit enough for a week long trip. That said, if your workout is more gear intensive than mine, you might want the medium size.<br /><br />Both of them are considerably more shallow (not as tall) than comparable duffles like the adidas defender II or the Nike Brazilia, which I personally prefer. I don't want the thing knocking my knees when I carry it.<br /><br />Also, if you found this info helpful, please click Yes below. Cheers!"
5.0,I was so happy with my bracelets! I saw other reviews saying they were not pleased with the results. mine came two days early and were absolutely beautiful colors. I will definitely be ordering another set because of the very low price!
5.0,"Love the design and quality. It is a heavy ring. I especially love the different colors, for those with multiple championships!"
5.0,Feel protected
5.0,"These glasses are light weight and fit comfortably .It came in a zippered case inside a thick box case which is impressive. I love the color and the make which makes it totally good.<br />It also has this pouch inside which is to protect it from scratches.There is also a cleaning cloth provided.<br />The glasses are very sturdy and thick which is very stunning. I like the over-sized lens ,which completely covers the eye line from sun light . It eliminates glare and reduces reflections during a bright sunny day.<br /><br />These glasses are ideal for driving or any outdoor activities. I dont like strain on my eyes especially when the sun is at peak. These glasses are serving the purpose of reducing eye strain by protecting the eyes from UV radiations . These glasses are a total worth for the price paid."
5.0,Just as pictured.  Beautiful!  They were a gift to a friend and she loves them!
5.0,"Nobody does jeans like Gloria!  Comfortable, roomy where they need to be,  flattering."
5.0,Bought this for my sister as a gift and she loved it. It is so cute! I bought the brown one. It looks just like the picture
5.0,Bought this a while ago to help protect a broken toe while doing jiujitsu.  They have been great and have used them off and on with other foot issues while grappling.
5.0,"Well made & was the perfect gift for my husband, he loves it :) Also u would have thought I paid way more for it than I did so perfect gift & perfect price was a win/win for me:)"
5.0,"These shorts are so lightweight, breathable  and comfortable that it is seriously hard to wear any other shorts now.  They are great for mtn biking, running, hiking, climbing or casual -- and are easily the most comfortable shorts I own.  There are no back pockets, so keep that in mind. They are slightly stretchy, allow for wide range of movement & the waist has a ton of adjustment via the built in velcro straps. The size chart is accurate, I'm a 33-34 and wear a large, they are great fit with adjustment left in both directions if needed.  The fabric is super thin, but so far I've had no problems with extensive use for more than a year.  The regular Ethers and other mtn bike shorts are certainly more durable, but nothing compares to these as to fit, breathability and comfort.  I've heard some complaints that the button isn't strong enough, but there is also a velcro that closes over it.  I have never had the button accidentally pop open -- not even sure how that could be possible."
5.0,Loves it so much that I bought one for my friend. He like to go to raves and the zipper pocket is perfect for‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶stuff.
5.0,Smaller than I thought but it's cute!
5.0,"Mix and match, and wait for wat is on your way!"
5.0,Product as described. Will buy again.
5.0,"I was really quite surprised how nice these sunglasses are when I received them. I really like the lens color with the bamboo frame - it's a great combination. The thing I noticed when I first put them on was how good the fit was and how comfortable they were. I do have a larger face but these just fit really well, not too snug but not too loose. Polarized sunglasses are the way to go and these are indeed polarized, protecting you from UVA/UVB rays. These are great for doing anything outside especially driving in the daytime.<br /><br />They also include some extras when you receive your sunglasses. There's a nice wooden/bamboo case to store your sunglasses (or anything for that matter), a nice quality soft case, a small microfiber cloth for wiping down your sunglasses and getting all those fingerprints off. They also included a cool little screwdriver with a Phillips-head on one end and a Flat Head on the other end. It has a loop on the end so you could attach it to your keys or anything you'd like.<br /><br />I do recommend these sunglasses as they are a nice everyday pair of sunglasses that are stylish, comfortable, and won't break the bank. I will have to see how they hold up over time but there's nothing to me that indicates they won't last for a very long time."
5.0,It makes the mask so much easier to breathe in. It really helps at work!
5.0,I love this shirt! It's sexy and classy and I got several compliments on it.
5.0,"Gorgeous bag. Lightweight, but strong.  Perfect for spring.  I love it."
5.0,"Using this loupe to view our jewelries or jewelries in the stores became an addiction on the first couple week I received it. The lens is clear and focused well, as long as you know where to put the rock under the lens. Just like a professional with professional loupe. This loupe is inexpensive compared to the usefulness and to the one mostly used by professionals (or they may just use similar loupe). The double set of the loupes is very useful, one for me and one for my wife! The compact box is also helpful. She definitely loves it. I bought another loupe (with LED) to complement this loupe (see my other review)"
5.0,"Amazing,  beautiful üòç love it"
5.0,This item well worth the money. It fills up your pandora or similar styles. So the charms do not get snagged<br />On anything.
5.0,"I do like the simple vintage design of this blouse but I should have ordered medium instead of large. Also, it's advisable to wear a camisole underneath because the fabric is somewhat translucent/ thin."
5.0,"Love this Totes umbrella!  After having purchased other non-Totes umbrellas and having them literally fall apart on me, i purchased this umbrella and it (we) have survived many a rainstorm!  It is nice and convenient because of its size.  If the day is sunny, i will usually leave the umbrella in my vehicle.  However, if there is even the slightest hint of any cloud formations for that day, this handy umbrella is my companion.  When i travel to Europe, i ALWAYS take this Totes umbrella with me.  Due to its size i can conveniently slip it into a side pocket of my backpack and it is ready for action as necessary.  Belgium of all places have pretty unpredictable weather, and you may have the sun out one moment and  a rain shower coming down when you least expected it.  It is light and attractive.  I really like the wide velcro tab which keeps the umbrella closed, it is stitched very nicely, versus the very small piece of velcro that is very commonly used in other cheaper umbrellas.  I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"I love this bracelet, I was worried because it was so cheap and I was taking a chance. I mean<br />Not really considering how inexpensive it was. Worth it. On time and good quality"
5.0,"It rides high, more on one's skullcap, rather than coming down low onto one's forehead.  It's just an observation,  not so much a criticism."
5.0,Hard to find grandson loves it
5.0,Awesome the seller is super honest this is an 100% Calvin Klein product as I review another ones I bought this like two or three years ago probably and they look like the first day and again I two them in the laundry and the dryer
5.0,"Besides the look,their size, thickness and the weight was the deal maker."
5.0,Buttery soft feel.
5.0,"This is a truly elegant sweater with many designer touches. Right now we are experiencing a heatwave, but the second the color fall weather arrives I will be enjoying the comfort and panache of this sweater. If you are looking for the perfect gift for someone, this mock turtleneck sweater is it!"
5.0,"I love these pants. I've wanted these pants since last year, but I refused to pay $110 for them. I'm so happy I found them on amazon. I'm 5ft 9 155lbs, and I brought a size small. They fit great. They are very slimming, and they stay up while working out. They also feel great. I want to buy more!"
5.0,"very nice, great quality."
5.0,"These are my favorite bra. Comfy, lightweight, and holding up."
5.0,so cute on the little one
5.0,like the feel of it
5.0,"very cool, used them for Halloween costume and they looked great!"
5.0,"They fit well and are comfortable. Perform as expected, nothing more, nothing less."
5.0,Very high quality and attractive pin.
5.0,"I love to have these on my shoes when travelling, but they are also great for every day wear and even hiking. They're pretty durable overall, but I have had one or two of them break when hiking, so I'd recommend keeping the extras work you in your pack just in case. I already did that with shoelaces, so it really isn't a negative. Just a bit of advice."
5.0,"One of my best friends is obsessed with this show, and I just had to get her something from it. I found these and it was perfect. I ordered it and they came in a good condition and were very soft. She said they fit her well, and were soft. If you're thinking about getting these as a gift for somebody, do it!"
5.0,I just love this dress! I especially love the pockets because you can put your hands in them without pulling the dress out of shape. It flows beautifully and hides a multitude of sins without looking like a muumuu! Be sure to use the size chart when ordering.
5.0,Just what I expected! Lovely sunglasses
5.0,"My son got this for Christmas and he loves it, the lights are awesome!"
5.0,"Loved it, all original, 100% guaranteed"
5.0,Love it.  I'm wearing it today actually.  Good quality.  All beads in tact after multiple wears.
5.0,Embroidered patch instead of decal. Decal on previous hat flaked and deteriorated quickly.
5.0,I liked the color and the fact that it fit my head perfectly. I love it!
5.0,This dress is amazing. It‚Äôs worth of price of the dress. Very satisfied with the dress as well as service provided by seller.
5.0,I ordered the exact right size. They work perfectly.
5.0,"Looking at all the idiots saying &#34;The Material is too cheap.&#34; And &#34;Too expensive for the material its made with.&#34; The REAL Pablo merch IS made on Gildan Shirts, and they sell for $45 or more. The Merch isn't high class its just printed on there, thats why these shirts are pretty much the same thing as the original."
5.0,"This is the BEST diaper bag I have ever owned! Trust me when I say the BEST! I did a lot of research before making my decision to purchase the Ella Dane diaper bag. What sold me on this beauty was the amount of room it has.  It can seriously hold so much (I pack it for a toddler and newborn)and the side pockets can hold my 32 oz Hydro Flask without taking up any of the internal real estate, such a win!  I also love that it can be feminine yet masculine enough for my hubby to carry.  If you‚Äôre in the market for a new diaper bag I highly recommend this beauty!!"
5.0,"Loved everything > it was perfect . . . Fabric, fit and protection."
5.0,Love them. Very nice.
5.0,Great gift to my grandaughters! They loved them!
5.0,Great lightweight bracelet with tools provided to size correctly.

5.0,Loved it. Just as pictured especially with the color.üòä
5.0,"Love these! I‚Äôve had them through a season, they do fade a bit but otherwise holding up to multiple washing. Nice amount of padding. Handle sweat well."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:8b891af7f64a6c265479f89985f73f9d]] Super cute. And big head friendly!!
5.0,Very warm and cozy great for construction or outside working late.
5.0,I bought this shirt March and im not sure why September is my first time wearing it but I love it! Got lots of compliments
5.0,Love it.  Fits great.  More high-wasted than hip resting.
5.0,Adorable is all i can say.  My friend loves anything infinity so when i was picked to receive this during a promotion i jumped on it because i knoew she would love it.  and she did!  Great quality and nice color.  Fits well.  although a TAD on the small side.  Over all I couldn't be happier and neither could she.
5.0,"I love the style and appearance of these earrings. The variety of colors allow me to interchange them with numerous outfits. Besides the product themselves, they go above and beyond on a customer service level. I was personally contacted as a follow up to ordering the product. The communication was professional and courteous. I would definitely feel confident in purchasing these and other products of theirs."
5.0,Love these!  Fast ship and they do not disappoint!
5.0,The amber lens is what I asked for
5.0,Great fit. I love the sweaters
5.0,"GORGEOUS and very flattering cut. I got so many compliments on this coverup in Jamaica. the color is lovely and the material is very breathable. I'm super picky but it was  great value and the perfect length. I'm 5'3 and it hit about 3-4 inches above the knee and is true to size, stretchy, so order down if you are between sizes."
5.0,"It‚Äôs a thicker material so no need for nude color undergarments- but still light enough for summer! Can be dressed up or down! I weigh 210lbs, wear XL tops and 16 pants. Size XL is perfect- I did put a bandeau on because I am larger chested and it was rather low cut!"
5.0,"This shemagh is perfect, the size is noticeably larger than other shemagh, and the weave is sturdy and even, but light enough for good air flow. The packaging was very thoughtful too, overall I'm very satisfied, especially for such a fair price."
5.0,"This watch is so beautiful, it is delicate and charming. It fits well and comfortable. It‚Äôs a great choice for a gift or for yourself."
5.0,The leather is very soft with the rubber sole provides excellent cushioning to foot. The red and black color suits different style of dressing

5.0,This is cute and what I have bee looking for. It goes with everything

5.0,Great to polish my Pandora jewelry!! Love it! So simple and easy to use.
5.0,"I ordered a large (my usual size) and its still a bit snug getting on and off but its so soft and still wearable. I love the color, definatly worth the money"
5.0,Fits perfectly! Doesn‚Äôt leave that gross silicone puckered skin crap. I love it!
5.0,I love the material. Very soft and comfy.
5.0,"Well packaged for safety<br />Beautiful shine, very sturdy, unique design.<br />Bought it for my fianc√© for Valentine's day. He loves unique chains, and this fit the bill. Would buy again. Plan to get the matching bracelet"

5.0,I needed something quick and cute for an event . This top has become one of my favorites & go 2 tops. It makes my not so perky breasts look lovely and perky. I recommend others buy!

5.0,Really love these. They fit awesome. I normally wear small.  The are a great material and look great with short belly shirts. I highly recommend them.
5.0,Very nice quality. Lots of room. It doesn't have a top handle but I don't think it needs one. I bought it as a teacher bag for my husband and he has no complaints.
5.0,"Adjustable,comfortable"
5.0,"Works great, the best no show socks I‚Äôve ever gotten!"
5.0,"My daughter normally wears a 6, but her heel almost falls off the back of these.  Wearable, but we also got Koya in a size 7 and that is a much better fit.  If you are a 51/2-6, get 6, but if you're 6-61/2, I'd get a 7. They are surprisingly comfortable, and as a BTS fan, she absolutely loves them!"
5.0,Arrived just as pictured and Super Fast... Got tons of compliments. Accomplished Look!!
5.0,I love this. I use it as a change purse and a conversation piece. I love Elvis
5.0,"I am very happy with this purchase. I am very impressed and very glad to have found it. My husband wears a size 15 and I was very happy that I was able to find something that will fit him, and very good detail. The image is what you actually get. It is not like the other items I have purchased that they advertise pewter and you get steel or some other metal. Definitely a sturdy looking ring. My husband will love it for Christmas!"
5.0,Gave as a gift for my daughter! She love it!
5.0,Great quality material with versatility.
5.0,I would recommend buying these pajamas because they are so soft. I used the recommended size chart recommeded to order my size & was pleased at how they fit.

5.0,Beautiful dress. Loved it for a summer wedding.
5.0,"I literally just got these delivered 10 minutes ago, I'm wearing them and they are perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.  Mudd used to sell &#34;skinny bootcut&#34; at Kohl's but no longer and I've been searching and for months for a replacement.  These are it. My new favorite jeans! I hope they come out with more colors.  I literally just bought a second pair."
5.0,"These are just the right tint for me, and I love that they are polarized.  They fit well, look good, and are incredibly inexpensive.  I put one pair in each of my cars, and keep one in the house to wear when I go for a walk or work in the yard.  What's not to like?"
5.0,"These goggles are very comfortable and large enough to use with a large frame eyeglasses like the one I have.  The elastomeric material used to mold these goggles provide a snug fit.  Let me warn any potential buyer that there is a film on the surface ad it is difficult to see.  If you do not remove this film, the view will be hazy and the film can scratch easily giving you the impression that it is the surface that is scratching."
5.0,I just got in a 40mph crash with this on.  Its saved my skin from ripping  off. The hard plastic  on the shoulders  helped  with me just sliding down that road untill  i stopped.  And the hard plastic  on the forearms and elbow  helped alot to just have a couple  of bumps  that's it glad i had it on
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift and I she called me and was over the moon excited about the necklace, said she could not wait to show it off."
5.0,This hat was just what I was looking for without spending a lot of money

5.0,My son loves this!! It‚Äôs super soft and cozy!
5.0,"Gorgeous  chains, fast delivery. Great buy."
5.0,I love this bra.  Hands down the most comfortable bra I have worn.  I've spent the last 4 months out of bra because I wasn't working  I got back to work soon and decided I haven't had new bras in years so I should update. And I'm so glad this was one of my choices.
5.0,Perfect and great quality.
5.0,Very comfy. Love the color and feel on my feet.
5.0,"After reading the description and reviews I thought the price looked reasonable so I would give this dress a shot. Blown away!! I ordered it in green and it is now my favorite dress. The fabric is more like a thick jersey knit, which is comfortable and flattering to my form. I have a rather large bust and the cut was flattering in that area without looking awkwardly stretched out. Not too tight at all. I am 5'7, 145lbs, and a 34DD... a large fit me with absolutely no problem."
5.0,Perfect! Everyday use
5.0,"Love these jeans,  my new favorite Jean's! Fits true to size but could have probably went down a size since the do have a little stretch to them."
5.0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I had one of these growing up so I bought it more for the nostalgia factor than anything else. I didn't take into consideration that I was a child when I last wore it, so it was a bit small for my man sized wrists. Don't get me wrong it does fit and is sleek enough to use under latex gloves or any other gloves for that matter.<br /><br />The build quality hasn't changed in oh so long. I'm glad I bought it."
5.0,"I love these! I've worn them three times so far, haven't washed yet though. I will be ordering more!"
5.0,"üòç loooovvvveeeee these shoes, I had been wanting some gladiator style for @ least 1.5 yrs but original ones i wanted in store price were over $60 and then sold out and didnt return this yr but im glad i didnt get those but finally got 'em and don't regret they feel comfy and very roomy. Recommend"
5.0,Thank you Claddagh Gold for your amazing products. I am very  satisfied with the Necklace and the bracelet.<br />Hesham

5.0,"Perfect for summer , nice fit at waist. Enjoy the color choices"
5.0,Gorgeous heel! Way too high.
5.0,"This adorable sun hat would be appreciated by any toddler. The fact that it has ""mouse"" ears with a bow makes it irresistible.  This might be the one sun hat that doesn't get ripped off by your little one."
5.0,Did exactly what I wanted with these 2 decals....put them on my tablet cover :)  Looks Great !!
5.0,I ordered this dress for my adult niece.  I did get to see the dress on her and I thought she looked great.  The dress is very comfortable and feels like good quality fabric.  The colors are amazing also!
5.0,My 3 year old loves these shoes!  She bounces around and loves to make them light up.  They are pretty good quality as she puts them through a beating and they are holding up really well.
5.0,Love these pants! They look great on my fianc√©. My boyfriend said that they feel comfortable and have ball room. Hee Hee.
5.0,"My home office is cold, and my hands were always freezing! I tried to wear some silk glove liners but it was too difficult to hold a pen. These have been great for keeping my hands warm and don‚Äôt interfere with dexterity. The tag listed the fabric content and it‚Äôs about 25% cashmere. They‚Äôre not at all itchy."
5.0,Running through my vein  ~ this chain.......
5.0,"simple and elegant, and perfect length"
5.0,Very nice dress but ordered too small in size.
5.0,I love this dress and intend to buy more from the same company.  Fits perfectly.

5.0,"Love these shorts! Comfortable, wicking and fast drying. Bought a second pair in a different color after wearing the first  pair I bought for a week straight, lol."
5.0,Buena adquisici√≥n
5.0,I LOVE THIS DRESS! I got many compliments on it. It feels great. It fits better than I expected. I have a larger cup size and was worried it wouldn't fit but the cut of the dress and the material allows for a comfortable chest fit. I'm also on the taller side and it wasn't too short.
5.0,I got it for someone and they love it
5.0,I accidentally butt bought these leggings. They are sily & comfortable & most of all FUN! Get tgem!
5.0,These stayed in place all day. It‚Äôs hard not to love them.
5.0,"Love these glasses, fun and colorful. They fit well and I'm looking forward to purchasing more colors."
5.0,"great shorts for biking, they're a bit snug for the large. I wear a 34 and they fit snug."
5.0,"Unfortunatelly I didn't read that sizes run a little small. So, I'm size M (european) an for me M size of this top was small :(. I gave it to my sister (size S) and itwas ok for her. Quality is good, and colors as they are on the pic."
5.0,Daughter loves this dress! Nice fabric. Bright colors.
5.0,"I really like this shoe, it has wonderful cushioning as I would expect from trotter.  I would order another pair if there was other than black.  I did order another shoe but the quality of the cushioning was not up to  the standard I expect from trotter"
5.0,Since this was a gift I don't have a pic but this lay so pretty around mother's neck.
5.0,Excellent item. All ate soft and sizing is correct. I ordered 4 and my husband loves them!
5.0,Very cute. I wore is with a pirate costume and I got a lot of compliments. I have only worn it once but the quality seemed good.
5.0,"i wear a 34 and I ordered a 36 .. Fits perfect... I had jeans like these in the 70 's ...  when I needed a patch put on , I would have one of my girlfriends sew another patch on .. We never got rid of our old jeans.. I am a slim build .. If your a big boned person they will be too tight on the lower  below the knees part"
5.0,Fast shipping item exactly as described.  Great seller. Band fit perfectly for my MOTO smartwatch.
5.0,I LOVE this bathing suit. It covers my flaws and makes me look hot af. I‚Äôd order in different colors tbh.
5.0,Very good quality watch ban. It made my watch look three times more than what it's worth. The clasp keeps the ban securely looked. Can't find one negative on this very stylish product.
5.0,beauty and quality of necklace
5.0,I expected Teal but this skirt is a VERY dark forest green.  Not as expected but it‚Äôs still a nice skirt.
5.0,"He was excellent, just a bit long."
5.0,Love Minnetonka!  The fit is great and they last for years and years literally.  I am so happy that Amazon now sells them as they can be very difficult to find.  They are very comfortable right from day one and I wear them as casual and more dressy both!
5.0,Very cute ^^ I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 120ibs . I ordered small !
5.0,"Very happy with jacket, good value for the money"
5.0,These pants are amazing. Super comfortable and flattering. They are also high-waisted and stretchy. Perfect for quarantine and school or work from home or even running errands

5.0,they are nice an warm like them alot very good quality for the price

5.0,I love this bracelet it's nice and it works!!
5.0,This item got here almost 2 weeks ahead of when it said it would arrive and they are well made and super fun to use decorating my things! I love them so much!
5.0,Absolutely love this wallet.
5.0,"I am using this item to hold keys chain clipped to a belt loop.  It looks and feels very strong, and I believe the spring mechanism will last a long time.  Works great for me. The spring feels strong and the key loop should never accidently get separated from the clip."
5.0,"I absolutely love these super cute Earrings! I have really sensitive ears, and these do not irritate them at all. They have not tarnished or turned my ears green/black. I barely know they are there."
5.0,Items arrived quickly. It's the same color as the pictures!
5.0,one of the best purchases. It's nicer than pictures show. fits as expected. so comfortable. I could wear it everyday!
5.0,Too Cute..I love this outfit on my daughter. I knew it was cute when I ordered it but seeing it on my baby I wasn't ready for the cuteness overload..
5.0,It was well made and looked great but did not fit her body shape.
5.0,"nice product , great quality , i am very please"
5.0,Great product; comfortable; true to size shown; excellent price; FAST DELIVERY!!
5.0,Alittle too short for me. They do fall down a bit but I‚Äôm pleased with material and quality.
5.0,Order received was not ‚Äúdouble print‚Äù.  Slip resistant surface only on one side.<br />Previous orders were double print and were thicker material.
5.0,"FERDA!!! It's a great gift, and a pretty steady key ring."
5.0,my dog lost it but it was very nice I will be getting another one soon
5.0,"nice fit, very soft, and good quality"
5.0,I've had these for a year now and I still love them. The scent was very strong when they first arrived but they've toned down in the last year but still smell lovely. I use them for meditation but they are a comfort to be able to wear as I go about my day.
5.0,I used it almost in shoping and trips
5.0,Pants are true to size and the color looks exactly like the picture. The fabric is thick and hides sweat! Would recommend for working out
5.0,Bought it for my son. He said he likes it
5.0,Love the design. Doesn‚Äôt wear off like other cheaply printed watch bands.
5.0,Yum...right though
5.0,nice fit. They are comfortable to wear all day and rugged enound to handle all types of ground conditions. I would buy again.
5.0,"Comfortable and easy to install. The resin band was leaving a puckered red mark on my wrist, almost like a chemical burn . i' ve had nylon bands in the past, so i bought this. I have big wrists, the old band barely fit. This one still has two holes open. The installation tool made it easy and simple to change. I have been changing watchbands for over 50 years and that was the easiest pin change I've EVER done ( I usually have to search for at least one pin on the floor after it pops free and flys away.)"
5.0,These shoes are SEXY. I love them! Absolutely ADORE them. Payless BRASH is the only brand of shoes that i truly love and for the most part own!
5.0,"These socks are AMAZING. I was not sure these would work and was just skeptical about  socks being tight enough where it will make your feet not hurt. Let me tell you, I work 12 hours in a hospital and my feet do.not.hurt.at.All. I was looking for some type of relief cause when I started working I could barely stand an hour without being in pain and now going 12 w/o batting and eye. Yea get this. Oh and the good for blood flow and not getting clots so there‚Äôs tht too"
5.0,"This hat was affordable, shipped quickly, looked amazing and will be used as a church and/or Derby hat. Very pleased."
5.0,"Love it! The lace is not at all scratchy, very soft! Material is sturdy and looks just like the photo. Came in great packaging! Shipping was on time. The fit is what I expected, fantastic! It's a little loose around the waist, which is fine with me, I've got a little chub so it's perfect. I'm 5'2 and 154lb. 34D. I love this dress!"
5.0,Works great and I like the design
5.0,"As in my other review, I love this style of tie and this different brand is another great find on Amazon.<br /><br />Dark navy, almost black under certain light, this goes well with various suits, shirts, casual wear, etc. Just the right length for my 5'5&#34; frame, skinny but not pencil thin, and feels well made, if a little &#34;polyester-slippery&#34;. Nice touch is the satin/soft liner on the part of the tie that fits under your collar so the tie can be done up easily & slide on the shirt instead of getting caught."
5.0,Love it and so do other people's  who have seen it just hope it doesn't  turn
5.0,sleek and cute
5.0,perfect. i love it
5.0,This dress is beautiful. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it. It's a heavy-ish material - scuba like - but not too hot. I wear it with leggings or skinny pants and the silhouette is great.
5.0,This ring is great. I have enjoyed it so much that I can foresee ordering a couple more to have on hand.
5.0,These are so soft and comfortable the quality is really really good<br />seems everything that is a complaint with others  was the opposite for me these pants were perfect :-) I have to have another pair
5.0,Bought it for my sister and she loves all the ones she owns.  We will buy more.

5.0,Our daughter is wanting to go to Disney world. These are for her birthday.  I can‚Äôt wait to give them to her!!!
5.0,"I absolutely love these socks!  I purchased them at a great discount and I can't believe how well made and cute that they are.  The only problem I can see arising from these socks is that they are very big.  I completely understand trying to get a sock a one size fits all but they are extra roomy.  I wear a size 9 1/2 to 10 and they were big on me.  Therefore, if I would have purchased these for my daughter who wears a size 7 - there's no way she could have made them wearable."
5.0,love these buying more fit great
5.0,They provide great support for long periods of standing.
5.0,Plenty of room for phone.  Lots of pockets and card slots.
5.0,"UPDATE: I have knocked 2 stars off my review because they broke 2 months later :( They were super comfortable and cute, but not for the long run.<br /><br />Super cute glasses, I get tons of compliments. Gave up on expensive glasses after my 2.5 year old broke my guccis :( These make me feel fancy as well and are a fraction of the cost. If you wear them for a longer period of time, you will have pain behind your ears though"
5.0,"Love this,<br />It‚Äôs structured and doesn‚Äôt show my nipples. I wear 34 D/DD and size xs tops. The Medium size was perfect for sleeping or working out. Good coverage and keeps the girls put."
5.0,"Order came on time.  the packaging was impressive compared to how things usually arrive packaged from them (amazon). I love the way they catch the light and sparkle. They're absolutely breath taking. I love how easily the stainless steel polishes up so bright after they've been cleaned and dried.<br />All the stones are intact, the settings are all straight and snug. The setting is large enough to catch the eye without looking too big, gawdy and fake. I will absolutely recommend this set to anyone looking to buy inexpensive wedding rings with an expensive look and quality."
5.0,Love it goes with my dress perfect.
5.0,"I have expensive progressive lenses in my prescription glasses that cost about $1000. They make small characters visible and readable as they should. The surprise is that these cheap glasses (with the 2.5x magnification) work nearly as well.<br /><br />They work so well, that I'll take these on bicycle rides and outdoor activities and leave those expensive glasses on my desk."
5.0,I loved these they were so cute when my son fit in them. Note..they are moccasins so they are not cold or rainy weather shoes--but they are perfect t for everything else
5.0,"These socks fit great, they don‚Äôt slip off. Perfect to wear with Vans and Ked shoes."
5.0,I loved this- it was perfect for my Medusa Halloween costume! It shipped quickly and was exactly what I wanted. Thanks so much!
5.0,Hold most of my groceries with1 bag. I keep one in the car in case of one of those emergency grocery runs we have at least once a week!
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous on. I used the size chart given and I should have ordered a size smaller. Even so, it‚Äôs beautiful. Also it‚Äôs longer than I expected which was nice."
5.0,"Okay so I loveeeee these. When I opened the package it looked so small but the length def stretches. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 130 pounds and I got a size small. They are flattering, fit my length.. the scrunch feeling reminds me a little bit of a thong but if you‚Äôre used to thongs then you‚Äôll be fine.<br />I would recommend!"
5.0,Perfect the color is just what I needed
5.0,After my first case(included with purchase from sunglass hut)ripped(after 2 years) I was pretty upset as this case has helped keep my sunglasses looking like new. I ordered this one and so far it is doing a great job of keeping my glasses in excellent condition.
5.0,Love the comments I receive when wearing!
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this Dooney bag!  I have wanted a Dooney and Bourke handbag for such a long time and I got this one for Christmas.  I truly love the color...it is not as dark as a navy, but not a bright blue either!  I love the color, it goes with almost everything.  The leather feels just wonderful and has gotten even better since I have put some wear into the bag.  There is plenty of room inside, with ample amount of pockets."
5.0,So cute for summer time! It looks great on everyone
5.0,I bought these for my grandson that isn't born yet (April 2019) but they're adorable and they seem to be well made. Would buy again..

This dress's value and style are the REAL DEAL!"
5.0,Excellent watch. Still working and looking great 10 yr. later!
5.0,Really pleased with the quality of this band. The neat thing is that it has a built in lever to pull the pin back to put the bank on your watch. It also comes with two bands if you happen to have thick wrists. I just ordered 2 more for spares. Best bands I have found and the price is great!!!
5.0,Nice quality. Arrived on time and just as described.

5.0,Love the top! Definitely runs small. But love the shirt. Thank

5.0,I got this to carry around at Disney for a week. It was perfect!!
5.0,This is a very cute watchband.  It states that it is leather but I knew it couldn't be for that price.  I have really enjoyed wearing it and have had a lot of compliments on the band.
5.0,"I‚Äôm so happy with this purchase. Im a full figured curvaceous gurl and this dress is very flattering, not to tight or frumpy. It‚Äôs just right.  I ordered the cram and blac, which turned out to actually be navy and cream, but I‚Äôm keeping it hunty."
5.0,"I wear a 36‚Äù waist which in US is size L normally, ordered a size XL, fit perfectly.  Good material good pattern.  Worth the money."

5.0,Was a gift and he loved it!
5.0,"So far, so good.  I bought these glasses because I needed dark lensed glasses to use after I have my eyes dilated.  I think the darker ones will work for that."
5.0,They make me super happy
5.0,"So many repair/construction/installer/delivery people (hauling in things to my new home) have stopped dead as they have stepped into the foyer, gawked all around, and asked &#34;Gosh, lady...are you a witch?&#34; that all my chums have to leave the area when a new person comes into the place, otherwise laughter would erupt and overtake us all!<br /><br />I guess I do have a rather eclectic collection of stuff from my years of traveling and collecting.  Ah-hem.  Er.  Well...<br /><br />So when these very same friends pointed out a PERFECT bumper sticker on a car in front of us while we were enroute to a concert, I gave good old Amazon a try, and as usual, this site did not disappoint!<br /><br />I bought two of these...nice quality, would work great on a car, but I have one tucked inside a glass-fronted case of articulated skeleton models, and the other stuck on to the fridge in the kitchen.<br /><br />Such fun!  Great addition to the weirdness!"
5.0,"It is nice, much better than my Champions wind breaker"
5.0,"I ran into a dilemma and my first dress wouldn‚Äôt work for a wedding I have tonight. I ordered this and overnighted it, and it arrived 10 hours later.

5.0,"We are hosting a masquerade ball for our reception. This will be my husband's mask. He loves it. The mask allows him to still have his face in pictures; yet, be mysterious at the same time."
5.0,"My present fanny pack which served me for a number of<br />years needed to be replaced due to a broken zipper.<br />It was brought years ago at TOTES which is no longer<br />open and I haven't seen exactly what I wanted in the<br />department stores.  I found exactly what I wanted on<br />Amazon.com with this style of fanny pack which came<br />in different colors. I chose black. It is exactly<br />like my old fanny pack except it is larger with more<br />zipper compartments along with a cell phone compartment<br />which many fannies do not offer. I can carry more if<br />need be. I use the pack every day, under my coat or<br />just strapped around my waist. It is so convenient.<br />No purse to carry and with the fanny pack I have<br />hands free shopping. Very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />Thanks amazon for this product!!"
5.0,"It is my favorite sweater.  Its a more slim fit, but not tight.  Seperate pockets in the front.  It is made very well and after many washes, the lettering doesn't wear out."
5.0,Looks good and very comfortable.
5.0,Still wearing it and loving it.
5.0,"Great product that came exactly as the picture shows. It is high quality, which I wanted for my daughter's first earrings after the piercing earrings could be removed.  I didn't want her to get an infection that can come with cheap metal and inferior products.  This absolutely fit the bill. They came in a black velvet pouch. Put a big smile on my dog lovin' daughter's face!  Highly recommend."
5.0,"This is a great, low profile pocket clip that holds a lot of cards. It even comes with extra bands for the four corners. I have no doubt that it will last a long time!"
5.0,Fun to wear! Thanks Amazon!
5.0,Super cute with boots!
5.0,Beautiful. I would definitely recommend this purchase. So sparkly. She's not tarnish. Very durable. Lays flat. Does not bother. Excellent product.
5.0,This wallet is made of genuine leather and the quality is amazing! It takes a while for breaking in the leather but it's still great! The slot to use the tab works great but takes a little more push back down to get it to go down all the way.
5.0,"Great product! The red in this picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs a deep, beautiful red."
5.0,These fit great and are so very cute for something so practical. They are feminine and stylish (for a trail shoe). The vendor's packaging was great and they arrived right on time. Very happy!
5.0,"I ended up returning this jacket because it felt too hot for me. If you are looking to stay warm, this is the jacket for you. I liked it, but I get warm easily and was sweating in just a few minutes."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c7ff91fe4a27395924cbd9086334a584]] You will need an undershirt and slip as the material is really thin. It is two pieces. The skirt part has a zipper and the shirt part is Velcro. It‚Äôs not the best quality and the seems were not property bound. They are raw edged seems. So don‚Äôt try and wash it unless you bind those seems. For a simple costume party or event, it‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt know how it would hold up in theatre. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for long term reuse. But for what I needed it worked out fine. The straps were too long so I adjusted them. If you can do any hand stitching you can move those buttons to adjust the straps to the skirt."
5.0,My son put them on his Crocs and everyone loves them!
5.0,Fits like I've owned it for along time. Fits perfectly and good quality
5.0,Very cute. Dressed up my plain dress very well!
5.0,"A lightweight yet warm sweater, perfect for those days they blast the AC at the office."
5.0,"When my granddaughter opened her gift she was so excited, she exclaimed""it's a unicorn ü¶Ñ robe !"""
5.0,It took so long to receive it- I almost gave up but it was worth the wait. Fits as expected. Material is nice and soft and didn't fade or otherwise disintegrated after first wash. Looks cute too.
5.0,"I went a size up (Medium instead of small) as many reviewers suggested. I am 5'4&#34; and 120lbs. It fits well - I probably could have done the small too, but this way I can wear layers and it's a jacket so that seems to be a likely scenario.<br /><br />I bought this for part of my halloween costume, but it is cute so I will wear as a regular jacket. Not very sturdy, but I wasn't expecting much for the price. It has exceeded my expectations."
5.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for my sister. She loved it! It‚Äôs well made and really beautiful! Goes great with casual or even dressy outfits!
5.0,"These are so beautiful!!  However, I wasn't so careful, ordered clip-ons instead of pierced ... but I have a friend who will love these also and I'll order more for me!  :)"
5.0,Love it which it was a little larger
5.0,Really cool got lots off complement
5.0,Soft. Comfortable Attractive. My grandson loves them. Fits as expected
5.0,This is my new favorite shirt. I love the way it hugs my body and accentuates my curves. I am 5'5&#34; and it hits at mid thigh at the longest part and goes up on the sides as high as a few inches below my hip bones. I'm pretty busy and this shirt doesn't pull across my chest at all. The rounded back part is still high enough that it hides my bra. Definitely will buy more in other colors
5.0,It is a great a looking dress
5.0,"I bought this bag to go with my clear shoes and it was perfect! The only thing is, I couldn‚Äôt store my phone in it because my phone is too big. Other than that, it‚Äôs cute and worth the money."
5.0,Super nice. I got these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them. Great quality. They are exactly as pictured
5.0,I love that I was able to put both my sons‚Äô names on one instead of having to make two separate ones!
5.0,Cutest outfit! And fits sooooooo well. The onesie itself isn't the easiest to get on and off but it's not an outfit he wears everyday so it's ok. The jeans fit him so well and stayed on without constant readjusting. The bow tie fit very comfortably and made a good teether too.
5.0,These shoes fit great and provide lots of cushioning!
5.0,I use this bag almost daily.  I can fit my clipboard and all the things I need.  I like the quality of the bag and it's very sturdy.  I highly recommend this item.
5.0,My bf loves this shirt...that's all I can say.
5.0,"These are great, cheap glasses. You will never feel guilt if anything happens to them. We have bought this twice now and they are perfect. Plus, they are really expensive looking and well made. Our girls love them."

5.0,"I love this ring. It's simple, it's classic."
5.0,Very very nice. I‚Äôve gotten lots of compliments. I love the stainless steel chain. Silver turns dark on me and this doesn‚Äôt.
5.0,Nicer looking in person.  Looks great on the corded necklace.
5.0,"This line comes with neutral colors that easily pair with anything. Mine is beige, which is a light color but not at all transparent, even if it is unlined. I could give all stars for that. One size up fits just right. I work at home today so I just wear it straight out from the package, but a bit of iron should be much better. I move around a lot this morning and feel quite comfortable with it.<br /><br />P.S: This item is shipped by Amazon and offers free return as well. I ordered a wrong size before, just proceed a return, got Amazon credit to immediately order another one. Much time is saved on Amazon."
5.0,This dress fit as expected and is very soft.  It is not as short as in picture which is good for me since I purchased for work.  The turtle neck is a little too high for me but can be easily rolled down.
5.0,My grandchild had her first communion and loved this perfect gift!
5.0,Actually this poppy is an emotional piece of history.
5.0,"I am 5'3&#34; 111 lbs. The medium fits perfect! Looks exactly like pictured, fit looks like picture also."

5.0,great and tight fit.
5.0,Absolutely love this jumpsuit! I have both the black/white design and the black/gold design!!! I‚Äôm short and curvy and they are fantastic! Great material and a little long but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm sort. Put on heels and it‚Äôs perfect! I plan to order another!!!

5.0,Love this. Cute and comfy. In get a lot of compliments when I wear this!
5.0,"Im fishing a lot and I constantly get sun burn on my face and neck. This hat solves my problems. Its comfy, protect me from sun, looks pretty good, and it's washable. The face peace is kinda tight but I dont use it anyway. I would recommend it."
5.0,"Haven't switched the bands yet, but the material is exactly like the stock one."
5.0,"These are so much better in quality than I had anticipated! They come with a tool to adjust the size, so if you're smaller these could be used as pants belts or resized for waist belts. I am so happy I found these, they are the perfect, quintessential waist belt. A wardrobe essential. I would give 7 stars if I could."
5.0,Love the look and that it‚Äôs sturdy and chic although it‚Äôs for men. I don‚Äôt like the smell any suggestions for the leather Oder?
5.0,I purchased these as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. They are attractive and  look to fulfill that role very well.
5.0,My mom looks amazing in it. Heels or wedges makes it pop. She is thick and solid around 5‚Äô3 and she fit a large. And it was still swingle but fit in the right spots.
5.0,These Best Friend Key Chains Are Perfect for you and your Bestie! Super cute message included with a heart. Perfect for your key chain and your Best Friend gets one too!  Can't beat the price either.

5.0,Very comfortable üëçüòÉ
5.0,very cute &dainty
5.0,I purchased the bootbra extender to pair with the bootbra as the boots I have are literally thigh high boots and I needed a little extra material.  They work great and are very comfortable.  Would definitely recommend if you need extra fabric.
5.0,It is fit for my as I expected and good tap.
5.0,Very nice item for a good price
5.0,I got these for my husband price was nice and so was his reaction
5.0,I‚Äôve worked underground my entire adult life and the majority of the time your boots are wet on the outside! Since I‚Äôve got this my boots are lasting longer and in turn saves me a bunch of money!! I highly recommend!!
5.0,"Great necklace.  Not sure why I had to fill out the review for a ""toy,"" but this necklace is super great, and unbeatable at the price!"
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  The very first time my wife wore these, a magnet fell off and could not be found. the magnets are tiny and weak.  I do not recommend these. The seller was very gracious in solving my problem.  I very much so recommend buying from this seller."
5.0,"Absolutely awesome. Stretched mine perfectly. I have wide feet, the versatility of this is so perfect."

5.0,"Greg Buckle, love it, I'm wearing it now..."
5.0,"I love this watch! I don't even notice that I'm wearing it! It's a great size and I LOVE the elephant  motif on the face! It's discreet enough to be professional, but fashionable enough to be super fun for any outfit! I have been wearing it for a couple days and I have noticed some color change on the watch band. Other than that, you can't beat the price! I love it! I would buy again!"
5.0,"This product is just what I was looking for!  They are a quality product and keep your glasses from sliding down.  At the same time, they are easily adjusted to make it easy to get your glasses off.  They are a high quality product."
5.0,True to size. I like a loose fit. Beautiful color. Makes me happy when I put it on:)
5.0,Super comfy. washes well doesn't fade.

5.0,"I was little reluctant to order but I am glad I did. It just arrived and it took 10 days to arrive from China. Yes you have to pay 5.99 in shipping but even with that the price isn't bad at all. The top is very beautiful, it looks just like the picture. I noramally wear XS so I ordered XS, but I noticed that the shirt has LX on it.(I guess it must be their size) anyway, I am happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I gave this keychain to a dear friend who has been very helpful to me.  She absolutely loved it.  ""It has my name on it!"" she exclaimed.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought it to be made from real leather.<br /><br />Thank you so much."
5.0,Exactly what I needed for my 9 month old. Great quality and fit!!
5.0,I love the buttery soft fabric. I use it when gardening to protect me from the sun and it stays pretty cool.
5.0,The length of these are perfect for small children. and they are super cute and not heavy. I do wish there was a breakaway option just for safety purposes. Otherwise super cute and helpful for kiddos wearing masks.
5.0,"The local Dick's Sporting Good was sold out of the bifold wallet, so I went to Amazon and found exactly what I wanted."
5.0,I was not expecting much when I got this for how cheap it is. I love this band. Super light. No shifting. And super stylish. I‚Äôll be getting more colors in the future

5.0,lightweight and cushioned sole. Caution if you have a  high instep these might be tough to get on fully.
5.0,"Great for breastfeeding, cozy, flattering. I probably could've gone a size smaller, because its super stretchy, but it fit me appropriately (with 34DDDD- yes 4 D's- my nursing bust size)and I got many compliments."
5.0,This is an absolutely adorable dress. I am normally a 10/12. I ordered a large but could have probably gotten away with a medium. It runs just a touch large. Colors are vibrant and the dress is sturdy.
5.0,It's a great coat. The fabric is really soft to the touch. Nice gift!
5.0,Versatile and reliable. I am very glad that I purchased this belt!
5.0,"i love these so much, definitely worth it, fit is perfect"
5.0,"Love the fit, very comfortable. I'm on my feet all day and they didn't hurt once, even tho they were not even broke in yet, plus I love this color in person."
5.0,Very good quality. Very nice.
5.0,I bought these for a parade and they did the job! I got compliments on them but I did end up donating them. They were really cute but not very comfortable. Not a big deal though!
5.0,Feels soft and looks as expected.
5.0,This is the only time I've ever ordered a dress online and had it fit just right. It is fun and elegant at the same time.
5.0,These are gorgeous! Can see very clearly on a sunny day!
5.0,Dress fit Great. Received a lot of compliments. Wore the dress to a wedding reception.
5.0,"That is one of cool classic I have for very good price. The package was time I was waiting for, very secure. I like the way they protected the package. It is  very cool. I do like it very much."
5.0,"Was skeptical at first to order an off brand. I love this set. I ordered a small and bottoms fit great and too fits as expected. I have a larger chest, but the small top holds them in nicely. The material makes it I don‚Äôt have to wear a bra. Just have some good cleavage showing. This is a cute errand outfit or relax in. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it to the gym. It‚Äôs ribbed and tight and stretchy. Highly recommend."
5.0,11/10 that is all I can say! I‚Äôm 140lbs 5‚Äô9 and got a small! Perfect fit!
5.0,"I love this because I can store my IPhone 5 in the zippered pouch with an otter box case on it. It holds a lipstick or Chapstick and all cards, money, etc. I can't expect anymore for the cost. Love it!"
5.0,"This is very nice, fits my frame perfectly except I had to cut out the center ring - hated to do that on a new item. Seems sturdy - remains to be seen how long it lasts in the AZ desert sun. For the price I'll be happy if it lasts a year or two. Pretty color."
5.0,"Really cool masks!! The lights have different setting and can flash different speeds. Does not come with batteries, takes 2 AA great for Halloween costume!"
5.0,Perfect leggings/yoga pants. High waisted and super soft. Fits great. Hard to choose which pattern/color to get next.
5.0,Three months after purchase and the band is still holding up. Looks just like the real thing
5.0,Beautiful.  Colorful and whimsical.  Great buy.
5.0,They look kinda funny on me but they work.
5.0,"Looks good, not cheap, you can adjust it to any size wrist. I recommend it"
5.0,I love these!  I use them to build animatronics and other similar devices.
5.0,You don't want to find out you need these and don't have them. You buy these based on your age and you may never find out if you needed them or not. It's better to be safe than sorry. I'm 50 now and I don't know when edema could show up and I don't want to know. I wore these on a flight from Toronto to Helsinki and back and I'm still alive and didn't get edema. A word of warning for newbies. Don't try and put these on after you board the plane unless you're a yogi. It takes some strength to get these on.
5.0,"Really sturdy boot. I would wear them hiking all the time and wouldn't get any blisters. I've worn them more than 100 hours, but they are still in great condition."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, the style, stretch, bright colors are exact and the material feel soft and comfortable. I am 5‚Äô7 and 185 wore it to church and got so many compliments. I look forward to ordering every color. Love Love this dress!!"
5.0,Love the blanket and it is great they sent me the wrong color though.
5.0,Perfect quality sweater! So cute and cozy!
5.0,Like the style and value for the money.
5.0,This beats notched belts when you are losing weight.  As you drop weight you just move it one click at a time. Eat to much back it out one notch. Feels comfortable and holds nice.
5.0,BEST HOODIE EVER. Incredibly soft and the hood is nice and big. Super soft inside and pocket lining. Not super heavy yet incredibly warm. When I need another i'm definitely ordering one of these!
5.0,I love this bag! It is versatile and there are so many hidden compartments and pockets. I can wear it like a backpack one day. With comfortable straps I may add. I can carry it as a duffle bag another. It folds down to the size of a Frisbee for easy travel. It works and it's exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Family beach gathering all ages, men and women, It was a fun gift made everyone wear it. I wore mine for over a month and brought the beach ocean and the memory back with me."
5.0,I used for my child she loves it wears it to school.
5.0,These earrings are so pretty!  I absolutely love them!
5.0,My husband really likes this watch. Great product for the price!
5.0,"Zip is a little stiff on both of them.  Most likely due to being new.  Great shoes, awesome color and quite comfortable for the money paid."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and it is Long( hangs to my ankles with flats on) . But looks great on! The hood really makes it look cute!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:d20adc6277e8b24c0544489335aa91af]] I love how adjustable these bands are.
5.0,Exactly what I need post knee replacement and as a former nurse. Great toe box and easier to put on and take off.  Will be using these for years to come!
5.0,"I love Dr Martens boots. The Persephone ankle boot is no exception. I cannot wear heels, but these boots have the stability I need while still looking hot as hell. These boots are heavy, so expect a good work out the first few times you wear them. I normally wear a 8.5W, and I‚Äôve always found Dr Martens to be very accommodating for wide feet."
5.0,"I bought these boots for my 8 year old daughter. I wasn't quite sure about the design since I thought perhaps in a really hard rainstorm, water may get into the boots through the gaps at the top. She has yet to use it in those weather conditions so I'll reserve judgement. Fit seems good and there's room to grow so the sizing seems typical for a young girl who is moving from size 2 to 3."
5.0,This is the second batch for me. Won't use anything else on my precious stuff!
5.0,"Perfect fit and perfect product. In fact, I ordered another package of 3 (different colors!) because I like them so much. I'm a big guy (275lb body builder style body) and ordered the 3XL (normally wear 2XL) because I like it loose when I work out. It was not blowsy and actually looked good."
5.0,"Yes, love them!"
5.0,Looks well fits well.
5.0,"Extremely cool find. Had these tailored on to a brand new Navy Blazer for summer.<br />Only thing is the front buttons are perhaps half a cm larger than normal blazer buttons, which might bother some."
5.0,"My teenage niece loves this necklace, I got it for her for christmas and she wears it all the time!  Put a new chain on to spruce it up a bit."
5.0,"This is a good quality and really scary mask! My husband put it on and went to trick or treat with my daughter, and really scared even adult. We had fun!"
5.0,Great material and beautiful design. Great for summer work environment. I got several compliments.
5.0,VERY NICE WITH EVERYTHING YOU WEAR
5.0,This is a really nice dress. It‚Äôs exactly as the picture shows. It fit really well and looked great. Very happy!
5.0,"beautiful dress. Fits great and accentuates curves. My height is 5 foot (short) and this dress required hemming about 4-6 inches to avoid tripping on it (but for my height, almost all dresses/clothing need to be hemmed). My husband said it looked great on me. Worn for a &#34;vampire&#34;/gothic themed formal dance."
5.0,"Fits very well, I didn‚Äôt experience the skin irritation issues."
5.0,Very comfortable and so cute! I will be ordering in other colors. The pink is very bright! Easy to get on and off.
5.0,"Las tallas son exactas, soy L, ped√≠ una L y me qued√≥ perfecta, lleg√≥ a tiempo y tiene buena calidad"
5.0,Cute and soft. Fits as expected
5.0,"Love the large size, colors were great, fabric is great!"
5.0,"BEAUTIFUL, LOOK AND WORK AS EXPECTED"
5.0,Solid workout gear.
5.0,Gave these shirts to my daughter and granddaughter.  They loved them!!!
5.0,"Although, the baby is not big enough to wear this yet, It looks like its true to size."
5.0,"I LOVE my earrings!! they came quickly and were exactly what I expected. And as a bonus, they were neatly packaged in a cute little box! I will definitely be doing business again with them."
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for.<br />The leather is great quality and my belt came with a lovely hand written note.<br />  I am already planning on ordering more for my family members.<br />Thanks again love it
5.0,I have to stand on a concrete floor each day and the socks really help my feet.The compression socks are very comfortable to wear. I like that the socks are black because I can wear them with many different pants.
5.0,I love the design. Not recommended for petite women. I like it enough to get it tailored.
5.0,Calidad excelente.
5.0,"Omg , this dress is super cute . Good Quality material and its sooooo beautiful."
5.0,Perfect wallet with just enough slots I was tired of the over stuffed traditional wallet this was a gift from my Queen who had to tote my old one in her purse. Love it!!
5.0,"Perfect! Love the cut, the material and the fit. A+"
5.0,"I usually wear an XL but ordered a M and it's great. It's so roomy that you can't go wrong. I had no trouble getting into it, as some reviewers did, despite my ample booty. If you do have trouble, I would recommend stepping into it with the strap in front, then pull the strap over your head once it's up on the body. No need to cut it. Going to the bathroom is tricky, but that's to be expected with a romper."
5.0,I loved it!! I wish they had one in a key chain form. But this was still perfect!
5.0,It came fast and was just as expected.
5.0,"These were nice quality, but the sizing to me was way too small. Nice price.But unfortunately  I sent them back."
5.0,Who knew Happy Socks made a No Show!?!? How cute and fun. My boys loved them. True Happy Sock quality!
5.0,Nice denim dress
5.0,Fit my granddaughter perfectly!!!
5.0,Summer cool üòé dress for Arizona!
5.0,It is perfect on my daughter. She wears a 4T. I was leery on which size to get but I went for the 2-4. Good choice. It's beautiful!
5.0,Excellent product as advertised very comfortable
5.0,Great scrub cap! I have 2 and will definitely buy more as needed
5.0,"Good looking wallet, feels nice and well made."
5.0,Nice bag. It's HUGE though. Not duffle gym bag sized.
5.0,"I've worn my previous pair so much that I wore them out!<br />Definitely makes a difference, especially when worn over another pair of regular socks."
5.0,"The material is light and good quality, almost a polished cotton.  Garment is well made.  Short-sleeved, which I want for summer.  It is long enough to reach my ankles, so it looks graceful on.  Very comfortable to lounge in now that the warmer days are here.  A reasonable price besides."
5.0,This wallet is all I expected it to be<br />The zipper works very well<br />The inside card holders are perfect tightness<br />There is plenty of room on both sides for dollar bills to be placed open and flat<br />Bills on one side and receipts on the other side<br />I am getting another one for down the road when this one wears out
5.0,"Wearing this, I feel safe and my glasses do not fog.  When I do not have to wear it, it is an attractive neck covering and at the ready for when I do.  I keep one handy for my morning walks.  Again, I can exercise safely and still breathe!"
5.0,So incredibly beautiful!  I bought one for my mom and one for myself. The light reflects off them and they are gorgeous. No one knows they‚Äôre CZ!<br /><br />I‚Äôd buy again
5.0,Me encanta;para cualquier ocasi√≥n
5.0,"I am tall and slim. Shorts that normal people wear make me look like I am playing for the NBA in 1978.  These are great.  They fit perfect, and fall just below my knee.  There is a little elastic in the waist, but not too much, and the pockets are deep enough.  I am very satisfied and actually just came here to order another pair.  I thought I would write a review while I was at it."
5.0,"I'm 5'2"" 125lbs I wear a 7 and got a 7 they fit great and you can unroll the bottoms too love them for sure"
5.0,I love it....get alot of attention & complements whenever I wear it....
5.0,Fits & look fantastic. Launders very well. Almost wrinkle proof! Would purchase again & again.
5.0,The dress looks amazing.  Fits like a glove when you order the proper size.  Shows off your figure well. Perfect for a hourglass figure.
5.0,I love this sweater.  It fits perfect.
5.0,"It‚Äôs very good case, I like it"
5.0,Got this for my hubs just as a little gift to let him know I'm always thinking of him. it was cheap and just something to say I love you. Good quality. No issues.
5.0,I adore this dress. I usually wear large but decided on the medium cause I read reviews saying it‚Äôs long and I‚Äôm glad I did! Stretchy enough to fit comfortably. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 160lbs for reference
5.0,"This watch. It tells time. It's water-resistant. It even tells you the day. The battery life is great. For only $5-ish dollars, you too can own this simple watch. 10/10, would buy again."
5.0,My husband loved it. It was perfect.
5.0,"I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH CREATIVE HAIR PIECES AND FASCINATORS NOW. SINCE I HAVE DISCOVERED THEM, I HAVE TRIED AS MANY AS POSSIBLY AND I THINK THIS ONE IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED ONE THAT I HAVE BOUGHT YET. IT IS LARGE, CAME BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED, AND IS GORGEOUS. IT FITS WELL IN THE HAIR AND SITS NICELY. I AM SO GLAD I STEPPED INTO THIS WORLD OF ELEGANCE AND FOUND THIS EXPERT QUALITY HEADPIECE FROM FAYBOX!<br /><br />SHIPPING WAS FAST ENOUGH AND THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN AND I HOPE IT HELPS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT!.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34; below where it says &#34;Was this review helpful to you?&#34;"
5.0,"Love this! I was a bit skeptical of what to expect after reading reviews about sizing and quality. This is beyond my expectations. For a low cost swim suit, this is perfect. It's very cute and well made. I am 5'3&#34; 135lbs I normally wear small to medium so I took the chance and ordered a medium size. After 2 babies, it's hard to find a swim suit to compliment my new body. This one fits perfect!!"
5.0,"I went with a large, because I don't like tight clingy clothes to sleep in. So its a little baggy and loose. Super comfy, and cute."
5.0,"This fit and very comfortable, I love it."
5.0,It's everything I was looking for. Lots of compartments and made out of materials that are durable.
5.0,Awesome hats I wear it everyday and they are super comfortable
5.0,"I rated this a 5 Star because of the quality of the product, and the fact that the sellers are a family ran business.  I would make a couple small recommendations:<br />- Make one of the pouches slightly larger to fit my REDLINE 5620 310 LUMEN 4X ZOOM TITANIUM.<br />- The clips on the small pouches don't seem to clip as secure as the front large buckle.<br /><br />Besides that, I'm hoping this works well this Hunting Season."
5.0,My son loves his gift!  An excellent buy!
5.0,Grate value for your money
5.0,Looks great with jeans! Lots of compliments!
5.0,I just received my package less than 30min ago and couldn‚Äôt wait to put it on. It looks great. And much better picture quality than had been described before. Has a soft texture to the band material. So far I love it!
5.0,"Fit great, Love the pockets.  Very Comfortable  Love the high waist."
5.0,"I got this in a size XL in the light pink and when I first put in on I was surprised how flattering it was despite its light color. This isn't quite off-shoulder but it is breezier which is exactly what I want during Summer. The fabric is excellent quality-it is thicker-but quality thick, not smothering hot. It's very sophisticated looking and is a pretty look for Summer or Fall."
5.0,These are not easy to find in the stores. I was very happy when I found them on Amazon. I normally wear an XL in Women's shirts and such. . Ordered the XL and they were a true fit for me. Loved the fit and feel and the variety of colors. Felt like it was a good deal.
5.0,Adorable and cozy! My daughter absolutely loves her Bunny robe.
5.0,"Fabric is soft, pockets are perfect.  Neckline is adjustable.  Perfect for a new mom who hasn‚Äôt gotten her belly back.  Feels comfy, flirty, and relaxed. Perfect for traveling.  Barely wrinkles!!!"
5.0,"My son is in Kindergarten and he has trouble keeping his laces tied, especially at school. These slip on easily and are comfortable. They are very light weight which I like because they seem more ""grown up"" to him than the clunky Velcro shoes I bought before."
5.0,"My secret santa loved it!!  It took a whle to get to me, but once it did, it was just what I had hoped for."
5.0,My kids call it my Ms. Frizzle dress (The Magic School Bus).  More stretch than I was expecting but very comfy and reasonably priced.
5.0,"As a healthcare caregiver, this product allows me to wear it all day without the feeling of not being able to breathe. It is very lightweight compared to others I've tried. Although it did take more time than expected to receive it."
5.0,"Great feel,price,and look. Fast shipping ordered on Friday arrived 1pm Sunday"
5.0,"I love these shirts. I sunburn easily, plus I had radiation for breast cancer, so I need all the sun protection I can get. The shirt was a very pretty blue, fit me well and keeps me from being sunburned when I am out fishing, playing watersports with my dog, or doing yard work."
5.0,perfect small purse! good storage. I got this when I injured my back and had to keep my purse weight down.
5.0,"This bracelet is perfect size , adjustable and sturdy. This is not my first time ordering from this jewelry store , I have ordered a evil eye for a family member and it‚Äôs been a year the bracelet is still in the same great condition. Will definitely order more pieces by Leslie."
5.0,"Because of the reviews I thought this luggage set was going to break easily. Well, it turns out it resisted 2 bus rides of 5hrs each, 2 trips to Maryland of 5hrs each and I overstuffed the pJesus out of the biggest wallet. I would say they can take a look and are flexible. I know people here complain about the quality but this is so worth my investment. They are a good solutions if you need something fast and reliable at a low price."
5.0,"100% Authentic. I was initially concerned because finding them at this price is nearly impossible. Wonderful glasses, incredibly light, well made (even the end caps on the end of the arms that go behind the ears are titanium instead of plastic) about the size of a medium Ray ban aviator."
5.0,It stays on my head when sleeping and is just what I was looking for.
5.0,My daughter uses this necklace as a breathing tool. It looks pretty and it‚Äôs way better than her biting her nails off
5.0,i‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and about 120lbs and 32b. this suit makes me feel fierce after fluctuating in weight from kids and traumatic life experiences over the last nine years. it‚Äôs edgy but still has good coverage. definitely a great suit for the ol‚Äô mom bod.
5.0,These pants are very soft and look really good on the hubby.  It was a great purchase and he was excited to have them.  He is such a Gas Monkey fan.
5.0,Nice blouse. Shiny fabric.
5.0,Luv...luv...luv!
5.0,"Great watch for the price. I gave my cousin who was fighting cancer and she loved it, but sad to say she died like 3 months later and her daughter has it cause it meant so much to her mom."
5.0,"Loooooove these pants, I would buy them in more colors if they had them."
5.0,"large fit well for me, i usually wear a 34 dd or ddd, has removable cups"
5.0,My favorite shorts for the Summer. Love the pockets and material. Size small.
5.0,Super comfy! Perfect fit!
5.0,"Pregnant daughter loves this, would buy this again in other colours. It's lengthy so it's been able to grow with her pregnant belly, which she loves."
5.0,"Love Bolo bracelets and this is one of the best Ive purchased so far. Good quality, stays on well, Ive purchased 3 in different colors."
5.0,Great top. Very festive!
5.0,Fits really well. Very comfortable!
5.0,I picked this up for a friend who loves HI and she loved it!
5.0,These pajamas are PERFECT! My 4 year old is obsessed with Bluey so these pajamas naturally made sense. They were a perfect fit - they fit his size without being too tight and they have enough room for him to grow a little. Arrived on time. The colors were bright. And he loves them. Highly recommend!
5.0,Love this dress I get so many compliments when I wear it.
5.0,"I use these when working with my UV resin. They definitely protect my eyes. I had started to get headaches after using my curing lamp for long periods. I decided to try UV protection glasses, and these are perfect. Lightweight, and fits over my prescription glasses. No more headaches!"
5.0,I've had this band for months and wear it everyday and it is great. Good quality good feel.
5.0,love this chain.
5.0,Love this!! Buy it!!! Kinda short but who cares lol
5.0,Great price for beautiful bracelets.
5.0,Right size  right colour
5.0,The headline about covers it.  They don't keep my feet warm at all.  it's not the soft knit I was going for.  it's kind of like that loose-knit but the fibers aren't soft.  I'm going to have to spring for the merino wool socks.
5.0,I love it!! Looks great when you are dressing up a bit more than casual but you can actually wear it with everything!
5.0,Cheap watch but if you're not doing hard labor it is perfect
5.0,Santa brought this to my husband! Cute and affordable
5.0,Great flannel
5.0,Comfortable and durable material.
5.0,I love the color of this ring. It looks beautiful gold
5.0,love<br />it
5.0,These are very nice and pretty.  Good quality!
5.0,Love the fact that I can put a lot of things in it.
5.0,I love these enamel charms. They look great in the jewelry I make. They seem to be of very good quality and I received a good number and good variety for the price. They seem to be holding up well when worn as well. Will purchase more.
5.0,"I had the opportunity to review this set of Primesons 18K White Gold-Plated Cubic Zirconia Swarovski Hoop Earrings.  When they arrived, I was quite surprised at their quality for being costume type jewelry. The metal is polished to a shine.  The post is plenty long to be able to get the into the lobe and to clasp them shut.  Be careful not to bend the posts because if you do they will not close properly.  My wife wore them for an entire day and the clasps did not come open but as she took one off, she bent the post slightly and had to bend it slightly back into the correct place to keep it clasped.<br />The cut of the ‚Äústones‚Äù catches the light.  You can tell by the deep green of the middle stone, that these are lab created.  Most real Emeralds are a lighter green.  I have seen much more expensive earrings with simulated stones, and this set beat most of them in color and quality.  The smaller halo ‚Äústones‚Äù are big enough to catch the light.<br />My wife suffers from some metal allergies. Yet these earrings did not cause any reaction on her skin. Nor did they make her lobe sore or itch.<br />Overall for their price point, these are a very pretty pair of costume jewelry earrings.  The look beautiful on and my wife will get lots of use out of these earrings."
5.0,looks very realistic and is a perfect addition to my hand........
5.0,Son para m√≠ hija y le gustaron por c√≥modos
5.0,"Good product, good price and delivery"
5.0,"I worked as a manager in a jewelry store for ten years, I sold Rolex, Mavado, Tag Huer, Seiko, Pulsar and most every brand out there. For the money and as a good inexpensive gift this watch would get a 10 rating for durability, size, colors, weight( this watch does not feel or look like a dime store watch. The band is very durable and stylish, the crystal seems or feels like a sapphire crystal, the hands are appropriate in size and easy to read. I wear it everyday and everything looks like the day I got it. Would make a great graduation, birthday or any occasion gift for the man in your life."
5.0,Very badass looking watch...I love it!!!
5.0,This is a medium size sun umbrella that folds to a small size.  It's perfect for one person.  The materials seem to be of good quality.<br />So far I have had no problems with the umbrella and it handles light winds just fine.  The umbrella has a solid feel and mechanically works smoothly.<br />Like every umbrella you have to use common sense when using it.  If you need to keep the blazing sun off you body this umbrella works just fine.<br />The plastic handle has a nice feel to it and is easy use.
5.0,"This is an adorable apron - I love the cute design of the dogs on it.  The material is lightweight (so it won't weigh you down) but it is also absorbent.  I love my aprons to have pockets, and this one does have two nice sized pockets."
5.0,favorite umbrella ever.
5.0,"its okay, not 100 percent perfect but I Love the design and the color"
5.0,"It is a good and accurate watch.  It is my second Seiko solar.  I would recommend Seiko solar watches to anyone.  They are moderately priced, reliable and good looking.  This particular one is fairly heavy and somewhat thick.  My other is the opposite.  I can easily buy two Seiko's for the price of many other brands.  I have not tested the duration of the charge but have never had either of my solar watches stop."
5.0,"Our granddaughter loves them. If anything, they run a little larger than other size 10s so they are a bit big yet, so she trips up on the some one side walks where two concrete pieces meet.  She is 2 and a half and puts them on herself. She‚Äôll sleep in them if we let her."
5.0,Nothing wrong with this shirt at all. Looks good and feels good on me
5.0,"I've got a bit of a dad bod and I was looking for a t-shirt that fit well without looking like I was wearing a dress.<br /><br />This was a random buy, but it fits the bill perfectly! The shirt fits great, looks extremely well balanced, is very soft, and extremely durable. I am very pleased and will be purchasing more from this brand in the future.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
5.0,Very classy piece!!!
5.0,"First hat I bought since getting out of the army in 68. Glad I bought this one, color and size is just right."
5.0,"Love this bra, comfort and sexy all in one."
5.0,"Product arrived on time and I could not be more pleased.  It seems to be well made with no loose threads and the fit is perfect.  After looking at the size chart I went the large in the light gray and it fits my 6', 230 pound frame.  Zippers all work nice and smooth and it is great to have the security of zippered pockets.  I have had other vests where the zippers were cheap plastic and never worked very well.  Great product for the price!"
5.0,Beautiful! Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,These are a European style cut and are fitted more around the thighs. If you have larger thighs than usual you might want to go a size up. I got these for my brother who likes to be trendy and he really liked them.
5.0,I wear it on my left lapel on a daily basis.
5.0,Good quality arrived on time for gatsby themed party
5.0,"These gloves are great! They fit your hand nicely! I use them for so many things, especially in the kitchen."
5.0,"I love this dress. It packs/travels great. Get lots of compliments on it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 & 135lbs - small chest - fits great, doesn‚Äôt sag around armpits, not too tight or loose, it‚Äôs just right. Usually have trouble getting ‚Äúlong‚Äù dresses long enough, but not with this. I bought another"
5.0,Very pretty with the coordinating necklace and ring.

With the amount of stuff that I put in it I would‚Äôve thought it would fall apart by now but it‚Äôs extremely sturdy and fits a lot in it including cards, bills, change, and even pens or other small things you might need to carry with you.

5.0,"I got this bag as a smaller option to carry my EDC stuff on my commute to work on my motorcycle. I have a trunk but wanted something smaller than the regular size backpack Ive been using.<br /><br />When I got the bag today I packed it with spare tshirt, over the ear headphones in case, small carry case with misc charging cords and plugs, flashlight, pen, Swiss army knife, spare 1911 mag, and a few other small items. All of this fits well and I still have plenty of room to spare.<br /><br />I tried a few different guns in the concealment pocket and found that the pocket holds a 5inch 1911 w/light pretty well. It was a tad visible but probably not enough to worry if the bag was being worn. This will depend on your body type and clothing choices. I also tried a full size Glock w/light and found it was more visible than the 1911. To be fair mine does have a remolded grip with magwell so a standard model would be a bit better or taking off the light as I have the Surefire X300 which sticks out pretty good. A subcompact Glock fit very well and could fit inside the pocket in most holsters. I didn't try anything smaller than that as it is obviously going to fit. I did also slide a 4in 357 as a test and found it was much to big and stuck out the top a good amount, to much for my liking.<br /><br />The bag itself is very nice, especially when you consider the price. The material is very nice and feels sturdy. The interior dividers feel a little cheaper but they certainly seem up to the task at hand. The zippers are extremely smooth and the pulls and cords feel of a good quality to the touch.<br /><br />I think the bag is just what I was looking for and gives me a much smaller bag to pack on my bike and free up a lot of space for me while letting me carry what I want."
5.0,Great fit! Warm and cozy!
5.0,"My grandson was thrilled with his watch, especially as it was just like his big brothers."

5.0,I had seen the Vertical Frontier previously to purchasing this DVD and wanted to watch it again.  Being a non-climber but having climbing friends I found it fascinating and have a little more insight into the climber's passion.  I also enjoyed a bit of history of Yosemite too.

5.0,Very attractive necklace and my co-workers loved it.

5.0,"I don't think the picture does it justice. It looks really simple but when you put it on, its the right touch you need to pair it with your maxi dress or cute top/sweater. It fit really well. I'm 5'2 and 140 lbs and my waist is 31 inches. I love it and look forward to wearing this summer.

5.0,"Awesome face jewelry - first time buying a piece like this but it‚Äôs amazing. Adjustable chains for loops that go around the ears. Love the little accent on the chain end, too. Comfortable on my lower lip - not sharp or pinching. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it to my next goth event!"

5.0,"Very nice chain, looks great on my son."
5.0,"These earrings were perfect.  They look amazing and are of substantial construction.  But the surprising part, they aren't heavy!  They look like you should plan on taking them off at some point during the evening but I was shocked that they didn't bother me at all. I kept them all night!  I am going to have to look for more fancy occasions to wear these!  Great buy!"
5.0,Nothing wrong with this product at all. Looks great and exactly how it's pictured.

5.0,So creepy it's great. Looks much better then expected. Super happy with this. If you're a venom fan this is for you.
5.0,Bought this for my 19 year old son who is in a recovery program for addicts. He loves this bracelet! He adjusted the length so it fits snug against his wrist. It is a beautiful but masculine bracelet. He says it's good to look at if he's having a rough day to know God is with him on his road to recovery.
5.0,"I acquired a 2003 White Malibu which needed some body work only. It had belonged to an elderly lady and it only had 56K miles but I guess God was trying to tell her it was time to stop driving with both exterior mirrors broken, a dented front bumper and other scratches. Anyway, after the repairs were complete I wanted to start dressing it up with nice wheel covers and license plate frames. These are exactly as described. Nice metal and the words are etched onto the metal and not painted or stenciled."
5.0,"Ordered this for a galaxy watch. I did not pay attention to it being one strap that you weave through the pins instead of it coming in two seperate pieces that connect on the ends. Either way, it serves it's purpose. But if you want to use the heartrate monitor, the strap completely covers it. The strap itself feels thick and durable. I am hard on my stuff so I will update if the durability doesn't hold up."
5.0,Bueatifulüòçüòçüòç
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE - ordered another color!

5.0,"This thing is a workhorse. The built-in timer, clear digital face, and resin strap make it a perfect watch to workout in. At this price, you really can't go wrong. Casio is a proven brand with proven quality, and this should be a watch in anyone's collection."
5.0,Love it<br />A little smaller than what I expected. Hard to carry over my shoulder. Next time I'd get a size up. Construction is great.

5.0,"This shirt is exactly as advertised! Perfect fit, well made, looks good & is different from every other fishing shirt out there. I‚Äôve worn this shirt offshore twice & wade fishing once. So far I don‚Äôt have a single complaint & I‚Äôm pretty rough on these shirts."
5.0,This is a very cool watch. Its the perfect size with an easy to read face and a very nice leather band.  Can't say anything bad about it at all.  You will enjoy if you purchase.
5.0,"I love this dress! And plan on ordering more in different colors. Comfy, flattering, super cute and flowy.  True to size and washes well. I washed perm press and tumbled low for a few mins then hung to dry the rest. Wrinkle free!"

5.0,These shoes are so much fun! I have bought my daughter two pairs and she loves them! Lots of compliments!
5.0,This  top is really nice.  I am a bit of a thicker girl and need the stripes to make me look thinner.  This shirt really helps and it provides a flattering look.  I ordered the large size.  I am approximately a size 12 on top and this blouse fits a bit looser which I like  I don't like tight tops that show every bulge. The quality of the fabric and craftsmanship is very good. The spandex in the shirt provides just the right amount of stretch.  The Black cloth on the sides of the shirt are flattering and I love the contrast they provide.<br />I depend on customer reviews just as much as you do!  I pride myself in always providing my honest opinion on the products I purchase and review. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,Fits well and I love the deep navy blue color. Stays in place while swimming.

5.0,Ordered these for groomsmen for wedding & was surprised that they come with free handkerchief ! Which is an awesome deal for $10 usually department stores are expensive when buying these separately. Color matches mint bridesmaids dresses perfectly.
5.0,"I purchased this hoodie for my 7 year-old-son and he absolutely loves it! The design is beautiful, high quality with lovely colors. I ordered a size medium, and it fits great, with a little room to grow, which is important as winter is still on it's way. It's got a front pocket which he loves, he can stash his belongings inside safely. The hoodie is also super soft and just generally feels very well made. My son and I both highly recommend this hoodie for anyone in the market."
5.0,"Great,quick shipping and great product"
5.0,These are great for golf. 90 degrees and everything was dry. I‚Äôm getting another pair.
5.0,"Super adorable necklace. I am happy with the length. Often times a long necklace is still too short but this is actually a longer necklace. It doesn't look too childlike. It is decently made. There were no loose parts or pieces that look like they would immediately brake off. It lays nicely and has enough weight to lay without bouncing all around while moving around. The back is flat and doesn't bother if against skin such as scratchy or anything. Overall it is a very nice necklace. I am very pleased with it. The metals are pretty and the colors of the pineapple are bright. There are little jewels that make it a little more put together and keeping it from looking cheesy. I am very happy with it and expect it will last a good amount of time, it does not appear to look like it will fall apart after a wear or two so I am very excited to rock it through the remainder of summer! I received this product for a discount for my fair and unbiased opinion."

5.0,wonderful confortable boxers
5.0,I love this ring. Super fast delivery.
5.0,Very comfortable üòå happy with my purchase üòä BUT you have to know your size. I ordered it in a 36ddd because some people have said that it runs small. That's why you must KNOW your. SIZE. I had to go through that trouble of returning it and ordering my natural SIZE 36dd. And ‚ù§Ô∏è I love it.
5.0,"Got these on lightning deal sale! Great price. First time I've bought sunglasses without trying on, they are very light and seem to stay up great. Bought to take to beach in place of expensive prescription sunglasses. Will use for driving also. Love the wrap around design to keep sun out from sides and above."
5.0,Great watch! Bought for our 10 year old for special occasions. He loves it!
5.0,Very good and compact
5.0,"I bought it for my daughter, she loves it. Turns nicely"
5.0,"I know we are all tired of the masks. I've tried so many and they are either too hot or lay against my mouth when I talk or breathe. So far, these are the best I've found! They have a good seal around my nose and cheeks and fit below my chin, while not touching my mouth when I talk or breathe. This is a huge selling feature as far as I'm concerned! I like them so well I just placed a second order to give to family members!"
5.0,They are great! Love the color and how they change to sunglasses when there is sun
5.0,"Looks nice, fits nice! It was very hard to find a black Mets cap that wasn't fitted, at a reasonable price. So the price is nice too! Let's go Mets!!"
5.0,Seamless
5.0,Have yet to use these but I tried them on and they are awesome!
5.0,I bought for someone else.
5.0,The glass were a great deal for the price. I would recommend these glasses!!
5.0,The strech felt very good
5.0,"I love this dress. It looked so nice with my new developed tan. It isn‚Äôt super forgiving in the belly area, but I‚Äôm not even that upset since this dress is fantastic every other way."
5.0,"Product description is accurate and photo is an accurate representation of this ring.  It is large and two-tone.  Looks a bit like antique sterling silver.  The white beads appears to be glued in, but done so attractively.  I estimate the ring size to be about a 9, but it is adjustable with a slit-opening in the ring.  I personally think this makes a better scarf ring than a cocktail ring, so I took a photo for you to see it as a scarf ring."
5.0,"Perfectly described, great workmanship and excellent customer service"
5.0,"I bought this for my husband and he is in love with the socks, great material, comfortable an deal size, I need to order more of these"
5.0,I love cut that they've cut down on my migraines!
5.0,Perfect fit! I love the quality and design. The best!
5.0,I love this top! The material is lightweight but not see through. It drapes very nicely. Can be used for a casual or dressy affair.
5.0,This cloth is fantastic to polish up my jewelry after I have cleaned it.  Workable great on my new and antique jewelry items.
5.0,very comfortable and affordable
5.0,I like the colors and everything about it I would recommend it to any body that cooks Thank you
5.0,Product received as described
5.0,Received this promptly and it looks better than I expected.  Beautiful! I love mine
5.0,Out of the package I thought this dress was oddly shaped and would not fit. I was wrong.<br /> This is very comfortable and flattering. It follows my form perfectly without restrictions. I will probably order another in another pattern with long sleeves.<br /> I recommend this dress.
5.0,"Fit like a charm!!! I bought this dress for my Grandma's surprise party and it fit nicely. I added a shaper (which did no justice lol) but overall I was pleased with my dress. It‚Äôs classy, gives you a boost of confidence, and although it didn‚Äôt stay up on my shoulders throughout the night, I still had no complaints. I‚Äôm a shorty 5‚Äô4, around 200lbs and I ordered an XL. I wasn‚Äôt sure how it‚Äôd fit or how short it‚Äôd be looking at it online, but it wasn‚Äôt as short in the front for me."
5.0,They arrived when expected and were an exact match to picture representation!<br />Lots of compliments on them!!!
5.0,Very flattering on
5.0,Pretty but the big hoops are bigger than I thought for my 7 yr old granddaughter but she'll grow into them
5.0,I absolute LOVE my wristlet.  My fiance and I were just looking at the Samsung galaxy S6 and I can't find one exactly like this.  Seriously considering keeping my phone just so I can keep my wristlet.
5.0,"Highly recommend. The shape of the headband and tightness/fit allows the band to stay on the head and not really move. These are surprisingly very absorbent for how thin (and breathable) the material is. The striped one isn‚Äôt my favorite pattern b/c any folds when on your head make the lines kinda disappear, but the color (charcoal) is fantastic."
5.0,"Love Love Love this necklace! Shipping was super fast! I have very sensitive skin & wore this all day no issues.  Soo many compliments on it as well, its lightweight too wish I like I didnt feel like ot was wearing me down. Looks even better in person. Will order more."
5.0,The fit perfectly
5.0,"The pictures don't do them justice!  Build is rock solid.  Finish is much better than average, though a bit of glue overflow is evident at the back of the join.  (Who's looking at the back anyway?)  The brass posts are better than expected."
5.0,"It was absolutely adorable, and my great great niece loved it!"
5.0,Great quality fabric. Will buy more from this place.
5.0,"This is my first time trying to buy earrings on Amazon. Very pleasantly surprised after receiving it. The design is exquisite and elegant, suitable for all occasions. The quality is good and not heavy. The packaging is very suitable for gift giving. Highly recommended!"
5.0,My girl couldn't love w/out them
5.0,Title says it all....nice cheap hat!  Fits my husband well but big on me.  No problem.  I would recommend.
5.0,"Received order on time and it was all of what I expected, no complaints!"
5.0,The straps are so soft they don‚Äôt hurt.
5.0,Took a little while to get here but worth the wait. This is a beautiful set .
5.0,These are comfortable and great. You  can't wear them out.  Cushioned and sturdy. Quick rinse and squeeze they are ready to go.
5.0,"Very nice pendant. Great coloring, beautiful quality. I will be ordering more.  If you make jewelry, these are quality pendants."
5.0,Got tons of compliments!!! does run big though
5.0,Very cute. My niece loved it.
5.0,Just love it in my boy
5.0,Love it ! Love it!
5.0,Loved the material. It as comfortable. Easy to wear. I forgot I was wearing it! There‚Äôs a zipper compartment that helps keep the important things together. Super comfy for travel
5.0,"High quality, considering the price point (could charge 2x the price and still be a great deal). I used to work at Bausch & Lomb, when they owned RayBan - these Clubmasters are every bit as awesome as the original model, and a lot lighter on the face (nose). I'll order Woodie's Wayfarer next to compare. The optics are darker, clarity is pretty good, and scratch resistance (we'll see). Winning deal !"
5.0,"Good price, arrived on time"
5.0,Got these for my 5 & 6 year old. Perfect fit and good quality. (They have to wear masks every day at school) Will be buying more!
5.0,These are gorgeous earrings! they are delicate and stunning! Great for any occasion!
5.0,"My granddaughter loves the dress. I would say it is well maid and true to size,"
5.0,I absolutely love this bag.  So much so I came back and bought 3 more as gifts!
5.0,"These glasses work great! I am in a cleanroom environment 80% of my workday and I have to wear safety glasses throughout that time.  These glasses have a shield that fits the contour of my face which keeps the fog away, (which has been a huge problem for me with other safety glasses).  They do not come with the strings that are shown in the picture though. Also these glasses are on the small side. If you have a petite face/head they will work fine."
5.0,Cute but my button fell off after 1 wash
5.0,Easy to clip on and super cute and dainty. Worn them for months and have no issues
5.0,Exelente perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,So cute and adorable! Great quality.
5.0,"Love it, my chakra,my lucky charm ü•∞"
5.0,Daughter was very happy with this top
5.0,Great band.  I bought it for my wife and she loves it.  It looks great with the rose gold watch and its very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for and alternative to a leather band.
5.0,As expected. I had previously bought one in the wine color. The lace tears real easy. I wanted another wine colored one but it hasn't been in stock. I got tired of waiting so i ordered the blue this time. For the price i can easily replace the dress when the lace parts get torn.
5.0,Exactly as described.  Very cute
5.0,"For someone who loves photography, this is a nice little keychain."
5.0,"Mittens are well made, and the colors and pattern are really fun. Inside has a soft fleece."
5.0,"The skirt is so cute! Hits right at my waist and short, but not too short. It looks so cute with tights and boots!  I personally don't like built in shorts, but they're very easy to remove if you choose. They'd be great if you're not planning to wear tights. I typically wear a us size 4 in pants/skirts and ordered a size large per the size chart. It fits perfectly,  and I imagine I could size up to an xl as well, but I wouldn't go any smaller.<br />This is GREAT for the price. Pleats are sharp, and the fabric is not itchy wool like some other pleated skirts.<br />Feel free to ask me any questions and please give this review a thumbs up if you found it helpful!"
5.0,I got these cubes because I travel quite frequently. They have seriously helped me out so much! They keep things organized and make living out of your suitcase 100% easier!
5.0,"Fits well, thick durable fabric, very cute"
5.0,"These are so comfortable, and they fit perfectly. They stay in place, cover my backside, and I don't get wedged in crevices. For reference, I weigh 112 and ordered the size small."
5.0,Very good quality! I have already washed several times and the color is still vivid .
5.0,"Every time my husband wears this he gets multiple compliments!  It goes with so many different the it's.  I love it.  It's base color is chocolate brown, not black."
5.0,Fit was spot on zipper is a little sticky but ohther than that the dress is prefect .
5.0,perfect gift<br />para mi otra madre .....<br />a la madre de mi esposo le ha gustado  mucho<br /><br />gracias
5.0,"Good for workout, good fit, comfortable.  Order normal size."
5.0,honestly best purchase from amazon by far I recieved lots of compliments about my top . Id buy it again and again great fit too.
5.0,"I ordered 1 pair to see if they were going to help my legs from hurting so bad .  And honestly I was a little skeptical, but the difference that these have been made are outstanding! I'm able to walk my 6 miles again and do my yoga !  It didn't take away all my pain but it's helping me get back to do what I love !! Will buy again!"
5.0,"These socks are exactly what I wanted and needed.  They fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable to wear.. something I had been somewhat concerned about before I ordered them.  Plan on ordering a second pair for myself and a pair for my husband as well.  Oh, they wash beautifully too."
5.0,"super cute!!!!<br /><br />i love this bunny hat, it‚Äôs good quality for the price and is super comfy, 10/10 would recommend &lt;3"
5.0,i just love it!!!!!
5.0,"I have somehow become a bit of a collecter of masks during this crazy time we‚Äôre in. I typically will grab some if they catch my eye, or are on sale, etc. so when I seen this one I knew I had to have it. At such a great price too! Masks like this can be really expensive in the store. I don‚Äôt know if I was too caught up on how it looked to pay attention or what but it also came with filters and I totally missed that part so it was a great surprise. Not only is it gorgeous, it‚Äôs so silky soft, it adjusts easy, it doesn‚Äôt move all over my face when I‚Äôm trying to talk, and the material doesn‚Äôt make me hot or break out. Which I have had a huge problem with. I‚Äôm probably going to just get the other colors now, I mean why not? You can‚Äôt really beat it."
5.0,"I bought several CZ silver bands on Amazon, from cheap to moderately priced and liked this one the best!  Looks the most realistic with great clarity and sparkle in the stones.  Comfortable to wear and a nice match to my engagement ring.  No one can tell it's not real.  Sometimes these CZ bands are too wide and features stones that are too big to be believable.  Can't believe with my expensive taste I picked the least expensive one!  Hopefully it will stay this nice....only time will tell."
5.0,It is not cotton as I had hoped and as it was advertised it is rayon but it is a really comfortable shirt and has a great cut and the colors are wonderful. love the red one
5.0,"I love it,is very pretty .i will be buying more later.i give it 5 star."
5.0,"The dusty pink is more like a true ballet pink, even better than I expected.  I'm 5'8"" and 36C bra and the L is perfect.  I'm back to order more colors!"
5.0,"I was very impressed with the construction of these shorts. The stitching is tight and not a stitch out of place. The waist is a bit loose, but came in just enough with washing & drying. Length and overall fit not affected by laundering. Gives a very polished look. I ordered a couple more colors and will look for them again next summer for more. Highly recommend."
5.0,I love it. It‚Äôs simple and does its job. It‚Äôs perfect for work and when I‚Äôm just running errands.
5.0,"I love it , but I could not get any other color in2.00strength"
5.0,Like Olga design.
5.0,"My daughter picked this hat & it did not disappoint.  She absolutely ""loved it""!<br />She is 11 in age."
5.0,Exactly what I pictured
5.0,"These are excellent clip on sun glasses.  My glass lenses are quite thick near the edges, and many of the clip ons of this type do not fit well on them.  I will be buying a couple more pair.  The  opaque plastic case and cleaning cloth are a nice added bonus."
5.0,"I was so pleased when received this scarf.  The quality is wonderful, and the bright turquoise blue will add a great pop of color to any outfit.  This scarf is beautifully finished at the edges.  An excellent value for the price!  With the great selection of prints available I'll be visiting this particular vendor again for at least one more (well maybe a couple more!). The 43"" square is such a versatile size."
5.0,Absolutely loved this top ! The quality lasts forever and is like a boho boutique find ! Love it!
5.0,"This is magical. I go out of my way to attach this to everything of mine. I'm not a fan of pink but took a chance on this, and I adore it. The blue stands out more than the pink. It's heavy and the beads turn when moved, simply stunning!"
5.0,They are so comfortable and stylish. These pants are too flattering. I wear them to hang out and work! I am sure to order more.
5.0,This top is conservative but a nice design with good detailing.  The fit is flattering on top and loose towards the bottom which makes this more of tunic or kurtha (Indian top) rather than a blouse.  The top portion and lower portion have nice embroidery which sets this apart from traditional tunics and gives it some flair.  It is 100% cotton  which makes it breathable and nice on warmer days but this is hand wash and the color will fade a bit.  It held up fairly well to the first wash but Machine washing will definitely ruin it.  Overall considering the price this is a very nicely designed top that should go well with flowy pants or a skirt.
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! Light weight, flowy, dress up or down. Will buy more!"
5.0,I really like this watch. Nothing fancy but that's what I like.
5.0,outstanding quality and good price. Great belt at a very reasonable price.
5.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, fits great. Sleeves could be slightly longer but I've got long arms and I still like it. Soft material!"
5.0,Simple and nice goes well with silver earrings.
5.0,"These glasses are super high quality, and trendy! Perfect to enhance any outfit! I was hesitant about the blue, but I love every single pair! 10/10! Fast shipping was a bonus!"
5.0,Easy to work in comfort good value for money  love the colors
5.0,Great fit!  Soft cotton.  I'm a 6'3&#34; 210lb guy with long arms.  This large was perfect!
5.0,"This shirt is perfect! The texture, the length, the fit of the sleeves, all of it!! And it's cute too!üòä A win/win in my book!"
5.0,Ordered for a 1980s theme party. Fit as expected. Washed it without any issues. Cute top.
5.0,So cute I ordered another
5.0,"Best socks ever! My go to for all court sports. Very durable, comfortable and great fit!"
5.0,These pin locks were so easy to use and come with the little allen wrench you need to use them. Now my nursing pins won't pop off my badge!
5.0,Using for an outside wedding with a sheer over jacket. Dresses it up perfectly and with jewelry.  Flattering and comfortable.  No complaints.  Bought a large and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Excellent case at a good price.
5.0,"This Wildtrest Shirt dress is super comfy. The material is very soft; cool and comfortable for summer. The price is great. And it has pockets, so that makes it even nicer. The dress runs true to size, but I ordered an XL for two reasons ~ first, I wanted a super loose fir, and second, I have a long torso and was worried that the waist of this dress would be too short. I could have easily worn a medium, as this dress runs very true to size. As it is so big on me, all I had to do was shorten the elastic at the waist to cinch it tighter. For me, although the medium would have fit just fine, I could tell the waist would have hit just under my bra. I am 5' 7"" and have a very long torso, so I anticipated that might be a problem for me. But if you have an average body type, order your normal size. So for me, the XL is perfect and cinching in the waist left me with a great little dress for summer that is flowy and full skirted with the waist at my natural line."
5.0,Fits my chucka boots perfectly.
5.0,"Nice wallet with a lot of space for credit cards! Leather quality is very good, and the size is just perfect! Loved it!"
5.0,The color was rich.
5.0,Doesn‚Äôt really flatter your figure but it‚Äôs comfortable to wear while cleaning the house or working on the yard
5.0,The case is sturdy and really pretty.  Keeps sunglasses from being scratched or broken.
5.0,"Perfect size for my 9 year old daughter. She has sensative ears, and these earrings do not bother her earlobes. We love the colors and how she can change them to match different outfits. The price is awesome too!"
5.0,"Beautiful<br />Compliments every time I wear them!<br />If you wear silver earrings, you should have a pair of these.<br />And thankfully! They are affordable! Sorta :)"
5.0,I like the fact that as I lose weight and inches around the waist that this belt is designed to be made shorter. I have around six belts now that are to long even though I punched more holes in them to wear but then the tail is so long that it flaps around and if you cut them you have a raw edge that starts to fall apart... Good by belt.
5.0,I love the color and the shape.  They hug the ears great.  Great investment.  I love them.  Great to wear with formal clothes or jeans.
5.0,Color. Not as pretty as picture! Color
5.0,Nice quality. Doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. Would buy again :)
5.0,The mouse ears were perfect! I'm very pleased with my order.
5.0,Great item.  Beautiful tie.
5.0,The fit is good. I wear a 16 and thats what i ordered.  Its Comfortable and not clingy.  I like it.
5.0,Completely satisfied! Will definitely buy again!
5.0,"Quality is an important part in my purchases and since this was a gift for my toddler grandson I wouldn't buy anything I thought would not be nice!  Well, my daughter loves it and says it ""perfect"" so I'm assuming I did good!  Thumbs up from me!"
5.0,This umbrella takes up no room. Great choice when luggage space is at a premium. Highly recommend.
5.0,Just what my kid wanted :)
5.0,They work very well on my larger lens glasses.  The regular ones just didn't quite work.
5.0,"Great transaction! Great prices and dependable shipping, will buy again"
5.0,I love this dress but it fits small which I read from other reviews so instead of getting a Medium I got XL. It fits perfect. The middle piece at the neck was not centered but I can easily fix that.
5.0,This swimsuit is ADORABLE!  Amazing suit for the price. My only complaint is that the cups for your bust are a bit low on the torso but maybe that is my body type.
5.0,I love this necklace bought a second one  to wear together or layer with other pearls!
5.0,Beautiful watchüòò
5.0,"Nice quality, great colors, solid and nice looking metal.  Shipped quickly and packaged very nicely.  I'm ordering another soon.  Well done!"
5.0,"I had to buy a dress last-minute for a wedding. This dress arrived quickly with a few days to spare, and it fit me perfectly. Although I have a fairly small frame (I'm 5'4'' and 110 pounds), my hips are a bit wide. Luckily, I did not have to worry about that with this dress! It also fit well enough on top, and even though I have small breasts, I think that the top is loose enough that it would fit with someone who had larger breasts. The navy blue color was also quite pretty, and the material seemed pretty good. To sum it up, I recommend buying this dress."
5.0,"Love the shirt. Fit great, good quality."
5.0,Quality workmanship and fine leather. The passport fits well and there is room for credit cards and money as well.
5.0,Matched great to my husband tie for a wedding he preformed.  Our sons wore these.
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
5.0,This was a amazing fit ! I'm a chubby gal and this was very comfy and perfect to wear !
5.0,Way to big for kids only fit my husband
5.0,"I wore this for a wedding. Super cute, tea length, so a bit long if you like that. Good quality!"
5.0,This face mask has two layers and fits well and is a good safety mask.  And is very attractive!<br />However there are no ear loops to keep it in place and it does slip when I am speaking.<br />The designs offered are all attractive. I happen to like the floral in shades of purple and lilac with blue.<br />The price is very attractive.
5.0,This dress fit a little snug but I am a little on the curvier side. I have to say this dress is the most comfortable dress ever. I love that you can dress it up or down very versatile.
5.0,"I loved mine so much I ordered another pair for a gift. Nice weight, good costume jewelry."
5.0,"These Curve Sunglasses are a great Summer look with Whiskey/Amber color, I had them perfectly converted into prescription sunglasses. The frames are solidly constructed and built tough."
5.0,This is a very high quality product for the price.  It fit's fine in pocket with a couple keys.
5.0,I am 5'4 130-135lbs. I ordered a Medium. Love the longer sleeves. Goes down to bottom of butt. One of my favorite clothes items I've ever bought on Amazon.
5.0,I have brought this dress 3 times from 3 different companies in the same size and they all fit differently. This brand POSESHE has the best quality and it feels the best... The material is nice and thick and does not show any bulge. I love it.
5.0,"I love these shoes, I needed something to wear in the shower and these were great, not supported for outside walking ."
5.0,good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating
5.0,"GORGEOUS. I love these, they are so delicate looking and I don't have an allergic reaction to these."
5.0,I love it so much and it brought my culture back to me for my graduation. Loved it
5.0,This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She was very pleased. Very pretty and lots of room.
5.0,I ordered these before but got the Margot style. I was going to return but loved those too so I bought these again lol. They fit amazingly. Love the mid waist. I'm 5'8 and 156 lbs. Normally wear a womens 8 so the junior 9 fits great. They have some give to them so washing and drying isn't an issue.
5.0,"This wrist band for the Fitbit Charge 2 is gorgeous. I was concerned because the band is so long to fit large sizes. My wrist is on the smaller size.  It didn't matter. It's sleek, comfortable and it feels really good. I love it.<br />The rise gold band is beautiful. I'm glad o have it for one of my Fitbit bands. I am enjoying using different wristbands."
5.0,Fit is perfect it is a little warm
5.0,THE exact hat worn by Captain Casey on Deadliest Catch.
5.0,"Not gaudy, and beautiful."
5.0,I wanted a watch to replace an old standby which was similar to this. Did not want one of the large watches so many men are wearing nowadays. This small watch is just right for my narrow wrist and arm. Keeps perfect time and all functions work as expected.
5.0,"Love this shirt, quality is great as well as the price."
5.0,"Impressed, worth the price!"
5.0,"Was concerned due to other poor ratings but the dress is well made and runs true to size.  Granddaughter wears 3T and the 3-4 I bought is fine, will wear for quite awhile as it is stretchy and not at all too small.  Fabric colors are vibrant and little one loves it."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for a dainty earring to wear everyday! But the one thing is the post is to long for the screw closer to tighten the earring snug against the ear lobe.
5.0,very nice piece of jewelry
5.0,Love it I have received a lot of compliments on it
5.0,Nice material. Bought it for my mom's birthday. Love it
5.0,I bought this shirt for my cruise. And I'm so very pleased with my order! The fit was excellent! I have very large arms and this top was slightly snug but forgiving. Very comfortable! I highly recommend! I'm 5'10.5 and 233lbs.
5.0,"Pretty necklace with a very nice chain, I did not realize Turquoise came in purple!  Was a gift for a friend - she loved it."
5.0,"I love my hat. It rolls up and stores perfectly in my car or beach bag. It fits good, no headaches and provides good shade."
5.0,I loved it but I think if I lose a little more weight it may become too big.... Overall great and fashionable!
5.0,"These are awesome! I figure if you are going to wear a mask everywhere you go now, might as well get something that is nice and comfortable. I was looking for adjustable ear straps and nose piece, and I found these. And the price was great. Everywhere I looked the price was high. This is very affordable and thickness is great also. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for making these! A big thumbs up!"
5.0,Great quality my son love them
5.0,Beautiful ring - the pics don't do it justice!
5.0,Great ring and isn't cheap
5.0,I may purchase a few more pairs.
5.0,I love the green. I would buy again.
5.0,"Excellent bag. I bought it for an upcoming trip but have been using it as a schoolbag. Roomy, well organized and constructed. Especially like the RFID blocking credit card slots."
5.0,"I can't even explain how happy I am with this belt design.  No more ripped shirts, no more tugging on my pants, no more bulges.  I needed this in my life and am so happy with it.  I only wish the ""leather"" ends were a bit more durable as I'm not sure how long the clips will hold up,  but for this price I can replace with no big deal."
5.0,Im very happy with the purchase
5.0,Fits great. Can breathe well and I have asthma. Mask fits better upside down.
5.0,These are just the right size and the color is a nice clear aqua.The earrings are big enough that the color of the stones are clearly visible.
5.0,excellent fit and value!
5.0,very nice i like it it is good for my sunglasses i requited it thank you i will order more
5.0,"I'm 5'6"" and usually wear a 6-8 in bottoms. The medium fits great! The material is very comfortable and feels thick enough. It's flattering and shows off my curves! I'm really happy with the purchase."
5.0,"Fantastic. Good weight, sturdy clasp, perfect fit."
5.0,They are beautiful.... value for money..... I recommend them
5.0,perfect. cheap. Have been using it for months now no issues and I abuse all my stuff.
5.0,Works great for Big Hipster size wallet.
5.0,"What a very professional company. Shipments came earlier then expected, I was blown away by the quality of the jewelry, it was fantastic. I bought two things from jblue and I will absolutely buy a lot more in the future. I also gifted this necklace and he absolutely loved it! I also got a nice catalog."
5.0,Very nice bracelet. I love the spoon handle look!
5.0,"Adorable, and my daughter loves them so much I had to buy more!"
5.0,Soft and baggy just how I expected it to be. Design is supe cute. üíúüñ§
5.0,Fit like a glove- light weight for hot Florida temps  Only thing is I thought I was ordering a  Burgundy dress as pictured turned out it was olive green as stated in the description
5.0,XMas gift
5.0,"I have to say despite the simplicity of the product, this necklace draws a lot of attention. A lot of people ask me what the symbol stands for, even distant friends and relatives. I just waive them off and brand the necklace the ""Ivan seal of approval"" so I can say ""I approve of this body"". Its a great way to start a conversation when you need one *hint hint*. Its an ominous, yet nice necklace that will draw attention."

5.0,"Got what was advertised. Especially nice that each came with a hard carry case. Refreshing to see a vendor these days that, at least on initial appearance, gives you what you‚Äôre expecting when you place your order. Can‚Äôt speak to how they‚Äôll last yet but they should if kept in the nice carry cases. 5 stars!"

5.0,"This was so cute and comfy. Fit was as to be expected. Well made and soft high quality fabric. There was more detail to it than I could tell in the photos. If I was going to a party I would have definitely kept it but I‚Äôll be home handing out candy and making dinner. The claws make it really hard to do real life things with your hands lol! I returned it and was refunded right away. I was sad but if you are going out or to a party, totally order it! You can definitely hold a cup. üòÇ"

5.0,"It‚Äôs held up very well, happy to have purchased."
5.0,"We bought these to sell at Relay for Life and after some of the reviews I only purchased one set of 40 as I was concerned about how they would work.  The ones we received worked great - only three did not work - which compared to other reviews is wonderful - really wished I had purchased more.  They shipped on time and were packed in sets of 4 on a nice hand shaped background with a red, white, blue and green light on each finger and they were completely sealed. They lasted all night and the kids really enjoyed them a lot - we got mobbed and sold out in less than 1/2 hour - if you have been to relay for life you will know you stay all night and we did not have one single kid come back to complain about their finger light - just some who were disappointed we had sold out already.  Ordered from UnitedIntegral and I highly suggest using them as I know we will order from them again for next year or any evening event with kids as they really loved these!!"
5.0,5/6 fits my 5 yr old son perfect! Soft material.
5.0,"Haven't had a chance to try it out for my garden activities yet, but it looks and feels great and should do the trick as far as covering the back of my neck when bent over gardening.  The problem with most fixed brim hats is that they tilt will your head movement and expose the back of the neck to long stretches in the sun."
5.0,"Loved the earrings.  I love turquoise and not having pierced ears, this was the answer."
5.0,"Purchased 2 dressed that worked perfect. Beautiful, very well made!  Perfect for adjusting sizes."

5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Great quality hat with the messy bun hole at the top! I wear this hat all the time and it‚Äôs comfortable and cute. The faded black denim look is my favorite. I like the adjustable clasp being hidden too.
5.0,These boots fit great out of the box.  Plan to still get them heat molded to feet.  Really looking forward to see what they can do on the ski hill.  Replacing some older 15 year Solomons which are still running good.

5.0,It‚Äôs beautiful and comfortable and I didn‚Äôt look like a fat cow in it like I thought I would. If I had more occasions to wear a dress I‚Äôd buy more styles.
5.0,"Perfect daily wear for a Star Wars fan! The jacket arrived quickly and I wasn't disappointed. It is a little thicker than an normal ""bomber"" style jacket (being reversible it makes sense) but it adds to the overall feeling of quality on the piece. The jacket fit well with a more modern cut (more fitted), and complimented my frame well. At 5'11'' and 170 pounds the medium fit perfectly!"
5.0,"I originally got this set for friend who is in need of some healing some comfort in alignment, when I saw it I had to order the same set for myself. I love it."
5.0,Beautiful dress and nice material !
5.0,"Cute, fits good, but a little more see-through that I've expected"
5.0,"My daughter wears a size 4 shoe, so I was somewhat worried that the 4-6 would be too big. They fit perfectly and are extremely soft! They have a little bit of traction, which is great for us since we have hardwood floors. Multiple pairs means she always has some when others are being washed. Overall extremely pleased!"
5.0,"Wonderful gloves, very soft interior, good quality material for the outside of the gloves, they work perfect, and did I say how Soft they are? would buy again happy customer."
5.0,"Beautiful case, ultra thin and keeps perfect time.  What could be better."

5.0,"Perfect shoe for my kid. The show was cute and fit well! For the price I was impressed, they are good looking shoes but with the price im not worried about them getting messed up with any weather they may encounter."
5.0,"Great price, very beautiful, fits great, and my niece (6 years old) loves it!"
5.0,"If you have a large head and normal store bought sun glasses never fit comfortably, then, these glasses are a must, perfect fit, covers the eyes completely, this is the first time I've bought extra large sun glasses, honestly, I didn't know they sold them, covers the ears with room to spare, and even bend out-ward, if that is required.  I have thrown my other pairs of sun glasses away, comfortable and fits me perfectly.  One Review compared the glass as &#34;large as the Hubble space lens...&#34; they must have had a small head, they are not as large as implied in that review, of course, look normal on persons with large heads."
5.0,"This seat-belt keychain is the best I have owned so far. Sturdy design - the seat-belt feels quite solid and secure, one handed operation is very convenient.<br />To me, one of the best things about this is it's ability to be moved around my belt to different positions that jingle-and-jangle the least, as opposed to a keychain that can only be  placed where you hook it, and if you have heavy keys can damage your pants or make them droop (more) awkwardly.<br /><br />The only &#34;Con&#34; that I can think of is that you have to be careful when you remove your keys; mine tend to drop to the ground if I don't hold on to them firmly. But I have yet to have an accidental unbuckling of my keys."
5.0,"These are the best sock, just keep adding to my collection."
5.0,Love the dress. It fits well. I order an X-Large because w like the extra room. I did use the belt that came with it. However very comfortable.

5.0,"They work great. I was skeptical, but they really keep my glasses in place."
5.0,"I really, really like this one!  It's beautiful and is very good quality.  Lovely on, too."
5.0,"Whether it's warmth or just required, your face covering can match your hat in this get up. The ""scarf"" goes on over your head and you pull it down around your chin or face. It's a circle. You don't have to wrap it around or anything. The hat has an adorable pom pom. Both are lined in the softest, warmest fleece."
5.0,These are cute and they work great for my son to cover his legs when I do wet wraps for his eczema.
5.0,I love these bags. they are pretty and highly functional. The cool pack bag is huge. It's more than adequate for a large grocery trip or a family picnic. I get complements on them all the time.<br />They are sturdy and strong and very easy to use. I would buy these again!
5.0,Love this! It‚Äôs beautiful and fits so well!
5.0,these are a nice fit. as stated they are for compression but not medical strength. not too tight and wash/dry without shrinking.
5.0,Elegante. se aprecia la calidad.<br />Buena compra.
5.0,"It is much larger than I thought, but a truly nice charm."
5.0,Love these<br />Not cheap plastic<br />Nice metal with weight to them
5.0,Very cute for my 1 year old daughter
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this costume! I normally wear an XL and it fits great. I will have to shorten it because I'm 5'1"", but I expected that. Two separate pieces (the coat is FABULOUS!) with 2 jewels and an extra jewel. Can't to wear this as my Winifred costume!"
5.0,This product is absolutely adorable for my granddaughter and brewer beautiful doll.  It is so soft it was just as described. Love it!
5.0,"First of all there is nothing I dislike about this backpack. I love the size of it, the space on the inside is perfect for me to carry notebooks, a book, pencil/ pen cases, phone, earphones, loose pens and also a mini tablet or laptop. I am definitely going to buy another backpack in a different color. Also it came way earlier than expected which is always nice! Thank you! :)"
5.0,Bought for my daughter and it fits great and it looks great and great quality.
5.0,"These are super comfy and made out a smooth breathable material. The compression is moderate, not too tight and not too loose. A little bit see through when bent over but it's not that bad. I'm 5'3&#34; 150lb and ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. I got the blue and the water melon? I think. I would definitely recommend these and I will be buying more in different colors in the near future. Can't wait to wear these to the gym! If you're on a budget these are definitely the way to go instead of paying 80$ for a single pair of lulus.<br /><br />No problems with shipping, correct colors came and shipped in 2 days."
5.0,"I ordered a few ties from Tok Tok and got them delivered 3 days before promised. They have been the talk of the office, Very delighted with the quality of the ties. And know that I will be ordering more."
5.0,Very nice! Like on the picture. Nice box. I recommend it!
5.0,"Came in earlier than expected, and fits perfectly. It also looks great!"
5.0,Great price for leather!!!!!!!! Very nice handbag.
5.0,"Very cute swimsuit. Warning, the hole in the center will reveal side boob, which isn't bad if you want a little tease but maybe not a good thing if you are buying this suit for modesty."
5.0,i really loved these but i didn't know they were the same material as stockings...... they were tight but they do stretch... they're not cotton socks. Still love them
5.0,Fit as expected; surprisingly good quality material and stitching
5.0,"Very happy, and looks as pictured! I read some reviews stating it looked cheap, so I was nervous to buy it but it's such a good deal for a mechanical watch I took a gamble.. and I love it! It is larger than most women's watches, see picture. Granted, I've got small wrists but it isn't dainty so if petite is the goal you won't like this product.<br /><br />The only other thing I noticed is it does need to be wound each morning, which I expected for a low price-point mechanical watch. I followed the instructions of 20x wound, and it lasts the whole day. For $28, I don't mind winding it."
5.0,So I bought a size smaller than I am currently because I am losing weight. Even with it being too small it is extremely comfortable and supportive. I am pleased with this product.
5.0,I have bought several things from this buyer and everything is top quality.
5.0,Great quality. Perfect size. Blingy enough that I feel like a movie star.
5.0,Gave this as a gift to my mom for Mother's Day.  She loved it.
5.0,My daughter got this watch for Christmas and she loves it.

5.0,"it's a bit tight around my wrist, but I have received many compliments"
5.0,love this neckless
5.0,Very flattering and comfortable. Pockets sit a little higher so they don‚Äôt pull them down as easy. Sit right below belly button which is perfect for me
5.0,Like the design thought it would be a little bit bigger but still big enough to read.
5.0,I love everything about this swimsuit!! I will be ordering more colors! This one is so bright. I ordered XL and I wear a size 14. I‚Äôm 196 lbs and 5‚Äô3‚Äù. I would say it‚Äôs true to size. The suit has a lot of stretch. Buy this you will not regret it!!
5.0,"I wear these every day.  They are my go to shades.  I wanted to really wear them and put them thru the summer paces before I made my review.  I got them a few days before I went to a waterpark so I decided that would be a good test of them.  I wore them all day, without problems.  They fit very well, the wood arms are very sturdy.  The lenses are nice and clear, and really do a good job of keeping the bright sun out of your eyes.  handmade, is etched into the end of one arm, along with a model number.  I would not have a problem buying these again, because I really like how they fit and the look.  Im a surfer, summer loving girl, and these fit into my style great.  They also provide a nice cleaning cloth, along with a carrying bag to keep them from getting scratched.  It was 100 degrees the day I went to a waterpark, and not a cloud in the sky.  I could go thru my day and enjoy myself without the sun being in my eyes.  I really like that these are dark enough, that they keep the brightness out of your eyes.  I great product, and I like the handmade touch very much."
5.0,I have purchased designer handbags bags before and this onemail is right there at the top. The side are soft and rich in feeling. There is only one main pocket but it has side pockets for your phone and extras.
5.0,"My fav swim suit for sure. the pattern is exactly the same as the picture. I got a large and the top was quite big at first, I ended up tightening the straps and it fit a lot better! (size 36 DD for reference)"
5.0,Gives very natural whitening and shimmering. Smells nice.
5.0,"So comfortable and warm.  Hood is very fluffy, so it‚Äôs great when you really need to bundle up, but a little excessive on just a breezy day.  I love this jacket."
5.0,"My grandson chose this watch as part of his graduation gift. It just needs to be sized to his wrist, but he is very happy with his selection. This is his first watch. Nice color and style."
5.0,"Love this so much I bought 2 more as gifts!! It exceeded my expectations.  Great value, good package."
5.0,Clasps hold securely to my sweaters.  Looks just as shown on line.  Happy with the quality and look.
5.0,I love this dress. It‚Äôs perfect and the material feels fancier than plain cotton.
5.0,I love the length of this  it gives me the look I need  loved the cute bag that came with it
5.0,Nah.  Not what I expected.  Top looked cute on but material felt cheap and was itchy.  Too bad
5.0,"Great shirt, received many good complements."
5.0,Greet dress but fits small
5.0,"These are by far my favorite pair of sunglasses I‚Äôve ever had. Sturdy frames and I think they‚Äôre pretty stylish with flat lenses and pointed tips. Especially for guys, these are unique and I‚Äôd recommend these to anyone. Especially at this price point. I bought darker ones, but I‚Äôll definitely be buying the gold ones as well."
5.0,We love the shirts
5.0,"It is beautiful, I will be wearing it every Sunday"
5.0,Fits exactly as a medium should. The sleeves are 3/4 not rolled up as they appear in the picture and the color is a true olive.
5.0,I love wearing this shirt! It very flattering for someone without a six pack :)
5.0,"I love everything about this band. The color is so pretty, it‚Äôs durable and comfortable."
5.0,I have a round face and they compliment me so well! I've been looking for some reflective lens glasses for a while and these are amazing! They also protect my eyes from the sun which is great! Definitely recommend!
5.0,"Me super encant√≥ este vestido... Llego de la forma esperada, la tela es bueno, no se transparenta, es c√≥modo, creo es la primera vez que pido algo y no tengo que hacerle arreglos. Muy recomendado."
5.0,This cross is very delicate looking and the length is perfect I am glad I bought sterling silver so it will not corrode.
5.0,My daughter is only 2 and loves these shoes!
5.0,"I love this dress! I ended up with the large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs. The dress was comfortable and had cute little pockets. The white dress is a little  see through, so I‚Äôd recommend wearing skin tone undergarments. I‚Äôll definitely be buying more dresses from here"
5.0,"The shape of these tubes make paddling on the river a little bit easier. Nice, sturdy tubes."
5.0,"Love this one it is very comfortable, It's one of my Husband favorite :). I got the plus size because I am 5&#34;7 225 lbs. It could fit someone bigger than me very stretchy."
5.0,amazing love it
5.0,"I have European background and was very excited to get this handbag. The bag is very well-made and looks exactly as pictured in the ads. It is absolutely gorgeous! The bag is 3D, with the face coming out and the body wider at the bottom so it can stand on a flat surface. It is larger that I expected and has extenders on the sides because of the wider base. This allows for better storage of bulkier items. The bag fits a cellphone, keys, makeup, and a small wallet. I tried putting my oversized long wallet in it but the top would not close because the 'head' of the bag is more narrow. I do wish that the inside compartment had dividers or separate pockets, that way the phone would not get scratched by the keys and everything is not jumbled up together.  I also wish that this would come in different colors, like red and black or other options besides just pink. I also wish this would have been made with genuine leather so that it would last longer. The bag definitely makes a statement and draws attention. It would suit better for a younger generation. I definitely cannot picture a senior citizen strolling around with this down the grocery store isles... Overall, this is a very unique and super cute handbag and I am very happy with this item!"
5.0,"This wallet is perfect!<br />Well made,<br />Good price,<br />Snug fit for cards ,<br />Not bulky, like traditional wallets."
5.0,I have a slightly larger face but they fit well and I LOVE the color!
5.0,"I love these. I have several styles including this one (Same brand, same material) and they all are wonderful. They are soft, they are not scratchy. They fit plus sizes very well. Size 20-26 for sure. But I suspect a8-28 is the full range. Smaller than that and it would be a little loose. It may fit bigger.<br />They stay up well and don't run easily (I have not yet managed to make them run) Note that these are a thicker material. Not super thin like most tights."
5.0,These were purchased for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves them. Perfect fit and comfortable
5.0,"This purse is a good buy, it's kinda heavy but beautiful and very roomy I recommend this purse."
5.0,"Super loving this hat! Great fit. Star Wars official. Nice quality, glad to add it to my hat collection."
5.0,"I usually don't spend this type of money on a bag, but let me tell you, this bag was worth it.  I love it.  It is so well made and even more beautiful in person.  I absolutely love it and am glad I splurged on a nice bag which is not only beautiful but functional at the same time.  Love love love this bag!!!!!"
5.0,"nice, sturdy, use them daily when umpiring, Gives me a clear view of the field, players & ball. love the Blue exterior tint while looking thru them is almost an amber tint."
5.0,Great price on the medium fit and they were better quality than expected.
5.0,Great watch just over priced.
5.0,"I found these perfect if you're trying to sneak in an afternoon nap or if you're sensitive to light. For me, my bedroom receives quite a bit of light and I don't use blackout curtains. If I went out late or simply want to sleep in a bit more over the weekends, the Mae's sleep mask provides adequate blocking of light. I would say it provides 80% coverage with a little light that could seep in from the top or bottom. This is hardly noticeable with your eye closed. Though this isn't one of those masks that cover half your face I would be that this is 10x more comfortable. The material used is soft as silk too. Though it says it's machine washable (cold water only), I'd stick to handwashing and I would never put this into the dryer. Also the band is very flexible and should fit most shapes and sizes."
5.0,Fits great and provides support while still able to breathe in it.
5.0,This is a very lovely piece of jewelry. The silvery is more substantial than appears in the photos. I am very please with this purchase. I purchased this as a gift for my daughter in law. She has a large and comprehensive jewelry collection and loved this pendant. Neither of us had ever seen any quite like it. I just ordered one for myself.
5.0,"Got this for my VBS Jungle Safari costume, I cannot even wait to get to use it. Fits great, came before I expected it."
5.0,I ordered these as a gift for my youngest granddaughter who has a beautiful black cat as a beloved pet. She loved the earrings.<br />They are small and very lightweight making them perfect for a young girl.
5.0,This was a Bday gift for my husband. He loved the graphics & the size was perfect.
5.0,Soft stretchy and love the two pockets
5.0,Fit great. Stay on well. Keeps our little one from slipping and sliding around the house
5.0,cute and perfect!
5.0,I was hesitant to buy this Leo after reading some of the not so great reviews... I can say ours is EXCELLENT quality.  The fabric is a great quality and thick.  It has a great stretch and recovers nicely.  The skirt is flown and matches beautifully.  My daughter loves this so much that she insists on still wearing it even though it is cold!  We currently layer a long sleeve Leo under it to keep her warm.
5.0,Embroidered not printed.
5.0,This is my favorite handbag. I got tons of where did you get that bag. It has clean lines and goes with almost everything.  Plus it's the perfect size.
5.0,"I myself wear size 13 extra wide shoes which are often hard to find and more often not as wide as advertised. I recently stretched a $180 pair of SAS men's Italian leather loafers to perfection.  I also did the same for a pair of leather boat shoes. The stretcher works very well and is easy to use. I find it particularly useful as my right foot is wider than my left, and I can now get a custom fit."
5.0,Nice Quality bands.
5.0,"I bought this in navy blue in an XL. Perfectly what I expected. Fits perfectly, color is great, dressy and comfy. I bought a waist belt so it has a more fitted look, otherwise it is a moo moo. Very cute with a belt."
5.0,These are just what I wanted. They are dark and light-weight.
5.0,light weight easy to put on look great
5.0,Very warm used from a winter üèà game and tailgating stayed warm

5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for, great quality."
5.0,"Ordered for prairie school day for my daughter, it fit her well and looked period appropriate.  It was well made and would hold up to many more uses!"
5.0,"This little ring is a LIFESAVER on days I have to work outside (residential Appraiser). I always cringe when I caught my diamonds &prongs on stucco, so I stopped wearing my wedding bands to work. This silicone ring lets me show my commitment without fear of damage!"
5.0,Shipped quickly and pretty scarf
5.0,Perfect shirt when I drive in an Aston Martin on a hot day or actually any car.
5.0,Good set of goggles.  Protected my eyes during a week of snowboarding and stayed on despite my many crashes in the snow! Great deal!
5.0,"I bought this for an upcoming trip. It‚Äôs flattering, and the fabric feels nice against the skin."
5.0,This worked so well at the masquerade party. Loved that I could use it or may or down. Lot of people said how hard it was to walk or dance with their tie on masks. The quality is really sturdy bit able to carefully bend to fit your face.
5.0,My favorite hat from now on..<br />I absolutely adore...My husband loves it too.. He wantws one for himself...lolz..<br />He really does...
5.0,"Love it. True to color. Its vibrant, pretty and very soft. Not cheaply made.  I would by another one in a heart beat."
5.0,"Our neighbor has a hat like this, which my husband inturn wanted one. Looked all over and couldn't find one. Found it here, fits great and my husband loves it....that's all that matters."
5.0,This dress is absolutely gorgeous!!
5.0,Got for a buddies wedding. Yet to use it but seems to be good for the price.
5.0,"I give this item all five stars, because it is exactly as described by the seller! It's a very sexy and beautiful dress and not to mention inexpensive.<br /><br />I ordered a large and although I could zip it up, it felt a little too snug in the upper belly area for my liking.<br /><br />I ordered the blue dress and it's brighter in person than what actually shows on the screen<br /><br />I like the material and everything about it is well made<br /><br />For reference, I usually wear a size 14/16 or a large in my tops. I'm a 36-38c and I'm 5'1 in tall<br /><br />I think if you have a larger bottom half, please be advised that a large may be too snug on your stomach area.<br /><br />This dress is see through on the bottom half and therefore it comes with a pair of briefs to wear underneath.<br /><br />Me personally, I'd buy a plunging neckline body shapers to wear underneath, but the briefs that come with this dress will do just fine<br /><br />In closing: BUY THIS DRESS, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!"
5.0,Great socks. High quality and very helpful for my Dad's postural hypotension and keeping good circulation in his legs !
5.0,"Good coat -- fit as expected for the most part (the sleeves are a bit wide in my opinion, but it's fair enough)."
5.0,Love to sleep with these on!
5.0,Super comfortable and cute. Thinking about buying in other colors
5.0,"This skirt is perfect - the exact length and fit I wanted, light, comfortable but not flimsy. it's well made and HAS POCKETS. 10/10 will probably buy another so I can wear 2. Only down side is it needs ironing for wrinkles."
5.0,"At first I did not think that this would really provide much support or compression but it turns out that it does.  It is also comfortable to wear - my toes arent pinched!  Somehow it seems to be a bit easier on my skin as well - the fabric is smoother perhaps?  Regardless, I like these."
5.0,Looks exactly as shown....it is a beautiful hat!
5.0,Perfect size for kids.. plenty of room
5.0,nice but runs big... my son is small frame and ordered a small in mens but was on the bigger side...
5.0,My granddaughter loves it. Skirt is quite short so needs bootie covering. Wish we had ordered size larger.
5.0,"Beautiful color, and so very comfortable! Will be ordering more in other colors!"
5.0,"Although this item runs smaller than US sizes it has become my daughters favorite hoodie. It didn't shrink too much when laundered either. It also didn't attract as much lint and hair as we expected which is a miracle. It does have that hourglass figure design, but it's not overwhelming. It actually looks good on my daughter and that's a blessing. She says it's comfortable, and now she is asking for a different color."
5.0,Very simple and comfy
5.0,"Loved it for my Cancun resort trip last week! Fits very loose and roomy, yet I did not &#34;drown&#34; in it. I'm 5'5&#34; and approx 120lbs.... I purchased it in a size SMALL."
5.0,I love it!!!!!! Materials is a very good quality!!! I a must to buy!!!
5.0,Well packaged and pretty sturdy. For the price you can‚Äôt beat it. I will likely order another in a different color.
5.0,"Loved these bras, had surgery on both breast and these were perfect after surgery, had to wear for several weeks and sleep in them and these were comfortable. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,Got this for my 4yo birthday and it fit good and she loves it.
5.0,"I was truly impressed with the quality and sparkle of these earrings. The CZs really do have a nice color and sparkle...plus the metallic component seems well made but lightweight. I'd consider these to be good quality costume jewelry and would recommend them. I would definitely order from this vendor again.  Even though they are big chandelier style earrings, they are not so heavy to tug your ear lobes down and feel uncomfortable. Order these!"
5.0,"Great for the collector. Zipper rough and interferes when putting objects in and out of purse, so daily use can be an irritation. But I‚Äôm a Luna lover and couldn‚Äôt resist. Hanging in room for decoration."
5.0,"I also have this in black. I absolutely love these blouses. The sleeve and detailing always gets compliments. People can‚Äôt believe I bought this off Amazon. Just to add, this does sit slightly off the shoulder. For a better look, wear a strapless bra or pin the top to your bra strap."
5.0,"--If you found this review helpful, please click ""helpful--<br /><br />I'm late to the game but I'm just now getting into jumpsuits. I've loved rompers but jumpsuits are so much better! This one is so flattering! I can dress it up or down.<br /><br />The material is a cotton type knit and is so soft! It feels like I'm wearing my jammies. The cut of the top is so flattering and it has a snap to keep the top together. If I were to wear a cute bralette/bandeau, I'd leave it open.<br /><br />It does run a little large. I ordered a medium and it fits fine but I could have ordered the small. If you're between sizes, size down. I am 5' 6"", 140 lbs, and size 4 for reference.<br /><br />--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--"
5.0,This shirt was a hit and worked perfect for the concert.<br /><br />It's soft & looked amazing.
5.0,"Great, just what My wife and I needed. Appears to be of good quality."
5.0,"Soooooo comfortable, Love!"
5.0,"Roomy. I may take the small another time. Otherwise it is a great buy. Like I said, I may take the small the next time."
5.0,Great for swimming. Doesn't slip and easy to take out.
5.0,Well made and fit perfectly on my glasses. Good strong clip and easy to use. These clip-on are definitely a game changer. Love the case and eyeglass holder they come in to keep them from getting scratched up. Would recommend this purchase.
5.0,"These socks are great!  They are soft and stretchy and very lightweight, which is just what I wanted.  It's almost like wearing no socks at all, except they do their job and keep my feet from chafing.  They wash beautifully and seem as though they'll last a long time.  I would have preferred to be able to choose the colors as I'm not likely to ever wear the dark ones, but for the price, I really can't complain."
5.0,This mask is the one I wear every day it has a wire in the top it‚Äôs so many compliments on it and it fits great love it
5.0,"This is probably the highest quality nose stud I've ever owned. It does not snag easily on my blankets, the gem is very sparkly, the metal is high quality, the packaging was great, and their customer service went out of their way to make sure everything went well with my order. Great product, I would highly recommend it."
5.0,I‚Äôm a veteran and proud of it
5.0,Cute anniversary gift. Well made
5.0,"CALIDAD DE LENTES, DURADEROS Y DE BUEN ASPECTO COMO LO PEDI. RECOMENTADO."
5.0,I love mine I‚Äôve got it wet and everything & it‚Äôs still perfect. It does stretch out though.
5.0,OMG this ring it so nice. Love it
5.0,"Absolutely recommend these! I‚Äôm already on my 4th pair, almost have all the colors except for one pair and I‚Äôm definitely going to get them. You can use for just about everything. I wear them around all the time when I go out and get nothing but compliments. And they‚Äôre awesome run in or for working out. Great alternative to save money without sacrificing quality in material!"
5.0,My wife like the material and how it fits her
5.0,My son likes them and they are comfortable.
5.0,I wasn‚Äôt sure but they are amazing great fit comfortable and stylish love them

5.0,My son loves the socks.
5.0,these come in a clear protective pouch. very cute shades.
5.0,I love it.Fits rigth.come on time.
5.0,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS DRESS! Bought this for a fall wedding and was hesitant because I hadn‚Äôt yet tried on, but went based on other reviews. The dress came in two days and fit perfectly when I tried it on! Hits at the knee, has a zipper on the left side, and you‚Äôre able to wear a regular bra with this (which is a HUGE plus in my book)! So glad I bought this, and will get more use out of it!"
5.0,Fits a bit tighter than I thought it would. So I ordered a MEDIUM instead of a small. The MEDIUM fit PERFECT!! The small would have been to small.
5.0,I use to hate to drive at night but the head lights of on coming cars don‚Äôt bother me anymore.
5.0,Love the look these pants create
5.0,Neice lived it and she is so cute in it.
5.0,"Great formal dress! In reality looks better than on the photo model. Quality product for the great price!  It's a little stretchy, has a nice weight to it."
5.0,Its an attractive and well made shirt. Has a slenderizing effect
5.0,"I love the sweatpants. They are light, comfortable and the craftsmanship is excellent. These pants are not designed to be worn in cold weather as the material is not thick enough. Otherwise you can probably wear them comfortably in 60 degree weather (Fahrenheit) and higher. I am 5'6'' and weigh 150 lbs. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with these sweatpants."
5.0,Super cute and great quality! The skirt was much thicker then expected! You can‚Äôt find an outfit like this for such a great price! My daughter wears it even though it‚Äôs not her birthday anymore! Highly recommend! Awesome price!
5.0,"I bought this for my son for his birthday.  He seemed quite intrigued by it as he's only ever had one of those digital watches with the calculator on it. lol<br /><br />Last night he informed me that he'd figured out how to set the second hand.  lol<br /><br />It's beautifully presented in a wooden box, comes with a ""friendship"" type bead bracelet, gender neutral.  Also comes with a tool to adjust the wrist band and an extra link if needed.<br /><br />We couldn‚Äôt have been happier. It‚Äôs a beautiful watch, with many functions. The real wood in the band and the watch face is just gorgeous. It was easy to set up and my son was ecstatic with the gift. Beautiful and very striking.<br /><br />I think this would make anyone pleased to receive it.  It's a wonderul and uique instrument.  I highly recommend."
5.0,"I loved this jacket, now my outfit for use in a Halloween party is ready. My costume is Max from Stranger things and I recommend it for who wants to use the same costume."
5.0,"Good goggles, tight fit, they don't fog up.  Used then in a pool for an hour and they felt great!<br />I received this item for a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
5.0,Fast shipping. Well made.
5.0,"The style I purchased was the cheapest of the bunch, and a steal! It's cute and still vibrant (I don't put any of my scrub caps in the dryer). The towel material or whatever on the inside for the forehead works great. I don't sweat through it. Would buy again."
5.0,"Fits perfect! Feels super sexy and if you get the mesh dress to go over it, it's the perfect going out dress to anywhere."
5.0,"These pajamas are very comfortable sleepwear (and lounging around for part of the morning, lol).  I recommend highly, considering the price and comfort level."
5.0,I love the back story as I've shared with many who've asked about this ring.
5.0,"I love this shirt. It fits right in all the right places. The sleeves are the prefect length for my long arms. I would say true to size, if you want a form fitting but not tight shirt. Order a size up if you want a more loose look. Great, soft material. Not too warm but just the right texture for chillier days. I'm going to be buying in more colors."
5.0,I am pleasantly surprised how nice these are.  They fit perfectly and I am able to use touchscreen.  Great product and even better product.  I highly recommend.
5.0,"So, this turned out way higher quality than I expected. Nice, thick cardigan that's soft and so far has worn really well.<br /><br />I'm probably going to buy several more as the color was great and the fabric felt way nicer than the price would lead you to believe.<br /><br />Great cardigan!"
5.0,Great skirt. I loved it. Really comfortable.
5.0,"I absolutely love this. It is so soft, warm, comfortable and just the right amount of ‚Äòoversized‚Äô without making me feel like I‚Äôm swimming in it or sloppy looking. I got two colors and I think I need them all! No shedding (wore dark shirt underneath and maybe 1 piece or 2 of fuzz here and there came off?) and no static!!! Very pleased with this. Wearing a size small."
5.0,Great for travel - especially when packing in carry on - perfect
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 165lbs 36DDD and I ordered a size Large. This dress was amazing! The top is lace and see-through but you can easily wear a bandeau or strapless bra underneath if you want a more conservative look.
5.0,"Love this product,"
5.0,These boxes are useful for so many things!  Currently they are storing my teaching units...one unit per bag.  File folders will stand up in them.  Note:  this is NOT a case for hanging files and is not advertised as such.  But the handles make the boxes easy to move into and out of my storage unit.  I like them a lot!
5.0,Absolutely love it!! It's perfect.
5.0,Really nice mens watch.  It's a heavy watch.
5.0,"Nice looking, don't break out the ears, reasonably priced"
5.0,Absolutely loved it. I‚Äôm on a weight loss journey and thought this dress wasn‚Äôt going to fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 225 lbs and the 2xl looked fantastic on me. Will now buy in different colors.
5.0,These glasses are a lot nicer than expected. I thought that they would feel cheap and fragile but boy was I wrong. The frames feel solid and they look like the real deal. I don't think anyone would assume I purchased these for the price they are being sold at. For the money I would definitely say an excellent buy!
5.0,it is very flattering on any body shape. its long and flowy. the neckline makes the bust look big and i really like the back. i was hesitant to order a dress online but it fits perfectly. very flattering on any figure. im curvy and i got alot of compliments on it. hids your fat lol
5.0,She loves The rocky horror picture show and had to add it to her patch collection on the back of her blue jean jacket. Super fast shipping!!
5.0,You can use the lace side or flip it around and use the plain side.  Solid camis.
5.0,"Really cute, i love how simple it is!"
5.0,"Very soft and stretchy. A little thin and required a cami/tank top underneath, but not a big deal. Our daughter loves this dress"
5.0,"I havent worn it out yet since it's still 88-90 degrees out, but I have tried it on. Very soft and has pockets. Looks exactly like the picture."
5.0,Good value for money. True to size. Very cute costume. May need to wear an undershirt because it‚Äôs thin for cold weather.
5.0,Fits nicely on face. Are more cat eye then excepted but still nice.
5.0,Used it as soon as I got it. Works great!
5.0,I love these jeans. They are a great fit for me.
5.0,This dress is beautiful fits a lil tight on the arms
5.0,Very pleased with the selection. If I could offer one suggestion it would be to size up at least one size to allow more room for an apron.
5.0,"They look like $500 umbrellas. Everyone that comes to the pool compliments them. It got a little windy and they rocked a bit, but not terrible. They look great, easy to raise, lower, and swivel. I really have no complaints"
5.0,Noooooo pockets! This ad lies to us unfortunately. But the fit and feel is great. 176lbs 5'4 and I bought an xl.
5.0,Looks sturdy and feels sturdy. I‚Äôve been wearing it long enough now to know this band is gonna last. Great band replacement for my Fenix 5X that looks just like the original and at such a great price.
5.0,"Nice, soft material. Exactly as expected for Ralph Lauren product."
5.0,Very nice fit. Good quality for the price
5.0,"best lazy dress , ever"
5.0,"It's a really simple watch, it tells time, and figuring out the different settings and functions is pretty easy with the instructions that come with it. Probably not going to impress anyone with it, but then again, who wants to hang out with people that can be impressed by a wristwatch."
5.0,"These are great for kids and for women. It has adjustable straps and it is very comfortable. I haven‚Äôt washed the ones I‚Äôve used yet, so I cant say how they will behave yet."
5.0,"Really like this coat. Nice quality. I'm a small but since everyone said it ran small, I purchased a medium which ended up being too large. Since the quality and price was great, I ordered me a small and it fitted perfect."
5.0,Very nice for the low price.
5.0,My 4 year old grand daughter asked for these and wears them often.  It's a fashion statement when you are a fairy or unicorn.
5.0,Easy for toddlers to put on.
5.0,"Great piece of jewelry.  I ordered this for my wife and had slight issues with the clasp on the first order, but the seller ninaqueen provided the best customer service and took care of the issue and replaced the item which works great!  It's nice to experience such wonderful customer service. Will continue to buy from this seller in the future!"
5.0,I bought this nightgown for my granddaughter. She's absolutely in love with it and never wants to her regular clothes on . It's the  perfect  colors and washes well!!!
5.0,Exactly like the picture...It's the second shirt I've bought from them. Happy with it.
5.0,"I ordered an XL and should have got a L. Hoping it shrinks a little, but other than that it is a great hoodie."
5.0,Excellent quality and design. Padded case with cleaning cloth - ideal for all Betty Boop fans!
5.0,"Muy bien hecha, est√° muy padre"
5.0,"Bought this for my tall 14 month old. It was a loose fit but fit him perfect length wise. Extremely warm. He only had on a shortsleeved onesie under it, was running around at night in the cold and he was almost sweating underneath. I can‚Äôt get over how perfect it is"
5.0,I bought one from Costco last year and was so glad I could find this one for my elderly mother.  Heavy coats and jackets are a struggle now and this jacket is incredibly light but very warm. My mother loves it and has gotten rid of her not-so-warm but heavy jackets.  I winter hike in mine and have been very comfortable.
5.0,This was very nice. I received it in better condition than I thought. Hope to do business with this person again
5.0,Arrived very fast and fits great my son loves his jammies
5.0,"I bought this for the corkscrew rings because I wanted the double piercing look, it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,I was very happy to receive my  order on a Sunday.Now I have plenty of time to pack for my trip ill be going on Easter weekend since I received it early. I am very happy with the sizes of both Tote bags and love the colors. Im very pleased with the entire transaction and quality of the merchandise.<br />Thankyou<br />Karen S.
5.0,"I'm 5'7"" 122lbs and I bought a S. It fits perfectly so alterations will be necessary. I recommend this for a semi casual look. I wore it to work and received compliments."
5.0,"I love ‚Äòem<br />Wore mine on my vacation with blazers, kimono, short sleeve jacket<br />Its very comfortable looks good on pictures<br />I actually bought every colorüíñüíñüíñ"
5.0,".. and I'm not handy at all.  Had a friend come over, and we were able to put this in (and it looks great!) in under 45 minutes.  Found a few videos online that showed how to replace these, and got some of the suggested ""Self leveling Caulk"" - worked like a charm."
5.0,"Beautiful, unique, well made(embroidery),nice quality material. Great all around for the price! My wife is very tiny but bust measurement was right on in ad, so we were surprised that it was too big but it will work.  Too bad it didn't come in Ex-Sm would of been perfect!! Our advice to smaller Ladies ignore the order 1 to 2 sizes up in most &#34;Asian Size&#34; clothing your usual xs/sm will fit fine & ordering up in sz will result in disappointment when item is too large!!üòïüòØüòû"
5.0,Loved it! It made a great gift!
5.0,"Beautiful! Fits great. Train is not quite as long as expected, but very flattering."
5.0,Everything I was looking for. Dainty and cute. Material is definitely not worth the price though.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my Grandmother this year for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES it! It is gorgeous and eye catching! She also loved the loop on the charm and how it will never allow the necklace to turn! Definitely worth the small price.
5.0,"Love this tutu for my 3 year old, she is tall and the 2T-4T fit nice and snug! The skirt is really awesome and stays upright without wilting down. She feels like a true little ballerina in it. Just ordered a 2nd as a gift for her 4 year old friend. I did size up for her 4 year old friend to the 4T-6T size so it will last her longer. I will totally buy again in another color."
5.0,Very cute! My daughter loves hers! She likes wearing one on one side and a stud on the other and having both left and right earrings gives her the option to pick! Quality is okay but expected for the price
5.0,Good. .so happy
5.0,"This is one of the most beautiful dresses I have ever worn! Plus, it's very comfortable. I could totally see someone wearing a white version of this as a wedding dress. I am pleased with quality. The color red lace does not quite match the color of the red skirt, but it doesn't bother me."
5.0,I am thankful for all the reviews. I ordered a smaller size and it fit PERFECTLY!! My daughter wears 18m and I ordered the 6-12m size. It is such an adorable outfit and the quality exceeded my expectations for the price.
5.0,better than the other costumes on amazon. I had to return 2 other costumes. This one fit well for me and looks great!
5.0,This is so much fun
5.0,"Great fit. Low profile hats can be hit or miss and be crooked and weird, but the two hats I've ordered from these guys have been spot on.  Great hat."
5.0,Thanks! Good Job!
5.0,My Granddaughter loved it.  Fits as expected.  Washes up great.
5.0,"Dainty, beautiful and functional... Just what I was looking for and they have 15&#34; necklaces, which are tough to find. My order came in a timely fashion, and they enclosed a black velvet drawstring pouch, for gift giving. Very classy!"
5.0,Super warm but runs really big
5.0,I love this dress! It‚Äôs beautiful and quality is really great! I would recommend it to anyone!
5.0,"I recently received an Apple Watch 5 in Space Gray Aluminum as a gift. The silicone sport band it came with is very good, but I wanted a metal bracelet for a dressier day to day look. Apple has really lost its mind pricing its stainless band at $449 -- more than the watch itself (?!) so I went looking here on Amazon.<br /><br />Juuk seems to be aiming for higher quality at a reasonable price, so I checked out their website and liked their attention to detail. I'm sure some of the less expensive Chinese bands are good, but you never know what you're getting for $19 or what have you, and I liked the looks of this one, which is styled a bit like the Apple SS model and the excellent solid-link bracelet on my favorite traditional watch.<br /><br />On receipt, the Juuk band was very well packaged and looks great ""in person."" It's a bit lighter in color than the almost-black watch, but blends perfectly. I'd actually prefer this satin gray to a black band, which would be too similar to the silicone one I already have. It's light and comfortable, and so far I couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />A couple of tips: I didn't notice written directions in the packaging, and at first thought removing links to adjust the fit would be a problem, but after finding Juuk's helpful video on YouTube, I noticed the slick custom tool almost hidden in the packaging. It's three small spikes on thin rectangular block, and it's poked into place at the end of the packing material, which is exactly the same width, such that it's almost invisible. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's so clever it's easy to miss. Once I found it, the video showed how simple it is to remove and replace links, and I had it adjusted in just a couple of minutes.<br /><br />I've noticed some people saying the band doesn't fit the 4 or 5 watch, and it looks like this may have been the case last  year, but the one I received fit easily and precisely. You need to depress the small buttons on the band (not the watch) and insert both ends at the same time so one end doesn't put the other out of position. I didn't notice the buttons at first, and the band absolutely will not slide into place unless you do. Once in, it's a perfect, secure fit. It removes just as easily by pressing the release buttons on the watch case.<br /><br />Once on the wrist, the aluminum material is very light, which I think is appropriate with the light aluminum watch.  It doesn't pinch wrist hairs. I particularly like the disappearing butterfly clasp, which clicks solidly into place. The dual-button release feels precise and aligns the band perfectly. It looks great and is quite comfortable. I wonder about the durability of the aluminum alloy and how scratch-resistant it will be, but other hard-anodized aluminum things I've owned, like flashlights, are quite strong and very hard to scratch, so I think it may do well.<br /><br />I'll update this review if the band doesn't wear well, but my first impression is that this is exactly what I was looking for -- a good-looking band that suits the watch and doesn't cost the truly silly amount Apple is charging for its branded metal band.<br /><br />Five stars. I think this may be a better-looking band than the black one from Apple. The smooth gray color and lightweight material are well-suited to the watch, and while it's not cheap, it seems very well made for the price.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5.0,Love the dress sad it didn't all come but I'm gonna keep it
5.0,This is the perfect tote! Love it!
5.0,The quality of this is good there put together well. The picture is good. Handle multiple washings without Shrinking or fading
5.0,"I bought this for my sister who recently had a baby.  She is a little insecure about her fuller figure right now so I wanted to find something that would cover a little more than a regular bathing suit.  The neckline is higher so you don't have to worry about the girls popping out, but the spaghetti straps keep it fashionable.  The artfully placed ruffles kind of hide the tummy area without looking like a mumu.  The fabric drapes beautifully and it looks great in or out of the water."
5.0,This watch meet my expectations. Nice quality. I'm very pleased. I received this for a discounted price.
5.0,Very good for walking and fits perfect.
5.0,"The size runs small!  I bought the usual size and it was small I went back for one size more and it was perfect, I have washed this piece and kept the size and colors as it is seen in the picture!<br />I recommend this product!"

5.0,"Cute dress, very comfortable and fits perfectly. I'm 5'4 135 and bought a Small. Washed it in cold and it came out fine."
5.0,Glasses are great quality especially for the price! They are packaged nicely and protected so no scratching will take place. They are a good shape and fit the face well. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and excited to wear these!!

5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 226lbs, a bit curvy.<br />I took a large,<br />Fits perfect for the occasion, with heels it was barely showing my shoes. It‚Äôs a little see through so I would recommend no unties or a the string thongs. I want a gold for NYE."
5.0,Cute little case. Good quality! Arrived with all components!

5.0,"Love, love this purse. It is a large bag, but not too heavy. It fits just right over my shoulder. This is the real deal at an excellent price. I have many Coach bags, most from the Coach store at malls. Thrilled to find this quality bag at this price. Would buy again."
5.0,Best socks ever. Long live darn tough

5.0,"Loved it! Couldn‚Äôt have been happier, wore to the renaissance fair for the first time! Just had to make some adjustments to it because I‚Äôm short but over all it was everything I expected!"

5.0,Just as it should be. Works great and it‚Äôs so comfortable I forgot I even had it on.
5.0,"Fits good ,looked nice"
5.0,"Perfectly beautiful, nicely crafted and very strong. Manufacturer should make deals with the blender bottle sales peeps because these are perfect for attaching to my breakfast-to-go bottle, leaving my hands free for all of the rest of my hustle to work paraphernalia every morning.<br /><br />Would be nice to have more colors to match my various bottles and carabiners."
5.0,"super cute! it's smaller than I imagined but in the best way, I'm giving this as a gift to a little girl (3 year old) and was hoping it wouldn't be too chunky, but it's perfect! The silver chain is very good quality too."

I use it for work, parties, galas, and even casual events. I have even fallen asleep in it overnight a couple times. I have  44"" hips, 45"" bust and 42"" waist and am 5'2. I ordered large, it fits perfectly. In the winter/cool fall, Ive even worn it with boots and pants underneath."
5.0,"Awesome necklace. I got it for my 6 year old boy, and he loves it, but I've sneaked it out of his bathroom to wear it a couple of times myself."
5.0,"The eye glass holders work perfectly.  Since Covid-19 we are required to wear masks in public. When using my mask, I found my  eye glasses would slip off my face if I looked down due to the mask ear loop.  Now I don't have to worry about dropping my eye glasses.  The eye glass holders are made of sturdy material and are adjustable for any type of eye glasses.."
5.0,Nice feeling shirt. I like itüòÄ
5.0,"Super cute. Quality better than looks in the pictures. As with any of these swim shirts, a beast to get on. Belly shows a little"
5.0,These were a hit with my daughter who plays softball. Great quality and just as described. Arrived early to as an added bonus.
5.0,"If your wrist size falls in between the sizes, I suggest going for the smaller size as the band stretches and is flexible.  Great price and color choices. Band was easy to install and is secure."

5.0,Just fit. The fabric feels very nice.
5.0,Great beanie! It's very warm and not itchy at all!
5.0,I love this bra so much I ordered as second one immediately!  It has great support and is very attractive.

5.0,My engagement ring is size 5.5 so I ordered size 6. It fits perfectly! It is a little thinner than I was expecting but I love it.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9c57ecccb3c3e9b77b083f762a5d0f92]] I think this is a beautiful and well needed item. It has a beautiful appearance and a sturdy hold.
5.0,Looks amazing on a NATO strap. Classic Casio for daily wear.
5.0,"All the colors make it so easy to go with whatever I'm wearing. I like to tease my hair and put on a head band with one of these on it. It looks cute and accents the colors in my outfit. The size is perfect too. They aren't obnoxiously large or awkwardly small. I just wish that these ones had one prong on the clip instead of two, because it would make it easier to slide under the ribbon on my headbands."
5.0,I love how it looks and feel on my wrist not only is it super cute but super comfortable. Definitely recommend.
5.0,I seriously love these joggers. I will definitely be buying more!!

5.0,"Kids loved it for Halloween,  numerous complements from neighborhood parents.  Great materials and great buys."
5.0,"I bought my first pair in 2014 and a year later I lost them. So I bought the second pair in 2015 and I lost them too. I will buy a third pair this year and hopefully wont lose them....<br /><br />These are simply great. They fit perfectly and the color, feel and quality of the frame is just awesome. The lenses arent glass made, yet still polarized and nice. They could be cheaper, no question. But they are not Chinese made, it makes a difference (price-wise)."
5.0,Fabric is soft and perfect. Love the length. Fits as expected. Great product.
5.0,Love this glasses.  They look sharp with whatever you are wearing and I like the case.  I also like that they feel light so you do not have to worry about the line on your nose.
5.0,Good briefs. Will reorder.
5.0,My Daughter really liked her card i gave her she put it in her wallet
5.0,"At first glance these socks resemble Nike Elite basketball socks, just missing the swoosh symbol. One major difference is that you get 4 pairs of these for the price of one pair of the other. These socks have a little more stretch to them. They feel like they have about the same amount of cushion. The only remaining question is if they stand up to the test of time but only time will tell that. They appear to be quality made so I would assume the answer to be yes. If you don't need the swoosh I would recommend these without hesitation."
5.0,"Love this dress! It can be dressed down or dressed up for a night out. I love the fit as well. Very flattering to my body type. I did have to buy a special bra,  the strapless bras I have, were showing in the back and in the front ‚Äúpeak hole‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt feel like it provided enough support to go without a bra. However, I am very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Super comfortable and sized perfect
5.0,these cats are very pretty and if taken care of they will give you many years of enjoyment! My daughter had two that kept hitting each other and she‚Äôs kept losing stones because they are only glued in place but I‚Äôm hoping these replacements will be better taken care of now that she knows the problem! thanks for having them in stock!!!
5.0,It‚Äôs soooo cute!! Perfect for my Loli collection for cosplay for TikToks lol and to gamers stream with it on ! I‚Äôm so excited to show it off I already got a lot of compliments on my social media about it .. hurry and grab before all the ladies take it oh and it fits amazing especially if you got a pear body like me ‚Ä¶ the breast area is snug but nothing like a cute nip slip lol Jkjk
5.0,I gave this to my niece for her graduation/enlistment gift. She loved it. I was very happy with the size and the quality and she was also. It laid very nicely on her chest just below her neck.

5.0,Absolutely beautiful ! Wear it a everyday and hasn't gotten messed up . Would love to try their rest of their jewelry. I've had it for over a month and still like the day I got it !!
5.0,Love this dress. Beautiful
5.0,Fits perfectly and the quality was great!
5.0,This shoe is perfect for my racquetball game. I bought this to try as this was the first time i am buying this brand and overwhelmed by the quality of the product. It has beat my expectation and wonderful job done by the makers of this shoe. Can't thank you more for such a perfect shoe for such a reasonable price.
5.0,Great product. They fit great.
5.0,Beautiful lines and flow‚Ä¶runs a little big.
5.0,"The tent is good sized and looks to be of good quality. I have just set it up inside the house and not used it yet but set up and take down was fast and easy. Feels pretty light when packed, though it does not get too small because of the poles."
5.0,"They are really comfortable, delivered fast and my kid loves them"
5.0,My granddaughter loves this ring. A very stylish ring. Well made.
5.0,Safety purposes when walking around during the day.........the safety sock slippers stay and do not stretch like so many brands
5.0,"Super soft, great color. Fits true to size, a really comfortable. Definitely thinking about getting the other colors."
5.0,"Love this dress, my husband bought it for me as a gift. The pattern is so cute, the material is heavy enough you can wear it without a bra but not revealing and still airy. Hoping the print stays nice after being washed."
5.0,My girl loves these and the fit nicely.
5.0,"Fabric is not stretchy nor clingy not see-through. If you are looking for a dress to cover 'problem areas' without looking oversized, and still being cute and casuel then this dress is perfect. Careful with drying heat as I accidentally shrunk mine some but can still wear it. It's just shorter now."
5.0,A mi hijo le encanto es muy practico para los ni√±os se entretiene mucho
5.0,Very happy with the knit cap. It fits my small head and is adorable.

5.0,I love them. Perfect size
5.0,Perfect for camera n easy setup
5.0,Fit perfectly in my purse for international travel with the ease of not having to search for passport or IDs
5.0,Nice top.  Have ordered this brand previously.  It is a bit large on me but my weight is 126 so should probably have ordered small rather than medium.
5.0,"It's a beautiful dress that fits me perfectly and is figure flattering. I have a bit of a tummy that the dress hid well.  When I wore it, I got several compliments. Based on how happy I was with this dress, I bought a second one made by Miusol. The material is nice and a good weight, not too heavy or too light.<br />The only negative is that there is no backing on the embroidery as others have mentioned. This torn up my stockings. It wasn't a huge deal, as it could only be seen if I pulled the hem up a bit. Lesson learned, I just won't wear it with stockings again. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't find the embroidery to be itchy."
5.0,These are warm like mittens for your feet! Beautiful assortment of colors. Will definitely purchase again.
5.0,"My daughter loves looking pretty, but she also loves to run around in the dirt at school.  She has worn these shoes almost every day since I gave them to her and they are holding up beautifully.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Durable construction<br />-Comfortable and easy to put on<br />-Attractive and girly.<br /><br />Con's:<br />-None"
5.0,As expected. Fast shipping.<br />Thank you!
5.0,"This dress is adorable, and totally worth the buy. It does feel kinda snug around the part of my body where the bottom of my bra hits, and it doesn‚Äôt have any stretch, but I expected that after reading the other reviews. I have an odd shape (5‚Äô2‚Äù, 130-135lbs, 36D chest, and I like pizza üòÇ) but this is the first dress that I‚Äôve found that doesn‚Äôt come down past my knees. The pattern is cute, and I like the design. Typically I have to decide between too long and too loose or too short and too tight, but this one is the closest to my actual shape. I COULD order a large, but it would be too long and slightly too large everywhere else. I honestly like the fit and the ‚Äúflowy-ness‚Äù is perfect for the occasion I purchased it for. (My best friends baby shower) I don‚Äôt typically write such detailed reviews, but After how difficult it was for me to pick this dress, I decided to leave the most detailed description I could. Really hope this helps and it‚Äôs totally worth the buy."
5.0,"Purchased 2 anklets as a birthday present to myself.  These are not dainty anklets and they are a true statements piece.  I wear them with my mood, so its not a constant wear for me."
5.0,"I have been looking for smaller shoulder pads for a couple years.  I happened on these by accident when I was searching for the pads that I had used for years.  I was so impressed by my purchase, that I ordered two more sets.  I never want to be without these....a very pleased customer.  Delivery was very quick and free shipping was an added bonus."
5.0,Awesome product for the price. Try these before buying the expensive ones. They are fantastic
5.0,"This necklace definitely makes a statement and I've gotten good comments wearing it.  I've worn it several times, even while carrying an infant who loves to tug at it and haven't had any issues, so especially considering the price, I'm very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"This product ain't no joke!!! It gave me a perfect hour glass shape! I have tried a lot of waist cinchers and this one is the best!!! It is extremely firm, leaves no bulges, and engages your core when you wear. Forces me to sit up straight as well which is good for my back. It is also very comfortable. However I wear it for hours a day so the bones started to come out. However this can easily be fixed by re sewing the fabric above it. Otherwise I highly recommend this. I just got a second one with a smaller size. LOVE it!"
5.0,I love our new little leg warmers. They are so cute and exactly what I wanted. She is going to look so cute this Christmas.
5.0,"Love this! So cute, and comfortable! Planning to buy several more in other colors!"

5.0,This is the perfect size purse for everyday.  I love it.
5.0,Very beautiful watch.
5.0,"I bought 3 sets and my children love them, if you want it fitted then buy your size but if you want it a little baggy like the young people wearing it then buy a size up."
5.0,A gift for my boyfriend.  He wore it when he returned to work and co workers got a good laugh.  Thank.  Stay safe.
5.0,"Le result√≥ muy √∫til a mi hija, ya que realiz√≥ un viaje de estudios y fue parte de su equipaje"
5.0,I'm surprised at the quality of the fabric.  It's a light stretch jersey but super soft and silky.  It hangs nicely .  Couldn't wait to wear it!
5.0,"I bought a pair for myself and my daughter to use for camping. These are comfortable, fit snugly, and provide both insulation and protection from stepping on anything lying on the ground. Great buy."
5.0,I love this bathing suit! It's soo cute. The top is lightly padded and has wire to keep my boobs in check! I ordered a size up because that's what I usually do when ordering bathing suits online but it actually turned out to be a little big. Not by too much so I'm thinking that washing it will help with that. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. The material doesn't feel cheap and feels great on my body!
5.0,Sooooo soft! Not see thru and they stretch over my size 14 self. Comfy and I love the pattern! I will slowly be getting more patterns!
5.0,"I love my bracelet from my husband that inspires  my battle with multiple sclerosis and letting everyone know about my battle with this MS disease Thank you Inspired Silver, Amazon & Husband (Frank)"
5.0,These are nice and large and fold down nicely. I like the little tab they have which allows them to attach to the bag carousels for easier filling.
5.0,It was a gift for my daughter and it looks great.
5.0,"The cheer team got this for our coach, and she really likes it. Great gift idea."
5.0,GREAT FIT!! Bought others but these fit the best

5.0,"Look better in person, not too flashy."
5.0,My grandson wears it proudly to collect our eggs
5.0,very cute made really cute bracelets and earings
5.0,"Absolutely in love with this ring! We didn't have much to spend on bands and this ring has exceeded my expectations. I wear it ALL the time, I've sanded, painted, washed dishes etc. and not one stone has fallen out. It still looks like the day I received it."
5.0,Love this product! Fits great!
5.0,Goodness! The sweat band keep my eyes from stinging in the middle of MANY traumas in and out of sterile fields. Did not make me hot at all! Which was something I was worried about. Since I run hot at all times.

5.0,We took a beach trip to Santa Monica beach and my son looked adorable is this shark swimsuit. It was a big hit everyone thought it was so cute. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs true to fit. My son is very tall for his age and it fit him perfectly.
5.0,"I bought these for my barbells. They are a bit small... they give the measurements as 4mm and I feel that's correct so I don't know why people are butt hurt about that. I wouldn't use these on dermal, I have one and these are way too big imo"
5.0,"Pros: 1. They are the exact color and discription as on the website.<br />2. They are made of thick/sturdy materials.<br /><br />Cons: With the exception of the light pink belt, all of the colors are primary which heavily leans toward male. My daughter likes to wear hot pink, purple, yellow, basically softer (Easter- like) colors. Their current choices do not work with her school polos. Consider expanding the color palette."
5.0,üòçüòçüòçLOVE THEM!!
5.0,"This is basically a replica of the Petzl Sequoia Srt 2014 harness, the only difference is  it doesn't have many add-on places for accessories like the Petzl  Caritool. At a fraction of the price of the big brand competitors this harness is awesome, quality is good but you have to double check the stitching for long ends that they did not cut, all you have to do is take a lighter and burn the long ends not really a big deal especially for the price. Another thing I recommend is where the bridge rings connect to the harness to the belt you need to reposition the straps because it was not positioned correctly. Other than that it is comfortable just make sure you don't tighten the thigh straps to tight  because once your full body weight is suspended it will be uncomfortable because you did not account for the weighted pressure."
5.0,Love this dress! Very sexy! I didn‚Äôt end up wearing it bc it was a bit too tight for my chest (too sexy for work party).
5.0,My husband gets compliments on this shirt all the time. It really is a cool design.
5.0,This band is so cute. It is made well and the design is very attractive. I will for sure be buying more.
5.0,"Perfect for a Bikram yoga workout. Stays in place, good fit, holds up in the washing machine. Also like the colors."
5.0,Totally awesome product!
5.0,Silicone nose pads for eye glasses worked great.  Easy to apply over the original pads and the soft silicone is much more comfortable eliminating the ‚Äòdents‚Äô on my nose from the original pads on my eyeglasses.  I will be buying more of them as spares.
5.0,Beautiful bag. Great delivery and packaging.
5.0,My son loves these. I have bought several.  They have the filter pocket if you want to use it.
5.0,My kid love them!

5.0,My son loves these and will only wear this particular google when he swims competitively.
5.0,Love these gloves. They are so warm. The best part is they stay on because of the zipper coming up the side!
5.0,"The stone was fine, but not exactly what my wife was looking for in her birthday present.  Because she had not opened the gift for a month (I ordered well before her birthday), she was not aware that the stone was not what she wanted.  TriJewels went above and beyond, working with us to resolve the issue quickly.  We will definitely order from TriJewels again."
5.0,"I actually love these sandals.  They are extremely comfortable and fit as expected.  Unfortunately, I purchased them to wear with a specific skirt, and the color doesn't match.  So, I'll have to keep looking...."

5.0,Very cute and practical
5.0,Fast delivery. Very nice item
5.0,Great muscle tank. Not tight around the waist.
5.0,This shoe was very comfortable and the support was great for me. Unfortunately I had to return them because my new job requires me to wear leather uppers and I bought these primarily for work.
5.0,"Best product ever is my 2nd time I bought and I really like to bad that doesn‚Äôt have an extra small size too, I loosing lots of weight üò¨"
5.0,Just as pictured. Lightweight. Flowy. Vibrant in colors. I think you can wear with biker shorts or leggings. It doesn't really have stretch to it. If you are wanting a more comfortable fit prib should go up a size. If you are ok with it being fitted order your size. Hope this helps!
5.0,"VERY pretty, came in an envelope and was a bit tangled. I purchased it as a stocking stuffer for my daughter and I may have to come up with a way to package it and wrap it so that it is not tangled when she opens it. But great length, appears to be good quality and very pretty. I love the three layers and they are all connected so that it will lay nicely."
5.0,Long wear to sleep in mostly
5.0,"I love this hat! It looks gorgeous, it‚Äôs comfortable, and it doesn‚Äôt smoosh my hair. The medium fits perfectly - not too loose and not to tight - and covers my ears. It really looks like a much more expensive hat. The fake fur is amazingly real looking. Looking forward to cold weather! Just ordered one for my mom. Getting lots of compliments on mine."
5.0,Cute! My pre-teen wore it to a wedding and loved it.
5.0,I absolutely love these bands.  I originally got these bands for my Fitbit and when I purchased my smartwatch I ordered some more.  These bands are soft and sturdy.  Super colorful and hold up amazingly.
5.0,"Cute , lightweight.  Just the right sparkle for the size. Great price."
5.0,Good quality robes
5.0,"Hat has a premium quality feel to it, almost MLB Nee Era like. The only complaint is that bill is probably some hard plastic material so it makes it<br />Hard to mold it but I like it"
5.0,"Beautiful dress I got for my teenage daughter, she wears it to school with leggings and boots. Looks fantastic!!"
5.0,Great quality just as I'd expect from Pandora. True Pandora bracelet and as expected. Would buy again!!

5.0,"I wear eye protection (goggles/glasses) and surgical mask daily for work during the pandemic, and I was having a hard time completing any paperwork with eye protection on due to fogging. I know lots of you can relate...this is the second time I've tried an anti-fogger, and it works reasonably well (hey, we know it's not magic), especially if I use it every couple of days on my goggles and don't clean them off too much. I even bought extra for a colleague having the same problem. I will keep using it."
5.0,Both very soft and fit well. V neck and the bottom seam comes up at the hip so it looks feminine and curvy.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Nice quality and perfect size.
5.0,Adjustable and good quality. Just what I expected. The nautical graphic is something I really like!

5.0,"My family is not fond of number 45, and my older son (19) and daughter (23) are very verbal about this. I bought them each a shirt for a little ""Christmas Eve"" present.  The shirts are thick, and a little big, so I would order a size down. They're mens size, so they will not be fitted like a woman's tee-shirt. I wish I would've ordered my daughter a medium instead of a large, but. . . This will probably shrink a little bit after washing and drying. Over all, a great inexpensive gift for anyone who believes 45 should be 86'd.  ;)"
5.0,Working well so far. I usually get a breakout from metal bands.
5.0,"Super cute and well fitting, I'm 5'2 and 115g  this fits perfectly. It is great quality and workmanship. Been using for awhile now with no issues at all and it washing just fine on regular cycle."

5.0,Beyond pleased with this product!! I have extensive scarring and issues due to mastectomy and reconstruction and have relied primarily on sports bras the last few years but need cups - this was a perfect fit.  The only issue i have is that the lace is a little itchy but that will likely soften with wash.  Will be ordering more items from this line.
5.0,prefect just what i was looking for thanks
5.0,"We had an 80's themed party to attend, and my son (recently watching pretty in pink) wanted to dress as ""Duckie Dale"".  I quickly scoured amazon for the accessories and was pleasantly surprised when I received the glasses.  They were the perfect size for my boy  (he's 10yrs old), packed securely (no bends or scratches), and sturdy material.  They will need to be ""adjusted"" to properly fit his face, but other than that, THEY ARE GREAT GLASSES!!  and so much cheaper than local party stores"

5.0,So awesome and well made. My husband is a 62 year old Dennis the Menace and is very tough on everything he wears. He wears these all the time and they've been washed  a bunch. Good quality!

5.0,Love it! I got a medium and I'm 5 ft 7 and 145 lbs and it fits like a dream! Lands right above my knee. The navy blue is light weight enough to be cool bur thick enough to not be see through.

5.0,I love my little pendant just what I was expecting I love the size of the pendant is stands out and gets a lot of attention. The necklace is just right little bit longer would have been Great
5.0,"They fit well, not too dark and do not change the color spectrum significantly."
5.0,Absolutely love this purse! And it always gets complimentsü•∞
5.0,"I was looking for a bag that would hold my Surface Pro 3 and a few misc things that I carry back and forth to work.  I'll be honest I was hesitant to by the bag, because the reviews I read kept saying the bag was too small.  Finally I decided to just buy it and give it a try.  So glad that I did.  I love it!  The bag is on the small size, but that's what I wanted.  It holds my Surface Pro 3 with keyboard.  Additionally I store the power cord, small mouse, and a notepad.  The bag can still closes with no issues.  It's super cool and keeps my Surface Pro safe.  Exactly what I needed!"
5.0,"Cute dress.  I ordered an extra large, I'm 12 or 14, and it was a bit snug so I'm going to order the xxl.  The top is super cute. The bottom part is a bit poofy and stiff but it stills works for me.  If u don't have a belly or a butt that sticks out you'll score with this dress.<br />I think it's very well made for the price."
5.0,"I love my Fitbit band, the colors stay on without wearing off!"
5.0,"This ring looks expensive, but it isn't."
5.0,Works great to hang ornaments.  Each color packaged separately in a zip bag then all bags in another bag taped shut so no leaking at all.

5.0,My fiance loves them. :)
5.0,"Perfect fit, very comfortable and I wish I could have one in every color. If you're looking for a navy belt this is the one. Prefect color navy. I think I'm going to order another one for back up."

5.0,I gave them to my Granddaughter for her Birthday She Loves Them

5.0,"It was a little hard pulling up, I have bigger legs, but once I got it up my legs and over my butt it fit really well. I love it. Could support the girls more, but it is not terrible being it is a once piece.<br /><br />Received many compliments on it, a few of my friends want one now."
5.0,I am so grateful for my locket I carry it everywhere I go in my pocket and wear it sometimes thank you so much for doing such an amazing job on my beloved ‚ù§Ô∏èMilo

5.0,super comfortable and very absorbent putting on after shower  would definately buy again

I HIGHLY recommend these earrings, guys! The quality for the price is amazing!<br /><br />It would be SOOO easy to give these 5 stars. They are beautiful.

5.0,"love the high waisted undies with lace they are so soft and comfy, they fit per the measurements they provide, buying more for sure!"
5.0,These worked great for my Kazooie cosplay. It little difficult to keep them up but if you fold over the tops then they fit fine.
5.0,"Love this top. Very versatile. Subtle, but great detailing on the overlay. My shoulders are a little on the broad side, so I like shirts that camouflage them."
5.0,"Love this dress. The quality is good, colors are so pretty and it is so comfy. It is a perfect summer dress especially for Texas summers. I got so many compliments about the dress. I am 5ft 4in 145 lbs and small fit perfectly."
5.0,Wife's favorite socks. They work.
5.0,I Purchased this as a gift for a very close friend‚Äòs 50th birthday. All of the things included to make the presentation of this gift was a homerun! I would definitely purchase from this company again! The attention to detail is spot on and the quality is classy and looks expensive!
5.0,These got here very fast and almost every one of them is adorable!! So worth it
5.0,Take note petals fall from metals so make sure you tighten it. Or be careful opening it! I want to give it lower rating because of that but this earrings are just so gorgeous! Definitely statement piece! It stood out as I paired it with my silver dress! I love it!!! The other earrings that came with it looks exactly as pictured and beautiful as well but not as eye catching as the petals design! I love it!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c24555c9e8ff84b5d1de409a8101e9e3]] I absolutely love this band. Very comfortable. Easy to install. I work in a fast pace environment so this band is perfect.  Going to purchase in other colors!
5.0,"Oh my, this is a Fab u los belt!!!!! Easy to cinch, and I need to figure out a more reliable way to release it, but I am sure it is me, not the belt. Just don't have the muscle memory. At 64, it is an old dog, larnin' a new trick."
5.0,"Color is gorgeous and it fits well.  I am 5'4 and will need to wear a wedge shoe.  If you are 5'6 or above, you can get away with a sandal."
5.0,They were a gift for my aunt and she absolutely loved them. The material is so soft and stretchy.
5.0,"This Rose was worth every penny , I'm widowed and in my early 60's and so is she, after I gave her this magical flower she knew she wanted to be with me from then on and into our golden years."
5.0,"This is a unique boutique like item. Everyone compliments it, asks where I bought it. It is soft but strong knit. It reaches mid back when I wear it wraped around shoulders with buttons down front. It adds nice layering touch that can be casual or dressy with heels and bracellets. Beware it catch on some. The versatility is exciting. I like changing it up and being creative how I drape it or button it .There was not any instructions so I experimented. I use this often and love to put on the top inside a tote bag. It folds flat so I have a comfy blanket for travel, put over my lap, or wrap around my neck to spruce up a tank top.  I love it and always have it so they tease me I am linus. It is light,warm,stylish and versitle. Buttons are securely sewed on. I wish there were more colors to buy. I have pink and beige. The color pink is really a berry color, darker than rose but lighter than burgandy. It can be worn asemetrical or traditional. I cannot believe there are not more reviews. This buy is trendy for teens, practical,elegant for women of all ages and warm enough for snuggling on a flight or in a rocky. Perfect length and width. Must see and feel to believe. I am on again to buy one for a gift. Perfect price. I cannot believe the value."
5.0,my husband loves this watch. this is the only watch he will wear and work in. its slinder design is why he perfers it. he goes thru one every year.i usually buy it at walmart but this year i found it on amazom. great deal
5.0,"My son has a big noggin. Not even 3 but his head is 21‚Äù around so I decided to get him the biggest size. It‚Äôs perfect because I can tighten the back to fit, but he still has room to grow. His last hat like this didn‚Äôt have a hard brim so when he got it wet it was hang in his face. This is perfect to get the sun off but still comfortable!"
5.0,"Opaque, flattering, forgiving.<br /><br />Other reviewers are right about the details making this cover up special - the beads and the little band on the back make this cover-up special, and the material is opaque (in black), soft, and not that cheap polyester feel of so many beach cover ups.<br /><br />Sizing: I ordered the medium, and I'm 5'2&#34; and short-waisted with postpartum figure woes. The dress fell to mid-thigh (so taller women be warned), didn't cling too tightly to anything, and managed to look flattering. I had my doubts about the drawstring waist, but I was really surprised by the flattering fit. This really looks like a cute dress.<br /><br />I could wear this to a casual beach dinner or run around the resort after the pool without being self-conscious about wearing a skimpy beach cover-up in my not-so-fit figure. Highly recommend you give this one a try."
5.0,Good band for the price. Was surprised at how lightweight it is. Definitely dresses up the watch. Very easy to get on and off.<br />5 Removable links. I had to remove 2 and it fits perfectly. Happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Awesome, exactly what I wanted!"
5.0,Simple LOVE IT...THANK YOU
5.0,Really like the sizes! Product as described and arrived on time.
5.0,"Bought it for my gf as she loves to go fishing with me, do things in the yard, etc...while still ""looking cute""  as she always says LOL  So a hat she could put her hair up and keep off her neck was a discussion one day.  Surprised her with this and she has not taken it off all weekend.  Great buy and the criss cross style allows her to wear her pony tail high or low."
5.0,Cute shoes. My kids get compliments on them everywhere we go.
5.0,"Metal Construction, very durable. Perfect size."
5.0,I love zmart socks this is the second time i ordered them...great quality. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.
5.0,This jumper fit very well and I received sooo many compliments.....
5.0,Great leather-free wallet. If this item remains available I'll buy it again when it's time for a new wallet.<br /><br />Holds up well to daily use and has a nice slim profile that isn't too bulky in your back pocket.
5.0,I‚Äôm so happy with this it‚Äôs the best
5.0,"Beautiful dress, nice heavy fabric on the skirt and the dress fits perfectly right out of the bag! Very rare for me as I'm only 5'1&#34; and about 115lbs. The small was perfect!"
5.0,I need something to wear for a Harlem night's party! Tried it on as soon as it arrived. THIS will work! Can't wait to get the full look on. Great dress for the price.
5.0,So cute and soft! It fit my grandson perfectly and he looks adorable in it!
5.0,I liked the outfit
5.0,"I ordered a SMALL and this is a VERY beautiful dress. I had to return because the sleeves and basically the entire top part are so loosely fit, it did not look right on me. If you have larger upper body then this will look good on you."
5.0,"Amazing packaging, great shade of blue!"
5.0,"Love it, elegante and beautiful"
5.0,"These boots are super cute, I underestimated how cute they where. The quality is excellent and the go with just about any outfit."

5.0,My brother loves them all!!
5.0,"It came a lot larger than expected, but I dig it!<br />Super flowy and comfortable.  I wear it probably too much.  Casual or an out to dinner dress."
5.0,The kids loved them for my daughters birthday party.
5.0,"These headbands are awesome! They fit perfectly and they're super comfortable. They have stayed in place during a variety of workouts so far (elliptical, rowing machine, deadlifts, squats, etc.)"
5.0,"Silly enough, I bought these because they match the dog lights on my new car, but they asked for a review , and here it is.<br />The glasses are way better quality than I expected. The lenses are glass and the hinges are the kind that don't break.<br /><br />These are way better than their low price would make you thibkZ"
5.0,"I'm normally a small (5'5"" 120 lbs) but I ordered a Medium and it fit perfectly. I may order more for the summer!"
5.0,"Purchased for my 8 month old and they fit perfect! After washing they are very soft and comfy. Does not have a scratchy texture to it. The stretch is just right, not too big and not too tight/small"
5.0,Very comfortable and very warm. Better than what I expected.
5.0,Good quality and thick
5.0,"They're pricey--but worth every penny.  This is my second pair because the dog literally ate my first pair.  They're much better made than most flip flops, and I swear the foot massage they provide really energizes me, helps my slightly arthritic joints.  I like them so much, think they're such great looking flip flops, I almost hate to wear them outside and get them dirty.  But I do.  I just wish Amazon offered them in more colors in women's sizes.  Revs, which is an English company, also has a website from which you can order, and they do ship to the U.S."
5.0,My daughter really loved her shoes they fit perfectly!
5.0,Looks like picture when I put it on.
5.0,I love these masks.  They fit nicely and are comfortable.
5.0,This hat is awesome and appears to be genuine issue! The XXL fit my big ol head perfectly. I wear a 7 3/4 or 7 7/8 hat so I was pleasantly surprised. It matches my flecktarn field jacket as well so I‚Äôm happy I bought it.
5.0,Perfect for my luau flamingo themed baby shower!
5.0,friend loved it
5.0,"I wasn't sure what it would be like. I was getting it for a friend who was becoming a deacon. I thought it was beautiful. I thought maybe she wouldn't like it and I could keep it for myself. Well, she loved it. It's exquisite. Glad I bought it for a great friend."
5.0,It fits a little big for my 10 yr old. She lives it and after tightening up the waist she'll be able to wear it for awhile. Kudos.
5.0,I love this dress I ordered it because I want to match my husband suit as we're going to a wedding it arrived three days early and it matched perfectly I love the way it feels and looks on me the best dress to show off all my curves!!
5.0,Awesome product very soft and warm.
5.0,"The gloves arrived toting a very bad chemical odor (that has faded with a few washings), and 2 loose threads on one thumbhole. The smell even lingered on my hands after I wore them. My cat would keep his distance until I'd taken the gloves off and washed my hands thoroughly- and I don't blame him one bit. I gave up after 4 washings. Too much stankiness!"
5.0,"Nice coat,  keeps you warm and dry. I especially like the lining. Plenty pockets for cell phone, pens.  It‚Äôs got it all.."
5.0,This company (Tideclothes) was awesome to work with.  I sent them a message because my daughter's measurements didn't really match up to the sizes.  They custom made the dress for no extra charge and got it to us well within the needed deadline.  It was beautifully made and looked gorgeous on my daughter.  I would highly recommend!!
5.0,"Very nice mask durable,breathable I like the variety of different styles got a lot of compliments."
5.0,These are beautiful.  They are a little smaller than I originally thought but they get the job done
5.0,They fit so well!
5.0,"I bought this product for my boyfriend, and he loves it. It has a slight slouchiness. The lining is well made and so very soft. It's warm and looks great, having the grey rim on it. I was actually surprised of the quality!"
5.0,"I love the unique frame and color these Sojos sunglasses have. I have never seen a pair quite like them! I recently got hooked on Sojos sunglasses and they are great quality. These frames are definitely big enough for a male or female (some of my other pairs are a bit tighter). I have a small face and these still stay on without any problems. Thank you Sojos for making great quality, affordable sungalasses!!"
5.0,Light as a feather. Stunning!
5.0,The extra large will fit as a medium just a heads up
5.0,"My new FAVORITE!!! I love this dress so much! The colors are remarkable! It‚Äôs so flowy and pretty!<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, the length goes just below my knees- PERFECT for work. Dress is true to size. I wear a large and ordered a large and it fits beautifully!<br /><br /> I will be ordering more (different styles of course! )"
5.0,Cute socks for a Gator fan!!
5.0,I love my threaders!  The cuter they are. I'm buying
5.0,Omg this swimsuit looks exactly as pictured. If your a fan of the little mermaid like I am then this is the perfect swimsuit for you. The material on the swimsuit is nice and it's very well made. I ordered the purple top because my daughter has a very similar swimsuit. I read a few other reviews before purchasing this. I found it to fit me well. I'm not tall I'm 5'3 with a 38dd chest. Like most bathing suits I had to order a size or two bugger because of my chest size. The top half doesn't fit perfect but it's not so bad where I am unable to wear it. Overall the bathing suits fits well. I'm truly satisfied with me and I can't wait to use it at the beach next month.<br />Disclaimer I was given a promo code to give an honest review. Pls feel free to ask any questions.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:8fb9040e2df520bef95f401de43899d2]] Outstanding owl ring, excellent open adjustable sizing, it fits my finger perfectly, the ring is stamped ""S 925"" (silver) inside the ring. Translucent blue owl eyes are stunning, the black center pupils actually move, made like a level, the eyes are sealed plastic partially filled with liquid, containing a black air bubble that moves, love it. The ring feels strong, and of high quality, excellent details to owls face that wraps around your finger comfortably (no green discoloring on fingers or ring). The ring is priced (at the time of my review) at $17.00 which is quite affordable compared to other trendy designs I have seen on many other jewelry sites ranging from $30.00 to $45.00. I liked the ring so much that I put purchased another one. Having one of these rings on your finger is a winning look, for the price as well as the unique design I would highly recommend this ring."
5.0,Good Mask with awesome Customer Service. First time I purchased this mask one of the elastics broke after 2 days and notified the seller and they replaced it with 2. I've ordered several more and theyve  all lasted! Well constructed masks and great Customer Service!

Thank you for caring about your customers!
5.0,"Even though this is costume jewelry, when worn it imitates sterling silver!"
5.0,Easy to put together. Fun.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous!  It fit perfectly and the top is stretchy, which is a huge bonus.  Buttons in the front so also a big bonus.  There is a small zipper in the back, but I was able to pull it up myself.  I received so many compliments in this dress.  Wore it to a friend's wedding and it was just wonderful to wear.  And I never, ever wear dresses.  My boyfriend actually laughed when I first walked out because he didn't know what happened to me.  I can't recommend this enough for a cute night out or an event.  Even my dry cleaner asked where I got it - she ended up ordering one for her daughter!"
5.0,These camisoles are a great deal for the price. They are so lightweight and comfy. They are also not too short or too long. Great buy!

5.0,I love my boots  their not to high or to low...its perfect for me
5.0,"This necklace is a beautiful piece.  The red crystals are vibrant, but overly so.  This is a great piece for Day or evening wear.  Just love it at a great price!"
5.0,"This pants are great and true top size,  I wear a size 13 and ordered a large.  They are comfortable and great for the office.<br />The fabric is not thin or cheap,  has a good feel and it's stretchy"
5.0,This was great for relieving the pain in my knees and it's so comfortable.
5.0,I like them but wish they were a little smaller. I have a thin face and it‚Äôs hard to find glasses of any kind to fit me.
5.0,"They fit well from the start, and are very comfortable. My taps are LOUD, and has brought my dancing up several levels. I also love the way they look!"
5.0,although not Alex and Ani - very similar and really cute
5.0,Very soft and cool
5.0,"I really like the fabric, fit, POCKETS, and waist/ drawstring, of these sweatpants. They fit great, had all the features I wanted, and look nice enough to wear out and about. I am not athletic looking and primarily wanted something comfy to twiddle my thumbs in. Really pleased! I bought them in black, navy, and the green."
5.0,I ordered this chain to hold my ankh pendant and it's perfect. Not too thin or too bulky.It hangs perfectly. I ordered the 24 in. It looks beautiful with my ankh cross. I wear it everyday.

5.0,I love it very nice
5.0,I have ordered so many of these on a regular.. I work at FedEx. They are great for handling all the boxes. The grip is great!!
5.0,"Comfortable and lightweight rain jacket.  The hood provides good coverage and the sleeves can be rolled up if they are too long.  We‚Äôve used it in light rain and my daughter stayed dry.  We haven‚Äôt tried it in heavy rain yet, but I think it will hold up (I‚Äôll update if it isn‚Äôt good for heavy rain).  We use it primarily for a school rain jacket."
5.0,"It was perfect. not heavy, light"
5.0,"Really cute sunglasses! Fit great, look great and came with an amazing case to keep them in! I love these sunglasses"
5.0,I liked everything about it. It was a bday present for my son. After I placed the order I realized I chose a one-size too small. The seller was kind enough and helpful to allow me to upsize the shirt before they shipped. I would purchase from them again.
5.0,"Super warm and soft, fits great, deep pockets and sturdy buttons"
5.0,I got the socks good my wife.  She loved them and said they are very comfortable

5.0,"These are great! I bought them for the grandkids and then ended up keeping some for us. THEN I decided to order more and give out as little Xmas gifts when friends visited, after making them step out side to view all the Xmas lights, the street lights, the lit trees-they are so cool and everyone was wowed at how much fun these were."
5.0,"Glasses are super cute, comfy, and great sun protection!  Would buy again!"
5.0,Fit great and soft material<br />Like the quality as well.<br />Going to buy it in a few other colors after i saw how nice the first one was

5.0,Happy with quality & fit perfectly.  I got her the jacket by the same company with the very cute cut & design of rear view.
5.0,"Bought a Large at first and it fit all except around the bust/shoulders which was too snug to be comfortable.  I'm a 12/14 and a 36C with fairly broad shoulders and then ordered an XL, while a bit more roomy in the skirt (which only made twirling all that more fun!) fit well.  It is a high waist dress and the skirt is very twirly friendly and comes with a small lining and crinoline. I purchased an additional petticoat in bright pink and it was SO CUTE! Highly recommend getting some additional fluff for it, while it looks cute without, putting that petticoat in really made the outfit."
5.0,"Very comfortable, easiest to put on of all I've used. Great value."
5.0,Came brand new! Very satisfied with these. They are the official Nintendo Joy con straps that you would get from buying a switch. Very good price and great quality.

5.0,Absolutely darling.  Well made.

5.0,There‚Äôs nothing to dislike it‚Äôs wort Every penny
5.0,"It's inexpensive, but don't let that fool you! It's a hardcore watch- took it diving for a week and it's still going strong."
5.0,"Beautiful color, just the right weight, and adjustable length. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Very Good. Am Elegant. Thanks.
5.0,Granddaughter LOVED this.  Not the best quality but cute as a button and a good price
5.0,"This is my favorite shirt and I wish it came in more colors.  It fits perfectly!  If you wear a bra, it will show with it when you reach up or bend without stooping; otherwise, the split has a bit of an overlay before it opens up."
5.0,Good quality! Fits good! Very warm!
5.0,"Fun design, great quality!"
5.0,This dress for my 5 ft 130 pound frame perfectly just like a glove !!<br />I am a DD and fit my chest well<br />Love this dress !!

5.0,You can never go wrong with DSG gear. Product is as described. Stayed warm!
5.0,"These Sandler‚Äôs are the best I have ever tried, please make more"
5.0,lovely colour and useful

5.0,very nice looking for the dog lover (wife)
5.0,Not exactly what I was expecting but still a very pretty dress.‚ù§
5.0,"i found this in a tiny, quaint little shop a block away from the ocean while on vacation, but i didn't have any money on me at the time and left feeling heartbroken. i couldn't stop thinking about it, so i went online and googled ""starfish cuff bracelet,"" and there it was! i ordered it right away and i'm so happy i did. this beautiful, unique piece of jewelry is so eye-catching and I love the way it conforms to your wrist with its bendable legs. great for summer if you're into nautical style, but i'm going to probably wear it right through the winter. i do not regret my purchase in the least, and feel i am a happier person just from owning this bracelet."
5.0,"Great picture. It's a gift, so it hasn't been worn yet."
5.0,These earrings are very nice and good quality. I would buy again.
5.0,"They are pretty much old school style.This type have been around forever and are good for a variety of application. Great quality for a low price. Not really good if they get wet. They are ok for things like shoveling snow, light gardening, general chores, , light auto work, painting, etc..  They last long if taken care of a bit. Glad i got these and would buy again"
5.0,"I love this dress, I wore it to my graduation and got a lot of compliments on it... I will be ordering other colors thanks. I didn't get any pictures of the dress sorry but it's a must buy!!!"
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this dress.  It's so comfortable and flowy.  I'm 5'4&#34;, about 120 and I got the small.  It fits nicely to my body without being too snug.  The length was good too so I didn't have to get it shortened.  I get so many compliments and no one can believe it wasn't an expensive dress!  It has a nice boho feel and the slits on the sides are a good addition.  Straps are adjustable too!"
5.0,"So cute, and super-comfortable!!"
5.0,"This is a nice skort. It was purchased based on the size chart but I could have gone down a size smaller. I think it's true to size but for me, it was a little too big. I purchased it for exercising (walking/running) but it's so nice I use it for everyday wear."
5.0,I like these hats and have a few for different seasons.
5.0,"Nothing better than a black sweater to go with everything, and this one is no exception. Fits great, roomy without making you look frumpy. Great for fall with the larger knit pattern. I'm five feet seven inches tall, so it doesn't hang as long on me as it does the model, but is still past the knees, my favorite length of sweater. Will be a nice, just to take the chill off weather sweater during the early days of fall, or I could pair with a sweater dress and scarf when it gets colder."
5.0,This is like a 10mm inner diameter. Do you want that??? Maybe. I didn‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs my bad.
5.0,The length of the clothes is what I need. It's just that the sleeves are a bit long for me. The fabric is also very soft. Very satisfied.
5.0,"I love these. They‚Äôre adorable and stylish, I love wearing them especially with my pjs. Their cute for any age. Honestly want these in every color. Get these, and they have decent quality."
5.0,I didn't have to go to the store to find them and they arrived rapidly and were well priced.
5.0,They fit perfect and I wear them all the time!
5.0,Much cheaper option than some of the expensive brands and the quality and look is just as good.
5.0,"Could use more cushion inside, but overall a good buy. Rain boots are not the most comfortable shoe as is. I am a delivery driver and i need these for rainy days. I swapped out the inserts and was good to go"
5.0,"Great quality, and fits right. I love that it‚Äôs versatile and it looks super cool"
5.0,I love this coat.  It is perfect for the cold weather we are having.  It is long enough that it touches my knees which<br />makes it warmer.  I love the fabric and the fur collar.
5.0,Nice Stuff
5.0,"Nice feel due to what seems like quality materials coupled with quality assembly. No toe seams to annoy; a very nice arch ""hug panel""; nice crew sock height.<br /><br />The socks keep the feet warm, but not too warm. They seem to breathe quite well, too. Very comfortable for all-day wear.<br /><br />Color pattern was different from what we usually buy; it's eye-catching and quite attractive. Perhaps most importantly, the socks washed quite well. No issues with fraying or pilling; no issues with color run or fade.<br /><br />Not cheap, but I think worth every penny. I'm going to assume they hold up. So I'm going with...<br /><br />5 stars."
5.0,"Great pair of fashion aviators! Lightweight but sturdy, the hinges make a perfect fit on your face or on top of your head! And the reflective colors are super fun! The metal is good quality, these don't feel like cheap plastic sunglasses. Great product at a great price! I received this product in exchange for my honest review, not influenced by anything other than my own experience with the product."
5.0,Ordered for my mother and it came in less than 24 hours for a pool party that was the next day! Fit great!
5.0,I purchased this set for my daughter's birthday and she loves it.  Their are two matching bracelets and matching necklaces. She was able to share with her friends. The produce is durable and perfect for teens.
5.0,"I love this.  I am a woman (size 6-8) and ordered this in a medium.  I had see a tuxedo style vest with a satin lapel on the Free People website, but they were sold out.  I looked high and low for another, but it was no where to be found.  So, I decided to try to find a menswear vest that was similar and this is it.  I love it and get tons of compliments on it.  Great quality."
5.0,"Soft, perfect color, doesn't bind or slip down while wearing. Expect longer delivery because it comes from UK. Excellent service, packaging, reasonable cost."
5.0,Love the belt! fits perfectly and looks awesome!
5.0,"At first, I laughed at how large these sunglasses are on me. (I have a smallish face/features.) But then I realized that these are awesome for needing to be outside for any prolonged amount of time.  The lenses are quite dark and the frame is comfortable.  As a melanoma survivor (10+ years!), I try to use multiple layers/types of sun protection, and these glasses are a great addition, especially if I am sitting outside wearing my big hat!"
5.0,Could not have been happier.  I bought the hat for a costume piece and was thrilled with the quality.  It looked beautiful and really completed the outfit.  Can't wait to wear again.
5.0,"Nice and lite material, fits well, washes well"
5.0,"great, comfortable rings. I think I got a size up. Love wearing these to hike in, to the gym, etc."
5.0,i wear this mask all the time and i love the show as well
5.0,I couldn't be HAPPIER!!!<br />The fit is excellent and super comfy around my potbelly!<br /> I need them in white and tan.  Do you have them in those colors?
5.0,Thin shoe but my daughter loves them
5.0,"I love everything about it, it‚Äôs soft & comfortable!"
5.0,"The style the Minnie mouse thing, super cute"
5.0,Good fabric... good quality
5.0,"I love everything about this watch band. Feels the same as my Apple band, just a thinner band for my small wrist (S/M). I‚Äôll be ordering the 3 pack next!"
5.0,"Comfortable, warm and lightweight at the same time. Love how it fits."
5.0,These are the best!  I love them. I get compliments at the gym and when I go out. There's very flattering and fitting..
5.0,great ring like everything about it just ready to order my third one friends love it
5.0,Son hermosos y buena calidad
5.0,"Perfecto, muy Buena qualidade , como visto en la foto"
5.0,Good quality. Good for either male or female. Goes with most anything.
5.0,"Very nice product.  Great for jet ski riding when the water is getting colder.  Not heavy/not a neoprene, just a stretchy fabric.  Best for a thin person as it is very formfitting. Good zipper, though a short cord added on would be nice as it is difficult to reach (in back) for yourself.  Good colors in fabric.  Very satisfied.  Also came within 5 days without special shipping having been paid for."
5.0,"Love it, nice color and flowy so not tight around my stomach"
5.0,"This is my daughter's favorite leotard. She has worn it probably 10 times, and it still looks new. I machine wash it and hang it to dry. It is beautiful and comfortable, and it fits!! I followed the sizing guide--thank you thank you thank you for having a sizing guide that emphasizes the &#34;girth;&#34; that is the only thing that makes sense to measure when you are buying a leotard. We will be back for more leotards from this company!"
5.0,When I tell you I have so many compliments on these glasses I‚Äôm in love will be ordering again soon
5.0,Very Beautiful earings.  Nicely made. Happy with them.
5.0,"Loved these immediately! I usually wear a size 22, so bought a 3XL but they were too big, but they were so soft and cozy, I returned them and got the XXL and they fit perfect. And then I bought a second pair because they are that soft and comfortable. Plus, come on, they are Harry Potter pjs! So fun!"
5.0,My go-to Christmas gift for friends and acquaintances!
5.0,Definitely the perfect dress for dressing up and down. I wear it to work with a blazer. I wear it with jewelry and fun heels to go out with friends. Follow the sizing chart and you'll be fine.
5.0,I use this idems for paracord key chanes.
5.0,We loved these! A couple came with missing stones but great price for the quality!
5.0,"Absolutely love this! Ordered one first, and ended up going back to order all the colors. Super cute and comfortable for my daughter.<br />Fit as expected.<br />I did had to make a minor alteration by stitching the end of the straps because it was a tad too long."
5.0,Love them. Thanks
5.0,Love this necklace very much! Great quality as well
5.0,"I wore this out to a very hot dance night with a skirt, I wasn't completely overheated. I also got so many compliments! Great fit, but you can't wear a bra with such an open back. Also, the button on the back is a little uncomfortable, but it works well. I was looking for a top that was very easy to put on and I found it!"
5.0,I like it<br />Very good<br />Thank you
5.0,"This was a perfect purchase for what I was looking.  Perfect size and can hold many items, but yet never looks bulky.  Great length on the strap and it is wide enough so it doesn't cut into my shoulder."
5.0,Excellent album cover T-shirt<br />Detail was very good<br />Shirt fit as expected after washing
5.0,"Great hat I purchased for my son, fits great a little room to grow in but otherwise perfect for his head and the material is warm and thick as well. Glad I found this and purchased it through your company, haven't really seen hats this good in stores."
5.0,These gauges are really nice. Looks good on my daughter. They just need a little color or a background. They are see through.
5.0,Great product. Better price.
5.0,Love this top.  Great quality and fit.
5.0,I purchased this brand for myself and loved them so when my husband needed new glasses I get him these. He loves them!
5.0,Happy with it can't wait to try it at the beach
5.0,Works exactly as I hoped. No bulky belt buckle sticking out!
5.0,"Kids love them, easy to wear."
5.0,Wish they came in black and I would buy another pair.  Love them very comfortable.  Excellent vendor fast shipment well packed.
5.0,"I got it and the first order had broken glass, Amazon resent a replacement immediately.  Got the new one 2 days later. It comes in a cute wooden box with metal hinges and metal clasp to lock box. The stones were really nice, and it came with a gift of a beautiful  red crystal, it looked like garnet, pendant. I would purchase as gift because its a really nice set of chakra stones. Very pleased with this item."
5.0,"These are perfect, very comfortable and breathable."
5.0,The dress is a comfortable fit. Pro Examiner.
5.0,"5'4' 110lbs, 34B- Small fits perfect. I love that the back is a little longer and rounded. Very flattering cut."
5.0,The colors are beautiful. The legs drape very wide so that it looks like you are wearing a skirt rather than a pair of pants. The fabric is comfortable but does wrinkle in the laundry and will need ironing.  I have only worn this once (mine still need ironed) but my friend is already ordering one for her/
5.0,Arrived on time and as expected. Very cute!
5.0,"Was pleasently surprised the right size and good quality, as my brother put it on as his 50th party was just getting going."

5.0,Silky as described .
5.0,Well made and will stand up to rough handling. Very easy to attach and to see.  I like how they easily slide open to view the info.
5.0,"VERY CHEAP SO BE CAREFUL! So far I'm happy with the purchase. I'm just a little nervous because they're so cheap. They look like they're going to break if you're not extra soft lol. However , hot topic is the same and they're more expensive !!!! Soooooooooooo if u want chokers that aren't too expensive get these . I love em. Besides I don't expect these to last very long tbh."
5.0,good color and design. simple. good.<br /><br />but little more large size.
5.0,Litty McTitty!
5.0,I like that it is smaller in size than many other masks which is more comfortable for my face. The cost was reasonable.
5.0,Beautiful and not heavy. Get a lot of compliments and i tell them to go amazon.<br />Price reasonable.

5.0,"This Raymond Weil Freelancer Lady Sunshine watch is just beautiful!  The make of this watch is extremely high quality, the diamonds sparkle like crazy, and the watch keeps good time.  This is truly a beautiful timepiece.  The Automatic movement is cool to view through the cutout, and also the back of the timepiece.  I waited for 2 years to find this very watch at such a great price.  Thanks Amazon and Watchsavings!"
5.0,Perfect usage.
5.0,Thank you! Beautifully crafted and just what I needed.
5.0,"Last min buy to go to a wedding! It has a simple A line look, but it looks so nice! I even got a couple of complements. I bought size M, I am between M and L, and this dress hid the belly and the arms!!!! And now I can wear it to the office!"
5.0,"This was a birthday gift from my husband. The color of the tanzanite stones is rich. The diamond accents are generous, and the white gold glistens. It is a gorgeous bracelet, and worth every dollar spent. I love the secure clasp as well. No complaints here!"
5.0,Looking for new gown. This is perfect. Decent if wearing around house without robe. Stretchy in bed so I can move & not get wrapped up. Thankful I chose this one.
5.0,"Well worth the price. Lots of different colors to match up. Much nicer than I expected for the price. I would definitely recommend these earrings. Comes with a handy case that snaps shut to keep all of the earrings and posts together. As described and arrived promptly.<br /><br />***Update, as pleased as I was with this set of earrings after a short time the ball broke loose from the metal post on two different pairs of the earrings. One I was able to super glue back together and the other the post fell when it broke and since it‚Äôs so small I couldn‚Äôt find it to glue back. Just be aware.***"

5.0,Really warm and thick great buy for Wisconsin weather
5.0,"I really liked that the costume was very affordable. I purchased this for my teen daughter to wear for a clown day at school. The costume was perfect for this event. It looked great, was made well and was still cheap enough I didn‚Äôt have to worry about it getting ruined. Can‚Äôt beat it for the value and price. Would recommend."
5.0,"Fits great and can‚Äôt beat the price at $16! The color is slightly redder than I thought, but not too red. Wish I buy it in multiple colors."
5.0,My girl absolutely loves this ring! Great price for a good product. I've purchased multiple items from this company and have never had a complaint.
5.0,"Fabulous price for a lot of skinny ties! I needed ties for the groom and party for my wedding, but I was indecisive with colors. I ordered a few different colors to choose from here, and even though I didn't use all of them for my event, it was STILL less expensive than buying at a local store. The quality is good, and the colors came as they appeared in the picture. Worked perfectly for my wedding.<br /><br />FYI- you can buy a lot of 10 pocket squares through the same seller to coordinate and make sets."
5.0,A bit tight but I love this.
5.0,"Really cute, well made and comfy"

5.0,Purchased 2 cases to carry my Clear Armor 141001 ear muffs to the shooting range.  They work just how I'd hoped and well worth the money.
5.0,Loved it! True navy and just enough structure that it doesn't look like a Tent! The pockets are a nice addition and it can be worn to run errands and still look cute....
5.0,This is a great bag to bring to places that have a clear bag requirement.  It has enough room for essentials.  The straps were adjustable to fit my 6' frame and my friend's 5' frame.  We have had two excursions where a clear bag was required and it worked just fine.

5.0,I really like these gloves. Very warm and soft. It has been around 15 degrees outside. I didn't feel any cold air on my fingers.
5.0,Little one loves these.
5.0,"Gave them to my daughter who is a nurse and young, so she really likes the support she gets and the designs of the socks."
5.0,"Fits as expected, love the quality of Capezio's products (we also buy their tights)."
5.0,"This dress is eye catching, and suitable for many functions.  Dress print was chosen carefully for the fabric.  Soothing and chic."
5.0,What I love the most is everything! I just love my leather purse and it‚Äôs the perfect size for me. You can tell they made it with care.
5.0,Great material and sleek look!
5.0,"Excellent watch, looks good and keeps perfect time"
5.0,"Color size , just what I needed"
5.0,I just got back from a ski trip where I used this on several of the colder days as a layer.  it worked great.  I also wore it around town at night and it was perfect. I love the zippered pockets.  I also like the internal non-zippered pockets to store a hat and face-mask.  I wish the new lower price had been in effect when I bought mine.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for a Bride who's wedding I stood in. She LOVED it!  I have this purse in the royal blue and I love it too! very good quality, can't beat the price! We both have gotten a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,This brought a few laughs at a time when everyone can use one.
5.0,"This necklace has a beautiful design and is light weighed. It is the definition of a simple yet amazing piece of jewelry. It is made of high-quality titanium steel with 18k gold plated. It is very comfortable. I love how the pearl shows up nicely when you put this necklace on. These pearls are fine, not the best ones, but for the price they are great. This necklace is jewelry that is very much fashionable and stylish. And, this will make a great gift item."
5.0,"Only thing is there is no skid proofing on the bottom of these socks which I neglected to check for.  Otherwise, really cute socks."
5.0,Perfect gift for a granddaughter who loves BLING!!!
5.0,"Long arms and snug fit in the torso, but not tight in the shoulders. I'm a bit on the lanky side with longer arms and this fits great in a medium, excelling in sleeve length and being adequate in length overall. Sleeves could be cuffed up or not. Like that the zipper is colored and diminutive. Fabric is thinner but soft."
5.0,Beautiful shoes run small my is size 13 -1/2<br />I send it back for size 1
5.0,"What a diamond in the rough!  this is a great find. looks sharp & sleek.  For the price, simply amazing.  The real test will be its longevity and accuracy.  We shall see :)"
5.0,"Seriously LOVE these!! Such a great deal! Highly recommend. So cute, so light, you hardly know they are there."
5.0,Loved this necklace but was a bit too tight - I must have a big neck. Lol. But solved that problem with an extender. Perfect now.
5.0,"This is a great bag of silicone charms. My daughter freaked out when it arrived. It has something for everyone, and she's been making bracelets and necklaces and other creations using these charms ever since they arrived. The charms are cute and brightly colored and nicely made. They are easy to add to jewelry and they hold up, so it lasts a while.<br /><br />I received a discount to try this product out and review it."
5.0,"Beautiful dress, beautiful fit"
5.0,I like the charm and the chain is long enough. Yeah
5.0,LOVE THESE! I'm 170 and 5'6 hour glass. Size 14 is just to tight and 16 are to big. I ordered the xl and omg they fit PERFECT.
5.0,These came as described. Not see-thru. Good length. No complaints. My daughter enjoys wearing them too.
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for. Sports bras are always too tight and cumbersome for me. I'm a 36A and I wanted a cute  strappy bra with a little support. I think this may double as a bathing suit top as well. This is made for A and B cups in my opinion.  I wish there were more colors.
5.0,"This sweater was a perfect fit, not too hot, not scratchy so soft and I had so many compliments on it!!"
5.0,Exactly like the picture and adorable
5.0,recomendado
5.0,A good assortment. Not disappointed at all.
5.0,Es muy bonito se ve de buena calidad pero lo √∫nico que no me gusto es que los  bolsillos son muy peque√±os y los billetes de d√≥lares no entran ni el libro de cheques.<br />Lo quer√≠a usar para ir de compras a diferentes lugares pero con este no se puede.NO LO PODR√â DISFRUTAR üò¨
5.0,I got these as a gift for somebody going to law school. Arrived on time and looks like the picture.

5.0,"excellent so far,"
5.0,"Got these for my little boy and he loves them! Great quality, will last us a good time!"
5.0,"This really looked much better on skin, I had my doubts with the look of the picture but you will really like it."
5.0,Omg so glad I brought this love love love
5.0,I'm so glad I bought this dress. I was not sure what size to buy since some of the reviews were saying it runs small. I bought a size Small which is my actual size. I am 5'4 inches tall and 135lbs. It fit good with body shaper fit even better. I am ordering more colors. The material is decent also.
5.0,"Based on another review, I ordered a Medium.  I would normally wear a small and I likely would have been happy with a small as well. I am 5'4&#34;, D cup, 127 lbs.  I didn't wear it over the shoulder.  It is a bit scratchy, as other reviewers mentioned, but I wore a tank under it and was happy and cozy.  I might get the other color in a small.  Its a stylish sweater for cold weather."
5.0,Nice quality. Elegant.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:286205a9d1f4688934753f48c44f719a]] Light weight but warm; esp like being able to text!

5.0,"These are good quality, better than we had before, and do a great job."
5.0,Very cute shirt. I love it. I would order it again in another color...however the other colors aren't as cute as the black.
5.0,"I get lots of compliments when I wear this quirky shirt! I wear it with cute jean shorts or under a plaid button down. It's casual and cute. Not too short, and super soft!"
5.0,"The material is thin, but that's perfect for Savannah summers. The fit is great and length is good üëç"
5.0,This shirt fit as expected. It is just what I need in the summer in New Orleans.
5.0,"The frame didn‚Äôt fit my watch, but love the band! It‚Äôs purdy!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Fit perfect!"
5.0,"Now and can get my bracelet on by myself,"
5.0,I have had this for a while and it is still shiny and a great way to perk up an old outfit. I love that it give you room to gain weight and still offer an elegant look to an out dated dress and still be a fun way to hide your flaws in a pair of skinny jeans. People are to busy looking at the sparkle than my little stomach &quot;pooch&quot;
5.0,I got this for Christmas sweater day at work. It was comfortable and made my coworkers smile it definitely brought out Christmas spirit.
5.0,Perfect for its purpose! Love it!

5.0,Gave this keychain as a gift. I was the perfect size and not to heavy on the key ring. Definitely a good purchase
5.0,Really pretty!. Chain is not long so if you have a large neck you might wear as a choker. I would purchase other items though because it is good quality for the price.
5.0,Beautiful<br />Fits well<br />Great value
5.0,Fast shipping. Great buy!
5.0,"I'm most pleased with the HOMEHOT Girl's Mary Jane Flat Shoes for their classic style. These go well with a sweater and jeans, or for dress-up clothes like dresses for church. They clean easily. A very thoughtful touch is the hook-and-loop fasteners so little fingers can easily strap their own shoes. The kitten heels are fun for kids too! I'd recommend these for any outfit for a classic style and easy wear."
5.0,Nice and simple. Can wear it when you dress up or dress down!
5.0,This dress fit me like I was measured for it. I love it well made.
5.0,"I am 36A and size small in shirts and dresses, and I am 5'10&#34;. Dress fits great on top and is long enough. It's a bit tight at the legs so it can make walking more difficult - I cannot take a full stride in this. Otherwise the colors are great, and the fabric is comfy and silky."
5.0,Looks good on me.  Baseball caps don't work for me .
5.0,"I've been wearing it for two months, i wear this same band at the gym, and hold up great. Very light comfortable, its a bit more pricey than some of the other ones on Amazon, but you get what you pay for. i'm a big fan."
5.0,True to size and comfy.
5.0,im thinking about buying a gain in different color
5.0,"I got this for Xmas.  I wore it to a wedding,  and I got so many compliments.  It really is beautiful."
5.0,Beautiful (I wear it all the time)
5.0,"Buy two sizes up. My husband is large, I got him the xxl I believe. And it fits just right. This is more of a shirt material tho. Not meant to be worn in cold weather, it doesn‚Äôt keep you warm at all. But he loves it anyways!"
5.0,My Niece Loved it
5.0,"super cute! matches my wallet. I love this brand. Very good quality at an affordable price. Plus it's all vegan, so no animal parts are in there!"
5.0,"I was skeptical about buying sunglasses online (without being able to try them on first), but I‚Äôm glad I gave it a shot.  Really impressed with the overall quality of the lenses, frames, comfort, etc).  Even came with a sunglass screwdriver keychain and a really nice protective case!  Would totally recommend this brand and buy from them in the future."
5.0,Very comfy dress. Cute and stylish!
5.0,These are great especially for the price. My new favorite.
5.0,Perfect little watch that I wear everyday
5.0,Great look!!

5.0,"Perfect, my wife love her bag, perfect size."

5.0,I love the two sided hearts very nice
5.0,My feet and lower legs swell when I sit for long periods of time. I got these for a 13 hr flight. They did the trick! My feet and ankles barely had any swelling.
5.0,"Very comfortable, like keeping myself covered up a bit outside.<br />comes out of the wash and dryer without a wrinkly"
5.0,These are beautiful!!  They look expensive and elegant.
5.0,Purse a little larger than  I normally carry but it will be geat for trips or outingswhere I want to carry more Purse is very pretty
5.0,They arrived in a timely fashion and were priced right.

5.0,"Mother's Day Gift for Mom] Milacolato 925 Sterling Silver Pinky Promise Bracelets Long Distance Couples Friend<br /><br />This is such a nice gift idea to send someone to let them know you care, you miss them, or for a specific day of celebration. One for me and one for you brackets. Very simple - black cord with silver hearts in the middle. The bracelets are adjustable and you tighten them with two pull cords. There is a bit of macram√© design on the bracelets. I highly recommend these as a special gift for someone ""Just to Let them know you Care""! Love it! Card is such a nice detail! Highly recommend! 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
5.0,"Amazing price and robust material. Carried my tablet, ipod, phones, extra shirt, socks, underwear, portable usb battery, water bootle and keys. You can fit a good amount in it, I was sure i could fit more. Dragged it around on the beach, hiking, public transport and airplane. Took a beating for sure."
5.0,Read through previous reviews to see how the sizing would be (if they ran larger or smaller). Bought mediums and they fit perfect. I wear them under my shirts in the winter. The smooth material is better for my outer shirts not catching on the tanks. Plan to purchase a second pack. Good price for three tanks.
5.0,I love these glasses they are no to dark and they are very well designed.
5.0,"it arrived early and packaged well  this is soft, fits wonderfully."

5.0,"Perfect for hot weather, especially for those with smaller chest."
5.0,Realmente est√° muy bonito este vestido la tela es suave tiene una ca√≠da muy bonita el color es igual al de la foto
5.0,"The price is phenomenal for the quality. The fabric feels great on the skin. The fit was great as well- I wore 3‚Äù heels and it just skimmed the top of my feet. I probably could have taken in the chest are a bit, but didn‚Äôt have the time. I received many compliments during my husband‚Äôs military awards gala. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 158lbs."
5.0,"I love this shirt! Very cool. It does, however, run a bit larger than I was expecting and it is longer in the back than in the front which I hadn't realized. Still really like it, just something to keep in mind if your unsure on the size to get."
5.0,Cute fit... great price and easy to wear. Fabric seems like good quality and very easy to launded... line dry worked well.<br />I found it a little heavy in 110+ weather but I think that‚Äôs to be expected.
5.0,Fits amazing. I felt so beautiful at my baby shower. It stretches to fit any size women. I mean. Absolutely worth every penny.
5.0,Look good on outfits
5.0,awesome.. i love it
5.0,"Beautiful, comfy gown. And it has pockets! Fit is great"
5.0,"This coat is better than I anticipated.  It is soft and cozy inside, extra warm.  Fits perfectly.  Very long and covers all the way down to my knees (I am 5'6"").  The burgundy color is rich.  And no funny odor when opening from the package."
5.0,"These are awesome!! Standard stud earrings hurt behind my ear, and often fall off. These bad boys stay on nice and snug due to the screw backing."
5.0,"Everytime I wear this jacket, someone compliments me! Great fit, flattering and exactly what I was looking for! Wish it also came in black and white!"
5.0,So cute! Nice option for Dino loving girls that is not all pink!

5.0,Love this so dang much! It's super cute. Not as bright as the pictures make it look but still bright. It fits well and is a tad bit streatchy Wich is super nice.
5.0,"My husband loves it, its his second wallet, theres nothing wrong with the first one but this one has extra bands. Its sturdy and practical for only his necessary cards. Loves it."
5.0,I have been wearing hoop earrings for decades now.  I bought these thinking they would be comfortable and easy to wear.  And they are.  Everyone loves the look and I love it that they are so light-weight and sparkly.
5.0,"Great shirt!<br /><br />Fits nicely, very comfortable, the fabric is lightweight and gives to your body movement without binding. Been wearing it in 80+ degree temperatures and it's been nothing but cool breezes so far this summer.<br /><br />I typically wear a small size shirt and this one fits perfectly. Jolt Gear makes great shirts and shorts."
5.0,This shirt is amazing! I ordered a men's medium since I don't like how tight women's shirts are and it's a perfect fit! 10/10 Would recommend
5.0,Cute with Black Tights.
5.0,"My 3 year old loves this hat! Got the Batman for hid friend, they are adorable together."
5.0,"I am in LOVE. It‚Äôs dainty, beautiful and supports a good cause. It‚Äôs classy and delightful."
5.0,This dress is made of a different material than the other Allegrace dresses I have. Its a little more substantial and doesn't show every curve but has asymmetrical buttons down the from that allow you to customize how much leg you want to show without worrying about the wind blowing it up in the air. Overall I like the heavier material and looser fit with the belt for a more dramatic A line.
5.0,"This mask fits perfect, it's made of good material and it's honestly much better quality than I expected. I just ordered a second one just in case they stop making them I'll have one as a collectors item."
5.0,I absolutely love this shirt. Fits perfectly
5.0,Give extra warmth for v neck women tops
5.0,I wear these to work.  (I work at a doggy daycare). They are very comfortable and well made.  I love them!  They actually look like dog paws.  I feel that some I looked at didn't look like dog paws as clearly as these do.
5.0,"These leggings came in great! They are very warm and soft, and matched perfectly with the outfits that I had for them. They came very promptly and am very excited to order them again."
5.0,So comfy! The material is super soft. Love the back design! I want another one!
5.0,These are great for everyday wear. I never have any irritation. They are well made and lightweight. So far I've worn the black ones a dozen times and there is no signs of wear. The other colors are pretty too. And you can't beat the price.
5.0,"Got the vintage automatic watch bug.  This winder is superquiet, feels quality in the hand and a guilt free price.  I can wonder about my watch and not worry about resetting the time.  Let's me rotate watches without the hassle of resetting the time.  If I was rich I would get half a dozen of these and run them off a solar battery."
5.0,"I love these pajamas, they are super comfy,soft and fit just like I like it"
5.0,Super soft and cute. The recipient of these LOVES them!

5.0,Perfect fit .. great Quality exactly what I needed will order again.
5.0,Love Love loved this outfit on my baby girl
5.0,"These are the best scrub hats I‚Äôve purchased off of Amazon. Not only are they cute, stylish and well made but they have the buttons in the right spot. Some of the others I‚Äôve purchased don‚Äôt have the buttons placed properly so I cannot utilize them, which is a big disappointment. I definitely recommend!"
5.0,Love this shirt. Perfect fit for me.
5.0,This shirt was perfect for my son for Grinch day at school. Super soft and the colors were awesome! Print was front and back so that was an added bonus.

5.0,Nice quality; holds more than I expected; I really love it!üíï
5.0,The photo doesn't do these justice! They're absolutely beautiful and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a gorgeous addition to their charm bracelet.
5.0,"Very good quality. They fit perfectly over my glasses. Love the compact fold over design, they don't take up too much space in my bag. I will definitely be buying a few more pairs to keep around the house."
5.0,The ring is just what you need if you're active or work a job that will damage precious metals. It's comfortable and flexible enough to pull off swollen fingers after a long run.
5.0,"I got this to wear as a witch costume for Halloween. Very comfortable. Got a size XL. 5‚Äô4 215lb. The bust area is a little wrinkly, but wouldn‚Äôt be if you had a bigger chest. Overall I love it. I also ordered a petticoat to go under it, which I have on in the picture."
5.0,"I am in love with this dress. It‚Äôs comfortable and looks really nice on. It‚Äôs versatile. Bought it for a wedding, but I will wear it a lot!"
5.0,Just what I needed for my Saint's medals.
5.0,"I LOVE these underwear! Comfortable, covering,  and after a year of the first pack I bought,  they aren't wearing out."
5.0,"I got this hat with grey color a while ago for covering myself when doing backyard work. I found this hat is also good for weekend hiking. So, I am getting another one with light sky blue color for my wife. My feedback for the grey color one is attached bellow as it is applicable to this light sky blue color one also.<br /><br />I maintain my own front yard and back yard. The original intent for getting this hat for myself is to shield my neck area from the sun light when working on my yards. After using it, I find this hat is pretty versatile. When the flaps are removed, it becomes a regular hat. So, I could use it in hiking as well. The build material is soft and it can be easily folded down to pack into luggage or backpack without worrying about losing its shape. I mean, this hat is also very travel friendly. It has a neck strap to secure the hat in position, so I don't worry about it being blown away in windy days, or in beach area. Additionally, the mesh around the back of the trim really helps to keep my head cool. I have to say, this hat is really handy for various use cases."
5.0,Nice snug fit the printing came out great love it
5.0,Me quedan perfectas para descansar del arduo trabajo
5.0,"I appreciate what Elite sports is doing:  by offering a nice gi at a really affordable price.  There really isn't much to say beyond that.  The gi is simple, well built,  and it just works.<br /><br />A note on sizing.  The gi's seem to be better suited for shorter legs/longer torsos.  I'm the opposite, so I find the gi pants to be a tad shorter and the top to be a tad longer than I'd like.  But for the price - this is an awesome training gi."
5.0,Pairs well with lots of things
5.0,Yes. Exactly what I needed.
5.0,"Great shorts, bermuda type length, for ""I'm not 25 anymore and gained the 'freshman fifteen' during COVID...love them."
5.0,"LOVE! This bag!‚Ä¶ mom of 3 under 5yrs old‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs a grab and go! With ALL you need! 1 extra diaper, regular wipes, easy to grab hand sanitizing wipes! Wanting to clean all surfaces and little hands I love how easy it is<br />to get to them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ flip up the flap and it‚Äôs in my hands!‚Ä¶.. YOU NEED THIS PURSE/ DIAPER BAG! And two zipper pockets towards the back‚Ä¶.. fits keys, phone and wallet! Cross body keeps me with 2 hands free to hold little ones hands!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ small enough to feel like your not bringing tons of stuff! And fits just what you need!"
5.0,"I adore this dress!  It hangs well.  The fabric and colors are good quality. The cleavage is pretty but not too low, so you can wear it to a family event and not offend anyone.  But it is also flirtatious enough to wear on a date.<br /><br /> At first I thought it would be a bit too ""campy"" to wear at a wedding.  But it is actually a nice dress with an homage to vintage fashion!  Everyone loved this dress and said it reminded them of Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />If you want to go full-on rockabilly, you could wear it with a petticoat and do your hair in victory rolls and/or put a big Rose on your hair.  I chose to go with hair pinned back as a nod to the concept of victory rolls, and rose earrings instead of a big rose on my head.  I wore a statement bracelet and no necklace, since the dress had halter straps.<br /><br />Unfortunately in the picture I have my hair covering up the halter part of the dress.  Just trust me, it is cute, and since you tie it around your neck yourself, it adjusts well to different heights and sizes. I did not wear the ribbon belt it comes with, and I cut off the little thread loops on the sides of the waist that help keep the belt in place.  That was a personal choice.<br /><br />I am short and stout, so this dress hit below the knee on me, and because of my ridiculously large calves I looked like I had sausages for legs.  So I had it hemmed for a few bucks to hit slightly above the knee.  It was totally worth it because I plan to wear this dress whenever possible.<br /><br />Grace Karin please make more of these in XL!"
5.0,This is a huge bag and can carry lots of stuff!
5.0,Adorable! My 2.5 year old looked sooooo adorable in this! The shirt was a little snug and pants slightly too short. My daughter is 31lbs and 39.5 inches tall. She is thin and tall. It still looked good and cute on her!
5.0,Exceeded my expectations. I'm a junior in high school and I needed a new bag for my textbooks and laptop. Everything fits inside with more than enough room to spare. There was a strange bracelet stuck to the Velcro strap though....
5.0,"My new favorite shirt. I ordered a large and normally wear a medium so it was lose fit, medium would have been great. Very comfortable, high quality material, and looks great even in lose fit. Highly recommend this if you like something unique and fun to wear."

5.0,"Beautiful dress,  very feminine. I ordered the small and l would say it may run a little on small side as l am petite - 95 lbs, small chested and it fit me perfect. I usually wear XS but the SMALL fit like an XS, which was no problem for me. The small may not fit other more average sized ladies that wear small."
5.0,"Like the color, fit was good too."
5.0,Quality made piece.
5.0,Love it! Buy it! I ordered a Largr but should‚Äôve gotten a Med.. my cup size is 38C... a med would have fit better. Overall it was perfect! (Paired with pink pants also purchased on Amazon)
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised. It fits perfect & I‚Äôm a big gal. The color is vibrant and line dried quickly.

5.0,This dress is very comfortable and a flattering dress for summer time or a wedding!
5.0,"Can't even begin to find another sock company that even comes close to the guarantee of Darn Tough brand.  Better yet, they're made in the USA!"
5.0,"I love the material it was a lil Big but it didn't look bad, every body was saying how beautiful it look. The material of the dress is very nice. I will definitely will buy more."
5.0,"Light, easy to match and carry around!"
5.0,I wear it just under my finger nail on my middle finger. It's cute.
5.0,"I bought this to use as a tote bag.  It's the perfect size, not too big and not to small.  I've carried it every day for two months and am quite pleased with the way it has held up.  I think i will get to use it for a long time.  I love this bag!"
5.0,"I bought this dress for a bridesmaid dress. It fit small but after I reordered it, it was comfortable and looked beautiful. The dress is small around the arm hole and breast area, so if you have a bigger cup size I would recommend going a size up. The quality is just as pictured and it makes my body look great. The Seller also responds to any questions in a timely manner and helps with any concerns."
5.0,These shirts are super nice. Bought this one for my Dad to replace the one I stole from him. The old one was from the Vietnam Memorial so it is cool also. This one is far better for Pops these days due to the size.
5.0,These fit well and have a little extra support without being too tight. Good value.
5.0,"Okay so I've had the same Nautica puffy long coat for years and it's about time to replace it because there are holes in the pockets. I was a little skeptical on picking up this coat because the sizing is S/M and L/XL and I wasn't sure if it was going to be warm enough or just look nice for show. But this coat is perfect. Technically it's a smidge bigger than I would normally want, but that also means I can wear the thickest sweater under it with no issues. It's nice and long, super plus and has plenty of pockets. There's a hidden interior pocket in the left chest, a left arm pocket and the hood is nice and deep. I also love the length and that there's a back vent. I can't wait til we have a truly frigid day so I can test this out!"
5.0,"Bought these for my husband, great value, good fit"
5.0,Fit perfect on my 5 year old for Halloween. Its very authentic looking and does not look plastic like some I've seen in the retail store. She received many complements on her costume. We now have a new dress up option as well.
5.0,"I was looking for a comfortable modest bathing suit.  This fit the bill.  The fit was good. I am a size 14. I ordered a 3x (yes that was hard to see). It fits a little loose but not baggy. I like that fit. It was comfortable in and out of the water. Not heavy when wet and drys quickly.  The dress does go up a little when I jump in, but there are tie down strings that you can tie the dress to the pants. The only thing I didn't like is there is no built in bra and panties. That is fixed with a sports bra and a bikini bottom. This is the first swimsuit I have worn in a long time that I feel confident in."
5.0,Fits great! I purchased a red scarf so I had a little more coverage around my waist since I wore to work. But comfortable and looks good! Not cheap feeling like most Halloween costumes.
5.0,"this item is perfect for examining rings and slivers and anything else very small, it is small itself, yet powerful and cool"
5.0,"Great replacement for invisible socks or sock liners. Perfect for summertime and for snug shoes. Good fit, comfortable and they don't slide around. LOVE these. (I bought both: Halova and Moonsocks versions are the same)"
5.0,"This is an excellent quality Sterling Silver bead that is exquisitely detailed.  Comparing it to Pandora, Troll, etc., the quality is just as good.  The picture is accurate and it's a nicely weighted solid bead.  I had been looking for an angel for a long time, and am extremely pleased with this one.  The wings are incredible!  I have a few beads from this brand now and have been happy with all of them."
5.0,Exactly as described. Great product
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! Even more beautiful in person!
5.0,These were very easy to use and work great. I like that the clasp can be opened if needed. I will be buying more of these for my other shoes.
5.0,"I loved my first cocoon organizer so much I ordered another, and now all of my usually-separated goods that would take so long to transfer from backpack to backpack can be swapped in about 30 seconds. The straps retain pressure very well and are rubberized on the inside to increase grip. There's also a small pouch on the other side, I use mine for pencils&pens."
5.0,Loved the product. I caught the delivery guy (on my RING doorbell) throwing the package up on the porch trying not to be picked up by the camera. He lost out on that. Most Amazon delivery people place it on the porch and take a picture on it on the porch. That guy was lazy and tried to elude the camera.
5.0,I loved the keychain and charms. It was a gift for a coach moving away. Product is exactly what I expected.  I even added an extra charm just to personalize.
5.0,I recently received and have only used it once but I think it worked great !
5.0,I have purchased these many times because I wear them out and hey break. No worries I love these earrings!
5.0,"Fits great, is super soft and comfortable. Definitely a purchase I'm glad I made. Breathable fabric, and somewhat form fitting."
5.0,"I love these pants, I bought the dotted ones.  I'm 5'8"" and was happy to see the 34""inseam as an option.  At 165lbs ther large fits great.  The material is the softest, coziest pj -like feeling. I bought other pairs and they are rougher material, not as soft.  But they are still excellent pants."
5.0,Size is true to fit.
5.0,"Love it. Can dress it up or dress it down. Lay's very nice, material is comfortable. Its long for us tall girls, nice buy."
5.0,"Just one of the best things I have bought. I'm a photographer who travels a lot - which means travelling with lots of batteries, cables, smaller video camera, flash dirves etc. This thing holds  just about anything in place, and saves me trying to roll up cords etc. I have bought a few as gifts and they have all been loved!"
5.0,"perfect sheath for summer work day, accented with jewelry and a sweater or blazer"
5.0,"Very pretty watch. My only con is that because of the light color of the face, the hands are hard to see<br />."
5.0,"Looks so small, but fits comfortably."
5.0,Buy this brand all the time. It is cotton and breaths. It is very comfortable and washes and dries great. I will continue to buy this brand.
5.0,There are a lot of hoop ear rings out there but the hing on these earrings are great. They are as said top quality and my wife loves them for a simple pair of earrings to sleep in or just ware around the house or market.
5.0,Great belt. My 3 year old  daughter has no problem taking off to use the bathroom.  Would purchase again. Highly recommend.
5.0,I run 4-5 miles every day and listen to music. The pocket on these is perfect for my phone. It is secure and I don't have any trouble. Plus they are great at keeping you dry.
5.0,Its absolutely beautiful. My mother loved it.
5.0,Perfect for what I needed for a bodybuilding competition. Didn't stick to or ruin my tan. It was so comfy and the pockets made it the best. Highly recommend. Will purchase again.
5.0,Excellent leather detailing and quality made.  I was looking for a wallet with a snap coin purse attached and this is perfect.
5.0,They fit just as advertised
5.0,Wore them to a wedding got lots of compliments. They are by no means light but did not tug on my ears.
5.0,"Felt very good. And very happy they fit. I have big calves. Will buy more, wait I did buy more.."
5.0,"These are the BEST no-show socks I have ever bought! They do not slip off - even after I washed them and wore them again.<br /><br />I am a size 7 - they fit perfect, the base of the sock is a thin cotton with an anti-slip pad on the ball of the foot. The upper part of the sock is nylon with a thin line of anti-slip material around the inside of the upper edge of the sock (all around, not just on the heel).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these."
5.0,Wonderfully wireless pretty supportive bra!
5.0,I love this shirt. I get so many compliments and plan on ordering another one

5.0,These are so cute. I actually got them for my dogs. They kept them on and were so cute. Grandkids also loved them.
5.0,Very warm. Worth every penny. Love it.
5.0,For years I was paying 40 or $50 for a pair of those green superfeet insoles. come to think of it I was paying $48 exactly for one pair of superfeet. These are just as good. that's not an exaggeration I've worn superfeet for 10 years. These are almost as good. The only difference is I have high arches and plantar fasciitis and I require higher heel. Superfeet wete a bit higher. I'll try these other ones for 10 bucks you can't go wrong.
5.0,Niece loves this outfit!
5.0,These are the best no show socks I have tried.  I have worn both the black and beige with ballet flats and pumps and they do not slip off my heels and they don't show.  I am very pleased with them.
5.0,I bought this for a gift for my teen grand daughter.  It looks much nicer than I expected.  Very sparkly.  Love it!
5.0,"I purchase this watch two months ago.  The plan was for it to be a trial watch to see if I liked wearing a watch anymore.  However, I like it so much I will not be pursuing another.  The band is very comfortable.  The motion of the watch is very quiet.  I have received over a dozen complements on how cool it looks.  In short, I couldn't be happier."
5.0,"Great color, great fit, great shirt!"
5.0,Love it. Fits on my pandora bracelet.

5.0,Loved that it was exactly what I ordered..
5.0,"For the money, this watch is pretty amazing AND it actually works (unlike other inexpensive watches I have known). It says that it is not shower proof but after forgetting once, it seems to still be ticking along with no sign of water inside. I'll try to remember to take it off next time."
5.0,Beautiful quality sturdy nice clasp
5.0,"I'm using this on a Flat top Gambler ""Dice"" felt (Black). People like the hat and they always comment on how they've never seen a rain coat for hats except for State Highway Patrol.<br /><br />I used it today in South Carolina. Protect your investment."
5.0,Perfect item. Thank you!
5.0,"These are the most comfortable, and pretty, slippers I have bought and worn in a long time! I bought all three colors for myself, and then ordered a pair for my daughter for her birthday. The colors are all deep and lovely, the insides are comfy, the white fur trim is a real plus, and the soles are so durable, I accidentally wore them outside walking on my gravel driveway, and I thought I had my shoes on!"
5.0,"I have at least 10 pairs of Irideon tights and this is the first pair that I have purchased with a full seat. Super grippy. I love them!<br />I have other brands of breeches and tights as I ride pretty much every day, but Irideon is my favorite!"
5.0,Bought these so my kids can use them to hold their facemasks.  They work great for that purpose.  Seem durable.  Pleased with purchase.
5.0,Gorgeous. The pendant is nice and large. The chain is also very shiny and beautiful.
5.0,This cover up was the best.  I had it over my cute swimsuit and it Gave me the confidence i needed while wearing my 2 piece.  Love this wish it came in black
5.0,"Bright, colorful and durable!"
5.0,Perfect fit and shirt is thick and comfortable.
5.0,"Since they are impervious to UV damage and salt water, they are perfect for use on a boat!  Good build quality and they hold tight!"
5.0,"Got these shoes because my son hates socks and figured it would be easier to clean these and not have to worry about how gross he gets them playing in mud puddles. And they have not let me down. My son loves them, says ""they are so comfy and don't even get that gross""<br />He's also a pro at destroying shoes in record time and these have stood up half the summer and are still in great shape. So happy with this purchase"
5.0,"Man let me tell you, I have never felt this comfortable wearing a tank ever! I'm definitely buying more! It also make you look very sleek and professional."
5.0,I purchased these because the price was very reasonable and they seemed to be decent.  I had no idea they would be silver and as nice as they are.  Even my husband commented they were beautiful. Plus the free shipping was a great deal.  I would buy from this company again in a flash!
5.0,"ordered  this  jacket the same day as the logo cap ,  the jacket arrived in 3 days ,  it is exactly as shown  , very comfortable , and I ordered it in the larger  size too fit other clothing , for  much cooler weather , has the pockets for the armor inserts ,  but  the inserts do not come with the jacket , which is explained in the original order  ( was not a problem on my end )  I would buy  3 or more and not worry about any thing to be wrong )  great job too the seller"
5.0,Great product. More beautiful thhan the pictures.

5.0,This box is totally awesome! Just what I wanted! It's sleek and elegant! Very classy! My boyfriend loves it! Thank you!
5.0,Fits very comfortably on 5 & 7 yr old. Like the nose piece and the adjustable straps with bead. However our school doesnt allow masks with vents so this is going to be to used everywhere else.
5.0,This is such a lovely piece and small enough to add on my charm bracelet.
5.0,My daughter loves trhem
5.0,This clock was super cute and worked great!

5.0,Very good and sturdy<br />Great protection from the sun
5.0,Great but runs a little large.
5.0,I like the length and the wash of the denim. It was just what I needed for the Dimond and Denim party I attended. I have worn it many times since and it has held up well. It fits comfortably and is not too short.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I got it as a lightning deal in the wine color for $11 and change, not sure why that color was the only one for that price but it fits perfect and I got so many compliments on it!"
5.0,"I really love the skort I purchased. It gives me freedom to work in the yard, go fishing or just chilling out.  Knowing that regardless of what I do, I am still covered in all the right places is a really great feeling."
5.0,Shining Cloth makes for shiney silver work!
5.0,I was worried that it may not be big enough for what I wanted to use it for however it was perfect size and it even came a day earlier than it said.
5.0,"Color is GORGEOUS.  Saving for special occasions.  Fit lovely, comfortable - large - 5'31/2&#34; 145 lbs (hourglass shape).  Wear slip. Seems well made.  Yes, will buy again from this seller.  Thank you.  In my opinion, this skirt is something special."
5.0,"Nice pin, good quality."
5.0,Superb quality and shipping. Fast too! Thanks for an amazing sombrero voltiao!

5.0,love all my gowns by Eileen West! they are the best.
5.0,Comfy and cute. Great price. Daughters love it.
5.0,I have been thinking about these belts for a while and saw them on Amazon for a great price so bought two sets. One set for my sister and one set for myself I really like them as no buckle in the way very comfortable
5.0,Still wearing after years of use! And is so comfy!
5.0,Got these for my girls. They love the looks & are happier with these than their previous mask.
5.0,absolutely adore it.  bought a green and a burgundy and just got a forest green... and probably will buy other more other colors.
5.0,They fit right
5.0,I really like this necklace. It's original you don't see a lot of people wearing an eye with a teardrop. It's a little longer than I expected but it's not a problem. I still have many outfits I can wear it with.
5.0,Nice product. Great value!
5.0,"This is really solid plastic!! I can see myself having this for atleast 5-10 years!!<br />My only problem so far is it does not sit up straight, it must be laid on its side if you want to put it down. You can also easily change out the chain if you want to make this look more expensive"
5.0,"I bought these for my bridesmaids for my wedding.  I wanted something simple, unique and elegant that they would want wear again int he future. They were just as I hoped.  The color is brilliant and the silver is shiny. They do not seam cheap despite being very affordable."
5.0,"I purchased these slippers based on the picture. I liked the color and they ""looked"" very fluffy. When I got them I was initially disappointed that the slipper bottoms, although furry/fluffy, were very thin, like barefoot thin. But they are as advertised! They are slipper socks - furry slippers with a sock ""feeling"" bottoms. Super warm tho!"
5.0,"It is light and warm. Although I have not used the zipper yet, it is nice to know I can hide anything there"
5.0,"I ordered the pink; the color is actually more of a soft salmon color, which I like better than the color I was expecting. If you want a true pink, be warned.<br /><br />The scarf is a very pretty, soft weave that isn't bulky at all (a pet peeve of mine).<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I like it enough to buy another (at full price) in another color."
5.0,Love this top. I wear with leggings. It has shape & true to size. Arms make it feel elegant. It's a ribbed gauze type fabric.
5.0,"Love it!  So thankful my doc recommended compression socks; they make all the difference!  No more cramping, no more rashes, no more tired achy breaky legs - Yippee!"
5.0,Very sexy shirt!  Excellent price and durable material.  I love how my manly man looks it this shirt!
5.0,Quality is good.  Lined.  Color is as shown
5.0,Really nice hat that is very light and comfortable making it much cooler than my other summer hats. I like the shading from the sun it provides on my neck and face.
5.0,My daughter loves this bag! It is made so good and very sturdy material . Good purchase !
5.0,"The only way to get good value from these coil key rings is to buy them in quantity, as I did.  The colors are great and I am giving away spares as I only needed 3-4.  I use the one I use daily when I walk my dog as a wristlet and I use a carabiner because I think that the round, larger diameter keychain is easier on the coils than the key ring."
5.0,"This was the perfect travel wallet. I recently went to europe and I would of been in a world of unorganized hurt without this beauty. Highly recommend for the frequent traveler or everyday user who loves secure, attractive wallets."
5.0,Love the color like the feel love it all
5.0,These are adorable. Shiny and very strong.<br />Great quality. I was not disapointed.
5.0,"The color is gorgeous and looks just like the picture. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, around 130 pounds, and have a 34B chest and I ordered a medium and it fits great. The only thing is that the bottoms don‚Äôt have much coverage in the back, so it‚Äôs pretty skimpy. Overall though I love it"
5.0,I loved the little love Perl I got!
5.0,"I love,  love, love it!!!!! It was bigger then I hoped for and at a great price plus it arrived very fast. ; )Looks exactly like the pics. I would definitely buy from them again. : )"
5.0,Best jacket for the money! Keeps me very warm while ice fishing.
5.0,"This sweatshirt is just what I wanted. This is made really well, doesn't have frayed edges, looks nice, and feels nice. I love the neck line and the fact that it is sort of short. If you are bust I would buy one size up."
5.0,Absolutely lovely for the price
5.0,"Wanted comfy flip flops and these fit my need.  I ordered 6 pairs of various summer flip flops and these were the only ones I kept.  I ended up ordering two pairs, the white and the black.  I believe they described them as yoga mat like material, which after wearing them I would agree, they are like thick squishy yoga mats.  Wore them the whole day walking around the city on vacation and had no issues with comfort.  I would say these fit true to size.  If you want a flip flops that is comfortable, but has a tiny lift to them these are great.  I personally wish they were a bit taller in the platform, but then again I am 5'1 and enjoy having added height."
5.0,This cardigan is actually very good quality. Thick! Also love the flowers on it. Very stylish and comfy.
5.0,"good quality, exactly as described"
5.0,"Super soft, washes well. I have ordered in another color already. I am 5'9&#34; and 165lbs 36D and normally order large in tops but the medium fits very well."
5.0,Great pants‚Å∑
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:97b6750a62bd0bce9488eb20e932e0f2]] This dress is comfy, classy and great for the office. The buttons weren't sewn on correctly but no one will notice. The material is kinda cheap but it's made well. I wear it to work and ppl love it!"
5.0,I loved them ! Best part I got them earlier than the expected dates !
5.0,The fit and the quality were perfect
5.0,Purchased for a friend.
5.0,Great dress for baby shower. I'd given up home that a dress not making me hippy and this flowed nicely and flatter.
5.0,For an event. Everyone loves it so did i
5.0,I got these sunglasses for my boyfriend's stepfather and he loved these! Very stylish and fit perfect to his face!
5.0,"This polishing cloth is amazing! My beautiful wedding ring has gotten a bit lackluster, due to weekly racing sessions at the local dirt track, my addiction to lotion and overall humidity/sweat.<br /><br />After just one use of this polishing cloth, my ring now sparkles like fire and is absolutely mesmerizing to me! The size of this cloth is huge - so much better than the tiny little cloth that came with my ring.<br /><br />Use of this polishing cloth is so simple - use the yellow side to remove any tarnish/undesirable spots, and use the blue side to apply an awesome polish to your jewelry. The end result - breathtaking beauty and endless sparkle!<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking to bring new life to their jewelry, silver utensils or other silver, gold or platinum pieces - plus you cannot beat the price! This is an amazing product and you will not be disappointed! =)"
5.0,"Like color, fit, softness"
5.0,Great shoes for the pool and great price!
5.0,I actually haven't worn it yet but I will in a week or so!  Heading to Punta Cana!  Very cute suit!  nice material!  Great price for this type of suit.
5.0,Ultra sexy
5.0,Mamalon! 5 stars
5.0,"I'm normally very wary about buying body jewelry online but I am extremely happy with these! I bought the 1/2 inch, 12 mm size and they fit perfectly! Great price to!"
5.0,Fantastic Sunglasses for the price!!!
5.0,Pretty and functional!
5.0,I used these at the gym...they are of good quality and they dry easily...
5.0,"The product fit and looked as expected, when I tried it on. Will have to update the quality of the product once I wash and wear it!"
5.0,"I ordered a XL and the shirt feels like a 2XL, Next time I will order a Large size only.  The shirt is awesome!! Ready to go fishing!!"
5.0,"Briefs fit well, are durable and comfortable! Wash and fold and look as good as they did when new. Love them!"
5.0,"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to try the strap out on the water, but having lost an expensive pair of glasses while paddle boarding, we are hopeful that this strap will float so we can say we learned from a bad experience."
5.0,"This company is great! Their very accommodating in helping find the right ring size for you. The rings themselves are so comfortable I bought the pearl colored rings and their so pretty. I work with dirty compound and polishing machines and I wear my ring, when it gets dirty I just wash it along with my hands not bothering to take it off and it cleans up like new and drys easy. LOVE. Wish there was a black pearl colored ring ! üòâ hint hint"
5.0,I got this for my father-in-law for Father Day. It is hard to find XL size hats in stores. He likes the cap style and was so glad to have one in a summer weight fabric. He said it fit perfect.
5.0,"I like this so much I'm thinking of keeping it even though the dress I intended to wear it with is going back. One side of the elastic is smooth, the other is sort of vertically ribbed? There are no marks or embossing near the clasp that keep you from wearing either side out. 41"" waist, the size chart is accurate. Just enough stretch to keep it in place, but it doesn't slide up if I position it below my natural waist. Use the size chart and I think you'll be okay. The clasp is a sort of goldtone. I would love it if it were silvery."
5.0,"Good quality, arrived in a cute box"
5.0,"I really like this jock now that I've worn it a few times.  The white material has barely any stretch to it, not at all like another jock I bought, but it's exactly the right size to just keep my goods restrained.  I've worn it a couple times at my construction job - on a ladder, squatting, lifting, lying down under things.  With this thing on, I don't have to gather up my nuts after they've worked themselves under my thighs, everything stays where it's supposed to.  I've never felt like I wanted my junk to &#34;breathe&#34; but I did notice when whipping it out in the john that there's a sweaty warmth radiating right through it, so it does allow heat and air circulation.  I haven't worn it to the gym yet, but it should be good there too.<br /><br />I don't think this jock looks sexy really.  The stark white color looks a little medical or something and the mesh just allows you to see the naughty bits all smooshed when I think they're sexier out on full view.  There's other backless jocks that I find hotter but this one is really good for the original purpose - keeping the jewels out of harm's way during strenuous activity.<br /><br />I'm a medium (33 inch waist jeans) and I got the L in this jock and it's a great fit.  My equipment is a little above average based on what I've encountered."
5.0,Everyone loved the black cat with mask on too. I love these very breathable and comfortable. There are different designs to choose from.
5.0,"This belt was beautiful, I had to return it because it was too big for my boyfriend but I had no issues with the company and it arrived quickly"
5.0,Does the job perfectly!
5.0,"Arrived quickly, looks nice. Quality is spot on and it feels just as good as my more expensive ludell ones.<br /><br />I wouldn‚Äôt go diving with it but it looks nice on my keys"
5.0,Who knew we could add underwear to the Bumble clothing options?  These are super cute and fit as expected for my daughter who typically wears a size 4 or so.  Got her a size small.
5.0,"I travel for a living and bought these to keep in my suitcase for warm climates. They ended up becoming my favorite sandals and I wear them all the time, even at home. Just wish they were real leather."
5.0,This is not the first order of these socks.  I really like them.  The stay up fairly well and certainly do a lot to keep my cold feet warmer. They launder beautifully.
5.0,They were great exactly what the wife wanted!
5.0,"I love these dresses! They‚Äôre so cute with boots, booties or flats. Tights or leggings looks great! Wash and wear."
5.0,Exact fit.  Took about 3 minutes to switch them out.  Just use a small nail to depress the pins on the band and you are good to go.
5.0,I love this necklace.  I had been looking for a starfish necklace for some time when this one caught my eye. I am a lover of silver jewelry and collect pendants.  You can wear it with the enclosed chain or substitute any sterling silver chain you own.  With it's sparkle it is definitely an eye-catcher.
5.0,It's nice and zipper works nice and smooth.
5.0,"Typically wear a XSmall or Small, I got a medium via the seller's sizing chart. It was a good choice to go up...<br />I did need to get a slip to wear underneath."
5.0,My son was looking for a good shirt to use while running in the hot summer. This shirt fit very well and as described.  A good purchase.
5.0,"I went out the other day in rough and windy conditions.  It was brutal, but these glasses made it bearable. Nothing stops the water from getting in your eyes when you get washed over, but these do a great job of keeping the constant spray out of your eyes. They made an otherwise terrible day on the water bearable. When I gave them to my son, it was torture without them. Very happy I have them, they fit snugly also, so very little worry about them falling off"
5.0,"They fit true to size, but are definitely a slim fit everywhere except where the waist elastic lets them expand. So if you want extra crotch or hip room you may want to order a size up. Also I think it is best to wear them with a belt (especially if you order a size up or like to put a lot of heavy things in your pockets. All that said, I really like these shorts. They are nice and long, and the quick dry material is nice and thin but sturdy. I like how they only have a little elastic at the sides rather than elastic all the way across the back like some similar shorts. Black is a good true black that doesn't show any signs of fading. The zippered pockets are really nicely designed to keep things secure when closed without being unpleasant when open."
5.0,Everyone loves this hat on me!
5.0,This hat is so light weight for hot days.
5.0,"They are good glasses. Great, even for the price. Very dark and polarized. They are VERY large... I do feel slightly silly, but none of my teen children nor husband have ridiculed me as yet, so it perhaps is me. I would give it 4 1/2 for that, but it's more my problem than the glasses."
5.0,"Classy, comfortable. Fits well. Is good quality and doesn't look tacky or cheap. Can be worn for every day or a classier dinner out with a dressing dirt and heals"
5.0,my grand daughter loved them
5.0,Very beautiful in person!
5.0,The charm is bigger then I thought and so is the chain. It is pretty but the skulls are view able. It is a nice long necklace for you to wear with a turtle neck or a dress. I really was very please with it.
5.0,This was exactly what we were looking for. My son was very happy.
5.0,I got so many compliments! I love it! Durable and pretty. I thought it'll be uncomfortable but it wasn't. Great!
5.0,"I‚Äôm surprised it actually fits. The white is a bit see through just FYI, otherwise I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm going to buy more of these in different colors. We‚Äôll see how they hold up after a wash or two."
5.0,"They arrived without any cracks and looked properly packaged. They look a lot nicer in person and I felt they were definitely worth what I paid.  They fit fairly well, especially considering that I bought these without getting to try them on first. The cat eye design is flattering, especially if you have more curvature to your face shape. I loved the polarized lenses; they are my preference. The only thing I wish I had done, was find a nice hard-shell case to ensure they don't get crushed in my purse."
5.0,I went one size up then I normally wear due to ordering multiple things on Amazon and knowing things come a little bit smaller on here. It fit perfectly. Also the lining of the dress only goes to about the knees a little bit above so it's great for girls whose butts don't fit in short dresses. Super cute!
5.0,very pretty ! Thank you
5.0,Excellent fit. I have flat feet and the sandals have great arch support. Highly recommend.
5.0,"This is a nice dress, that is a little bit nicer than casual, but not overly fancy. It's a great dress to wear on a cruise. I find that I can add different styles of necklaces or even a scarf to have several different looks. It runs a bit smaller than I expected, so if you are deciding between sizes, I suggest going up a size."
5.0,"These are great for the gym, running, or just lounging around the house. Wash very well."
5.0,This is a ‚Äúst. Nick‚Äù gift and although my daughter hasn‚Äôt put it on yet it will fit fantastic. True to size. Very soft and quality material.
5.0,I love this necklace.  It's very pretty and makes a statement without being too overwhelming.  It does take some getting used to that it doesn't have a clasp but a ribbon that ties.
5.0,like the compression support. I wear them to the gym daily
5.0,These sets hit just the right note for my daughter‚Äôs bridesmaids. The perfect size and perfect amount of glitz. Not too blingy. Not too humdrum. Just right!
5.0,"This was better than expected! I ordered a medium as it was shipped from amazon and I didn't want to wait a long time, so I was expecting to to be very small, but it was big enough [I'm 5'9&#34; with small breasts and curvy hips] and looked pretty much exactly like it does on the model [surprisingly!] The material is strong and sturdy but soft and stretchy. Definitely comfortable and well worth the price."
5.0,Perfect!!!  Just what I was looking for!!  Meets all expectations!  Well made and fun to wear!!  Love!!!‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
5.0,A tad long for a vertical labret but stay in really well. I don't use the small rings. They're impossible to put. SO TINY.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:12e3437da2fcc7b217f305552c11f58d]] Holy cow, this costume is so much cooler than we expected. It's really easy to use, and looks so good! Everyone we have shown it to has loved it as well. Once you get the fan hooked into the blowup, there is a battery pack with an on/off switch and a little clip to hook onto a pocket. The feet have elastics that hold securely on your ankles, which helps so you can walk easily, and also to keep the air in. You really don't have to do anything to keep this held up while you are inside it, either. The fan really does most of the work for you. I honestly wasn't sure what it would be like to be inside of this costume. I figured I'd probably feel a little claustrophobic and that the air used to puff it up would make it weird to breathe in such a small space, but surprisingly I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. I actually wonder if the air blowing inside is what made me NOT feel claustrophobic. Because the air circulating actually kind of makes it easier to breathe in an enclosed space like that. So far we've had three different people wear this, all different heights. One about 6'0, another person about 5'3, and also a 4-year-old. Every person was able to wear it, including the 4-year-old. The legs just look a little squattier when a kid is inside of it, but otherwise it works the same! We were surprised that the 4-year-old didn't get scared being inside of it. He actually had a blast and loves to wear it. Overall this is seriously so fun to have, and we can't wait to use it for family Christmas parties and fun holiday events. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Much more neon and yellow in person, but I like it. Fits well."
5.0,loved the fit and makes me feel like I'm wrapped in a blanket
5.0,These are the SOFTEST leggings I own! This is my 3rd pair. IF you like really soft stretchy jeggings these are for you.
5.0,"These are so nice and soft, and comfortable for my husband, he really likes them. They fit perfectly too. The Christmas colors are fun!"
5.0,Daughter loves it uses for school swim classes
5.0,Where these just about everyday when I‚Äôm not at work. Very comfortable. Recommend these definitely!
5.0,I was thrilled it fit so well!!
5.0,"You cannot beat this veil for the price!!! Beware, though, that you need to purchase a comb separately."
5.0,Arrived very fast. Very helpful to identify which purse pocket my wallet with my medical information is in in case of an emergency.
5.0,Warm enough in cooler weather without being thick and difficult. Stylish too.
5.0,I bought this towel/wrap for my Finnish sauna. Super impressed. I just bought another. The fabric is breathable. The waffle fabric is key and it works great between sauna rounds. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll buy a 3rd towel at some point. But I highly recommend.
5.0,i wear these nearly every day and my students love to see all my fun patterns
5.0,"Love it!!! perfect size and perfect color, love the fabric too."
5.0,Excellent purchase! The leather is brand new so a little stiff however very happy!
5.0,I love the retro metro bags. Hard to find.machine washable and enough room for everything I need to carry with me
5.0,looks good ....the color perfect .......small ..small...small
5.0,I know it says Ram in the title but it's just the Dodge ram head logo which was fantastic for me. I have a Dodge Magnum and love this key chain!!! It's adorable and the seatbelt actually works!!!
5.0,This dress is flattering for a curvy girl.  I love the fit/ flare style.  It is light weight but not too much so.
5.0,Love it! It's stretchable and comfortable.
5.0,Love the shoes first pair was somewhat small but I returned them with no problems and got a bigger size fit great.
5.0,"This was a gift for my niece! She loves them! Won‚Äôt take them off.<br /><br />The first set was damaged (one shoe wouldn‚Äôt change colors, the other wouldn‚Äôt turn ON), but the return was very easy. They came to pick up from my house and the second set was perfect!<br /><br />These are her favorite pair!"
5.0,Roomy toe box.
5.0,Works well when running.
5.0,My son loves his new shoes! Highly recommended
5.0,For church.
5.0,The was the right fit and color was great. I washed the dress and color and dress didn‚Äôt shrink or fade.
5.0,Bought one of each color for my twin granddaughters for Easter. Super cute.
5.0,Cool gift!
5.0,Great product. Love it.
5.0,"One of favorite bralettes of all time, and definitely my favorite of the several CRZ yoga varieties I‚Äôve tried. I wear it as an everyday bra, and this works well due to its light support and lift, plus it‚Äôs so, so comfortable. I‚Äôm 125 lbs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù and a 30C and I ordered the small‚Äîsame size as I buy in Champion or Nike sports bras. My best friend (also petite/small chested) recommended it so this bra may work better for some body types than others."
5.0,"This is a beautiful prayer shawl.  Excellent workmanship and quality!  The blue is a deep indigo blue and that same indigo blue is in the tassels.  After showing this prayer shawl to family members, all of them were interested in buying one for themselves.  I highly recommend it.  The bag that comes with it is the same beautiful material."
5.0,I'd previously ordered 6 of these but was always running out so got this pack of 12. They are just the right size to stick in all my pockets.
5.0,Fits nice and will stretch for longer arms. Not too heavy and just right for my needs. Fast delivery.
5.0,Solid watch. Feels great on the wrist.
5.0,I wear these all the time versatile
5.0,The vest comes with plenty of accessories which is nice.  My son thinks it is great.  The quality is what I expected for the price but I wouldn't expect this to last long enough to be passed down.  We have not tried the &#34;clips&#34;  as we don't have a gun they go with.
5.0,Great product and super cute!
5.0,"Small and hugs the ear perfectly. Easy to put in and out, will probably purchase more."
5.0,My 5 year old daughter loves these masks!!
5.0,I think this is decent quality definitely comfortable and i would surely buy again especially for the price
5.0,"This dress was either going to be killer or just plain awful. I wasn't sure which, but I just knew it would be at one end of the spectrum or the other. Thankfully, this dress is totally amazing! Seriously it's so cute. It looks effortlessly adorable and I'm a little obsessed with the cut. The material is thick and it just feels well made all around. I', 5'2.5&#34; and about 130. I usually wear a small in women's or a Medium in juniors, I went with the Medium in this dress based on the other reviews. I really think a Small would have been fine, this fits me a little looser than I think it's meant to. It's really cute either way. I got lots of compliments on it at work!<br />I received this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest review. If you read my reviews, you can see that I do not automatically give any product 5 stars or a rave review because of the discount."
5.0,I love them. Will be ordering more
5.0,Superb ring!
5.0,The lights are easy to attach to a blk sweat suit and it runs on 1 battery. The auqa is very bright and my son loves it
5.0,"great material, super comfy, perfect size! I want one in every color!"
5.0,Lovely pocket-sized rosary for the money -- nice smooth beads & easy to pray with.  Great value for the money.
5.0,Love my new t-shirt dress !! Looks great on !! Size is ture to size
5.0,Great shoes for my 3yr old!
5.0,"The wooden gift box measures 2 7/8"" X 2 1/8"", and has a nice wood grain pattern on all sides. The lid fits tightly with smooth edges and no gaps anywhere. When you open the lid, the words ""Just For You"" are woodburned into the center of the inside of the top of the lid. The key ring inside the gift box is enclosed in a small zip lock bag. The writing on the key tag is large, black against silver, and very easy to read. The key ring itself is 1"" in diameter from outer edge to outer edge. The ring is nice and heavy duty, with no gaps as it wraps around. As you take the key ring out of its zip lock bag, the key tag itself has a protective film over the printed side to protect it from getting scratched during shipment. All these extra details make an excellent impression. Whether this key ring is a gift for yourself or someone else, it is a good purchase, and I am quite pleased with it."
5.0,Nice fabric that holds its fit and shape.  Nice coverage and color.  Fits as expected  I would buy again in other colors
5.0,Better than expected. Looks better than on pictures. Look well made and durable.
5.0,"Lightweight & cool for those hot days, but does run a little smaller than usual sizes."
5.0,"I absolutely adore these!!!! As you see in the picture, I made a whole collection of earrings out of these flowers - and that‚Äôs not even all of the flowers!! They‚Äôre so fun to make jewelry with, you can get so creative with them!! I‚Äôm definitely ordering more!!"
5.0,Looks nice & good quality
5.0,Beautiful shoe. Nice price. Fit as expected.
5.0,Bought for my daughter and she loves these. They are true to size and lightweight.
5.0,Great product or a high quality and precision.
5.0,Such good quality at a good price and it‚Äôs so bright! Loved it.
5.0,The tie is great and has even better quality
5.0,Me quedo perfecto.. linda la tela y por el precio es casi un REGALO..HERMOSO<br />.
5.0,"I'm always very skeptical about buying clothes online, but these yoga pants did not disappoint. They are very comfortable and fit me well. I am 5""4 and got mediums.. if that helps anyone. I like them a lot."
5.0,"Elephants are one of my favorite animals, so I was really excited to get these earrings.  The price point is low, so I wasn't expecting much, but they turned out to be super cute.  The quality is nice.  The little jewels on the earrings are held tightly in place.  The colors are gorgeous.<br /><br />These earrings arrive in a small box and include a little bag and small gift card, so it's perfect if you're giving these as a gift.  Overall, these earrings are excellent and I look forward to wearing them many times in the future."
5.0,"This is very comfortable and stylish, thick, and keeps me warm."
5.0,"I really like this skirt. The waist is a wide elastic. The material is nice and sturdy. Basically what you see is what I got, and I am super pleased. It will go with alot of different things."
5.0,Comes with all you need
5.0,Love these adorable shoes
5.0,This is just too cute! My 3 year old wore it to dance class today and she was in heaven and said she was a real ballerina! I will say the tutu is a bit high and so you can see panties but I just had her in tights and no panties so that solved that issue. She is asking for other colors so I will order more for her :)
5.0,My grandson liked this face mask.
5.0,"Purchased item for my 3 year old, she loves these earrings. I will purchase again for my nieces."
5.0,"I was looking for flashing that closely matched the small gold stripes in my kilt.  This did so nicely.  And the quality of the flashing is excellent, exactly what one should expect from this manufacturer.  Money well spent!"
5.0,Loved the fit of this shirt!
5.0,For the price this a solid product. Looks just like the pictures. Delivery was quick. If you're looking for an affordable A$AP piece this is a great choice.
5.0,My niece will love this as her birthday gift! Very cute and affordable!
5.0,"Great quality, perfect for graduation gift."
5.0,"I ordered a size larger to be safe, it is cold & layering is a possibility.<br /><br />N"
5.0,"Beautiful. I got this dress to do maternity photos for my Rainbow baby that I‚Äôm due with. I honestly cried when I tried it on it was so beautiful, soft, stretchy and bright. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 193 lbs, my bully does stretch it out but that‚Äôs al baby bump, and I bought a Medium. I recommend it. It even has POCKETS!"
5.0,The shirt does run small (but they made that aware when I ordered so I ordered a size larger) and it looks great. I like the design the shirt has and it‚Äôs great for the Fourth of July coming up!
5.0,Awesomeness  made in a pair of sunglasses...
5.0,"My head sweats profusely, even in the winter - I have a LOT of hair. I have a gazillion of the regular Maven Thread headbands that I love for keeping sweat and hair out of my eyes and fact, but I was finding that in subzero temps and strong winds, my ears just weren't warm enough but hats made me too sweaty. There were the perfect happy medium and got me through three full days of hiking high up in the Adirondacks this past Presidents' Day Weekend. I only needed a hat for the windy, exposed summits. I'm grateful they come in sets of two because I'd soak one entirely in sweat which you really don't notice until you take it off and try to put it back on, so I always kept a fresh one in my pack. They do dry quickly by the fire though!"
5.0,Great quality my son loves it!
5.0,"Love the necklace, feel so Carrie Bradshaw when I wear it‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,"Awesome purse! The canvas is a good heavy duty quality. The bag is really roomy, lots of pockets and zipper compartments. I love that it comes with a long detachable strap, plus the other 2 handle lengths that are on the bag. Great bag and I'll definitely buy other colors."
5.0,"This is a beautiful pendant! I bought this because I have an autistic daughter and want to show support. It was bigger than I'm used to (I'm used to tiny charms) but it's beautiful. The chain that comes with is hideous, looks like a cheap chain and guy would wear. But the charm itself is gorgeous, just make sure to get a different chain!"
5.0,love the hat. wish it was cheaper
5.0,Great shoe for play and school.
5.0,Spins smoothly! I personally love the feel of the raised characters under my thumb so that's a bonus to the design. The ring is not as heavy as I thought it would be but it really isn't much of an issue.
5.0,"I purchased this without a ton of confidence and I was pleasantly surprised at what a great jacket it is. So much so, I purchased another in a different color.<br />Don‚Äôt hesitate, it‚Äôs really nice!"
5.0,Very light earrings and easy to wear. They slide right into my piercings and go with any outfit.
5.0,"Got this for my daughter during Christmas, she loves it!"
5.0,Ordered the wrong color.... Just ordered the red one which is what I wanted in the first place...
5.0,"I bought this suit for vaca this past summer.  I bought the large and it fit perfectly. I have a 34F bust and the top stayed in place beautifully and IT WAS beautiful!  The color was as represented. The bottoms fit too, and I usually wear a 10. I love that the waist comes up how it's pictured!  Was skeptical because of some of the reviews but I am so happy that I didn't let that deter my purchase."
5.0,Like better with the belt
5.0,"Comfortable, forgiving fabric. Stretches easily and has a nice swing to it"
5.0,Bought it as a gift. The recipients were happy.
5.0,I wanted a smaller jewel for my monroe piercing and I received exactly what I purchased. Good quality and fast shipping. I am very satisfied:) Thanks!!!
5.0,"pretty good glove, I recommend"

5.0,I love these shorts. They fit well
5.0,"Dress looks amazing, great material!!!... i bought a M but it felt a little tight on the chest, then I decided to try a L and it was perfect!!!"
5.0,Product was as we expected it to be pretty well made love the little gift box it came in the chains could be of a little better quilety but for the price we are happy with the purchase
5.0,For a toddler...perfect...was surprised how well made they are including a Swiss style carrying pouch.
5.0,Perfect holiday party earrings! They look even better in person! Highly recommend
5.0,Very pretty ring.  Looks more expensive than it was!!!
5.0,"Wore these throughout the entirety of the 3-day Festival, and they held up AMAZING! I love these things, I still wear them to random events and will continue to wear them until they literally spontaneously combust! They're so pretty and so comfortable, finally a pair of wings that is truly a size for adults!"
5.0,"Great quality, stretchy, form fitting material. Very flattering. Can be worn with stockings or leggings."
5.0,It looks  very elegant. I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she is very pleased knowing she‚Äôs a little bit picky when it comes to jewelry but all i heard this time is good comments.
5.0,"A neat and surprising graphic for the '67 Pontiac Grand Prix. Just a small suggestion, however.  Pontiac only made a convertible Grand Prix in the year 1967, not 1968. Since the silhouette is obviously a convertible, the 1968 description is technically inaccurate. But the shirt is totally cool."
5.0,Looks great! I just ironed it to remove creases and hung it up using the little tabs that were already sewn into the back of it (very convenient).
5.0,So cute! The material is perfect.
5.0,Great buy and great for the price.
5.0,so beautiful! love this dress
5.0,"I like them , very good price"
5.0,Excellent conditions.
5.0,The beads/gemstones are a really good color.  Bracelet is easy to tighten and loosen. It is made well. I really like it and wear it often. It shipped quickly and was packages well.
5.0,"Hooping my ears, I have 3 holes in each ear and these earrings gave me the look. The earrings are comfortable to wear and I have sensitive ears. So far these earrings have not been a problem for me. I both both colors so one day I can wear all silver or all gold or mix it up....."
5.0,"The quality of the earrings is not exceptional, but at this price point, I was not expecting them to be. There is a couple of pair that I doubt I will wear, but overall I am quite pleased. It helps a lot when you actually get what you paid for. Thank you, seller, for being reputable. I have moderate issues with cheep earrings irritating my ears, but so far so good. Though I have not had them in all day.<br />Update: I have been wearing these earrings almost constantly for a week. I have not experienced any irritation at all. I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Love the quality, fit, and vibrant colors. Daughter loves these for basketball. They don't have seams that bother her feet and aren't bulky like other brands. Bought in other colors because she likes them so much."
5.0,Well made with warm lining.
5.0,"This bag is awesome! I am super impressed with how well it holds all of my stuff and ebags are so well made. I am a huge fan of their stuff, but this bag takes the cake! 3 weeks in Europe and I had everything I needed in this bag to get me through the trip!"
5.0,Love it! They r super soft and warm. I bought it in every color
5.0,"This dress was a hit! I received so many compliments. It traveled well, was easy to iron because it did not melt from the heat. The fit was very flattering and hid the extras.  Loved it. Id recommend and buy in another color."
5.0,"Soft, pretty, and You can breathe!!!"
5.0,In love with this purse! This is my second Kate spade I have owned! Such great quality!
5.0,"but, I am very disappointed, there was a stone inside the packaging that came off and one of the tiny links is broken and I have to figure out how to put it back together, other than that, it is beautiful and I like it, I just wish it wasn't damaged."
5.0,"Coming out of the cellophane package this dress looks very unimpressive.  It seemed thin, but had a nice silky hand to the fabric. It looked baggy in the top blouse portion but once I put it on and usedthe blouse snap, adjusted the elasticized sleeves, tied the belt....I‚Äôm in love with it!<br /><br />It fits as though I had it tailored.  I wear a small to CS mall but am medium build through the shoulders with a thicker waist not hourglass by any standard.  The elasticized waist and belt help make a gorgeous profile.<br /><br />Love the high low hem and as seen in the photo it looks fab with a pair of wedged peep toe shoes.<br /><br />This is a spring fall seasonal dress as the fabric is on the lighter weight side....maybe w tights boots and a sweater?<br /><br />Did I mention it has 2 set in pockets? No lumpiness where they are.... inconspicuous but useful.<br /><br />Great value for the price. HIGHLY recommend."
5.0,Got this for my oldest and he absolutely loved it. Definitely and grate gift.
5.0,This is a very nice scarf for a very nice price. I would like to purchase in other colors.
5.0,Multi functional belt that can be worn either dress up or dress down.
5.0,Great dress! Love the fit.
5.0,Very Comfortable & They‚Äôre My Favorite Night Pants/ Pajamas
5.0,"I was originally concerned about trying this coat, because I've always had a hard time finding a &#34;leather&#34; coat that fits properly. Usually it'll fit my chest, but be tight on the shoulders or short in the arms or vice versa.<br /><br />I'm on the smaller side (US small) and not really built, so I went with the Asian M and it fits almost perfectly. The only problem I found is that the sleeves slide up a bit if I stretch, but this is true with other coats of mine and it is not really an issue. I wouldn't mind trying the Asian L to see if the fit is better, but I am honestly happy with the size that I received. The coat has a modern, slim fit, so if you're on the muscular size, I would recommend going an extra size up from what the listing recommends.<br /><br />The coat is not actually leather, but PU faux leather. Because of this, the coat has a nice, light feel to it. It'll be perfect to wear now that the cool Autumn days are approaching. Unlike other items made of the PU leather, this didn't have any sort of chemical smell to it which is always a plus.<br /><br />There are two small zipper pockets on each side while the two on the front are just decorative and not functional. This also contains many decorative studs and buttons that are very stylish and fitting for the coat.<br /><br />Overall it is a really nice design and I love the fit of the coat. I'm impressed with the quality and comfort of the material and have a feeling this coat will last me awhile. For the price, it's really worth it."
5.0,I sent this to my sister in another state for her birthday. She says she just loves it!
5.0,This dress is so cute. I love the way it fits and its very well made. I wore it to a shower recently and everyone loved it! I would definitely recommend this dress.
5.0,Bracelet was made well.  Perfect for a teenager.
5.0,"I am 5'2 and weigh 160lbs. I have a 33&#34; waist and 43&#34; hips. I ordered a size Large and they felt too snug at first. I wasn't used to the tightness but it wasn't uncomfortable. I quickly realized they were sized just right. I wore them to roller derby practice and they didn't give me a muffin-top, didn't give me panty-lines and never needed adjusting. They didn't roll down at the waist like many other leggings did. These are not see-through and don't seem like they will get those annoying little fuzz &#34;balls&#34; where my legs sometimes rub together (while skating or walking).<br /><br />Waiting to see how they wash, but don't expect any problems. I will probably air dry these because I don't want to risk shrinkage. Will be purchasing more.<br /><br />Update: I now own three pairs of these pants in various colors. I have washed and dried them (whoops) repeatedly and haven't noticed any pillage or shrinkage. I use these for extremely heavy workouts and have really put them to the test. There is still no pillage occuring in the inner-thigh/crotch area. They are holding up well. I am really enthusiastic about these pants!"

5.0,"Love this backpack! Before I bought it I was torn between this and the Kanken. Glad, I chose this, but will still probably buy a Kanken. Not because anything is wrong with this bag but I just want one. Anyway...<br /><br />When I carry it to school, to work, and even Starbucks it gets so many compliments. Very durable and quality material. I would say that it is water resistant. Def Is not waterproof. However, even though the color is fairly light, it doesn't stain easily. I spilled black coffee all over it, pat it with a damp napkin and by the next day the stain was completely gone. Definitely want to buy more of these, including other styles.<br /><br />BTW this is a genuine Anello. Checked the web for how to spot a fake and this one is legit. I love it."

5.0,Very well made and my daughter loves it

5.0,"I've bought 2 pairs of these after being recommended by a blogger I follow. The first, black, and I loved them! No lint, easy fit, slightly dressed up legging.

I just wore some black boy shorts underneath. I also love the slits in skirts, they add a great dramatic effect. I'm 5'3 and wore it at my waist, and it was maybe a INSY bit too long (like 1/2 in.) , but not enough to bother me. The slit helps."

I would suggest sizing up if you're not at the bottom end of this range. This dress fits her perfectly with just a bit of room to grow.¬†<br /><br />I think the quality is there for this to last for my younger daughter.¬†¬† Machine washes and dries with no issue.¬†"
5.0,These scarves look great with everything.
5.0,"This the first time I have purchased these socks. Initially bought one pair to take a ‚Äútest drive‚Äù with these socks. After the first day I went back to Amazon and purchased 9 more pair. I bought the L/XL 15-20 mmHg socks and the fit is right on for me. I did purchase one pair of the 20-30 but they were too tight for me.  I will be purchasing additional pairs so I have enough for at least 15 days.<br />I did make one mistake, I dried one pair in the dryer and the shrank, so if you purchase these socks do not put in the dryer. I did wash them in the washer without any problems and hanged them to dry."
5.0,"I love this shacket. It is as pictured. It‚Äôs a little larger than expected but, that‚Äôs ok because I‚Äôm going to wear a hoodie under it. It‚Äôs thick it‚Äôs warm may possibly even cause one to be too hot ( personal summers aka menapause heat waves üòÇü§£üòÇ). Anywho, I highly recommend this one. I will definitely be purchasing in other colors.üíïüíï"

5.0,Great for a dressy look to enhance gold accessories.
5.0,"Great Perlman Hellboy mask and glove! Exactly as pictured. Plus it is a awesome deal at $35 for both!<br /><br />The eyes and skin are eerily life like. However, visibility is very difficult as you have to see through tiny slits next to the eyes (where the tear ducts would be). As amazing as they look, I will most likely be cutting the eyes out and replacing with yellow mesh.<br /><br />I will use some foam to reenforce the forearm part of the right hand of doom so that it keeps a more rigid rock-like shape.<br /><br />Great as is even without modding!"
5.0,"Love these for cheap sunglasses. I always seem to lose or scratch mine, so I can't justify spending a lot. I've had two pairs of these and get lots of compliments on the matte finish. Will buy again!"

5.0,"This is an excellent quality piece that I absolutely love.  This is so well made, the materials are really high quality.  I like this better than other similar brands.  I was not familiar with this brand until recently, I have a couple other pieces that have become my favorites.  I'm surprised how reasonably priced it is, I would be prepared to pay more.<br />This fits well, the cut is very flattering.  Order on the larger end to have room for layering underneath.

5.0,Cute and light weight material. Would recommend this cover up to anyone. Shipped fast and washed nicely.
5.0,Awesome! These are by far the best burp cloths I own. Super soft and the powder blue color is so nice. The only downside is that they shrunk during the first wash.
5.0,Most comfortable wedges ever! They fit perfectly and are exactly as described.

5.0,My son loved it. I love that you can adjust the strap to fit perfectly.
5.0,I've had this for a few months now and so far I like how it holds up.  It's not real leather but it's pretty durable
5.0,"Nice watch.  Well made.  Comfortable.  You will have to remove some links to fit, but it's not difficult if you're careful--I used a needle and a tiny flat-head screwdriver.  You can always take it to a jeweler to have it adjusted, if you're not confident that you can do it yourself.  Instructions for setting the time and date are in Japanese, but it operates like any other Baby-G--for which you can easily find English (and many other language) instructions by searching online.  (It's not difficult.)"
5.0,"This dress is simply gorgeous. Well made and fits like a dream. It has the perfect element of simplicity in the front, contrasting with the racy openings int he back. Can't wait to wear this number out!"

5.0,"It's Under Armour, of course it's awesome.  Enough said.  They're comfortable, move with you and don't bind up.  I chose them because they don't have any pockets; my plan was to take them on some obstacle courses but haven't gotten around to trying them there yet.  For the gym and trail runs they are great."
5.0,"Very comfortable, seams all are holding up and fabric is decent. Loving these dresses, bought 3 different colors!"
5.0,"Solid shorts, well made, seem durable."
5.0,"Best watched I have ever owned! Traveled almost to every continent with this watch and it didn't fail me. Multiply climates, multiply environments, a few falls, and it still tells me the time. What more could you ask for."
5.0,Big and spacious bag.<br />I love it!
5.0,Great quality thank you for your service
5.0,Sweet. Love the look
5.0,"I'm getting very picky about masks but these check all the boxes for me......3 layers, filter pocket, washable and have a  nose clip.  I like them so much that I bought them for my kids.

5.0,"This style purse has six outside pockets and another three inside with a large zippered section.  So easy to organize!  The pattern with navy and orchid colors goes casual with jeans or off to work during the week. It can't get much better than this.  However, I've been so happy with the last two I've gotten.  I'll be checking on all the patterns from now on."

5.0,"The pearl is beautiful, I didn't realize it would be so big.  I absolutely love it."
5.0,Came on time had to let two links out but watch so far it works perfectly very luminous and can be seen at night with the bedroom lights out. With white markings on black dial very easy to see during the day as well so far very pleased
5.0,I absolutely love this watch.  It is very well made.  I have a small wrist and so it fits great but it may be a problem for larger wrists.  I have gotten many compliments already.
5.0,My leather jacket I had before this one started falling apart really bad so I knew I had to get a new one. I got this for Christmas and its absolutely amazing. It's not stiff or hard to move around in. It's able to fit around my huge &#34;scarf&#34; I typically wear. It's really durable as well. I have two dogs who love to jump on me with really sharp nails and its never once torn. Indulge and buy it. You won't regret it.

5.0,"Ordered two of these in size XL, which is my regular size.<br /><br />While they took over a month to arrive, as they are shipped from China, they were worth it.<br /><br />The fabric is soft, the cut is flattering and comfortable and the weave makes it suitable for most weather (depending on what you wear under it.)<br /><br />Wish I‚Äôd have known that I‚Äôd like these so much, as I would have purchased in additional colors."
5.0,"Same size and style as DoorDash bag. This one feels more sturdy, however, especially in respect to the interior liner. They also each come with a thick plastic sheet that sits in the bottoms of the bags to give them a bit more support with heavier loads. Perfect for your small orders or an insulated grocery bag for 3-8 items depending on size."

5.0,"Very well priced for what they are--sterling settings with genuine, but not high grade emerald. Opaque, but the faceting helps them sparkle. Great daytime earrings, big enough to show up but still small enough to be lightweight."
5.0,"Color and style as pictured, it is a bit small. Doesn't have a lot of stretch and since it has to fit over your head it is slightly difficult to get on and off- but once on, it fits! Especially gets a little tricky to get off once you've been sweating."
5.0,"I love this little wallet/purse combo because it's perfect for my middle school girls. They can keep their phones, money and library cards in their own possession now, and it's small and can easily fit into their backpacks to take to school with them.  The wristlet came very quickly, and although it initially had a ""new plastic"" smell, that's faded quickly. The zipper is sturdy and the entire thing is well made. For the price this is a very great purchase!"

5.0,"I purchased one for a trial on my autistic son with sensory issues and adhd. At first we struggled with his willingness to put it on. It is tight to get on, but once it‚Äôs on he doesn‚Äôt seem to mind it. The result are astounding! He is more focused, still fidgety, less emotional. Just overall seems more comfortable. I‚Äôve purchase a second tank. Now he willingly comes to me for help to put it on and loves to show it off. Definitely recommend!"

5.0,"My brown Blundstones were absolutely battered, I hadn‚Äôt treated them since purchasing in 2014. They have seen more than their fair share of snow, rain, and dirt. This cream worked perfectly! I cleaned my boots first with a damp cloth, let dry, then applied this cream in a thin layer with a microfiber cloth. After letting it dry I removed excess and buffed with a flannel cloth. The boots look great! Other than the creases where they‚Äôve bent over the years, the boots look like new. Pictures show the before and after."

It's thin but it's a nice addition and not too heavy and warm like other ear covers I have for the cold of winter. Perfect for the fall or spring when it's not too cold yet.

5.0,"This is a great dress.  Really well made, the only thing I would say is that it fits everywhere except the waist, which was too big for me.  I ordered a size M and the top fits great, just about 3 inches too big in the waist, but I just took it in a few inches (which was really easy to sew, the dress really is made to be tailored) and it fits great now!  Other thing was the belt--it sits about an inch below where the line between the top and where the skirt starts, I look the belt off and just wear one of my own with it.  Overall I'm very happy with this dress, it's comfy and looks great!"

The construction of the shoes is fairly high quality and my small son did not have any problems with the tread, insoles or laces. The out plastic layer of the shoe also makes it easy to keep them fairly clean and looking good.

The good thing about this one is that it not going down when I sit.  I will keep my purchased because my goal is to have it fit me perfectly.  Not a bad purchased.
5.0,"Cute boots, esp. for the price. A bit slippery, but easily solved by adding Kiwi Sure Step Non-Skid Pads For Men's & Women's Shoes - 2 CT sold on Amazon for between $6-7. Because I have narrow, bony feet, I added a pair of cheap white insoles--the kind you can purchase at a pharmacy. NOW they're perfect!"

5.0,Very nice and comfortable. Make sure to let them air dry if you wash them!
5.0,"Ok, I have to apologize because I was initially disappointed because originally ordered this cap expecting an extra long version for long Locs and the one I received seemed so short. I couldn‚Äôt see how the cap could be marketed as extra long seeing as it only reached the bottom of my neck. But I have to say that this cap is like magic because I have waist-length Locs and the cap stretches and extends to fit them (without feeling super tight on my head), and it also keeps them contained all night! The locs do fold some because the cap stretches to about the middle of my back, not all the way to my waist, but that is what I was expecting when I ordered it, so I am very pleased with my purchase and feel comfortable giving it 5 stars. Oh, and the band doesn‚Äôt pull on my edges!"

Some times I would forget my watch, but I would always have this watch in my bag. This watch features an alarm clock, stopwatch, date, day, 24 hour time and of course, the time. All this for $10?! It is water resistant. I brought this watch in the shower with me many times and it still works fine (just don't press the buttons). I will admit, the case is a bit too small (only 33mm). Overall this watch is amazing for it's price."

5.0,These are adorable and fit my daughter great! They stay on her feet well and are well made. I actually threw them in the washing machine when they got dirty and they survived still looking cute!

5.0,Love this--it's the perfect size for my stature. Delicate but not so dainty that you can't see it. I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day.
5.0,"Arrived in a super padded envelope which I appreciate. You often hear about healing crystals arriving damaged and losing its energetic potency as a result and this was Def not the case here. The disks are held in place with evenly spaced, secure knots. And the size is perfect for my small wrist  but totally adjustable for larger ones. Highly recommend this purchase"
5.0,My boyfriend really liked it!
5.0,"Living in Oregon umbrellas are a must! This umbrella opens quickly and smoothly, and sort of reminds me of the one from Kingsmen. It also collapses nicely. Love the light on the bottom of the handle, lights up where you are walking which is nice at night. The carry case is a nice touch but I don't think i'll be using it."
5.0,"Fits perfect. Adjustable to fit more near waist or lower on hips. I ordered size small and I am 5-5, 130 lbs. hits just above my knees. Bought for trip to Kauai. Just what I wanted."
5.0,very warm and thick! I love it.
5.0,"Beautiful in person.  Does have a sewn in short slip cause the slit in the dress does come all the way up, doesn't take away from the dress at all.  Best part, the sleeves hide your arm Fat!  Win!!"

5.0,Exactly what it looks like! I love it!
5.0,Bought this for my teenage niece and she loves it.  Wears it all your round.  I guess that says it all.
5.0,Bigger in size than I expected. But super pretty.
5.0,"Love these shoes!  I'm an owl nut and had to have these.  I have wore them 4 times and for a long period of time, and they are comfortable.  They have decent padding, so that helps.  For me personally, I don't always like to wear shoes that are between my toes because they bug me after a bit. These were no different, but I still like them and will continue to wear them.  Fit was decent, but the elastic could have stood to be a little tighter.  I haven't had trouble with them slipping off though.  I wear size 8 1/2 normally.  I also bought a black pair for my owl-loving niece, and she loved them too."

5.0,Bought these for my 4-year-old to do screen time on his iPad. They fit his face perfectly. The glasses are lightweight and have a rubber grip so they don‚Äôt fall off. Very well made!
5.0,"This is absolutely gorgeous. The material is not as soft as I though, but it is by no means uncomfortable. It has some stretch in it but not much. I used to box and I'm not sure it would fit in the arms as comfortably if I was really jacked. It advertises itself as a dress and if that is so, it is very short in spaces and the slits in the front. I will not be wearing this as a dress, I will put sexy pants or leggings underneath. Also, the hood is amazing. Long witchy point on it. Its comfortable, sexy and dark. I'll be wearing this for more than just the holiday occasion I purchased it for. I'm 5'4"" 115, small chest and I ordered the small. Absolutely love this. Should have bought it sooner."

5.0,"Very nice, well made packing bag.  I love the size and know I will enjoy using it on our upcoming cruise."
5.0,Absolutely love my bracelet. The stainless steel is a good weight and shines more than I thought it would. I can't wear sliver as it turns my skin gray-green and the stainless wears well on my shin. I couldn't be any happier with my purchase.

5.0,Works great for my dads morning walks.
5.0,Had to return bc they were to big for my face
5.0,"These fit my petite 9-year-old perfectly. She usually wears about a size 8, but I ordered a 10-12. The slender fit was great for her, with enough length to wear with leggings. The fabric is thin but very soft and comfortable."
5.0,My wife was wearing it when i was home on vacation as i work over seas. It look very good on her. I should have taken pics.
5.0,Perfect workout top
5.0,the size chat helped.
5.0,Love the color and quality for a great price.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:fc2af42d39372556f7ca49a6e6a33fc8]] Great fit! Super soft stretchy but structured! Really keeps the girls in place while working out or even day to day running errands. Really love it will be ordering more. I‚Äôm a 38 double d and purchased a XL.
5.0,"These shoes beat out Skechers in my daughter‚Äôs opinion. They are lightweight, sturdy, & easy for her to put on & take off (she‚Äôs 6.5 & we bought a 2.5)."
5.0,Great shirt and great value.
5.0,I got these for my daughter. They are a great price and fit great. If you aren‚Äôt looking to spend lots on bras and get great bra then these are the bras you want to get. Couldn‚Äôt be more pleased
5.0,Solid umbrella
5.0,This fit perfectly! Fast shipping also!
5.0,"So beautiful, was delivered super quickly. Perfect size absolutely no complaints!"
5.0,The fabric is awful and not cotton.  Its very very cheap looking and fell apart when washed in delicate.  They send one product is nice then the rest they send are crappy and cheap.  Misleading to suck you in
5.0,"Great fit, look, doesn‚Äôt stain nose like other inexpensive sunglasses have before."
5.0,This is a beautiful coat!! Fits perfectly.. LOVE IT!!
5.0,Functions perfectly...very well made.
5.0,My friend wore this for a masquerade ball and it looked really good and fancy on him
5.0,"Strong and  Sturdy backpack. All zippers and closures are very well made and heavy duty.<br /> This backpack is much larger than it looks, a lot of space to hold your gear.<br /> They have thought of everything."
5.0,These are very comfortable and fit great. They wash very well. Don‚Äôt shed.
5.0,"Love these gloves. Was tired of buying the knit type of gloves and inevitably getting a hole in them every year, just to throw them away and get a new pair (no time to fix them!). These fit great even though I was worried the medium would be too large. I have small hands and a petite body and the medium was fine. Like that they also have the clip on the cuff to be able to put them together so they dont get lost. I live in NY and our winters (and falls, and springs :(  ) can be pretty cold so these are doing a great job keeping my hands warm. Also love the black grippy fabric on the palms. They work well for when you're driving and want to keep them on so that your hands aren't slipping on the wheel.Oh, did I also mention they're extremely soft."
5.0,I have a size 13 foot and they fit so I cannot complain!  For the price these are better than going to Walmart.
5.0,Good product at a low price
5.0,"Love it. I didn't even realize it came with 2 pairs, Red and Green.  Nice great for the price also."
5.0,"Very pretty,  I love it and it's the perfect length for me."
5.0,"Perfect fit for our 2 year old and they also fit me (average adult female). They were perfect for Monster Jam. Lighter weight than the other brand we had (that also fit, but slid down our 2 year old's head). Would definitely recommend for children."
5.0,Loved it! Got lots of compliments. Did ride up a tad but this material usually does
5.0,"Looks good, feels good. Wore it once and now will see if it lasts."
5.0,"This dress looks great. I honestly wish Allegra K had more dresses that were similar in different patterns. It fit me perfectly. It's hard to find clothes that look good on me -- I'm hour glass sized but also plus sized, at about 200 lbs and 5'6&#34;. I would definitely recommend this product. I'll update after a few wears & washes. It looks AMAZING!"
5.0,Great for mission trips
5.0,I wear them a lot
5.0,"I got the green one and I love it!, I'm 5'5 my weight is 112lb I got the size small. Fit beautifully"
5.0,"Super cute slippers, fits as expected, grandson loves them"
5.0,"Easy to attach, works"
5.0,"Son loved his necklaces! They are a lot prettier in person than expected.  They are &#34;delicate&#34;, but that is to be expected at this price.  If taken care of and worn for fashion (not rough play), one could expect long use.  We will likely replace the chains with black cord eventually."
5.0,I got so many compliments when I wore this skirt. It's made nicely and the fabric is a good thickness. I love this skirt.
5.0,U have to see to believe. Trust me I have about 10 now! Addictive and so pretty
5.0,love this dress so much I ordered a second one!
5.0,Well made  Perfect for my granddaughter
5.0,These give me a pretty alternative to stuffing my mask in my purse. They are lightweight enough to be unnoticeable. Very nice and worth it!
5.0,"I love this costume, it fit just perfectly.  The colors and fabric is beautiful and I would buy from this brand again.<br />Thank you so much it made our Church Fall Festival perfect. The children loved it..<br />‚ù§‚ù§"
5.0,"""Best glove ever, better than going to a store!""-My Mom"
5.0,"I love everything about this dress. I'm 5'2"" athletic build ,139lbs and the size small fit perfectly! It's super stretchy and flowy but not thin or cheaply made. I will definitely have to post pictures. Also, I'm very flat chested so it's loose around the bust but not in a bad way. Length wise, it sweeps the ffloor. If you're looking for a maxi dress, this is it! Totally worth $18."
5.0,Perfect fit! Nice material.
5.0,My son love it! Nice fabric.
5.0,"We got these for our almost 4 year old daughter and shes crazy about them. I love that theres a variety of colors, she picked the brown wine black pair since they look like ones that I have. She insisted on wearing them as soon as she got them snd didnt take them off until we sat down for dinner. Very happy mommy and toddler, I'll probably be ordering another pair soon."
5.0,Love it .can wear with any outfit.  Will b ordering from u again. Same as picture. Very pretty with other bracelets.
5.0,These are awesome! Great packaging too
5.0,Great quality. My husband was excited to get it as a gift and wears it all the time.
5.0,Wonderful dress.  I brought an XXXL expecting that it would run small (according to asian sizes) but it runs true to size.  I should  have purchased an Large or Extra-Large but I was scared that it would be to small.
5.0,Fun and unique.
5.0,Great look/fit
5.0,I had brain surgery ending with 35 staples on my head.  I needed a cute comfortable cap to cover up my incision while in public.  These caps delivered!
5.0,"Love this, super comfy and now my step daughter keeps steeling it."
5.0,Not my color but loved the saying.<br />Soft. Glad I bought
5.0,Does a great job!
5.0,Love this dress. The pattern is so nice
5.0,Shorts ride up  other than that great
5.0,"Great casual watch, band looks and feels like leather and the face is clear and fun sized. Very pleased with this watch."
5.0,Breathtakingly beautiful! I was shocked when it arrived! I thought it was going to be super tiny and wasn‚Äôt going to look ‚Äúreal‚Äù... this is a perfect size and the zirconias look like shining diamonds. It looks like a very expensive piece of jewelry! Absolutely love it!
5.0,Just got these today and I loooove them! They are beautiful. Exactly as described. There are a variety of stone sizes in each color and the biggest one is absolutely perfect for me!
5.0,"great product at a great price... i wanted to order a second pair, but it hasn't been available anymore"
5.0,"There is so much detail in this sweater but unfortunately because it's black it doesn't show in the pictures. However, in person it's super beautiful and there was a lot of work put into it. In addition, the stitiching is clean and the overall quality of this sweater is superior. I love wearing this because it super light yet keeps me warm. In addition, I've received many compliments on it everytime I've worn it. Great quality product and I would defiantly recommend it!"
5.0,Very please just what I wanted
5.0,Super cute. Can‚Äôt beat the price and the good quality surprised me!
5.0,"I am glad I found this item and bought it! Made in USA, Cotton and classy!"
5.0,"They were exactly what I was looking for, absolutely loved them!"
5.0,I purchased several pairs of these earrings about 15 years ago but never found green ones. I was delighted to find them from this seller and add them to my collection. The leverbacks are so comfortable and they make a big impact for a modest amount of money. All my Liz Palacios earrings look as good as the day I bought them and I wear them quite a bit.  I clip several pairs to a large safety pin and they have travelled all over the world.  Now if I can only find some red ones I would have every color I need. Hopefully someday.
5.0,Love these so much i have 6 pair. The colors are so pretty. And most importantly you can breath! They are a bit tight at first but just stretch em a little. They do feel a bit heavy but seriously they are nice!
5.0,kawaii! very cute and fits well!
5.0,I love the various designs and colors. My 5 yr old grandson chooses which pair he will wear happily. No fuss with Mom at busy morning
5.0,I used this while I was at the hospital for my breast reduction.  The robe fit great.
5.0,Great product and my dad loved it!
5.0,Nice quality and fits perfect. Perfect shirt for the shark fan.
5.0,Perfect leggings for the holidays.
5.0,Love this dress! Comfy and perfect for lounging around or doing every day things like errands
5.0,"I absolutely love this set, it's a wonderful addition to any earing collection"
5.0,"Gorgeous, good quality"
5.0,i LOVE THE DRESS DIFFRENT THE THE OTHER DRESS LOVE IT
5.0,"Buena tela, queda muy bien üëç"
5.0,Size perfect. Good product.
5.0,"I love leggins ~ they go with everything and are SO comfortable!  I sometimes struggle with getting the fit on leggins just right and I am always thrilled when I find that pair that is right on and luckily these are perfect!  And what is great is they are cut and made in a way that they should fit a really wide array of body type and size and still LOOK GOOD!<br /><br />Manufacture:<br /><br />These are put together well and definitely look and feel like quality leggins.  All seams are tight, stitching is nice and straight.  No errant threads to snip, nothing bunched up.  They look good.  I purchased the white.  I have yet to get my hands on a pair of lightweight, white leggins that are not see through.  I don't really think it's possible, but I would love a pair.  Not as much for myself as I am too old (or maybe just not confident enough) to wear these with anything but a top that covers my rear end but my 17 year old daughter would kill for a pair!  These are no exception but they are better than many.  I tried to show a bright blue and orange container with the fabric stretched.  These are CLOSE!  Again, they are lightweight and comfortable but made in a way to cut down on the free x-ray vision.<br /><br /> The fabric has a really nice give to it - it is hard to explain without seeing it ~ it has a give without looking all stretched but it conforms to your legs without looking bunchy.  (Which I will go into more with my little experiment!).  What I really love, as dumb as it may sound, was the extra attention to the crotch area ~ it is reinforced!  I love this as for whatever reason this seems to be where my leggins constantly split the seam.  I have no idea how I do this to my leggins but to me it is a sign of attention to detail and care for their product to add this to their leggins.  And hoping it will make them last longer for me!  Impressed that such an affordable pair of leggings goes the extra bit to make these better for the consumer...or just crazy people like me who somehow wind up with holes in the crotch of their leggins.  We won't even discuss it further...<br /><br />Fit/Sizing:<br /><br /> These may be one of the closet, &#34;one size fits all&#34; leggins I've seen.  They also fit me length wise which is where I have most of my trouble.  I am 5'7&#34; and about 128 pounds.  Often, one size fits all leggins wind up just looking a bit like floods because of my height and it is so frustrating.  These went right to my ankle and I am happy to report I did NOT have to keep pulling the waist up every 5 seconds because I had to wear them low to make them the right length.  They just fit like I wanted them to.  Just for my own interest I also had my daughter try them on - she is 5'6&#34; and 100 pounds.  A skinny rail, yet these wore tight to her legs!  Usually she complains if we share leggins that mine are not tight enough on her.  So...then I decided to have my best friend try them on ~ she is 5'2&#34; and about 155.  Again ~ these looked appropriate on her!  NO bunching at the ankles like they were too long and they did not look unnaturally stretched! How?  I don't know, but these are made to look good regardless of your size or shape.<br /><br />I am really happy with these leggins! In fact my best friend at 5'2&#34; is going to be buying several pair if she hasn't already, because as tough as it is to find leggins for a taller girl, I guess is how hard she says they are to find for petite!  If all of the colors are made as nicely as this pair and I have no reason to think they wouldn't be, this will be my go to for my leggin addiction from now on.  It is a no-brainer to me to buy a better made, better fitting leggin at the same price (9.99 at the time of this review) as all the others.<br /><br />I can't speak for anyone else, but I take my reviews seriously ~ I hope I have given some information that that has helped you out! I received this product at a discount for my honest and accurate review but I am not obligated to leave a positive review, nor do I receive any incentives or monetary compensation to do so. I personally get as frustrated and disgusted with some of the ridiculous and mindless &#34;reviews&#34; some people put up with zero care and I would hope my review is not disregarded just because of this with other people. My goal is to help buyers understand aspects of an item I would like to know before purchase. I am not affiliated with any company and am a normal consumer just like you. I pick items to review that I would normally want to purchase. (I don't do reviews for things I would already deem to be junk). I would never write a review for a product that is anything but my personal opinion and I have already purchased the product, nothing changes for me based on my review, but hopefully the time I put into writing can help someone out. Hope I was able to help ~ and please don't hesitate to ask me a question about any of the products I've reviewed; I am happy to help if I can!"
5.0,"Loved the color, fit,  and length. LOVE THIS DRESS!"
5.0,Bought this for my grandson and he loves it. Fit is great and washes up great!
5.0,Quite soft. My slim 10 year old son thought the fit was good.
5.0,Dress fits just as expected. Perfect dress for a fall wedding guest!
5.0,This is the best tank I own it never moves I never I to tug on it. I want 20 more of them. I actually looked it up so I could buy more of them. Plus the girls look great.
5.0,Pants are extremely comfortable. I‚Äôve worn them as pajama pants and also as lounging around the house pants. Great product for your money.
5.0,This ring is beautiful and very realistic. It's a nice size without being too big. And I love that it's stainless steel! I have very sensitive skin and this won't turn it green without the high price tag of paying for solid gold!
5.0,Cute summery dress. Fits perfectly. Front is cut a little too low but easily fixable by pinning the front otherwise it's a perfect dress.
5.0,My daughter loved this and wears it about everyday!
5.0,"It is just as described but it is definitely loose on the sides, I am using it as an over coat just to protect my expensive suit. If you want a perfect slim fit this is not the one. If you just want to protect your jacket , order a size up."
5.0,very good- quality is very good
5.0,This comes in sizes from s-xl. It's 2 pieces with a tube crop top and a l9ng skirt. It's easy to put on just may want to order a little smaller if you are shorter as it's pretty long and only way I could wear it being 5'1 was putting the skirt just under my boobs or over it. It's super cute with a floral print on the shoulder and a ruched cropped bandeau blouse with a high waist elastic maxi skirt which you can choose to wear as a maxi or midi depending on your height and the size you purchased
5.0,Bought this for my 9 year old daughter and we both loved it. Comfy and very fashionable.
5.0,Beyond expectations. Nice fit and nice fabric. Good luck ..
5.0,"worth what I paid for, less expensive than renting a costume, runs small"
5.0,"I hesitated between ordering a medium or a large and I ended up ordering a large. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 140 lbs. I probably could have gotten away with a medium but the large is roomy enough and comfortable. The bust fits great, not too much cleavage and the length falls a little below my knee. I saw some people had complaints about the thin fabric but I didn't think it was thin at all and in the maroon color I got it wasn't see-through at all. Happy with my purchase and might purchase another one as well."
5.0,"This Las Vegas sun is no joke. It‚Äôs seriously way too entirely sunny here and I have tinted windows and still need to have sunglasses on.<br /><br />That being said, I own a bunch of sunglasses. I think they can be a fashion statement plus eye protection and I like to mix it up. Here‚Äôs a more detailed review of these glasses.<br /><br />Appearance. These are exactly as pictured on the product page. I picked up the white marble with black lenses. The glasses have a slight chatty, vintage wayfarer look to them. They are definitely oversized so if you have a smallish face, this might not be for you, but I love big glasses. The bottom portion of the rim is a shiny gold and the ear piece has a bit of the marble on the tips but the rest is a brushed gold. They are a sharp pair of glasses and a departure from the everyday black or tortoise that I usually opt for.<br />Comfort. I am Asian and my nose bridge is quite a bit smaller or lower than most causasian people so I tend to find glasses slip down my nose a lot. These actually weren‚Äôt the case and were very comfortable. The nose pieces fit right at the top of my nose and stayed put as I walked around.<br />Price Point. At 19.99, this is fair and competitively priced considering it comes with a nice case that has a magnetic closure and felt lining.<br /><br />These will definitely end up in my regular rotation this summer.<br /><br />I received these free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,"Affordable, and I got the product that I ordered."
5.0,"Beautifully made, it's a gift that is sure to please."
5.0,"Very much impressed! Great Quality , warm for winter. Use them when working on my vehicle in the cold and it keeps my hands nice and warm!"
5.0,Love this cut top! I need to order Moreno like this for summer!
5.0,"I really like this dress, love the material and that it does not need to be ironed after washing.<br />I get so many compliments on the dress"
5.0,I love this necklace! It's beautiful and can&#34;t beat the price
5.0,these are so much fun to use and saves my manicure
5.0,I like the style and color. Item is just a little to big.
5.0,Great shirt! Fits exactly as expected and quality is excellent. Thank you!
5.0,9 year old grandson loved it!  He did yank off part of the chain after about an hour but still can use it.  He'll be using it with his Fortnight costume on Halloween.
5.0,"This pendant was lovely, shiny and larger than I thought, but the person I gave it to was happy. It is closer to being the size of a nickel than a dime."
5.0,"Ah!  I love this hat!  It's soft, and warm, and stylish for my morning walks in the cold climate in PA."
5.0,They are a good fit but if you wear anything over  an extra large they may not fit as well.
5.0,This is a great little tankini!  Appears well made and fits perfect. I am so glad I took a chance on it and am considering buying another.
5.0,"Exactly what my husband was looking for.  Not bulky, and very sturdy"
5.0,Besides being very stylish it is very comfortable.
5.0,"They a good inexpensive glasses, well made for the price yout pay.  They had accidently sent me the wrong colors and quickly sent me the correct order after I brought it up to their attention."
5.0,were easy on and easy off
5.0,Perfect for traveling.  I love the colors.
5.0,"Great colors, designs and most of all, my lil girl loves them,"
5.0,Easy to use and ideal for any man who wears a fit bit.  Lynn RN<br />Wish there was one designed for ladies smaller fit bit band.
5.0,Seen same top for sale elsewhere 90 bucks. THIS TOP IS SO MUCH BETTER SO GLAD I GOT THIS.
5.0,My future daughter in law loved then. She put them on as soon as she opened the gift. They are soft and warm. She is 5‚Äô10‚Äù and they are about 4‚Äù above the knee.
5.0,"Great hat. Good fit and looks amazing but was kind of hoping I'd get a misprinted one like LT did.<br />An actual New Era misprinted ball cap is worth a ton to collectors.<br />Especially when it's of two different teams on the same hat. Awesome!!!<br />I mean I can understand why someone would be mad about getting a defective product when expecting quallity<br />after purchase.  But if it really is a real New Era fitted hat and is licenced by the NFL, a hat with that kind of misprint<br />could fetch $200 to the upwards of $500 or even $1,000 on Ebay.<br />Wow LT!!!!  Your a lucky duck!!!"
5.0,These will work perfect as a men's gift at our wedding. The shine on them is fabulous. My fiance tried them on and said they fit his head (which I would say is average to maybe a little large) just fine. Really fun gift for a pretty reasonable price.
5.0,"This jacket (yes, jacket) is awesome! It has canvas-y feel with a stiff feel versus a soft flannel. Yesterday it was put to the test. 80 degrees and sunny for a four hour ride. My counterparts mostly wore short sleeves and were comfortable but burned. This jacket actually kept me cooler because the sun did not beat down on my skin all day. That being said, it is good for hot or cooler temps. When I say cooler I mean the days you need one extra layer‚Äîthis is by no means warm whatsoever. It reminds me of my ACU (All Combat Uniform) in the military when I was deployed overseas. It would be 110 degrees but this layer is the added protection you need to keep you cooler and safer from the sun.<br /><br />As far as fit. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and 195lbs w bit of beer belly thanks to COVID-19. I would not categorize this as ‚Äúslim fit.‚Äù I got a L because I wanted something fitting looser and bigger. I likely could have gotten away with a M. The large will be good for the cooler days when I layer more."
5.0,Love it. My initials
5.0,"Very well made, fast shipping, would buy again from this seller.  The oil can was very realistic and even squeezable,made a perfect prop for my daugters Wizard of Oz play."
5.0,"Better quality than expected, well made , true to size"
5.0,"This dress is classy and surprisingly well-made.  The green was a little darker than pictured, but still cute."
5.0,Perfect.  I get to look at this beautiful face all day.
5.0,Arrived so quick and fits as expected. Couldn't beat the price and was exactly what I needed to complete a look!
5.0,"II was tired of wearing my yoga bras around the house.  I wanted something prettier and looser than a sports bra.  These bras have more support than the lace bralettes that some stores sell.  I don't think you'd want to wear it if your a C cup and have a busy day outside the house.  However, it's much more comfortable than an everyday bra that you don't want to wear when you're home."
5.0,Great fit it‚Äôs so soft and nice and is also stretchy
5.0,Fits my 10.5 bowling shoes and can hold extra soles in side pouch ++
5.0,Si me sirvio
5.0,This is gorgeous and the color looks like a rose gold. Chain shorter than most necklaces but was perfect for me.
5.0,"This is a very comfy shirt, the ""weave"" pattern makes it snag easy on things. Love the color too"
5.0,"My previous ratchet belt was starting to wear out so I bought this one to replace it. I'm glad I did because this one is fantastic. My old one tightened with a very loud VVRRRRRRRPPPP. When I got dressed in the morning I would leave our bedroom to fasten it so I wouldn't wake my wife. This one is almost silent which I appreciate. It holds tight in position and releases very easily with the flip of a tiny lever at the bottom of the buckle. Looks nice too. I've only had it a couple months so I can't speak to its reliability, but so far so good."
5.0,make sure if you order the right color. the picture doesnt change with selection!
5.0,Perfect size and the material is super durable.
5.0,"I was initially nervous about getting these because of the reviews I saw saying how easily the posts got broken, but I ended up  discovering that you have to be pretty careless and/or aggressive putting these in to break them.  These earrings are so lightweight, and being made out of wood means I don't have to worry about the metal irritating my ears.  How you put them in does take some getting used to, but if you take your time & pay attention to what you can feel you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly."
5.0,"They are silky, soft and look great but go up 1 or 2 sizes up. My husband has the satin pjs too and the small fit him perfectly and these boxers were too small. Had to return them but we'll buy them again as he really liked them"
5.0,bought for a gift. They loved them.
5.0,Nice ring and style. Great fit too.  A great addition to any collection<br />of rings. Can go with anything you wear.
5.0,Fits better than surgical masks.  Reusable
5.0,when he got these as a birthday present.  Very well made and high quality materials.  One more piece of PPE that should keep him safe while forging.
5.0,"Fit perfectly, easy to install"
5.0,This band is thicker than other silicone bands that I've used but so far that have made a bit of difference. I love using silicone bands in the summer to avoid a stinky band or the discomfort of a band that takes a long time to dry since I'm in the water often.
5.0,"Lovely dress, just runs small but gave me refund n let me keep dress RECOMMEND"
5.0,Way better than was expecting!!! Love this sun hat and can't believe I waited so long to order it!!
5.0,Fit true to size. Kept my child's feet dry and warm in the snow.
5.0,Prettier in person its weighed than you think got lots of compliments
5.0,lovely dress great for work
5.0,"Easy to read, luminous dial."
5.0,So far no dislike ! I have small waist but very adjustable
5.0,Got it as gift for a friend. Totally likes it.
5.0,"I have heard these called &#34;magic leggings,&#34; and they absolutely loved up to the hype.<br /><br />They don't slide around, even during heavy weights and running."
5.0,I bought these a split them with my daughter. We both love them.
5.0,"Its a cool hat, like the colors and most people wont even know the backstory"
5.0,"I love this earring. I got my cartilage pierced a year ago and it has had trouble healing. Even with surgical steel my ear was so sensitive and painful. I read that surgical steel can still contain nickel (just a small amount), so I wanted to try titanium.I changed it to this earring and I haven‚Äôt had a problem since."
5.0,Super cute! Goes well with my fettish for nautical things.
5.0,Used these for a vampire costume and they ended up being the most noticed accessory. Great value for price. Most can be adjusted to fit any finger. A few cannot.
5.0,I can wear them day or night without discomfort and the tinit is good for riding my motorcycle at night as well as during the day.  I am please with this purchase.
5.0,"GREAT purchase  and fit greay,had to exchange  size had prompt response from Amozon."
5.0,Awesome little sun hat for my 8m old daughter! She gets compliments everywhere we go. Definitely recommend.
5.0,Beautiful print and color. Great value for the price!
5.0,works really well with my keys  thank you.
5.0,Love the fit of my band. Would def buy again. And def recommend it! I get compliments on it.
5.0,What cute earrings!  Bright color!  Perfect size. So happy with them!  Perfect for my Hawaii vacation üå¥‚òÄÔ∏èüê†
5.0,"Very strong Corduroy Bag With Nice strong Pull String. All my 3‚Äù King Size Pieces would fit in one bag, but I recommend two bags, one for each color.  Reviews from both Amazon and other distributors led me to this bag. I am happy with my decision buying two bags.I love these bags."
5.0,This is a beautiful prayer shawl and great quality .
5.0,I use these glasses for kayaking down a local river. I so appreciate they they float so I can focus on keeping control of my paddle rather than trying to save my glasses. Great customer service too! You can call or e-mail them and they respond quickly.
5.0,These are very pretty. I love them!
5.0,"I am enjoying wearing this NAVY ring, it's comfortable and has a very striking appearance,the price and prime shipping makes thia a great gift idea."
5.0,Absolutely precious! I can‚Äôt wait to wear it in the fall with boots and in winter with leggings and boots!
5.0,If I could give this 1 million stars I would! I love these sunglasses! They are amazing and perfect and completely block the sun.
5.0,Using the straps for my 10-year-old cheerleading daughter- ensure work great!
5.0,I love this item! I wore it for a bachelorette party out in San Diego. We went with a 1920's theme and it was perfect. I didn't even have to adjust it.
5.0,petite and lovely
5.0,"Flowy, pretty, and most importantly... comfy! Great buy. I'm 5'6&#34; and the size Large hit me right above the knee"
5.0,Everything my son hoped for!!  Even an opening so he could take a wee wee. Lol
5.0,Thick leather bag with a snap out zippered cloth organizer inside. The leather itself is raw inside the tote. This tote has a huge capacity for its size. It's big but not unwieldy. Serves its purpose for me and it looks great.  Note that it does not have any closure for the bag except for the organizer inside. The leather is thick so I'm pretty certain it will last a lifetime.
5.0,"Sexy in a very respecatble pretty way. Love this dress. It's gorgeous! So many compliments. And very comfortable, plenty of stretch.  I'm 5' 3"" and it is extra long, drags on floor but I used it for a costume so that didn't matter. i had on low heel shoes about 1"". I'll hem it for next time. I almost didn't get it because of the cut outs. I'm getting bit older, great waist but not so much in boob area. Solved the problem with a black  strapless halter. The black worked lovely with the dress color.<br /><br />As far as size I'm about 118 lbs with a small top A cup so I went with the small. Still it was just a tad loose if you are expecting a super tight fit.  I""m completely in love with this dress so comfy and stunning. Especially in this price."
5.0,"I bought a pack of these for camping and playing at the river in 2020. I didn't want to lose or scratch up my higher-end sunglasses. They worked so well, I recently bought my second pack for summer 2021. I carry them to the river, lake, ocean, bbqs, camping, you name it. I don't feel bad handing them out to people (yes, to keep!) who forgot or lost their sunglasses. The colors are fun and they're sturdy. The lenses will scratch, the way any mirrored sunglasses will - but for the price and their function, I'm happy with this purchase."
5.0,great buy!!!
5.0,"Just ordered these the other day and they were delivered today. I was skeptical, never seeing this design before, but wanted to try something to hold my glasses securely on my nose. These look as if they will do the job nicely. I have to put them on loose, then tighten them to a comfortable level. I must loosen them to take my glasses off again. Additionally, the straps were accompanied by what appeared to be a hand-written note! Who does that? If need be, I'll but from this company again."
5.0,"These are exactly like a pair of gold earrings that I bought back in the 20th century except they are silver (duh).  If they last as long as the gold ones and don't get lost, they will be perfect. The gold ones have always been lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Plus the click top fasteners seem to latch and hold forever so I've never lost one. These earrings seem to be the same.  And now that I've grown up to be an eccentric, I can wear a silver one and a gold one at the same time to see just how observant people really are..."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous but way to small
5.0,Ordered this for my grandson. He picked it out and loves them. Fit well and looks  good.  Good choice
5.0,Fabric was very soft and comfortable. Almost kept just based on that! I‚Äôm just not a normal/average  size/shape because I‚Äôm short. So it‚Äôs incredibly hard to find any sort of clothing that fits me. This would be probably be flattering on most average body types though.
5.0,It's beautiful and well made.  I have already received many compliments on it at work.
5.0,These are precious! I got one for me and The other 2 for my mom and my brother just to bring some festive cheer and to the house when my daughter is around so that she becomes more familiar with the season perion they fit great and they are very authentic looking.
5.0,"Looks great, good protection."
5.0,"Wife has failing sight, and the number she can see but the silver hands with a white face not so wonderful. The hands or the face should be a contrasting color. only had the Watch a couple of months and have already replaced it."
5.0,"Wow, this was a great purchase. Arrived quickly with Prime shipping, in the same box as my Manic Panic &#34;Pillar Box Red&#34; so I got right to work.<br />  I mention my red hair because if you've ever tried a bright color like this, you'll understand what a mess it can be just to keep the color up. Pros: These tools are better than any brushes I've used, it takes much less product to get the job done (my hair is almost to my waist).<br />Clean up is a breeze- they rinse right off!<br />I would recommend this product to anyone coloring their hair- you'll look and feel like an instant professional.<br />I can finally get gorgeous red locks without my bathroom looking like just I murdered someone."
5.0,Goes well with a crew neck sweater.  Will wear with my cameo pin
5.0,One of my favorites rags to wear!!
5.0,"For the money you can't beat this. Hands down! Considering the price I will purchase several, even if they only last me a year it's a bargain."
5.0,"I got these for my mom for christmas and she loves them- hypoallergenic (she has very sensitive ears and can wear these all day), not too heavy, and very cute! They arrived quickly and were well-packaged. However, I will say that they slip out easily and I would highly recommend wearing earring backs with them."
5.0,This was a gift for my mother for her birthday. It was packaged well . She is about a size large she likes her clothes flowy so I got her an xl and it met her expectations
5.0,But only because that's the smallest size they had and it was at 9/10 when my daughters in 8/9 however if it as it was described so I'm not gonna take that away because I expected it to have a little bit of space to to the size but it was true to the description and I can't wait till the company makes more and different variety of sizes since me and my daughters I have for the slides I was excited to find a pair for my three-year-old who won't take them off her feet and out of all the slippers and sandals those are her fave!! So it's a five star for me!!! If you don't have the same situation as I do just make sure you go one size up
5.0,I‚Äôm a size 9 US and it‚Äôs fits good! Like the color and design.
5.0,It is absolutely beautiful. It was a little long on me however I'm a little short. I wore it as a dress like a caftan. I didn't have beach trip planned and it worked fine. I should of worn more of a heal. It is well made. Not see through. Very roomy and comfortable. Slits on both side show some legs when walking. I bought other colors after I received this.
5.0,"It's comfortable, light, cool and it fits right. Glad I made the purchase."
5.0,"Very nice Buckle, nice and sturdy"
5.0,Shiney and clean looking.
5.0,"I just purchased this band for my fitbit and I find it to be comfortable and soft, easy to adjust and easily stretches to fit over my hand.  I can't speak to durability yet as I've only had it a few days.  It certainly feel sturdy.  I might order another one next month in a different color!"
5.0,This top is stylish and fits as expected. It's comfortable and durable.
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this hat. I have a medium to large size head but this hat fits just fine. Just had to loosen it some in the back and it gave me a perfect fit. The adjustable strap in the back makes sizing a piece of cake.  The fabric has a really nice vintage washed look and feel.  It really does feel like I've had it for years. It came with that broken in and worn look. The curve of the bill was a bit too flat for me, so I just bent it a little on the side and it took a perfect shape and it stayed.  It was very well packaged but it was a bit wrinkled when it arrived but those wrinkles fell after about 10 minutes of wear.  Note in the picture the wrinkles and then only a short time later the cap is completely smooth.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I am thinking about buying another one."
5.0,It dresses up any plain outfits
5.0,Life saver when I had my shoulder surgery. It‚Äôs comfortable and washes up great. Size ran true.
5.0,I love these leggings! Squat proof 100%! You wont regret buying these
5.0,Liking everything
5.0,I bought this as a gift and was very happy with my purchase. The keychain is well made and is packaged nicely.
5.0,"I love these PajamaJeans! I don't like wearing jeans a whole lot. I am a size 8-10, but I am short and have wide hips, so jeans aren't the most comfortable thing for me. The PJeans fit well and are actually somewhat flattering, which I was not anticipating. The reviews are correct that getting them over larger hips can seemingly be a little difficult, but once you do, they loosen up a little bit and are so comfortable that I can honestly say that I have fallen asleep in them."
5.0,"My boyfriend bought me the bracelet for my birthday. It is very beautiful. The bracet and charms are well made, has good weight to it and not too heavy or too light. It' s perfect! The charms are good size, very noticeable and has a pleasant sound when you jingle the bracelet.  Very happy with my shiny and beautiful charm bracelet!!"
5.0,Love love these shorts. Sooo buttery soft and very nice fit. Pocket is more to the front side than the side side. I love getting up for my walk and sometimes take a shower and put them back on.
5.0,"I've gotten so many compliments with this watch!  It's comfortable and the readout options are pretty sweet.  If you plan to wear it a lot (like I do) you may want to take to cleaning it often.  Mine is getting dirty on the edges and I haven't found a good way to clean it yet.  It doesn't really bug me because no one seems to notice, but I wish I had kept up with wiping it off after use.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's GREAT."
5.0,Now my luggage will stay intact
5.0,"Got this cover for Hawaii. I loved it and got so many compliments!  When i first took it out of the package, i was nervous.  It was VERY thin and staticy.  But once i got it on with my outfits, i was in love! its super cute!!"
5.0,beatyfull
5.0,"This, quite simply, is a wonderful watch - especially considering the price, which is currently only 85 bucks. For that amount of money, you get a beautiful Swiss made watch with a sapphire crystal, precision timekeeping, a second hand that hits all the marks, and a refined and elegant aesthetic.<br /><br />The leather band is more than adequate and is much better than most stock leather bands in terms of looks and comfort.<br /><br />So far, after a few days, timekeeping has been accurate to within about two-tenths of a second. Nice.<br /><br />The only thing that could have made this watch better is solar charging, but I don't even know if Victorinox makes solar watches. In any case I'm perfectly happy with it the way it is.<br /><br />Victorinox really hit this one out of the park, especially at this price point. Do yourself a favor and buy this watch before it inevitably goes up in price."
5.0,I have rhuematoid arthritis and these are great for me to wear while working. Keep my hands and wrists warm while freeing my fingertips for typing.
5.0,"Very flattering, very complimentary -- can't go wrong!"
5.0,The bold print was so easy to spot on airport luggage carousel - love it!
5.0,Great earrings. Have received a lot of compliments
5.0,I have so much fun with these.
5.0,Exactly as offered.  Thx!
5.0,"Very nice bracelet, the different purples sparkle.I have small wrists and it fits perfectly without being tight. I would recommend more for small wrists. It also looks good paired with other purple bracelets."
5.0,These sunglasses are super cool and different. Very stylish. Fast shipping and cane in tact.
5.0,I love it !!!! Perfect for my ten year old.
5.0,Super cute sweater dress and not too thick! It was a little short on me when I bent over but I wore spanx with leg compression so you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything if the dress came up. You could also see the black tights I had on underneath so I wore my skin color spanx over the tights so you couldn‚Äôt tell. 10/10 would recommend!
5.0,I purchase this few months ago and use it almost everyday. Perfect!! Great backpack! Very comfortable and have a lot of room for different things!!! Thank you!
5.0,Lovvvvvvvve it
5.0,I LOVE THIS PIECE AND SO DOES MY FIANCE. I BOUGHT IT IN A SIZE MEDIUM AND I AM 5'8 140LBS AND IT FITS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE. IT IS VERY SEXY AND HE WANTED ME TO KEEP IT ON THE ENTIRE NOT. IT IS COMPARABLE TO VICTORIA SECRET AND GREAT QUALITY!!!!
5.0,"I'm not sure how I made it to 56 without figuring this out but this guy just needs a bag like this. The weather is getting warmer and with no coat pockets to put things in it was going to be another season of stuffing all my gear into the pockets of cargo shorts. This bag arrived today and I really, really like it. I'm the kind of guy that is real picky about things like this and I'll admit that I was a little self conscious about how it would look. I mean, it would be ok if it looked a little weird (or just felt weird) but its totally cool. It has a well made yet somewhat rugged look to it and I love the color.<br /><br />I adjusted the strap as far out as it would go and the bag is right at hip level where I want it. It has a big flap with a small velcro closure and is quite easy to open. Once opened there is a good size pocket on the front (and a smaller zippered one on the back) where I can put things that I want to get to easily and of course a large central zippered pocket that will easily hold my 8 inch tablet if I need it to.<br /><br />My main objectives for this bag were to carry a good sized mod vape, my phone and maybe a water bottle. The water bottle idea is going to need more thought though as the bag might be a little small for that. It will fit but not with anything else in the main pocket. This bag is well constructed inside and out. The canvas material looks and feels just like what Carhart jackets are made of so I know it will hold up well. This is exactly what I was hoping for and I would buy it again in a minute. Outstanding!"
5.0,Gorgeous bought for my daughter and it‚Äôs great
5.0,Love it. Lots of compliments.
5.0,"This bralette is fabulous! I love wearing it. It's very comfortable and provides enough support for me. I am somewhere between a B and C cup and this has worked out very nicely for me. It gives me some lift and makes my breasts look nice. I recently lost a lot of weight, so this is area has become a huge problem for me.<br /><br />I have been using this for months and I find it supportive, comfortable, and nice looking. It goes well under anything I've worn it with. I will be purchasing more of these!"
5.0,"I have tried several different styles of compression stockings after having sclerotherapy, and these are by far the best!! I am 5' 8&#34; and 143lbs. I ordered the large and they are perfect! The stockings come up to my bottom, so they are definitely long enough. The band stays in place and is comfortable. So glad to have these now, definitely much better than using the ACE bandage I started with. A nice treat for my legs at the end of a long work day. I am going to place another order today. Thanks!!"
5.0,Love love love even ordered more for friends
5.0,They look so real! People have asked me if they hurt! Lol love them
5.0,So cute!!! Have gotten tons of compliments on them!!!
5.0,I cant wait for Halloween....my 2 yr old is precious as a fairy unicorn princess
5.0,I wear when weather is less than 50 degrees for driving and walking
5.0,Perfect length and stays where you need it. I get tons of compliments.
5.0,"This is one of my favorite summer dresses!  Feminine, lightweight, not too short, and cool...who could ask for more? ;0)<br /><br />As you can see from the images, I wear a red bra underneath because I cannot possibly go braless...LOL!<br /><br />The material is 100% rayon -- absolutely PERFECT for the brutal summer head of Texas!  I worried that it would shrink as have many other dresses I buy from Amazon, but was so delighted that is did not - that is with my washing it in cold and did not putting it in dryer - just air-dried it.<br /><br />The little scallops around the bust and the back are really cute!  It and print are what make it.  My hubby loves it and told me it's one of my favorite dresses.<br /><br />I am usually a size 16 and ordered the XL.  I was a little worried about it fitting me, especially in the bust, but it fits perfectly.  If anything, the bust is actually a little loose which is unusual given that I am really big chested."
5.0,very small short chain but nice
5.0,"Nice, just as described, would buy again"
5.0,"My daughter is in the leadership program for her high school marching band and these are perfect for the new members ""Welcome Bags""! Very fast shipping and good price for something fun!"
5.0,"Perfect Medium size canvas bag.  It opens nice and wide at the top for easy access.  Inside is a divider with a zipper pocket big enough to fit a small wallet or a few cosmetics.  Also on the inside are a zipper pocket and two smaller pockets on each side of the bag. On the outside, is a small zipper pocket big enough to fit a large cell phone or what nots.  The two zipper pockets on the front are fake...let me take that back, I was able to fit a Chapstick in there.  The shoulder straps are long enough for the bag to fit comfortably over the shoulder.  I am size XL to 1x ish so sometimes this is an issue.  The bag also comes with a longer shoulder strap that converts it in to a crossbody, that also tucks nicely into the purse without taking up any extra room.  Again the strap has plenty of length for the larger girls.  I used it for a trip to Puerto Vallarta, it folded nice and flat in my suitcase and came back to shape when I was ready to use it.  Great bag for the price."
5.0,Looks like jewelry not a sportswatch
5.0,I used these to attach my arm wraps to for my Rey cosplay. Absolutely perfect!!
5.0,"Very sexy shirt, fabric was a bit heavier than expected but not overly so. Quite comfortable fit."
5.0,Definitely a great slipper!!!
5.0,Very nice Nike shirt. Washes well. I line dry it so I‚Äôm not sure about shrinkage. Still looks new after many wears and washed.
5.0,The dress is beautiful but the sizing is large. I usually wear a size 10-12 so ordered XL as it said it corresponded to US 10. It was way too big!
5.0,This night shirt HAS POCKETS. I love it!
5.0,"Buena calidad , excelente empaque , bien precio"
5.0,love it but thin
5.0,It adds a beautiful addition to the watch. Exactly as described.
5.0,Very cute and comfortable shirt.  I sized up for a looser look.
5.0,Wife loves them. She really enjoys these.
5.0,Looks cool and good quality. Super soft t-shirts.
5.0,Loved the top but it was too small for me.
5.0,"Fits perfectly, works great when you have hot flashes."
5.0,Good quality exactly what I ordered lost 2 of them so will be ordering more !
5.0,I am in love üòç like the product is exactly the right size and fit. It came on time it looks just like the picture and as a teacher it definitely satisfies me in a professional world!!!
5.0,I absolutely love this chocker got a lot of compliments and it glitters nicely
5.0,Works great for my daith piercing
5.0,Love love love these pants. Very comfortable and fit perfect!
5.0,"Best mask yet and I use it for working out!!  I run sprints, 8 minute miles and it‚Äôs the best yet.  I love it and will probably order more."
5.0,Great fit and very soft and comfortable.
5.0,Great product! Super fast delivery!!! Perfect fit!
5.0,Really cute.  One of the feathers had fallen off when I opened the package but the earrings are still beautiful.
5.0,"Loved it! The color was gorgeous and the fit was good. Bought it for my mother-in-law for my mother's wedding... Her measurements are 5 feet 5 inches, 135pds, she's a 36c in breast measurements. Hope it helps anyone."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous love it
5.0,Just beautiful and elegant.
5.0,Beautiful and soft fabric
5.0,Ever since I got this I have been wearing this regularly. What I love about this is that its high neck and covers my shoulders well which makes it great if you're into modest wearing or need something to wear under. Even on its own its beautiful. The material is soft and has a gorgeous fall. Only thing is that I wished it was a bit longer in length.
5.0,"When I first got it I wasn't sure if I liked it. It has a sheen to it it. The inside is not fuzzy like a regular type sweatshirt, more like a French terry inside. Well I wear it all the time now when I get chilly. Doesn't make me hot, its just enough."
5.0,"Love these shoes, I have had a pair before, also have a white pair. Can walk forever and my feet do not hurt in these shoes, much better support than it appears."
5.0,I absolutely love the fit of this skirt. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 175 and curvy with a smaller waist. The medium hugged my curves in all the right places all while being very comfortable and nonrestrictive
5.0,"I was expecting the gift to be just like the picture, but its not. Its more, the front looks about the same but on the back there was Happy and Natsu's signatures and their footprints on the back. ^.^ Also, in the inside of the wallet had the first letter of the recipient's last name. It was a fantastic birthday gift and they loved it so much! I want to thank you ^.^"
5.0,I am going to get more! The fit is sexy and the colors is great. I like that it's a mock turtle neck and not a full one.
5.0,The pants are made well and fit just like the size we ordered.  I would order them again!
5.0,"I love this set of earrings! They're very unique and cute; the cuff fits well, and I've gotten many compliments on them. I would recommend them to anyone who likes pretty leaf designs, &#34;sophistication&#34;, and cuff styled earrings. :)"
5.0,"Surprised by the flexibility and quality of the material! So nice to find socks that fit comfortably around my 14.75in calves! I was mad at first, as Amazon pulled plus-size stockings! I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 129 pounds. Definitely not plus size! But, legs are muscled! Anyhow-these fit nicely and stay put! I will order more!"
5.0,"Eye catching, and looks well made."
5.0,Love the bright colors and the material!
5.0,Perfect fit for a 7 year old's Halloween costume.
5.0,"super cute and good quality, I love it!"
5.0,My son loved these shoes! He wore them everyday for over a year until he grew out of them! They are extremely durable!
5.0,just as advertised!!
5.0,The tank is a great alternative to a vest.  My son loves wearing it.  He wants to wear it every day so I‚Äôm going to need to buy more.  My only complaint is that the shoulder area is a bit roomy but this could be bc he is so thin.  Would probably fit fine on the average child.
5.0,They are exactly as described. Work great
5.0,"Recently received item. Initially surprised at the good quality for the price (a fraction of the famous store brands). It‚Äôs been washed, worn and washed again. Time will tell, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"I would buy this item, in RED but I don't see any size 8's<br />Please explain."
5.0,I really loved this item.... Fabric very soft and nice
5.0,"Just as expected.  Very cute necessities bag.<br />*Two zippered pockets on the fold.<br />*2 Side pockets.<br />*An organizer for items such as toothbrush, makeup brushes.<br />*Sturdy zipper<br />3 sections on the inside that travel size bottles<br />3 tighter pockets behind those<br />2 more mesh pockets that a comb fits nicely<br />It feels like water resistant material, but not plastic.<br /><br />I used it on a day trip.  It was the perfect size.  Filled it with items I would reaallllly need.  My items were neat and organized .  Everything had a place and everything in its place.<br /><br />It was taken to school with my girl.  Now her friends want one.  It was the pockets that they liked as well as being able to put a larger item inside.  Makes lunch time more fun.<br /><br />I thinks it's wonderful and I would recommend it.  The quib-pro-quo discount for review had not bearing on what I have written."
5.0,"La comodidad para mi trabajo, libre de resbalar."
5.0,"This dress is fragile. I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to wear it yet but when I do I suspect it will be a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù. That being said, it is fabulous.  I ordered a xxl. I am 5‚Äô3, 173 lbs 38DD with the family-genetically-inherited gigantic upper arms. Surprisingly, the dress fit. I will need some kind of spandex undergarment just to smooth things out when I wear it but I have no doubt it will be a head turner.  That being said, I paid about $10 bucks for it.  If the price jumps considerably higher, I dont think this review would be the same seeing the dress is so fragile."
5.0,"Fit great, nice material."
5.0,very well constructed...sharp looking belt
5.0,Super cute! My 3 year old loves them! She calls them her half-leggings. :)
5.0,Very cute. There is a picture of Anna and Elsa on boot which isn‚Äôt my style but my daughter loved them even more because of it.
5.0,Gave to my sister for birthday and she loved it!
5.0,"Gorgeous! I am a tomboy, but have recently started wearing more femine items. This makes me feel so womanly and pretty. I get lots of comments and stares. It definition boostsy confidence. It's stretchy and flowy. I will say though if you have large breasts like me, it does make them looked crammed in it. Otherwise I recommend!"
5.0,"I am a bit busty (38DDDD) and have to watch what I buy because nothing ever fits me through the bust.<br />I've decided instead of fighting to find something that not only fits my bust, but doesn't look like a tent I have started to wear more tunic tops with leggings, since I'm considerably smaller on the bottom than the top.<br />This looks great with a pair of black leggings, and that's exactly what I wanted it for.<br />The flow of the fabric is great, and the pattern helps to hide any back fat bulges."
5.0,I received too many compliments to count when I wore them!!!
5.0,They fit well and feel nice.
5.0,"The Tournesol Waffle Knit Shirt is a very comfy shirt I am looking forward to lounging in during cooler months. While it is lightweight and comfortable, 98 degrees is just too hot for anything.<br /><br />I love the chunky texture of the waffle weave this shirt has. It is soft and feels great against my skin. I am not crazy about the pockets. When I first put the shirt on I was baffled as to what the ears were hanging off of it. Ha! Tuck them in and they're pockets. They are big enough for maybe lip gloss, a small roll of tape, some animal crackers, and keys. I don't really need pockets in my tunic because I usually have them in my pants, but whatever. Interesting touch.<br /><br />The seams on this are all neatly finished and straight. The fabric is a good weave and has no picks or holes.<br /><br />I am 6 feet slim, and purchased a small. The sleeves did shrink a hair when washed, but with some pulling after redampening the shirt I got them to an acceptable length for my long arms. The fit is slim, but not clingy.<br /><br />Overall, this is a comfy piece of clothing and a good quality for the price."
5.0,high quality socks
5.0,Looks good for the price!  Pendant bigger than expected :)
5.0,"This necklace would retail for about $50 at your typical kiosk in the mall and probably anywhere from $80-100 at your major department store in the mall, too!<br /><br />The pendant is quite heavy. This shows that it is made of a quality material. The pendant itself hands straight. It does not travel around your chest, like other cheaply and lightly made pendants usually do. This will stay more or less in place.<br /><br />The pendant itself is about the side of a penny, well a little bigger considering the upper portion that is shaped like a tear, but overall, it is roughly that size.<br /><br />The back of the pendant itself is fully enclosed. To let the light in and to add extra sparkle to it, especially when the light refracts from it, there are very small heart shaped cut outs in the rear of the pendant.  This enclosed backing that is on the pendant is absolutely essential as it really does help to prevent the special coating that is made by Swarvoski on the back of the pendant from getting scratched off.<br /><br />The chain itself is quit thin. Personally, I found the chain to get tangled quite easily. You could always slide off the pendant itself and put it onto a bigger chain. But, I like the thinner chain as it almost looks invisible when I am wearing it. I like how the pendant is so large compared to the chain, it almost looks like it is one of those floating jewelry pieces.<br /><br />It comes within a very nice and thick and sturdy box, as you can see in the photos.<br /><br />I was offered a promotional price on this piece of jewelry when I purchased this item. The agreement was that I would try it out and leave an objective, totally unbiased and honest review. These are my personal opinions and are based on my own experience and are not influenced by the promotion in any shape, way or form."
5.0,"I have owned quite a few G-Shocks over the past 15 years, and this is by far the most robust and elegant of them all. There are a few points of clarification that I would like to make, as the product description is somewhat misleading.<br /><br />1.) This piece DOES NOT have a temperature gauge, barometric pressure gauge, or compass (contrary to the somewhat vague wording used in the  description). It does have a moon phase depiction, tidal gauge, standard timer, stopwatch, alarms, &#34;world&#34; clock etc.<br />2.) This piece IS NOT made in the U.S.A. If one peeks at the reverse of the watch, they will note that it is made in Japan. This is also indicated on the reverse side of the metal buckle. Personally, I consider this to be a desirable trait when I purchase a G-Shock, as the quality and attention to detail are higher level when manufactured in Japan. This is my personal opinion, but for G-Shock connoisseurs, the differences are there, albeit subtle.<br /><br />All in all, I am VERY impressed by the build quality, heft of the watch, and attention to detail by Casio on this G-Shock. With respect to this piece's lack of &#34;atomic clock synchronization,&#34; I could care less personally. The only G-Shock I've owned with atomic clock synchronization gave up the ghost after a year and a half of light use and ample charging. These watches are fairly accurate pieces, and the number of &#34;seconds&#34; one may lose over the course of a year is negligible at best. I can think of very few applications where someone might need a piece continuously synched with the atomic clock each evening. Simply put, atomic synchronization, while &#34;neat,&#34; is a bit of a gimmick.<br /><br />With respect to wrist-size alluded to in some reviews, G-Shocks are meant to be large watches, regardless of the size of your wrist. I've always had small to average size wrists, and I enjoy the largest of the G-Shocks. Pick what you like with the features you like, and enjoy the piece!<br /><br />Summary: high quality, solid build, fantastic attention to detail, worth the money."
5.0,The power reserve complication is very useful. I did test its time keeping accuracy against an atomic clock. It stayed within 30 sec over several days. very reliable watch. Just note that this is not a small watch!
5.0,"I absolutely love these ear cuffs!  They actually look like you have several earrings going up your ear.  You sometimes have to bend them just a little (BE CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THEM!) to fit the shape of your ear.  Again, I really love them and have received lots of compliments!"
5.0,I love them. Very clear vision. No glare from the sun. Great price
5.0,I went up a size because I read that the waist could be a little tight and they fit perfect
5.0,"As expected, the Woolly Pully is warm and scratchy. It is not meant to be worn against your bare skin. A simple very thin long sleeve shirt below it and you're good to go. If you put any kind of jacket over this Woolly Pully you'll be extremely warm. This thing works. Be advised that the advertiser states that it's machine washable - do not tumble dry. But the label inside stated that it is hand wash only. Not a deal breaker. You really don't need to wash it that often if you wear a long sleeve shirt between you and the sweater. Nice product, couldn't be happier with ti."
5.0,i LOVE this wallet. exactly what i was looking for. it also fits my iphone 6s
5.0,"I really like the hat. It is lightweight and allows my head to stay cool, but covered. I need the shade, but always sweat in a ball cap and this really helps. If you work in the yard or watching sports outside in the heat, I would encourage you to get one."
5.0,It looks so cute and elegant! Better than expected! :)
5.0,"I bought the purple/blk tyedye one so far, its soft n so comfy n warm. I plan on buying several more."
5.0,Came earlier than expected and fits wonderful. Stylish and cute color. My Sister loved it!
5.0,Product condition as described.  Very satisfied customer.
5.0,"This is a great hat.  I was not sure of the colors but I actually love them both.  I hike a lot in a desert climate and I have hair to the middle of my back.  This is so perfect.  I don't have to ""stuff"" my hair into a hat, which gets very hot.  These  fit well  and look really good."
5.0,I really like these little necklaces. Bought two of them and really like the dark/worn metal style that doesn't come through in the photos. Really happy with the purchase.
5.0,"Best no show socks I‚Äôve ever had, will buy more!"

5.0,Very soft and comfortable. I should have gotten a size larger but still happy
5.0,Love the way the bra fits! It‚Äôs comfy. Especially if you just want to wear a bra to hang around the house in. The bra came with no strings though. But I don‚Äôt think I need the strings
5.0,"This is a great set for stretching. I'm at an 8ga, going for an 0. Have used these successfully for every size up so far. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I got this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I love it,but it's a tad on the large size. It is made well & of a nice,soft material,too. This shirt would be perfect with leggings...nice & comfy!"
5.0,These glasses are so cute that I had to get them! They are bigger than I expected but I can tolerate it. The glasses reminded me of Coachella. I totally recommend for people who are going to festivals like Coachella
5.0,"Perfect , exactly what I was looking for and they work great"
5.0,"These pants fit very comfortably.  The fit, the length it was all perfect.  The style is great for work.  I bought them in black and grey and the grey seems to have a different fit.  The leg opening is definitely wider than how the black ones fit.  They still look nice but have more of a wide leg slack look to it than a more fitted work pant style."
5.0,"Very nice.  Comfortable.  Somewhat large but I like sweaters that have that fit.  It did have a ‚Äúsmell‚Äù when removed from packaging, but was easily removed."
5.0,The stones on these rarrings give a glistening effect beautifully done.
5.0,Bought this scarf for mothers day for my mom. I am in love with how soft the scarf is. Certainly have to get another for myself
5.0,I bought it for my brother he loves it wears it all the time fit well plus there water proof

5.0,"I've had this light watch since 6th grade (15 years!), only had to change the strap and battery each once. I'll order this again when my current one stops."
5.0,"The Kurve Girl's Sleeveless Tank Top is an excellent choice for any active individual looking for a high-quality undershirt bra. The seamless, stretchy crop racerback design allows for full range of motion and maximum comfort during any activity. Additionally, the UV protective fabric with UPF 50+ ensures protection from harmful sun rays. The fact that it is made in the USA adds an extra layer of quality assurance. Overall, I highly recommend this tank top for anyone seeking a durable, comfortable, and protective undershirt bra."
5.0,"a little uniform, but sexy and fits well"
5.0,"Very nice, good quality, just love it"
5.0,I love it! I bought one for sleeping and one to work in surgery.  Several of my coworkers have ordered since seeing mine.  I have nothing but praise for this product...it stays on well at night and my natural hair stays hydrated throughout the day and night!
5.0,Just what I needed to stone metal gun parts!
5.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry.<br /><br />* The Swarovski Elements crystals are pretty and iridescent. It really causes my eyes to become fixated on the necklace and the &#34;ice cube&#34; jewels.<br />* The &#34;topaz&#34; color that I purchased is colored just like the picture in the listing. Very beautiful.<br />* The backing on the pendant is nickle free, and make of a brass plated gold.<br />* The silver crystals at the top of the pendant are small and complimentary to the dangle ice cubes.<br />* The necklace length is close to 16 inches, and there is about 2 inches to extend the length.<br />* The closure is a lobster claw that is easy to open.<br /><br />I think this piece would compliment casual, work casual, and semi-casual clothing. I think it looks nice with V neck tops, especially.<br /><br />I was provided this product, at no cost, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Like you, I am an amazon shopper and I rely on product reviews when making my purchases. I would never award 5 stars to an inferior product. I hope you found my review helpful."
5.0,"I wrote that it fit as expected because I knew it was going to be small. My daughter is 7 and yes it‚Äôs more like a 5T size for her- BUT it‚Äôs perfect because she is wearing leggings with it, it‚Äôs more like a long shirt. It is super cute!! Really pretty in person, good quality, delivered way earlier than expected too- she is disneybounding as Ariel so this works perfectly. We ordered the largest one we could which was the 7/8 I believe. It goes above her knee a bit."
5.0,"Love this little dress!! Cute, comfortable, easy care."
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this dress.  I received SO many compliments.  It's comfortable and it's not too short.  I have yet to wash it, hopefully the shape holds after."

5.0,"Nice and lightweight, I add this layer on chilly mornings to workout."
5.0,"We love our new Wickiwicki cantilever patio umbrella!  We've avoided our back deck in the summer because it gets so hot. We have a huge deck that would be great for entertaining, except the sun made our time there brief. Our new umbrella provides the perfect amount of shade. It was easy to put together and set up. I love that there are 5 tilt options to adjust as needed. I also love the personalized service. You go over and above, where most companies don't even bother.. Thank you Wickiwicki. I'll definitely recommend your company to others."
5.0,Great bag. Just used it on a trip from San Deigo to NY.  Perfect weight & volume forms.
5.0,Got what was describe
5.0,"I am very happy with this product. It looks really cool and accurate. I now have to decide how to finish it, it looks kinda cool black. In case you are wondering, there is a padded lining inside the helmet, it's not very thick, but it keeps the helmet snug and comfortable."
5.0,"I really loved the dress got so many compliments, the fit is really flattering, stepped in the room and all eyes were on me, i ordered a large but i really could have gotten the medium for a sexy fit at the top, chest area."
5.0,"It is ok and the graphic is a pictured, just not that impressed with the cuteness factor."
5.0,Very nice.. Glad I purchaesd
5.0,very nice it‚Äôs my safety eyeglasses
5.0,"The dress arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.  The dress fits well although a bit large in the chest area for me but nothing I couldn't handle. I am also only 5 ft. tall so my mom did take a couple inches off the bottom of the dress as it was too long.  The material was extremely comfortable and I definitley plan to buy the dress again in another color.  Its a blank canvas that can be accented in a variety of ways which makes this dress so great.  I purchased the dress to wear to the Charlie Wilson, Johnny Gill and Fantasia concert and the theme was all white."
5.0,Work great at 1/5 the price.
5.0,"I absolutely love this pretty pair of leggings!  Not only it looks good, it's also comfortable, soft AND it has POCKETS!!! I can actually put my phone in the side pocket comfortably & not even looking awkward. If you like leggings with pockets, this is it!  Go for it!!"

5.0,It is the best I ever bought!
5.0,So comfy! Perfect for summer

5.0,"bought reading glasses from optometrist; >USD$300.  broke a hinge on the frameless structure: $70 to repair and they dropped the ball: it took 2 weeks.  looked at the replacement arm and retrieved the information: ""Wisdom 200 O33 52 - 18 140"" from one arm and ""140 airlock titanium"" from the new one.  discovered the meaning of the numbers (sizes): eye=52; bridge=18; temple=140.  search produced a sweep of pricing.  figured I could throw away the cost of these and still be ahead.  They're GREAT!  Now it's likely the plastic isn't as 'incredible' as the optometrist's version.  But WTF?!  The 3 pack of 1.25 from Costco were heavy, couldn't be bent to fit nose and fell off my face.  I can't say enough positive about these.  cheers"
5.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter who is one year old.  She's not potty trained yet, but her doll is!"
5.0,My husband and I partake in martial arts and he had a fight coming up and knew we needed to purchase noise canceling headphones for our 3 month old. Those events can get pretty loud. When the item arrived I tried them on my son and he seemed to be very comfortable.<br />Once at the event I put them on him and he was totally comfortable. He even fell asleep for 2 hrs during all the screaming and loud music.<br />I'm so glad these worked. They will be used A LOT!!!
5.0,Love it big enough.

5.0,I purchased these for an art project with my 5 and 8 year old grandsons.  We are making tic tac toe sets with 12x12 canvas bags with drawstrings.  These rocks are perfect for this project and we will have extras to paint for fun.  I am very happy with my purchase that was delivered right to my door.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5.0,"I bought these pants for my daughter. First, at Tilly‚Äôs. She liked them so much, she really wanted another pair, in another color. We could not find them anywhere in another color, in a small. So, I purchased the same exact ones she had right here on Amazon,  but used some Rit dye and dyed them black for her. Yes, I‚Äôm that kind of mom. Lol<br />They‚Äôre super cute, they look just like the picture on her, and she says that they are really comfortable too."

5.0,Exactly as described. Chakras all aligned.

5.0,"I haven't worn these yet, only tried on upon arrival.  I cannot wait to wash and wear, as they are super cute and super soft!  The fit is great too and true to size.<br /><br />I got the black and white checked capris style and already put other patterns in my cart...that's how much I like them!

5.0,It's compact and keeps everything thigh. The more cards you put in the harder it is to get them out.
5.0,This  is so comfortable and cool. i will be getting more love it.
5.0,"Holds everything I need, all leather, good price and fast free shipping."
5.0,"I was so happy when I got this wallet today  The size is just right. The leather is quality, so soft and every part is double stitched.  Best part for me is how it is organizered!!  I have given up on so many wallets because the layout frustrated me.  This has the right amount of credit card slots that your cards slide out easily and don't hide too deep inside slot. Your ID card can be removed without a hassle.  The coin pocket is on the back with two slots and a easy to work zipper. No change falling all over in the main part. Love, love the color design throughout You can tell I am picky!  I have finally found the perfect wallet!!<br />T"
5.0,Es para mi bebe de 10M y le ajusta muy bien la talla de 6M a 24M<br />Lo recomiendo
5.0,These are comfortable and do no create too much of a bubble/diaper butt.
5.0,Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it. has gotten compliments on it from friends parents and others.

5.0,"Just as it looks- feels good, great quality doesn't smell like plastic.  Very great purchase."

5.0,Great price..used for wedding..material was good and thin so the boys felt comfortable and could move
5.0,Good quality. Fits as expected. My 11 year old son loves it. It‚Äôs a bit big on him but it looks fine.
5.0,"This bag looks and feels great!  Advertised as a ‚ÄúMessenger Bag For Women‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs a lot more versatile than that.  It has three different carrying options.  Like a briefcase, with nice leather style handles, a backpack or a shoulder bag.  The straps and handles also have ‚Äúhideaway‚Äù areas to store them if not using.  Nice!<br />It‚Äôs got a couple of ‚Äúmain‚Äù compartments inside the bag for a laptop, tablet or whatever.  The zippers for the pockets all seem strong, and topped with leather pulls.  Everything seems well stitched, rugged and the bag itself is made of a denim type of material that looks like it will certainly stand up to everyday travel/use.<br />I plan on using this as my ‚Äúon the go gadget bag‚Äù where I can store my video accessories and cords, power back ups, camera mounts and accessories along with two IPads that I use for video editing.  Plenty of room for my needs, and looks great at the same time!  Very nice versatile bag that I can highly recommended for both men and women!"

5.0,Fifth beer me nicely
5.0,"These are so soft right out of the packaging! They‚Äôre the perfect size to tie around your neck then use as a mask or headband. Usually bandanas are too stiff for me, but these are perfect."
5.0,Bought these for a scouts award.  Works great.
5.0,Priced right! Well packaged! Delivered as promised! Great experience!! They are beautiful too!!
5.0,"Gave this as a Christmas gift. It was opened on 12/31. It's already broken. After contacting Shangpule, their customer service was prompt and they will replace the band."
5.0,"I initially purchased the 2XL but it didn't give the results I wanted. I ordered the XL instead and I'm much happier with this one. I'm 5'3"" about 240lbs most of weight is in the shaper... It gives nice smooth shape without beeing overly restricting. Easy to get on and off throughout the day. I tuck it under my bra in front and it stays up but the back slips just a bit, definitely not a deal breaker."
5.0,This case is exactly as represented and holds my large sunglasses perfectly.  It is very pretty and the cleaning cloth and repair tool were nice bonuses.  I would recommend this product and vendor to anyone.
5.0,This copper bracelet has beautiful artwork on it and definitely doesn't feel cheap. Great price for a real cool copper bracelet. I'm a happy customer. It's much nicer than another bracelet I bought for the same price.
5.0,I didn't think socks this thin could be so warm. I'll probably be getting more.
5.0,. Looks great. Easy  to install. Love  it.

5.0,Lo compre para un regalo q hice y a la persona le encanto y no dudo en usarlo al momento !!! Material delicado y duradero !!! Gracias üòä
5.0,Bought this for my Mom for Christmas because she was having issues with seeing the time on clocks and on her current watch.  She loved this one because she could see numbers and what time it was.
5.0,"This is a very stylish and roomy backpack--I wasn't expecting it to fit a much as it could! I use this for day trips, but I can imagine it being used as a purse to run errands with. It has a nice pocket on the back to fit an iPhone 6/7/8 or its equivalent. I will definitely update on the wear-and-tear of this, but so far, it looks like it's a durable fabric."
5.0,"I have been looking for the perfect bracelet to wear at a certain time, and this fits the bill.<br /><br />It is very well made and very comfortable.<br /><br />The snaps look like they will hold up, which is important."
5.0,I love these! I live in them!

5.0,I'm in love with these jeans. There is a zipper at the bottom of each leg and I wasn't expecting that. But they are slimming and look great.
5.0,I love my ring it doesnt leave green marks.
5.0,"Love this headband for my hot yoga class!  I have long bangs and this keeps them all out of my face.  It's super wide (like the Lululemon bang buster) so you can pull it up over your forehead and onto the top of your head like a hat to keep all those flyaways in check.  Some other thinner headbands ride up after awhile, causing your hair to spill out or an annoying stray strand of hair to go into your face.  Not this one!  Everything stayed perfectly in place.<br /><br />This has one skinny side and a wide side, so you can choose how you want to wear it.  For hot yoga I wear it with the wide side in the front on my forehead, but for just hanging out around town you can use the skinny side to look more fashionable.  There is also a little gold metal button on the wide side for decoration.  Very cute.<br /><br />The material is super soft and stretchy, like your favorite t-shirt.  I was worried it wouldn't absorb much sweat or would get gross like a wet t-shirt, but it actually held up really well.  I didn't notice it being very wet at all, even after my super sweaty hot yoga class.  Not sure where the sweat went, but it kept the sweat off my face and wasn't dripping afterwards.  Planning to buy several more in other colors!"
5.0,Fits my husband perfectly and a nice color too.
5.0,"Amazing for the money, I would pay a lot more. A little stiff but will be great in water. Love the easy slip for putting on and off."
5.0,"I've been a chronic oversleeper for most of my life, so much so that my family and friends always try to prank me when I'm sleeping. No matter how loud I set the alarm, the only person it wakes up is my wife.<br /><br />I can say with 100% honesty, the Shock Clock 2 is the only that has been able to wake me up in the mornings reliably. I use the jumping jack feature to get me out of bed, and my brain has been trained to be awake before the alarm thanks to the zap.<br /><br />Since I began wearing it to sleep, I haven't overslept once. Not only that it's designed to help wake you up in your lightest stage of sleep which helps with my energy levels in the morning.<br /><br />I was also super pleased with Pavlok customer support, after a few weeks of using the Shock Clock 2, I noticed my battery life was decreasing. I reached out to their team and they helped me do a hard reset which solved the battery issue."
5.0,"I am very happy with my purchase.  These earrings are simply beautiful.  The color is so vibrant, rich and a great shade of blue.  They may look small, but no - they are a perfect size.  I love them and thank the designers for such a wonderful pair of earrings!"
5.0,Has turned into one of my favorite cross bodies I own. Perfect size and like the fact that I won‚Äôt have to worry about my bag while being in crowded places. Very cute bag.
5.0,My son loves the hat!
5.0,Love this top!  So comfortable and I always get tons of compliments.
5.0,VERY NICE QUALITY !!!  GOOD FIT !!  ORDERED 2 MORE PAIR AFTER BEING SO HAPPY WITH THE FIRST PAIR AND GAVE ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT !!!
5.0,Great color for fall.
5.0,"I bought these earrings for myself and love them.  The ear cuff is 1 inch long.  The dangles are 1/2 inch long.  It has one post, so the top of the cuff doesn't hug the ear -- it sticks out a bit.  They are exactly as the picture shows."
5.0,"I bought this skirt to play golf in. Great fit, long enough to be comfortable and not be self-conscious."
5.0,So comfortable to work out in!
5.0,Excellent quality handbags. I have several and am never disappointed.
5.0,"Exactly as shown! Came on time and it looks amazing! Had a little trouble purchasing at first but I think that might've been on my side, nevertheless I received two free little card pictures because of the small problem!"
5.0,I'm 5'8 170lbs got a large<br />Typically I'm a 10/12. Wrinkle proof. Easy to wash. Very comfortable. I have multiple colors of these!!
5.0,i like that the size is on the bottom it will make it soo much easier to wash and put away
5.0,"I‚Äôm also a firefighter and I know the importance of these hoses, it saves a lot of lives and properties, so having one in my pocket reminds me how noble and selfless act this job is. Great quality and innovation."
5.0,"This is a very beautiful ring, good quality... I would recommend this ring to all my friend's and family..  Love it.."
5.0,"I purchased this badge, along with several others, to creat a Western Lawmen Shadow Box for my husbands collection.  It looks great and has a nice weight to it.  It's perfect for what I've used it for.  I'll be purchasing more from this seller as birthdays and other holidays roll around.  It's a great gift for his ""Man Cave""."
5.0,This is an excellent product !!
5.0,"Perfect for teaching. Neckline isn‚Äôt too low, material is comfortable, and it has pockets. Probably gonna order more."
5.0,Always like Miss Elaine clothy
5.0,Don't come whit a number.
5.0,"LOVED this cosplay! I got a Small in this and it fit great! My measurements are 33-28-36. I walked around an entire con in it and didn‚Äôt have a single issue!<br /><br />I did make a couple changes to the cosplay. I sewed to of the gold armbands a smaller, so they would fit my wrist instead. I also used a white belt I already owned because the one it came with was way too big. I bought the red leg pieces separately. I also made his headband.<br /><br />I recommend wearing some sort of pasties when wearing this cosplay because it would very easily cause a slip."
5.0,What a cute fun and flirty summer dress! Great cut and length. Loved it as soon as I put it on.
5.0,Great product makes it easy to get on shoes and boots either standing or sitting. Good for high top boots.
5.0,"I have had and been using my wallet for two days now.  I am in love.  There are pockets for everything including a hidden pocket in the back.  I can carry everything I need including my iPhone in this.  Shipping was very quick as I had it within two days.  As many other reviews have said, keep in mind the colors on the screen are a lot darker than the real thing.  This looks like a sage green on here and is closer to a spring green or honeydew color in real life.  Still beautiful. So glad I purchased it."
5.0,My wife  love it
5.0,Dress fits wonderful! I bought it as a maternity dress but it will fit after too. It also has pockets and is light weight material so I don‚Äôt sweat.
5.0,"They looked just like they do in the picture, and they came with a gift of pink heart earrings. Of course, I'm not gonna wear them, but it was a nice gesture. Definitely going to keep purchasing from these guys."
5.0,Fantastic size also well made.
5.0,My daughter purchased this for me as a gift and it is well printed on a solid piece. The hooks that comes with it seems durable. I can see this lasting a long time.
5.0,Overall very good item
5.0,"cute ring, can be used a stack ring."
5.0,The perfect wallet. Fits everything I need and I love that it is made from hemp!
5.0,"The Aircee Assault  Compact Backpack arrived very quickly from the seller in simple packaging.<br /><br />The package contained a single one-piece 32L backpack.  I purchased the khaki version of this pack, which is more of a coyote color; however, I rather the coyote anyway rather than the khaki color.  The pack is made primarily out of a nylon material that is pretty thick...much like a lightweight canvas.<br /><br />I have had numerous packs in the past and I have to say I am very pleased and impressed with the quality of this pack.  It is very difficult for me to find a pack that will hold up to my uses as well as one that has all of the features I like.  This pack does not have ALL of the features I want, but it is definitely close.<br /><br />Let's start with the straps.  The straps on this pack are made of a very stiff material and not particularly padded, but are long enough for someone of my size to be able to wear it comfortably.  I have another pack that is difficult to wear on my back since the straps are so short.  There is a little padding on the backside of the pack to make it a little more comfortable and to add a little breathability.  There are also a couple of plastic D-rings affixed to the straps.  I would like to see a couple of tack stitches on the straps to accommodate carabiners if I so choose.  I typically have one or two carabiners attached to the straps at about chest level to catch items such as keys and such.<br /><br />There are two mesh pockets on the sides of the pack that have straps that can be tightened over them for items such as water bottles.  I have a 40oz insulated water bottle that fits well in these mesh pockets with the strap secured to keep it in place.  On those mesh pockets, there is also a zipper and the mesh itself is actually a pocket too.<br /><br />Also on the sides of the pack are two additional pouches large enough to accommodate a cell phone or GPS or other similar-sized items.  One of the pockets is secured via velcro and the other is a zippered pocket with a velcro patch on it to accommodate morale patches.<br /><br />The top of the pack has your standard handle for carrying and two velcro-secured holes that allow you to thread a camel pack mouthpiece through or headphones through.<br /><br />The main compartment of the pack is very large and zippered with dual zippers, which means you can just open it part of the way from the top, rather than having to unzip it fully from one side.  Inside the main compartment is very roomy and there is a padded divider with a velcro-secured strap to accommodate items such as a laptop.<br /><br />On the back of the pack are two more pockets, both of which being approximately 8 inches deep or so...didn't actually take a ruler to them.  The top pouch is also dual zippered and has another velcro patch to accommodate your own patches.  It came with an AIRCEE patch that was a nice touch, but ended up in the garbage.  There are also a couple of elastic bands with clips on them that I still have yet to figure out the purpose of, but is a nice touch.<br /><br />The second pouch has a unique design to it.  There are zippers on either side of the second pouch that allow you to access the pouch contents from either side alone.  The top of the pouch is also secured via velcro, which means you can also access the top of the pouch via the velcro access, or you can open the velcro access and zippered sides to completely open the pouch.<br /><br />There is also 4 rows of molle webbing on the second lower pouch that will accommodate any molle gear you may have.  That leads me to the only complaint I have with this pack.  I have several molle attachments that I would like to have the option to affix to this pack.  The main one that I will not be able to use with this pack is a molle water pouch that holds my 40ml insulated water bottle.  I have another pack that it is currently attached to that has molle webbing on the sides of the pack that accommodate this pouch perfectly.  If I were to design this pack, I would probably lose one of the side pouches and replace it with molle webbing to hold other molle gear.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a well-made pack that has solid stitching.  I will have to see how well it holds up to my abuse and will update my post if I encounter any issues.  Bottom line...I am impressed overall with this pack.<br /><br />(will add pictures later)"
5.0,Beautiful necklace and the girl I gave to loved it!
5.0,"My wife was planning a mermaid birthday party for our daughter. She told me and my daughter to pick out the birthday outfit online. This is the dress we ended up picking. It felt like a big responsibility but it was a good idea to let my daughter help me. A lot of times my wife will buy costumes for the kids but they won‚Äôt want to wear them because they are uncomfortable. Since my daughter got to help to choose this dress, I think she was more invested in the experience. Her favorite color is purple and green just makes sense for a mermaid tail.  The dress is soft cotton inside and out. The mermaid scales are not rough or itchy. They don‚Äôt actually touch her skin though because they have an inside liner. This dress is clearly designed for the little mermaid but it‚Äôs subtle enough that she can wear it again without it being a dress-up event. The mermaid scales are very shiny. It ran true to size and it has a little bit of a flare around the skirt part of the dress. Everyone was impressed with her choice in this birthday outfit."
5.0,"I get a complement every time I wear it.  However, it makes my glasses keep falling off."
5.0,I love these shorts! they fit well and are comfortable.
5.0,wife loved it but a little small in the bust
5.0,This is the perfect bag for a night out which is exactly what I wanted it for. I'm able to move around without worrying about bumping into people. Obviously it won't fit everything a normal sized purse would so you WILL have to prioritize. Bought mine in grey and color is as advertised.
5.0,"Great dress, makes imperfect bodies look good."
5.0,Love this overall. Fit perfect! So cute on too.
5.0,"Just like his dad's vest, affordable and sized right."
5.0,This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous. Takes forever to arrive but when it does well worth the wait. It looks like it could have coat a pretty penny.
5.0,Great little watch. Very comfortable. Cheap.
5.0,Really cute and good quality. Bought it for my kiddo that is obsessed with Five Nights at Freddy's and it's now her favorite book bag charm.
5.0,So cute on my friends puppy. Well made and price was right!
5.0,I bought a two piece dress jacket for a wedding The jacket was like old fashioned fabric. I ordered this instead. A good match.
5.0,Love this shirt! Soft and comfortable and the color is as described. Highly reccomend!
5.0,"I bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday, she loves Bokugo and she wore it for ComCon (our towns version). She looked awesome. It is way nicer looking than the pictures give credit for. The fit was perfect! I am really happy, that this outfit made her so happy! This does run true to size, if you order it you will be amazed!!!!"
5.0,It's simple.<br />It gives me the time. That's all I want.
5.0,"Got so many compliments when I wore one of these necklaces, I bought three more...two to gives as gifts."
5.0,Bought as a gift and she loves the pants.
5.0,I bought these for my Grandson and HE LOVES THEM!
5.0,"I bought the whole Iced Out Cross Collection. The Necklace, Ring, Bracelet, and of course the Earrings! The Earrings are a perfect length, and they give the Necklace a great look without being over bearing! The whole set looks beautiful and I'm recommending that anyone try it out!!"
5.0,Love the fabrication of the scarf and the brilliant died fibers of the wool. This is a must accessory to<br />any jacket or coat. Proud to wear the Malcolm Tartan Plaid.
5.0,I purchased this for a friend for her birthday and she LOVED it.  The card was perfect!  The necklace was very attractive and prettier than the photo.
5.0,"I wanted to jump on the &#34;mint&#34; bandwagon for spring, but didn't want to spend a lot on pants that would go &#34;out of style&#34; soon. So I got this scarf. Great price, decent quality. Soft material. It's not quite the mint that's trendy, but it does say mint BLUE in the description, so it's okay. It looks good and is very light and airy (great for spring)!"
5.0,"Sized small, but super cute. Just order a size larger than you would expect."
5.0,Cute dress.  Love the pockets.
5.0,Nice fit and great lenses.
5.0,"Not thick, but for me it didn't seem they needed to be, and the ""thinness"" of the material makes breathing more possible. I find these more comfortable than a mask for Covid, and used them to keep me warm for a trip in northern temps from 12-24 degrees F."
5.0,"These are the best,"
5.0,This is a great top. Very slimming. Light weight but not flimsy. I wore it with capri jeans it looked great. I've already ordered it in gray.
5.0,Great addition to the Leg Avenue bat costume.
5.0,Really like how this purse fits
5.0,"I have enjoyed using these glasses. Not only are they fun and stylish, they actually protect my eyes from the sun. There are a lot of different styles to choose from but I found the orange and gold to be hot. The glasses are very light in weight and they are somewhat flexible. The Aviator style glasses are very popular and have been for a couple of years now. If you were looking for a heavy and sturdy pair of aviator glasses then this is not the set for you. However, if you are looking for protection or if you are wanting to look chic then this is the way to go. I love them and they are simple to use. There is no hefty price to go with it. You can spend a ton of money on glasses and not be happy. So why not get a pair and love what you buy? The glasses have rubber pieces on the ends to help keep your ears from being rubbed raw. The glasses do have the nose pieces so they fit comfortablely  on your face. I must admit that I also love the fact that they came with their own carrying case and cleaning cloth. The only con to this pair is that they could be a bit more sturdier.<br /><br />I did receive this item at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. That is exactly what I have provided. All of the statements are true and my own and I am in no way affiliated with the seller. My review is based upon my actual use of the product."
5.0,"Just what I wanted,  Thanks"
5.0,"I bought this engagement ring for my girlfriend ... after receiving the ring, it was obvious that there was no way she could say no.  We ended up with just under a carat with a hefty 18K gold band for under $1500.  It looks, feels, and is excellent.  I would recommend Amazon's build an engagement ring service to anyone."
5.0,"I found the other two reviews curious and, in my case, quite inaccurate. I bought these because they were marked way down in comparison to a similar pair sold by Woman Within. I couldn't have been happier. These turned out to fit me better than the Woman Within pants.<br /><br />Ladies know that different styles, even though they're the same 'size' can really fit differently (never mind differences in sizing between brands - it's a reason why if I find a good fit, I'll often return to buy in other colors or even just another pair). So I expected them to fit - I've been a 16 decades - but they fit better than expected. No gaping at the waist, but not hold your breath and squeeze cutting into the waist either. For my body type (apple) the pants are great.<br /><br />The brown sugar color is also nicer than it looks on my monitor and the corduroy is a medium weight. They didn't stretch into another size over the day's wear either.<br /><br />Now if only the other color wasn't pumpkin orange. I can't quite persuade myself I'd wear them except in a laundry emergency. The brown sugar pair I have are rapidly becoming favorites."
5.0,For the price wasn't bad. It's good for 3-12 yr Olds. Amall heads. The septor has a foam tip. Plastic handle.
5.0,"My awesome shirt came quick!! It took me forever to pick out which shirt I wanted. No worries because I‚Äôll be ordering many more in different colors. FL is always hot! So yes, to no sleeves! This shirt fits perfectly and is very soft.  True to size.  I ordered a medium. Even when I washed it the size didn‚Äôt change. I do wash using delicate cycle for all my clothes. Not sure if that matters. Thank you! ( ;"
5.0,Muy fina y elegante
5.0,Fantastic  look
5.0,Sold this to a client for a Mother of the Groom Dress . Quality was amazing and she looked beautiful and received the compliments to<br />Prove it!!!!!!
5.0,This is a lovely lightweight summer robe. The colors and print definitely lift my mood after a bath. I would love to have a floor length version.

5.0,Really cute and looks great on my 10 yo granddaughter. she really likes it. washes well.
5.0,Omg I just LOVE them...I bought 3 as gifts! Exceeded my expectations!
5.0,I've worn this everyday for months. I keep my cell phone in it. It is attractive and well made. I have a large waist- size 18 ladies and it fits.
5.0,Ideal for oversized hat. Only criticism is length of time it takes to deliver product
5.0,These sunglasses very similar to Blublocker sunglasses but without the guarantee.
5.0,Nice quality .
5.0,My favorite enso ring.
5.0,It holds every last card I have without me having to double card some slots. With the added phone and change it wasn't difficult to close like my other ones are. I like the space for the pen. For some reason I've needed a pen lately..
5.0,"for six dollars you get a quality feel pair of glasses, a nice zip close glasses case and a cleaning cloth. Very pleased!"
5.0,Love these skorts!  Not only are they comfortable; they are super cute. I am definitely ordering a second pair.
5.0,"This review is for FIBO STEEL Titanium Magnetic Bracelets for Men Women Health Energy link Bracelet Pain Fatigue Relif 12MM<br />I received my FIBO STEEL Titanium Magnetic Bracelets just recently. I have to say the quality on this bracelet far exceeds my expectations of what I thought I would be receiving. The picture on the website truly doesn't do this bracelet justice. When I received the package I was so surprised as I didn't realize this company also sends a free link removal tool with the product in the event it is too large. The bracelet is extremely well made and no issues with any of the magnets throughout the bracelet, with this design I would have thought the bracelet would be heavier as well but it is very light and fits amazingly well. I removed two links from the bracelet and this company made the process so easy. The link removal tool they send to you is easy to use and gets the job done quickly. The tool itself is well made and makes the job easier since you don't have to fight with it. I would recommend keeping the link in the event you need it later. This is a nice bracelet that you can wear with casual clothes or business clothing<br />Please note that I was provided this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and fair review."
5.0,This jewlry was perfect for my granddaughters 1st Boho Birthday!  I love it!

5.0,Es hermoso y perfecto.
5.0,Made for a bustier woman But I  love
5.0,Not cold season yet but confident will keep us warm and dry.
5.0,"This review is on first impression/has not been washed. I just started noticing the sizing chart links on item descriptions. 5'7, 157 lbs ordered medium which is actually a size 4 but actually fits very nice. One reviewer said they have washed/hang dried so I think I will keep. And like another mentioned, does have weird smell."
5.0,Fits good. Feels good.  Looks good.  What more could you ask for?
5.0,"Love it! I have the iphone8 it fits perfect. My license, money and credit cards fit perfect and the material is so nice! Totally a great purchasw"
5.0,These are as close to OEM laces as you can get.  Perfect fit and perfect thickness.
5.0,Really cool shirt my boyfriend loves it!
5.0,Lo reomiendo
5.0,Great price. Works great.
5.0,"I bought two of these as Christmas gifts and liked them so much I bought a set for myself. Comfortable, good quality and works well as loungewear."
5.0,I like that the look of a bracelet and able to maintain my keys in my hand
5.0,"The color of the hat is very beautiful and suitable for summer. The shield on my hat is a good barrier between me and others. It's so stuffy when I wear it every day that I find it hard to breathe. But the barrier worked just fine, and I was able to take it off occasionally and breathe normally.<br />I hope the seller can add an adjustable bag to hold the hat easily."
5.0,"This watch is exactly what you would expect. Simple, rugged, and attractive. Great daily watch."
5.0,Love them! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,The fabric is very comfortable and stretchy. Fits great. I loved wearing it this morning for my workout.
5.0,Love this.  I got my husband‚Äôs initial.  It‚Äôs really cute
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  Is exactly as pictured.  Service was prompt.  I couldn't be happier.
5.0,Love this belt. Just enough give. Only downside is the keeper loop went soft and frayed out within a few weeks of use. No big deal pants have belt loops for that too.
5.0,"Love the colors , comfortable and able to large faces ‚Ä¶(  men ) . Perfect for women, easy to wash and reuse . Colors do not fade either .<br />I have bought 3-4 already"
5.0,Got this for a Christmas present for my mom and she loved it. She loves 1928 jewelry and every piece they sent in this mystery set was a winner.
5.0,so happy with this bag.  Another customer did not like the opposite side of the shoulder strap but I believe it keeps it from sliding off the shoulder.  The zip pockets are a great size and the zippers open and close easily.
5.0,"Color: Purple<br />My little niece likes this scarf very much, it is very beautiful and warm, she likes to wear this scarf for outdoor sports"
5.0,I love them! Just ordered more. Thanks
5.0,"Nice design, fits very well."
5.0,"The gloves are perfect, touch screen works great! I would highly recommend."
5.0,Wear these for ministry on Sunday mornings . On my feet a lot and they don‚Äôt hurt my feet. Thank you Thursday Boot Co.
5.0,Nice.<br />As expected
5.0,Not being a complete fan of face mass this style serves the purpose and does allow you to breathe while wearing them. Filters included or a bonus. And I got a big head no pun intended and I still have a little stretch room.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, but when I received the bracelet I was suprised at how nice it was. It was a heavier, not cheap, bracelet. Gave this to my nephew to give to his nana, who likes expensive jewelry, and she loved it!"
5.0,"This is exactly what my grandsons needed for swimteam in an outside pool at 4,500 feet through winter. Plus they are super cute. So glad I found these."
5.0,Very nice set. Lots of different bracelets
5.0,Lightweight and looks great on!
5.0,"These socks are very soft and warm, and quite stretchy. I'm 5'5&#34; and curvy, and they come up onto my thighs and stay up okay without rolling. I wear them with a garter belt, though, which they're not too thick for. I liked them enough that I ordered more pairs!"
5.0,This purse charm is beautiful all the way around.  It is larger than it appears to be in the picture.  I am pleased with the size and the quality.
5.0,Love this and have only worn a few times due to the heaviness of this piece.
5.0,Love the graphics. Love the color. Love the fit.<br /><br />I normally wear an XL but I ordered a XXL of this shirt and it fits like an X-Large so I‚Äôd recommend ordering a size up if you want it to fit properly.<br /><br />Since it‚Äôs made mostly of cotton it will shrink in a warm/hot dryer. I just wash it in cold and tumble dry for a bit then air dry and it‚Äôs kept it‚Äôs size and color well this way.
5.0,"Great quality, and super comfy fit!  Would recommend to anyone"
5.0,I like the high waist briefs. Not only are pretty and comfortable; The briefs also provide much needed support to my abdominal area. I will order more briefs/panties from this company. My experience with Barbra Collection (Best of Beauty) has been exceptional. I am a very satisfied customer. Thank You!!
5.0,The coat looks great. Just like the image. The hood sometimes makes it a challenge to put on quickly but overall I am extremely happy with my purchase. I got it a size bigger to be a little baggy but it ended up fitting so it worked out.
5.0,Very comfortable and attractive shoes. I am truly satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,"Appears to be decent quality, the strap is a soft, sturdy woven nylon. The bag itself is a decent size for essentials (picture included for size reference)."
5.0,"Love this dress. Dressed it up with a satin blazer for a wedding, and dressed down with a denim jacket for running errands. Size 12, DD - ordered XL."
5.0,"True &#34;BlueBlocker&#34; lenses, but I wish you had the smaller size."
5.0,Fits my wrist well and the face I can read. Love it
5.0,"I have used to other suspender systems over the years in my law enforcement and security career. These are absolutely the best. They do not creep, they do not stretch on their own, they do not need constant adjustment or replacement or re figuring the shoulder support pads. Once you set these things, you can forget them. They are very comfortable and are great for load-bearing all the crap I carry on my duty belt. Do not let the low price fool you, these are the best."
5.0,"I love Cyanstyle tank tops!  They are well made and comfortable....and they come in so many colors!  I mainly use them for workouts, but they're great summer tops too."
5.0,Super cute! Love the fabric. Pattern is a little different than shown - still cute!
5.0,"Love, love, love. So soft, large size, I was extremely happy with this buy."
5.0,"These are SO feminine and lovely.  It is so difficult to find this type of house shoe, the selection is limited.  However, these fit like a glove and are so pretty and feminine I will buy another pair.  Thank you for the fantastic service, beautiful shoes and incredibly reasonable price! I paid nearly double the price for something similar but was thankful to buy it as this style is so rare. Kaye"
5.0,"GREAT SUIT FOR THE MONEY, WILL BE PURCHASING MORE IN OTHER COLORS"
5.0,"Easy to clean..fits comfortable, and soft in texture."
5.0,This dress washes and wears very well. Nice sturdy yet soft material. No shrinkage. Good fit. Order true to size.
5.0,Really cute! The texture of the faux leather is buttery soft. Good quality. Perfect size bag for a night out!
5.0,THESE BRACELETS WERE EVERYTHING I WAS LOOKING FOR
5.0,I love everything about this dress. It fits well and is nice material.
5.0,These pants are comfortable and appear to be good quality at a good price.
5.0,Love them.  Wear them all he time under dresses.  Not made for compression
5.0,"Very cute, nice material and got a lot of attention at my Christmas party."
5.0,The band fits my boyfriend very well. He likes the watch band connection a bit better though because as he‚Äôs working it doesn‚Äôt come off as easy.
5.0,"I love this top. I am typically a size small (5'2.5"", 116 lb.), it is one size fits all, which I can see making sense. I love the cut and how instead of hanging loose and baggy at the bottom, that it comes back in to hug my hip area, but is flatteringly loose elsewhere."
5.0,The most comfortable. Order a half size larger than usual. I can walk in them all day.
5.0,Cute but fit to large on my son
5.0,Need Other Colors
5.0,Es super bello de buena calidad y el precio perfecto.
5.0,"These are truly wide width. They fit well and look really cute.<br /><br />I don't think they will hold up for heavy wear, but for occasional wear they're fine. I would buy them again."
5.0,"I love this hat, it's thick and fits like the picture. It's warm and one of the best hats I own. I say buy it you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Perfect fit! Beautiful colors!

5.0,"I am 6'1&#34;, 200Lbs, fit, and normally wear a Large shirt. The sizing chart was spot on and the Asian sized 3XL is a match for American Large.<br /><br />The material is soft and feels durable. For the price, this is an excellent step up from a t-shirt for casual wear."
5.0,Interesting tie
5.0,"Great fit, fabric forgiving for all body types. Love the hidden pockets. I am 5'4&#34; dress touches ground. It's a very beautiful dress"
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a twelve-year-old who has discovered Egyptology, and it was the perfect gift.  Fine quality and tricky cute catch make this something that will last awhile."
5.0,These are great low cut socks for boots or athletic shoes. They don't slip AT ALL...which is amazing. They are also thicker than many low-cuts and and provide a great cushion. Highly recommend. Wish they offered in a lower cut for loafers.
5.0,"I‚Äôve been dealing with Plantar Fasciitis for a few months now, and it was continuing to worsen. I ordered these slippers, stopped wearing only socks in my home, and within a few days, I was getting relief. These Orthofeet slippers have GREATLY helped me with the pain, especially in the morning. Looking forward to getting back to running again and these slippers are an important part of getting back to normal."

5.0,"This is one of the best wallets I have ever owned. It's attractive and accommodates quite a lot. In fact, it holds the stuff that I had in a bulkier wallet. It is also strong. I've been carrying it for several months and it looks as good as it did on the first day I put it in my purse. I like it so much that I just bought a second one so that when the original one wears out, I'll have another one ready to pick up and go."
5.0,Not the same shape as the picture

5.0,This bracelet is better than I expected.  I love the multi-colored amber - the colors work so well together and I know I'll wear this a lot this fall.  I wear a 7-1/4 inch bracelet (or average) and the fit is perfect.  Received my order before I expected and am very happy with my purchase
5.0,"I'm a US 16w and I can fit the extra large. The top was difficult to zip as most of my weight is in my arms, chest and back but it fit fine and looks great. If you are pear shape it's true to size but if you are too heavy be careful ordering your exact size. Someone in a 12 said the XL fit them too so it also depends on how loose you want the top. My top is fitted but not too tight."
5.0,nice quality<br />fits perfect<br />awesome price!<br />long shipping but worth it!
5.0,Exactly what I was expecting.  Good quality.  Definitely recommend.

5.0,"good quality material gives the dress a ""slinky"" feel. fit is flattering. 5'3. 135. Medium fit perfectly"
5.0,"These little watches are great. I'm not a fan of wearing a watch on my wrist, so these work perfectly for me. I usually clip them right on my uniform (there is a safety pin in the back). The watch portion easily comes out of the rubber portion for easy cleaning."

5.0,"L-O-V-E, LOVE, love this top. Have received many compliments. Went back to order more .... wha, wha, wha ... only one i could find. :("
5.0,"This is a cheap product however it is quite durable and acts as the perfect watch for me, a mechanic. I get my hands dirty all day and I do not worry about ruining my watch when washing them! the watch is also very durable! It has been slammed into many things and hard things at that while at work, yet it still functions the same as day 1 out of the box! It is very accurate with time, does have a built in light with the press of a button however it is a very dim light and would be difficult to see if someone has poor vision. I would recommend this watch mostly due to the price of the product.<br />All in all, for $10.00, it is a great buy and &#34;if&#34; mine breaks; I would not hesitate to buy another one of these! Thanks for the great product!<br /><br /> *For the record: Casio did not pay me to write this, nor was this given to me for free.*"
5.0,"Great fit, good cover and it‚Äôs plus without the wiring perfect for my workouts"
5.0,Costume runs small. Order a size bigger or two depending how loose you want it.
5.0,Wish they had more in black
5.0,I honestly feel that this is the best baby item I received. My daughter has worn a pair of these since she was a preemie in the NICU and continues today 8 months. We have never lost a sock.

5.0,"I love my wall decal!!! I won't lie, at first i got a bit frustrated taking the vinyl off of the paper but i blame it on me having these crazy long nails. The install was so easy!! I'm not sure what adhesive is used for these but by far the best!! My words aren't peeling or falling off or anything. Definitely checking to see what other word decals you guys have available for me to purchase! :)"
5.0,These socks are real nice.  They fit well and are comfortable.  They are well made And stay up like a good sock should.  The Jean design patterns is very unique and is very well done.  My wife likes these for lounging around the house or for wearing to bed on these cold fall evening.  These don't shrinkage shrink in the wash or dryer.  Should hold up for a good long time.
5.0,"Great sweatshirt but it runs a little small. Order next size up.Doesn,t have a hood that ties."
5.0,"Bought these for my toddler. They are true to size. Easy to get on, they look good on, have held up, and she gets around comfortably in them. For the price and quality, I will be buying them again when she grows out of this pair."

5.0,Great Tank Top!  Great quality and very comfortable.
5.0,Such fun masks. Great price for the amount of product you get:
5.0,My daughter has been wearing cat ears for 5 years now! She's picky and I mean that.  These arrived last night and she's wearing them to school today- she loves them.  They said navy blue on the description which we were looking forward to but they are black.  Very cute.
5.0,"Perfect fit for a wide foot. The boot is not completely flat and does create a slight incline, resulting in a forward slide. Simply insert a slice of 'sole insert' in toe box. üëåüèæüåü"
5.0,"I had one these jackets for a few years and I loved it!  It was warm and comfortable and it wore very well.  One day, my wife's dog got upset with me and decided he was going to eat the zipper. I was pretty upset, thought about taking the jacket to a seamstress to replace the zipper, but decided that the cost would probably be comparable to just getting a new jacket, so that's the route I took.  The new jacket was just as comfortable and warm as the last one.  I'm not sure if how it is going to wear because, you guessed it, my wife's dog got upset with me again...  I tried to return it, but then my wife got upset with me because she really loves her dog!  Great jacket, definitely worth the low cost, just remember to hang it in a closet and don't piss off your dog (or your wife)"
5.0,Perfect for my three year old daughter! The stickers stay on really well‚Äîas long as it‚Äôs not being constantly taken off. The designs are really cute!

5.0,[[VIDEOID:2e2d7bc50ff5f09262673e1ae2739708]] I absolutely love these bands! I‚Äôve had my Apple Watch for a while now and wear it pretty religiously. I have broken countless flaps that keep the band down after the metal prong goes through the whole and it‚Äôs really annoying. These are great because the flap gets tucked under rather than put through the skinny flap. Makes it unbreakable for someone like me. The colors are also a plus!
5.0,This item I love very much the texture is great.

5.0,This bag is lovely.  I am very picky about the purses I carry and this one fits the bill.  It has sufficient storage pockets inside and is very handy with the extra handle.  The bag itself is very well made and will hold up for a long time.  Great purchase!

I'm actually more organized since I got rid other things I didn't need from my old wallet. The quality and practical function is all there which is most important. You see and feel where your $90 is going. Great buy!
5.0,"I love this shirt! First of all, I love that only Office fans will ‚Äúget it.‚Äù It‚Äôs also great quality... not too thin, and it‚Äôs soft. I‚Äôve worn and washed it about 5 times already and it‚Äôs held up well. It‚Äôs a nice, rich color as well, and TTS."

5.0,"I reicved everything quickly & it was just as described by the seller. This is a really good deal for all that you get. Overall, happy & I would recommend."
5.0,I bought one of these in South Korea when I lived there and loved it. I came home and all my friends loved it so I bought one for one of my friends and she loved it. I was so glad there were tons of colours to choose from which was great and I really like it. She was happy and so was I.
5.0,"After wearing this belt for a few days I'm very happy with it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size smaller than I thought I needed and it fits just right.  This belt might be overkill for casual use especially if you fasten and unfasten your belt frequently as it takes a few seconds longer than a standard belt due to the buckle and velcro configuration.  I expected this so I'm sticking with a 5 star rating as the belt is exactly what I thought I was ordering and was represented to me accurately.<br /><br />This is a well constructed, sturdy belt.  I haven't had a problem with this belt not fitting through the loops of my clothes, even on light shorts but it could be an issue with small loops.  The buckle is solid, has no sharp corners and feels like it could last a lifetime.  In addition, the buckle is designed in such a way as to allow for a rope or carabiner to be attached. I don't know if this is intentional and I'm sure it's not an approved use but if you needed to raise or lower a load and had no other options it would be a good last resort.  The nylon webbing of this belt is strong and high-quality. I'm confident that in a pinch this belt would support my body weight.  After fastening the buckle the tail of the belt is secured to the tight portion of the belt with velcro type hook and loop fasteners.  This helps the belt stay tight and prevents a loose tail from flapping around.  I have not tried this belt in CCW applications but my impression is that it will work very well."
5.0,Excelente cartera
5.0,The right size and shape for what I need to do with it.
5.0,So soft and wears very nice.
5.0,"I cant say anything special about the MASK. It's like any other disposable mask I've used a bit softer. With regards to its effectiveness against COVID-19...well, like any other disposable mask it definitely minimizes droplets reaching your respiratory tract. The one complaint I had...it came in resealable plastic that anyone could open and press back together. It did NOT come in a sealed BOX. Product seems ok though. CUSTOMER SERVICE is AWESOME!"

5.0,"i like it. it's what i wear around the house after a shower until bed. it is not a towel, it's light weight and comfortable. bonus for the pocket i use it all the time!"
5.0,For the price it works just fine. The inside lining could peel out  over time but that is hardly a reason not to use it. This case is big too.
5.0,Just beautiful!. Have been on the look out for something like this for a long time. Ordered 2 packs of 2 each. One for driving and TV and the other for reading. Could not be happier with my purchases. I am all set and have had plenty of compliments. So very stylish.
5.0,"Exactly what I ordered, love it. It's perfect for work and casual wear."
5.0,Holds what I want it for. Looks good so far
5.0,"This bag is great, sturdy and very clean design. I might want one just a tad wider or deeper. Wonder what they next size up is?<br />Zipper is a bit flimsy, but maybe if I didn't stuff it full of heavy art supplies, it might be just fine."
5.0,"came today, 2 weeks earlier than estimated.  I love this!  Beautiful.  I'm happy I ordered a large, they fit great, but they could be a tad tighter in the palm.  Soft and real leather, I'm happy."
5.0,My son Loves it and wears it constantly! It‚Äôs still big on his oversized 7th grade self so it‚Äôs perfect ü§©
5.0,The compression stockings are great!
5.0,"The costume fit perfectly, hid enough of what needed to be hidden and showed off enough skin to be sexy.  It was a little short but nothing a pair of tights couldn't fix.  Worth every penny!"
5.0,I bought it for my husband.  He is a mason and he wears it daily. Easy to put on with a magnetic clasp. It doesnt come loose. He has received so many compliments
5.0,"So, I ordered this in two colors - red and yellow and love them both.  While this is called a plus-size dress, it's truly a dress for almost all women. I'm not sure why everyone says the fabric is heavy - I think the dress may feel heavy (not hot heavy) because of the style - there is a LOT of fabric on the bottom half. I weigh 123 lbs and am 5' 4/12"" and got the small.  I love these so much that I have just ordered it in blue, too."
5.0,"The grandmother of the bride, 92 & wheelchair bound, looked beautiful! It fit perfectly and as they promised arrived in plenty of time! Thank you so much! We appreciate you more than you knowüòò"
5.0,Very nice l like it
5.0,So soft and great color! I receive so many compliments on this every time I wear it
5.0,My husband orders a different holiday suit every year and this one was definitely a hit. Fit true to size and loved the lights in the jacket.
5.0,"These shorts are absolutely amazing running shorts and I have them in every color. With other shorts I occasionally need Body Glide, but not with the Brooks Chaser 3‚Äù! I ran a marathon in them two weeks ago and had zero chafing or issues with the shorts. Get them!!"
5.0,I love these! The photo doesn't do them justice!
5.0,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! Excellent quality and the print is so pretty! Brought three dresses from this company already and we love all three. You won‚Äôt be dissapointed with this purchase!
5.0,worked and fit fantastic they helped me through a Spartan Run. great value.
5.0,Very comfy and cute! Can not go wrong with these dresses!
5.0,"My son had a Neon Dance at school so I quickly found this great polo and it did not disappoint. Nice material, and washed up as well. Great fit."
5.0,excellent style and quality
5.0,"Beautiful necklaces. I bought one for each of my bridesmaids, and myself to wear on my wedding day this year. üíï"
5.0,Wow. Vibrant colors. Stunningly beautiful.
5.0,"Love this dress, slightly loose at breast but could be too small bra. Did ride up at times but perfect length."
5.0,slow delivery but good item for price
5.0,"Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. Fit just as expected, if not better, and received tons of compliments! Worth every penny!"
5.0,My son loves this he will not take it off. Great product
5.0,"I was skeptical to buy this dress because of the one negative review, but alas, I ordered it! C'mon for $9 how can you not give it a try? Anyways, it came on time and in great conidition. The fabric is very light so don't expect this to be a warm dress. But, since it is light, you can wear it in the winter or summer. The color of the snakeskin print is definitely more brown than what it looks like in the picture (still really cute though). If you have a bigger chest than a D cup, I wouldn't suggest this as you will completely spill out.<br /><br />Now the sizing... I wear a size 8-10 in dresses and ordered a large. It barely zipped up but that could be my own fault from gaining some covid weight. If you are any dress size above an 8-10 you will NEED to get an XL. It fits exactly as it looks in the picture and no weird surprises when trying it on. Get the dress if you're considering it!"
5.0,I love this gym pants.  Is nice and fit good
5.0,"My daughter loves all things ballet, and purple is her absolute favorite color. So when I see this, I knew for a fact that I was going to have to buy it for her. Not only is it well-made, but the color and sizing are very true to what you would expect when ordering. I was super happy with it. Now my daughter is very tall for her age, so I did order a bigger size, but I have to do that with all clothing for her so that's not a big deal. The lace on this is beautiful and even after wearing quite a bit and washing a few times it has held up wonderfully. The skirt is so pretty and looks great with the leotard. It's easy to get on and off thanks to the functioning clip on the back (although it did take me a minute to figure it out!). All in all, this is a beautiful outfit for practicing ballet or simply wearing around the house as a dress-up costume. I'm going to be getting another one in pink, as well!"
5.0,Great bag for events that have a clear bag policy.
5.0,"I love the fit and thickness.  The only downfall is how fibrous it is!  However, I have not washed it yet."
5.0,Loved them! Quality was even better than I could expect
5.0,I love it and love the pockets in it too
5.0,"I wear these jumpers whenever I have to see a Covid patient at work. They are a lot beezier and easier than the plastic gowns they give us to wear for PPE in the hospital setting. They can easily be wiped down because of the type of fabric they are made of. I have multiple ones and after each patient I remove the jumpsuit and place it in UV light to sterilize it for my next wearing. On a busy night with multiple Covid patients I rotate through multiple jumpers throughout the night so that while one jumper is being sterilized I have others that are clean and ready to wear at all times. At the end of every shift, I change into clean clothes, bag my scrubs and all of my jumpers and everything gets washed in laundry sanitizer at home while I go and hop into a hot shower. The ease of this process has definitely made caring for Covid patients a lot easier for me and purchasing these jumpers was one of the best investments I could have made in myself."
5.0,I use these for night driving and there is no glare.
5.0,The Dirndl is good quality and fits true to size.  I think that the chain going through the loops is a little difficult as the dress closes in the front. I will replace that with a ribbon.
5.0,"Very nice headbands. Shipping took about 10 days, but it was work waiting for. These bands are a wider width that I was expecting, but that is great. I sweat so bad from my head, these headbands really help absorb the sweat."
5.0,Top quality item<br />I love it :) I love sleeping naked<br />But if you have to get up it could be an issue<br />So this nite attire did the trick ..
5.0,Wife loved her Palm Tree Charm
5.0,Very nice fitting suit...
5.0,"Flat compact design very practical for carrying along.  Print is very cute & humorous, a good antidote to grey wintery days.  Color light enough to be seen in the dark."
5.0,Loved it and perfect with leggings on a cool spring night
5.0,And they stay soft even after multiple washes.
5.0,"Perfect fit,  delivered on time."
5.0,I got these for my daughter who has wide feet. These are her favorite shoes and are well worth the price. Very bright pink as well. Love them.
5.0,So adorable. The size of the skull and the length of the chain are absolutely perfect &#60;3  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Love it. It makes me look like Angelina Jolie
5.0,The color is great (light canvas color).  They are no flimsier than I expected for the price.  They will work great as bags for my students and they take iron on printouts well.
5.0,"I loved the color, style and the make of it."
5.0,"Just as I expected it to be when I ordered it, well worth the value for it."
5.0,GREAT PAIR OF SUNGLASSES AT A VERY GOOD PRICE.
5.0,Love the fit and the suppleness of the leather!
5.0,These are what I'm wearing now. Hands down. Awesome glasses.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Soft and comfortable
5.0,"Cute top. The large fits a 36"" bust (I haven't washed it to wear it yet).  The white material is a bit thin, but easily fixed by wearing a cami."
5.0,Product fit well and was delivered on time.
5.0,Great pants . Like the phone pocket.
5.0,"Perfect quality you'd come to expect from Coach. Looks great, fits ok, (I did have to tighten the glasses a bit), but most of all makes summer driving less stressful on the eyes."
5.0,I ordered these gloves for my fianc√© because he has walk to work fairly early in the morning so it does get quite cold especially in the winter. He has mentioned how warm they are and how convenient it is to be able to change his music with the touchscreen part.
5.0,"My sweet lil brother loved them!<br />His first pair of basketball shoes, he asked for an all black pair and he got just what he wanted!"
5.0,My 9 year old son loves these. Great for him to pull up and down when he needs to. Helps with not misplacing masks. Comfortable and easy to wash.
5.0,"I could not be more pleased with these gloves. I needed something light weight and durable, I also wanted to be able to use my iphone without taking off my glove. I was amazed at the quality and the fit (though the thumb is a little tight, I am sure it will stretch). The delivery was also very speedy. In short great product. Thank you."
5.0,I love it. Hugged all the right spots but not too tight.
5.0,Love this cool band for my I watch
5.0,"Fits like a glove size XL , super soft , nice product will definitely buy again"
5.0,"I bought a Speidel for nursing school and it is honestly my favorite watch. The fact that the bands are so easily changed is a bonus! Usually have to go to the jeweler drop it of pick it up, yada yada yada. So being able to order one and do it myself AND save money doing it myself = Bonus!"
5.0,I recommend these very much. They are very exquisite and will not disappoint!!!!! Love them. So happy I purchased these. They really give me some bling!
5.0,I gave it to my son because he started working and needs to dress casual/elegant and this clip gives it the final touch. Very beautiful and delicate.
5.0,The blue background is vibrant and looks great!
5.0,"My favorite pants of all time.  Super comfortable with a nice waffle weave in a cotton blend material.  I love all the pockets on the pants - two jean-style front pockets, two back pockets, zippered leg pocket (for phones), zippered back pocket (inside one of the other back pockets), and an inside-the-waist zippered pocket (passport size).<br /><br />They run large, especially in the waist, so if you are in-between sizes, order the smaller size.<br /><br />I like them so much that I bought four!"
5.0,Fit is great but the top is a little hard to get on alone
5.0,"As lovely as can be.  The fabric is so soft.  My husband loved it on me.  And, that's all that matters."
5.0,size is off from label.  straps are very abrasive .  straps are non adjustable.
5.0,warm lightweight
5.0,"These suits are made really well. I like using one piece bathing suits at the beach because sand doesn't collect in the crotch area like it does with regular boys bathing shorts with the netting inside. It washes and dries fairly quickly. The only thing I will say is that sand does get trapped in-between the fibers, so it does need to be rinsed really well. But I find if I fill the sink and then soak and stretch the fabric, I am able to get most of it out."
5.0,"I ordered a XXL, which is my typical size. Usually wrap front tops fall too low and I need to use a safety pin to keep ""the girls"" from view. This dress stays modest without any pins and without having to be careful moving around. In addition, sleeveless dresses often are cut too low and show side-boob. This one doesn't have that problem. The cotton knit fabric makes it comfortable to wear in super hot weather without clinging or showing sweat. I love this dress!"
5.0,Material was very soft!
5.0,These sunglasses are exactly what I was looking for and I got them a lot faster than expected.
5.0,These are well made and extremely comfortable. I had intended to wear these with leggings but decided that they would make better pjs because of the length. I'm 5'4 and they go just above my knees.
5.0,"Cute and stylish! But if you have larger hands, these gloves may not fit."
5.0,"** update **<br />Here we are well over a year in and it's still going strong. My husband takes it everywhere and is not super careful with it - it's still in great shape.<br />The only complaints we have is that the gold logo rubbed off fairly quick  (probably going in and out of his pocket) and at first the card slots were very stiff. It took some getting use to for him since it was so much bigger than wallets he has had before, but he still loves it.<br />***<br /><br />My husband and I are both vegetarians. And this wallet is a nice, classy wallet without being made of animal materials, which is seemingly hard to find.<br /><br />Right away I was very impressed with the quality of the materials and the craftsmanship. You could really tell that this was a nice wallet from handling it. The color of the cork and the texture all made it look quite classy.<br /><br />Upon first observation my husband was a little nervous about the larger size of the wallet being that it seemed bigger than he had pictured. In fact, it is quite a bit larger than the US dollar bill, as shown in my photos. I believe that it's just going to take a little time to get used to having a bigger wallet than he was previously used to.<br /><br />Early on, it does feel a little bit stiff getting cards in and out of the slots (particularly the second slot as the bottom slot completely covers it). This may just need to loosen up in time.<br /><br />While It's too early to tell how well it will hold up to long term wear, we are pleased with what we have seen so far, as the craftsmanship is of such high quality. But we will come back to update if anything goes awry.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is a fine, classy looking larger wallet. As long as the size is something you can handle, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I purchased this wallet with a discount in exchange for giving my honest review of the product. The opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:d7f8b0d145498472b9d0e99fd2710020]] Bomb! Fit perfectly. Radiant color.  Great quality. So many compliments.
5.0,"I ran a 4 mile race as super Girl. So many compliments also very comfortable,  great material did not slide down. Recommend if you want to run stylish."
5.0,I wear this bracelet all the time. The beads are heavy and detailed. I'm definitely going to order more in other colors.
5.0,So cute! I have gotten a lot of compliments on it!
5.0,I'm 5'2 136 lbs and Medium fit me well. Maaaaybe would've fit into small but medium fits just comfortable. These are comparable to Gymshark. The material is slightly thinner and stretchier. They are squat proof.
5.0,"Warm, cozy and beautiful"
5.0,"Could be a tad smaller, but I do have small wrists, otherwise, I love it."
5.0,Gave this to my boyfriend as a small Christmas gift.  They arrived much sooner than expected and seem to be of great quality!
5.0,"I really like this!!! Very nice, lots of space for my stuff but it‚Äôs not too big.<br />It looks very nice, not cheap at all, the inside is very nice, I got the black and I like how it works with everything! I definitely recommend this!"
5.0,"I LOOOOOOVE this dress. It is so unique and retro but updated, form-fitting, body hugging, sexy but elegant show stopper dress. It's the kind of dress that everyone literally turns their heads and stares at me when I walk by because it's so different than what is out there. I get so many compliments when I wear this dress. I am going to see if it comes in other colors and order every single one. I am so happy I found this dress."
5.0,I needed these in a hurry for my daughter. Was very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Will buy again.
5.0,This ring is beautiful and I get compliments all the time.
5.0,Nice quality material. Looks just like the photo
5.0,I love Silver Forest Jewelry and have bought it for years. The quality is great and it is so attractive.
5.0,It‚Äôs very well made
5.0,"These are my everyday boots! I own various boots but these are the ones I pull out the most. They're very versatile. I've got the grey, and I'm back to get a black pair before the inventory runs out!"
5.0,"This dress is so cute that I ordered it in two more colors.  The fit is perfect and so very flattering.  I love that you get the look of a wrap dress, but it is securely sewed together.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"It is exactly what I was expecting. Absolutely love it. Thick enough for cold weather but not too much to where you'll be burning up. The color isn't mustard, it's such a unique color and makes it even better for me."
5.0,"Lightweight, perfect for warmer and cooler weather (with a layer underneath)..Hits right above the hips, I'm 5'3"", 125# and small fit perfect!"
5.0,"Amazing with slightly dirty silver as a maintenance clean. Still need to try it on my older, dirty items."
5.0,Who ever came up with this idea of making shades for kids... I thank them! My daughter is pleased with her looks
5.0,"So far so good, durable and was able to trim the belt down with ease. I'm allergic to the metals in belt buckles."
5.0,The shoes are comfortable and fit true to size. Very lightweight and overall cute. Received a lot of compliments on them.
5.0,I like the color and the length of the necklace.
5.0,"A little bit large.....not by much though. If in doubt, I suggest order smaller size or half size down if possible, especially since they have leather uppers.  They are super comfy. Love them!"
5.0,Love these slippers this is my second pare. My first ones lasted about 8 years before the soles started to dry rot. The best part is they also sell replacement in soles and then there like new slippers again. They came in earlier then the delivery date which was great.
5.0,"Love this shirt. Nice material and cute, cute, cute!"
5.0,"The unitard really is depicted correctly. It is of the fabric of much dance wear. I do not find it to be see through, but will still wear adequate undergarments at gym, just in case of sunlight angles I‚Äôm not seeing. Will also wear T-shirt, though seems ok alone.  Additionally, can be worn casually with a sweater, beach cover, shirt or jacket, with flats, boots. Or heels.  A very comfortable, easy go wardrobe item. It is true to size. I am 5‚Äù8‚Äù 35.5-27.5-37.5 144lbs.  I appreciate it adequately stretching to fit my long 33‚Äù inseam legs. I also purchased in white, olive, and grey. The grey fabric seems to have just a little less stretch than the others, but still fits me nicely. Being 95% cotton (not polyester!) and 5% spandex,  I will get a lot of wear out of these. I love natural fabrics, especially cotton. I am very glad I purchased these."
5.0,"Fits right, good quality for the price."
5.0,"I read all the good reviews, but I had to see it to believe it for myself.<br />Amazingly easy to use and it really does make jewelry sparkle in a way I could hardly believe.<br /><br />Like others say your hands get dirty, but a little soap and water and your hands are clean.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!"
5.0,Light weight!!! Comfortable!!!
5.0,"Got this for my Jamaica trip and I love it.  I'm 6ft 180, 38D and I got the large.  Shorts a little weird in the crotch area but other than that I give this fit a B+"

5.0,It‚Äôs great and not clingy.
5.0,I enjoy the product
5.0,Beautiful! I love it! Well made & helps your neck feel warm & helps with pain.
5.0,Loved it. Fits great. Quality is awesome.
5.0,Loved the material and quality of shirt! I ordered a small and got a little big to my liking so I do recommend if you line your shirts fitted go in the next size down.<br />I fixed mine buy tucking into my pants.
5.0,Very attractive appearance and excellent quality.
5.0,so far so good.  It came on time and on budget.

5.0,My son loves the keychain!
5.0,"I bought this for my 11 year old niece for Halloween and it fits perfect, took quite a while to receive but it was worth the wait."
5.0,absolutely LOVE these!! they look amazing and cover my eye area well.
5.0,I won't model this because of my size but this Ours summer dress is very flattering. I love the empire waist. The blues are bright and gorgeous. A little long but a slight heel took care of that problem. This is the 2nd dress of this style I have ordered. Slimming and flattering and light weight. Great product found on Amazon.
5.0,Diff logo. I‚Äôve never seen this image
5.0,My son loves Dude Perfect. He wears this hate everywhere
5.0,Follow the sellers measurements guide. I'm 5ft 10in 190lbs skirt falls below knee.
5.0,"I wore this with a zombie costume around Halloween. It was a fantastic way to keep my keys, wallet, cellphone, etc nearby while staying in character. It also makes a great cheesy prop."
5.0,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS HAT! I ACTUALLY WANTED TO BUY THE WHITE AND THE BLACK ONE BUT WHEN I SAW THE THE ORIGINAL PRICE FOR THIS HAT WAS $15.99 AT DICK SPORTING GOODS (NO LONGER SOLD THERE) I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE PERSON WHO IS SELLING THIS HAT IS SELLING IT AT 2 TO 3 TIMES ITS REAL VALUE.<br /><br />THE HAT LOOKS AND FITS GREAT. ITS GREAT FOR WHEN I HAVE MY HAIR IN A HIGH PONYTAIL OR BUN. BESIDES THE SCAMMING PRICE, THE HAT IS PRETTY AWESOME. WONT BE BUYING ANY MORE THOUGH.<br /><br />5 STARS FOR THE HAT, 1 STAR FOR THE PRICE!"
5.0,I wear this as a tunic and it's SO comfortable.  It is very classy looking and the materiel is quality.  Its my new favorite top for work!
5.0,Very cute! My grandson loved it!
5.0,Great tie at rock bottom price. I love these and they look great!
5.0,Perfect for what I'm doing!
5.0,"love this dress. comfy and got lots of compliments on it. can dress it up or down! I am 5'6&#34; 180#, usually a size 14/16 and xxlarge fits well"
5.0,"Softest leggings I own, so comfy. I want one in every print!"
5.0,"I suffer from migraines and high blood pressure. I have been wearing the bracelets for 6 months, I have noticed a big difference.  I highly recommend"
5.0,"This is about the 10th such hat I've had over the years - and it is the best quality so far. The hook-and-loop adjustable strap on back (also embellished - see image) sure beats the old plastic bands with buttons that break off.  The contrasting black, 100% acrylic material makes the generous, bright, 3-D  embroidery stand out like a neon bar sign in Saigon after dark. The 70's style hats with the fire dragon and scrambled eggs were flashy,  but I haven't seen one of those in years.  The styles change about every 7 years leaving the old designs hard to find.  So, if you find a hat you like, buy extra.  This Delux Military Law Enforcement Cap is not low profile like many of the hats are today.  It is more like the domed baseball type - or as some call it - an old-man hat, which suits me perfectly.  One note:  For head sizes 6  7/8ths and smaller, the adjustable, outer female Velcro strap will over-reach the male Velcro portion.  The end will flip up like a lose tag.  I sewed a 1/2"" square section of male Velcro to the back of the hat solve this problem.  Old vets like myself have come too far to allow for loose ends.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/5/13<br /><br />I just found the best selection of military and Vietnam merchandise ever.  Check out Medals of America.  Products made especially for veterans by veterans.  I think you'll like it.  Their Vietnam Medals T-Shirt is awesome and this is the only place you can get it."
5.0,"I just had to replace my old Fitbit 3 to the charge 4.  Good news - all the bands you bought for your charge 3 WILL fit your Charge 4.  Thank goodness.  I am always looking for a super easy on/off, breathable band.  This set is great.  I chose the white/gray and black.  They have a hook/loop like (""velcro"") that you easily press and pull to release.  the material is slightly stretchy, making it more comfortable.  So far, this one of my favorite types of bands.  Which they had better print options, but it is a bit of woven band - which may limit the choices there.  I'd rather have the comfort than that prints anyway.  You can adjust the band to fit your wrist exactly as you like it.  I like mine slightly loose.  No problem because there are no holes you MUST hit and whose position may not be in just the right spot.  It looks and feels like it will last for a while too.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."
5.0,"Fabulous! Quality is high end, price definitely worth it. Leather is a good medium weight, thick enough to last quite a while and the dark brown color is on point. A gift for a friend who put it on immediately! She has a fairly small wrist but it fit fine leaving her enough wiggle room without it falling off. Due to this bracelet, I immediately ordered additional bracelets from Cool Steel And Beyond."
5.0,Fits perfectly for my 11 year old son. Keeps him warm and comfortable even at low single digit temperatures.
5.0,I travel a bunch internationally.  I like the idea of protecting my passport and the extra pocket for ticket stubs is handy as well.
5.0,This skort  met all my expectations.  Great price also.  I wear for tennis.
5.0,These jeans are super comfortable and fit as expected.
5.0,"I normally have a big problem with panty lines but shape of these helps prevent them. Also, the fit is superb. Normally high-waisted underwear will still clinch at the thigh and create a line but these don‚Äôt. They are super soft and comfy."
5.0,"Athletic fit, snug sleeves, ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHIRTS. LOVE LOVE LOVE THOS CUT. i am definitely going to buy in more colors. Our whole family are fans of this show."
5.0,"these are my favorite amazon gym find. i never review, but these are worth hyping up."
5.0,"I have a number of these coverups. They are cute. They are also cotton and some have tassels. Others don't. They are somewhat sheer, especially in the lighter colors but they do the job they were designed to do."
5.0,"Great foot wear around the house. Good grip and  very comfortable. If I actually did yoga, they would probably work. Pretending is just more fun"
5.0,"a couple years ago JMS decided to skimp on the material on these plus panties, i use them as dusting rags now but they seem to have ""seen the light"" & returned to making panties that actually fit, covering everything it supposed to cover. whether theyre made out of cheap fabric or elastic or whatever is still up for debate as i just purchased them but i'm glad theyre what they used to be."
5.0,"Thank you, it's perfect.  Customer service was so easy!  I didn't know what size I needed so they worked with me until I found the perfect one!  And I love the hinge style."
5.0,"I did a test before actually wearing it for the purpose I bought for. So when I first opened it I was skeptical because they do look kind of small, I'm a size 34 DD I purchased the D cup. I wore it the entire day, like a normal bra just to make sure it was not gonna fall out or anything, it stayed very well. I even went to the gym with it and even with sweat it did not fall out!!!<br />I Loved this product I will not by a strapless bra at Victoria secret anymore!!! This thing is magical I highly recommend it"
5.0,"Nice product, nice packaging!"
5.0,"I got exactly the model I ordered and had my optical center install the lenses.  The frame/lens combination is light, and I appreciate how flexible the nylon material is.  Definitely worth the investment!"
5.0,"Wow! This product was shipped incredibly quickly! It was listed as arriving May 18th at the earliest and I received it on May 1st! I love the shirt and the material. The only negative is that some of the strings on the back were broken and dangling to the side, but it didn't impact the way the shirt looked. Still absolutely love it and it looks awesome."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS TOP! I got so many compliments and I honestly looked SO GREAT! I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs. Fairly thin on top. It's a nice color and great material. The model wraps it behind to tie, but I found that to be too long so I wrapped it around my body then tied it. I would watch out for your &#34;girls&#34; (aka your tiddies) because your bra can pop out a lot so I used Victoria's Secret Fashion tape, but double sided tape works too!"
5.0,"I bought this for my 11yo son, he loves it. It was comfortable and he could easily move. Def good for a few laughs."
5.0,Love this brooch. It is so pretty and looks so elegant and delicate but it is sturdy and beautiful. Highly recommended.
5.0,Loved it. It's soft and flattering.
5.0,I could have gone with a smaller size but I am happy with the top over all.
5.0,"love love love it. light weight, so soft, nice length. buying another one in a different color. it was wrinkled from the packaging and just used a water spray bottle on it - all of the wrinkles came out no hassle."
5.0,Surprising quality for the amount of money.  I would buy this again.
5.0,I love this necklace. I purchased it for my sister-in-laws birthday. When she open the box and saw the necklace she almost cried. Well worth buying.
5.0,"These gloves are my favorite. I've only strayed twice from them, once in 2004 when my previous pair of 3 years finally needed to be replaced and another  time in 2008 when I wanted to be cheap after I lost my second pair in a year. Both times my hands let me know what a great pair of gloves can do for your hands, (protect).  I've always gone with the top tier model so I don't know how durable the lower Schiek models are.  Now the Platinum Gel Glove might not be ideal for power lifters because  the gel/padding might hinder grip. For the 2 to 4 day a week gym patron they are a must have if you want to keep your hands smooth and callus free. The gloves at that rate can and will last years."
5.0,Every thing about this product is good thank you<br />I'll be ordering more thanks again amazon
5.0,I have a slim figure and it fits mostly as expected but it's a little tighter than I would have first expected but it does it's job and hasn't lost
5.0,Colors and pattern as shown. I have one other blanket scarf that is a little heavier. This one as warm as heavier one and I prefer how this one lays and folds.
5.0,Long enough t-shirt to stay tucked in.  Love it.  Gone are the days of constantly having to tuck in my tshirt throughout the day.
5.0,These are my husband's favorite!

5.0,Great costume kids loved it
5.0,These are beautiful earrings. Very classy and elegant. Nice  with evening wear.
5.0,"I am loving the details, durability, and overall the bangle is awesome."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9c3d543a86a855e4cbb5c18aefcff851]] Loved the outfit... Great fit, stylish and very comfortable. I would recommend going down a size."
5.0,The snug fits nicely on my large cranium and looks great for 4th of July events and other events that you really want to show off American pride!
5.0,What a great dress. Material is solid and good any season. It fits true to size i wear A size 16 and the XL fits me great
5.0,"I truly am a sock connoisseur! I never wear anything, clothing-wise, that is not comfortable and just taking these socks out of the package made me so happy that I bought them. They are soft and stretchy, not too thick or too thin. They feel fantastic on my feet!"
5.0,"Great, soft, comfy, flirty"
5.0,Very nice landyard.
5.0,Excelent i love it
5.0,just like the picture. light and easy to dry.
5.0,"Got this dress last minute for my daughter‚Äôs skating competition when another dress didn‚Äôt workout. Completely stunning! She is 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 110lbs, the xs fit well but probably could‚Äôve gone up a size. We were so happy with this dress and she got a ton of compliments!"
5.0,I'm a pants size 18-20 and these fit a bit on the big size but I like them! I like that they fit smooth under dress pants.

5.0,I really like this shirt it looks just like the picture.
5.0,Very comfortable<br />Thank you
5.0,It's a cute necklace. I don't like how it's adjustable but I'm sure l get use to that. But definitely worth a few dollars. :)
5.0,This dress was light and comfortable. Perfect for a southern Christmas party.
5.0,"I got these as a playful alternative to my boring solid color trunks, and my wife loves them! My measurements are 30"" waist, 36.5"" hips, and 21.5"" quads. Size 30 fit perfectly. Slides on snug but doesn't cut off circulation, and I don't need to use the drawstring at all in normal swimming (I probably would if diving, just to be safe)."
5.0,"Bought these for my son on his first ski trip. For him they were super comfortable, well fitting, and he looked great in them.  They held up well,  never scratched, and from what I could tell stayed fog free.  The only thing I would seek to improve on would be making it easy to adjust the head strap.  Other than that, I‚Äôve been looking at getting some for myself for next year‚Äôs trip."
5.0,"2 years and still holding up. Daily carry bag that's decently filled. It gets tossed in and out of my work vehicle and moved from car to motorcycle constantly, still no rips or wear. Zippers still function like new and no threads sticking out anywhere. Contents gets swapped out periodically and everything seems to fit as I need it. It is a smaller bag but that's what I wanted, kinda of forces me to limit what I EDC and to be sure my contents are multi use. I don't have a large over packed backpack anymore that 75% of the contents I didn't need everyday but rather stays in car as GHB. Would buy again."
5.0,My daughter loves this item. She wears it a lot at night and looks very cute in it. She says its comfy and has no complaints.
5.0,"Hey,  Reasonable price for these nice quality,  Very pretty earrings.<br />Wanted some small hoops that looked classy,  These cut the bill!<br />Love Em!<br />Thank You.<br />Came to me quickly,  Wrapped Sooo Nice!"

5.0,26 year old granddaughter loves it...so cute!
5.0,Beautiful necklace!  I especially love the delicate silver chain.
5.0,"Made my son very happy, he feels cool in it"
5.0,My daughter is absolutely obsessed with flannel pants right now and she loved these ones.  They do run a little big but not too bad.
5.0,Great quality. Very satisfied !!!
5.0,Just what I expected an more
5.0,Great size! Not too big but still has lots of pockets. I love it!
5.0,"I had to look a couple times to make sure this is black, it seems almost navy blue in certain light, but it is black. The sizing is accurate and easily tightened by the drawstring at the waist.  i love this aspect of it so I can make it a little more form fitting and less shapeless.  The details on this coat are very beautiful and well done. There are also lots and lots of pockets, yay!<br /><br />The first time I wore this, my daughter told me I looked like a model. It is super trendy and stylish. It is perfect for spring weather because  its not too heavy and warm but it keeps you warm when the wind blows and during these chilly pennsylvania days. It has been my go to for when i have to run to the store (back when I still left my house) when I would usually just throw on a hoodie. It makes me look like my outfit is put together even when its not!<br /><br />I think this is a great quality piece, I am unsure of the pricing on this coat but would expect to pay around $50 for this if purchased in a department store."
5.0,Dress was a hit!<br />I am 5‚Äô2 150 I ordered a large
5.0,"These earrings are so cute!  The one with the pearly at the top is a little heavy, so the back does need to be tighter than my other earrings, but they're cute and fun to wear.  I wore them for a masquerade, and while they matched my outfit really well, they unfortunately don't show up in pictures very well.  But that's the only down side I can see for them!  They came in a really nice box with extra backs too."
5.0,Absolutely stunning bracelet! I've received many compliments on it. The stones have an incredible sparkle to them and the fit is perfect. Has a study clasp also.
5.0,Very easy to read time with the contrasting face and markings. Also is a quality looking watch.
5.0,Fits nicely and I can swing freely during golf!  Others may not like that the back is longer but it works for me.

5.0,"I am 5‚Äô and around 137, post pregnancy. This worked perfectly for the event I needed it for. The large fit just fine, and looked ok, but honestly I probably should have gotten a medium. Quality is nice and The dress is an attractive style. Overall I recommend. It was refreshing to feel comfortable and look nice."
5.0,Just what I wantec.
5.0,"Beautiful boot, returned only because I was gifted this boot for my birthday. They are very fashion foward, have a nice secure bottom covered with no slip rubber. Look gorgeous with jeans. Or a skirt."
5.0,"I ordered this ring bit got a different one. That's okay tho, the other one is pretty too."
5.0,"My 7yo daughter loves the live action Cruella movie and wanted to dress as the character for Halloween. This dress made her Cruella dream come true. The length is perfect, but she is tall and slender. The wig, the mask, and the dress together are so cute. She can‚Äôt wait to put a Dalmatian sweater on our little beagle and go out as a pair for Halloween. It‚Äôs exactly what we were looking for."
5.0,This necklace is everything I expected. It's real sterling silver as it says I've wore mine ever since I've received it and shower in it and all and it's not tarnished or turned neck colors!! Would highly recommend this necklace and this company very trustworthy!! Hope ya order one and enjoy it like I do!! Thanks to the company for such a pretty necklace!!
5.0,"Nice, standard souvenir. Quality t-shirt and printing should last a while"
5.0,"I ordered these in x large , I'm 5'9"" and weigh 145 they fit perfect .I usually order large but decided to go a size bigger and glad I did . They go to my knee which I like . Great pockets for cell phone . I recommend."

5.0,Lightweight and perfect for driving
5.0,Needed for a beach wedding and was fine for the price.
5.0,"This season, these pants have become my favorites. The wale pattern of the corduroy is unique and expensive looking. The cream color goes with everything. The legs fit so well. They aren‚Äôt skin tight but seem to make me appear taller üòÉ The waist is a perfect fit and very comfortable. I‚Äôm actually 5‚Äô3‚Äù not 5‚Äô4‚Äù.  I was unable to change that but the length was perfect with boots."
5.0,"man this is my best hat! I wear it all the time cover from the sun light weight, this is the One!!!"
5.0,"Wonderful, unique ring. Very beautiful piece looks great on my finger. Exactly as pictured, beautiful wood inlay and incredibly comfortable to wear"
5.0,"Lost a different brand that the styling my wife didn't like.<br />This one is nicer, light, dries quickly"
5.0,"Well made, stretchable...Great Price"
5.0,A little hard to get in at first... but they work great
5.0,"Purchased this flannel gown for my 81 year old  Mom who is 5'2'' tall and uses a cane to ambulate and the item was pretty, soft and warm. The night gown fall just above her ankles and did not cause a trip hazard. I have washed this gown twice and the material stays soft, keeps its shape, the flannel does not shed and the colors remain vibrant. I have purchased this same gown for my Mother in blue and green."
5.0,"I was initially skeptical because these were so cheap but I figured, might as well try. They look just like the picture! They‚Äôre pretty comfy and the sole feels thick and sturdy, perfect for the rain. And they‚Äôre super cute! Definitely recommend."
5.0,"These are my favorite kind of garden gloves. They are rubbery, not plasticy so they are comfortable and feel close to not wearing gloves at all. They have a good stretch and fit my hand well. I am usually a medium to a large in ladies gloves. These fit me PERFECTLY.<br /><br />My palm circumference is 7.75"", middle finger is 3.5"" long, total length of my hand measured from the top, wrist to tip of middle finger is 7"", and my wrist is a 6.5"" circumference.<br /><br />These have a lot of stretch though, so they would fit both larger and smaller hands easily.<br /><br />These garden gloves are excellent quality and a phenomenal deal! I go through gloves at the rate of a pair every 1-2 weeks so while buying in bulk got a chuckle from my friends, they don't garden like I do and don't know how much money I spend on gloves!!<br /><br />I recommend these to ANYONE who gardens a lot and goes through gloves like I do, and likes the thin, stretchy gloves with the soft rubbery coating. These are amazing!"
5.0,Missing home in Ireland. Lovely fit and quality. Very happy!
5.0,"Great item, wide variety of saying from movie elf"

5.0,Wore it to church! Tons of compliments. Arrrrrr
5.0,"These slippers way exceeded my expectations! I just needed something to walk around the house in that was padded so my footsteps were not too loud for the downstairs neighbor. These ended up a perfect fit and super comfy. I wear them all the time, including when I am just standing at my standing desk. I also like that you can wipe them clean if you spill something on them in the kitchen. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised!"
5.0,The fabric is sooo soft and the fit was very nice for my 15 year old.

5.0,No<br />Instructions came with it
5.0,It is AMAZING! Get get get! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and about a size 4 or 5 and I got the medium. Fits wonderfully! No bad words to say here. I‚Äôm a pretty harsh critic of clothes.  Can‚Äôt find one fault. This dress is classy AF!
5.0,Have received many compliments on the &#34;bracelet&#34;. I really like the look but still a little big for my skinny wrists.
5.0,It‚Äôs  beautifully flowy !
5.0,Like the look and sturdiness
5.0,These little jibbitz are so fun!

5.0,Great size.. well made
5.0,"Only used it once so far and did the job. Held wallet, phone, battery bank and other small items."
5.0,"These are perfect for when I do not want to comb/style my hair but yet if I'm lounging around the house, my man doesn't have to look at my scary head, someone pops up to visit me, I have to run to the store for a quick pick up...nonetheless I still look stylish and together...I just a touch of lipstick/gloss to match the colors in the scarves. They feel so comfortable to sleep in as well and I automatically wake up looking pretty...LOL"
5.0,"I needed a yellow bag for a costume but didn't want to spend a whole lot since I don't usually wear yellow. I was also using this at Disneyland and needed something to carry all my stuff, and this bag was perfect! It's well made and it carries a lot. I am going to buy this bag in black because it's such a great deal!"
5.0,Muy buen material watherproof ya es el segundo par que compro de Antartica
5.0,"I like the color very much. Three of them are enough, and the quality is soft.  not bad!"

5.0,I love this dress. It is comfortable and flattering. Nice for work and good quality.
5.0,Great quality....strongly made.  Good price.
5.0,Look good just as described in listing
5.0,Was a gift for my sister for Mother's Day; wanted her to know she was loved.  Great quality as usual!  Thanks!
5.0,I just received this watch and like it very much.  I have a very small wrist and it fits very nicely so I am pleased!  I like it so much I will gladly replace the battery when it eventually needs replacing.  A keeper!
5.0,Fast delivery and look great.  My wife loves them.
5.0,"We bought this for my step daughters 13th birthday  and it was a hit!! She said it was comfortable and it fit beautifully! It fit perfect everywhere and the length was spot on! (She is about 5'4"".and hit at the knee/ slightly below it) She was definitely center of attention at the party  the sequins are not horrible and scratchy and we didnt see any falling out (like what typically happens with sequins) this is great quality at a great price!  Definitely recommend"
5.0,Perfect t-shirt. Collar not too tight. Soft fabric. Just the right length not to short.
5.0,Very very cute on. I am only 5‚Äô2 115lbs & This is absolutely adorable
5.0,My husband loves YoungLA and would wear them everyday if he could. They‚Äôre the perfect length for someone looking for shorter shorts. Stretchy enough to fit around his quads too.
5.0,"Great wallet. I was delighted with the wrapper paper and box it came in. The feel of the leather is nice. This is indeed a quality wallet. The ad photos show a phone being placed in the zippered pocket. My iPhone 7+ in its case was too big for the pocket but I think any smaller phone would fit fine and, if not a phone, it would be an excellent change holder.There were about 24 places to put a credit card."
5.0,Great deal and they are super cute!
5.0,its great mask
5.0,"Great Fit, looks great, son loved it."
5.0,I bought this ring for my girl friend. She very like it. So cute that what she said. Good quality too.

5.0,I love this t-shirt. It fits good and it looks great! It is just what I was looking for.Thank you
5.0,I love the fabric! Fits exactly how it should and they‚Äôre super cute
5.0,The material is nice and it fits like a glove and feels good.
5.0,"I have the gunmetal and love these sun glasses. The fit is snug so they will not slip off your face, yet the alloy frame makes them almost unnoticeable. The lenses wrap to block peripheral light. You will not find a better deal for this price. I bought 3 more in case these are ever discontinued."
5.0,"The material tag on mine says 100% cotton. The pattern is printed on the fabric and has a dull sheen somewhat like satin. The inside is white and the fabric is heavier than I expected. Not at all see through.<br /><br />I've washed and dried it in the machines. It may have shrunk the length just a small bit. The dress came out looking good and no need to iron. The pockets are small. I can put my large phone in the pocket but anything more than a slow walk would probably make it fall out.<br /><br />I'm 185 lbs, 5'3"" and the xxl fits perfectly and flows over the body. The hem is one of those that rises on each side and is slightly longer in the front and back. The front ends about 3-4"" above my knees."
5.0,These are wonderful. The best glasses i have used without a prescription. They help my eyes so much. I Love Them . Thank You
5.0,The plastic insert for my Rolfs wallet fit perfect. I will purchase these again when I need some more.

5.0,"Kobe them, been looking all season finally found them."
5.0,"Really easy to use. Love the snap especially, it holds in the card secure, don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling out of thrown in the bag."
5.0,"My husband loves these socks. He says they are very comfortable and the colors stay true, even after a number of washings."
5.0,"Love, love, love this purse! I will definitely be buying from this company again!"
5.0,"What else can you say, it works to ensure your Fitbit won't accidentally unsnap. Honestly, Fitbits should come standard with one of these."
5.0,Love these half ball earrings! New favorite.
5.0,"I love this bracelet!  It is a very good quality and I get a lot of compliments on it.  I thought it would be too loose since I have a small wrist, but it fits any wrist size just fine.  The price for this was practically a steal!  Perfect for mermaid lovers."
5.0,"I love it!! All products of Mandala Crafts are amazing, high quality and fantastic!<br />Plus they mail you when you buy any products , spreading love and happinnes !"
5.0,I read the reviews and checked the size chart so I ordered an ex large and it was too big. I do love the style of the dress and the material. It can be used as a cover up and can be dressed up to go out. To go out I would say to maybe stitch it  bit on the top and bottom since it is completely open.
5.0,"After much frustration with standard style backs it is truly amazing how well these locks work.  Easy to put on and remove, they are well worth the investment.  Great quality and a very fair price.  I highly recommend."
5.0,Added a little flare and they were perfect for our bake shop set up
5.0,I loooove all of my cow cow dresses!
5.0,fits as expected. i love it
5.0,Nice big easy to read face
5.0,Nice sweater and warmth. Quality is actually good better than those from Rowme.<br />My daughter is 13 Y.O. And she is between sizes (S/M) and it fit true to size so if you want looser go one more size. Love colors. Nice product!<br />She love it!
5.0,Very soft. Sizing is perfect. Exactly as described.
5.0,"I love cardigans & probably have too manyü•∞ This is the second Grace Karin cardigan I‚Äôve purchased & it quickly became a favorite! I love the style, shape, texture, and overall quality. The fabric has a wonderful stretch & doesn‚Äôt lose its shape which is important to me. I can push up the sleeves & they don‚Äôt stretch out. It fits well. I like fitted clothing with sleek, clean lines. Sloppiness will not do - especially in cardigans.<br /><br />I prefer the mid-thigh length. It works well for me since I‚Äôm tall & have a voluptuous hourglass figure.  It‚Äôs long enough to rest under the curve of my bum. It‚Äôs a modest length yet fashionable, making it easy to wear & very versatile.<br /><br />As a rule, I wash all of my cardigans in Woolite then hang dry. This one tumbled through the dryer a few times by accident. I was happy to find that it didn‚Äôt fade, unravel, shrink or pill under the arms. I definitely recommend investing in Grace Karin cardigans. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5.0,My husband loves the look of this hat.
5.0,Adorable and so many for the price. Perfect gift for my sister. She loves them.
5.0,"Dress is amazing and just like the pictures! I am a Medium in regular dressed and I ordered a Medium and fits just perfect! The dress came with a bag that has a zipper to keep it nice when stored, and I was so happy and thankful that the seller even included a pearl necklace which was not part of the dress! So cool and thankful for that bonus pearl necklace! The dress is a very good material and the sequin and beads are all over the dress even the back! It has a zipper on one side.  The quality is great! Arived in 2 days! Will be buying again from this seller! Thanks so much !"

5.0,"Nice watch for the price.  For those complaining that the chronometer doesn't align at 12 oclock when zeroed, RTFM"
5.0,The coat is a great fit. I just got big need a large one. Thank Jean Paul Germain
5.0,Daughter in law loves it.
5.0,Beautiful design and easy to use.
5.0,"cuuuute, everything i expected. i keep very long nails on and i was able to get these on by myself so i was happy about that. good quality, distinguished shaped studs. love my purchaseüê∞"
5.0,"Its beautiful! I just got it in the mail, which was fast. Only took about 4 business days. I was confused at first on how to send an email about the engraving, but as soon as you order it, they send you an email...which was very easy. They were nice and got my engraving perfectly, even though I messed up. Very happy"
5.0,"I gave the scarves as Christmas gifts last year, and everyone loved them."
5.0,The fit of these glasses are really comfortable.  They reflect the glare of the sun and makes visibility clear.
5.0,"Always needing a shirt to go under specific clothes? Want to keep cool while working out or being constantly on the go?  This is the short for you, then.<br /><br />I love how soft and comfortable this feels! It is made from Modal material (which is a type of rayon). I have nothing to compare the feel to, but can only say it feels amazing!  I wear in between a small and medium top, but ordered a medium.  I should've ordered a small even though the material stretches out, it would be more form fitting for me in a small. It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing an undershirt any time I wear this. If I had a small, I wouldn't even need a bra to wear this around the house or farm.<br /><br />It's not often I don't have something negative to say, but I do not have any real negative to this.  Maybe my only negative would be that I don't have more things made of this material!<br /><br />‚òÜ‚òÜDISCLAIMER: I did receive this MsBasic Womens basic active crop top at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest, unbiased, and own original opinion. However, reguardless of the price I paid, I do not base my rating on price, but the product itself.  There is honestly NO downside is seen to this and we'll worth the money!"
5.0,My son loved it won't take  it off üòÇ
5.0,I bought this set for my step daughters prom and it was a hit she looked beautiful!
5.0,"I love big & gauty, lol! I love my necklace! Shipping was great & my necklace too! Something about the purple & green just grabbed me right away. I am so impressed I will only be buying Amazon now. A fraction of the cost I found looking for which allows me to buy more. Much Love and thanks Amazon!"
5.0,"Neleus does not dissapoint, I've purchase dozens of clothing from this company and I'm always amazed at the quality of their clothing."
5.0,"So perfectly soft, fit smooth and flattering. I wear an 8, I ordered a large, it fits not too tight and not too loose. I'll definitely order another color."
5.0,"I love it, it's beautiful. It's way too big for me, but I don't care.  I will have it shorted and loose all the links.  Just wish watch band designers would make design bands for petite women."
5.0,Beautiful dress! Fits great & super comfy
5.0,Great product. Good quality!
5.0,Muy bonito  muy Buena Calida
5.0,Real nice bigger than I expected<br />It's big and heavy
5.0,"This was perfect for my Martha May holiday costume. Fit was true to size, it wasn't too long and was exactly the look I was going for."
5.0,"Dress is awesome, I'm 5&#34;5&#34; 180# and an x-large fits PERFECT . Shipping on the other hand was awful,  Amazon really needs to reconsider using USPS. They are pathetic,  rude and lazy."
5.0,"Perfect replica of the Pirate gold from the first Pirates movie. I got the brass coloring of it, looks more authentic and real. The Cave map of &#34;Isla de Muerta&#34; is on the back of the coin. I did spray a bit of clear lacquer to seal it so it did not turn when it lays on my upper chest green. Defiantly recommended this if you love Pirates of the Caribbean."
5.0,Great earrings for great price!
5.0,ABSOLUTLY HANDS DOWN LOVE THIIS BRACELET...THE QUALIITY IS AMAZING..FITS ME GREAT...LOVE THE ELASTICITY ND MOST OF ALL A GREAT AD TO MY ARM....SHIPPING WAS FAST...DEFIINIITLY WILL BE ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN..THANX!!
5.0,This hat is one of my wife's favorites. It keeps the sun off her face and the rain off her head. It is also very portable. It's her go-to hat when we go out for a walk or sit on the beach. We would purchase this again.
5.0,Really nice pop to the diamonds. Great value and well made product . This earring has a screw on back. Great Quality!!!!
5.0,Great keepsake
5.0,It was pretty cute. True to color in pictures.
5.0,These earrings look very pretty.<br />They are not to heavy on the ears.<br />I match it with m6 casual attire and it goes very well.<br />It comes in a nice box to store it when not in use.<br />It is great for gifting to your friends and family.
5.0,"Such a beautiful, flowy dress! I love the print and color. I went 2 sizes up because I want to wear this throughout my pregnancy. You should stick with your normal size. I wish it had a lining though... I always wear shorts underneath just in case! Pretty soon I'll be styling this with some OTK boots. Overall the dress is really light weight, comfy and easy to wear!"
5.0,I wish it was bigger. It seems too small for the size I ordered.
5.0,My niece really enjoyed this Celtic cat pendant!
5.0,I'm a &#34;wings&#34; fanatic and this watch is terrific! Love the wrap-around style. The details are great and it shows awesomely. All my friends want it...:) So happy I found this. One thing I really like about is you can style the wrap many different eays plus you can secure the center strao in the closure to lock it in place. I love this watch.
5.0,LOVED IT BEAUTIFUL DRESS AND LOOKS GREAT ON
5.0,"still cute as a button, but ran sort of small."
5.0,You will not regret. I bought this gown for the Zulu ball and have rave reviews. I would definitely recommend this dress if u wanted to make a statement. I bought a size down to fit every curve. It did just that
5.0,"Not terribly small, and with wearing a bit, seems to stretch out so I would buy true to size if you're looking to buy, which I would if I were you. Very comfy and warm. I love these!"
5.0,This jumper is perfect!! I am a mom and newly pregnant with #2. I have room to grow (belly wise) and talk about comfort-this thing is like pajamas that you can wear in public and look cute!! I‚Äôm ordering every color!
5.0,"This was absolutely perfect. My son wanted to make homemade pizza from scratch - dough and all, so I bought this as a surprise for a weekend activity during COVID. I also bought a matching one for me and one for my husband. The size is perfect (my son is 6.5 yrs old) but it adjusts so it would likely fit smaller & bigger with no problem. I washed it before & placed in the dryer without any shrinkage or tearing, and the quality held up fine too. I like the materials because most of the mess does not seep into the apron but just sort of sits onto and come off with ease so no staining. The hat fit perfectly as well. It was a perfect experience! Super cute and kept the mess off. Couldn't ask for much more!  I definitely recommend."
5.0,PRICE IS RIGT
5.0,Execellent hat for the price with great material quality. I would recommend it to others and purchase more products from this brand in future
5.0,The gloves fit me as expected. I purchased to have a little warmth for riding horses and liked the grip on these and the touchscreen compatibility. Have not used them riding yet but will update when I do. They are comfortable and very easy to do things with them on compared to other thick gloves. Neoprene like material so I would assume not waterproof.
5.0,Using this for shotgun hulls while our shooting skeet/ sporting clays.  It‚Äôs fantastic for that purpose.
5.0,The perfect hat for my 92 year old mother inlaw. She was the hit of the wedding..
5.0,I've had compliments on this piece. No one knows it's just a cheap necklace. Great buy! A++ I wear to the club often.
5.0,Fit well.  Really good for summer months.
5.0,"I knew this hat would be large on me... I have a small head, and this is a man's hat - no surprise there, and the price was right!!  I'll add a couple of hair combs underneath and some decorations, and it will be a perfect steampunk hat :)"
5.0,"This dress is super cute, but I would size up 2 sizes. I ordered an XL and I am a size 14. Size chart says XL is a 16 and it was a little too tight. I am still keeping the dress, but waiting until i lose a little weight to wear it out."
5.0,Exactly what he needs to be in compliance with fire resistance gear. Neck (gator portion) seems to be long enough to stay tucked into coat as well.
5.0,They are just perfect beyond worth
5.0,I've received so many compliments for it.
5.0,"great little hat.  got it as a gift for a friend, and he loves it.<br />nice accessory for disney lovers, the mickey and writing on the side is so cute."
5.0,"Exactly as advertised.  However. I had to make some adjustments in order to connect it to the charger (i.e. trim the rubber off the back portion).  Once that was resolved, it was the ideal case."
5.0,I use them outside in the sun to not get fried. I run with them. I sleep with them. They are amazing.
5.0,Great fit looks good love the 70's vibe
5.0,Really good looking and sexy shorts
5.0,"Bought for wedding was beautiful, very nice quality"
5.0,This are absolutely the perfect no show socks. Comfy. I hate socks and realize now after getting such a big pack of these that I just like these minimal socks. And I happen to love these colors to boot. I was even able to give my niece a few pair and she loved them as well.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for and half the price of what I have seen in local stores. I absolutely love it. Just wish it had a strap to hold it together when it was down instead of a bag. But I just put a small bungee cord around it to keep the wind from opening it up and we are good to go.
5.0,Great gift ! Loved it! Even better in person :)
5.0,The product was perfect!
5.0,"Very pretty.I was looking for small, huggy hoops with a bit of sparkle. .<br />I do agree with other reviewers that the fastener could be a bit more solid, but so far, they have stayed securely in place."
5.0,Todo object
5.0,"A nicely knitted kippah. It is not stiff like another reviewer mentioned. Perhaps he got a bad batch? Anyway, this lays nicely on what little hair I have left.  These are perfect &#34;house kippot&#34;."
5.0,"lenses are excellent protect me a lot of sun care with them my view and delete expression lines of the face that we do not want to see, the lenses arrived in perfect condition and on time, I recommend for your purchases with this seller."
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my daughter, who enjoys fun socks. She has another pair of mismatched socks by this same company and really likes them. The quality of the socks is very good,and I really like the fact that they are manufactured in the United States. I also like practical gifts like these that can be used and enjoyed."
5.0,"As I've gotten older I have sensitive toes, this helps a lot."
5.0,Beautiful material and fit.<br />works nicely over a summer dress.<br />Definitely recommend...nicer than expected.
5.0,"Beautiful charm, a gift for a golfing friend, I know she will love it.  Exactly as pictured and described, in a beautiful jewelry pouch.  Fast delivery."
5.0,I had this sent to my sister as a present and she really likes it! Unfortunately I'm not there to know how good the quality is but I think it's cute and looks like the picture.
5.0,beautiful Dress. fit prefect looked very nice and good material
5.0,These Grumpy PJ bottoms were perfect for my teenage daughter. The fit was true to size based on what she wears from hollister or old navy. They are soft and washed and dried great! No special laundering required. Very happy. Now she can be grumpy in her grumpy pants! LOL
5.0,"I wore this dress to a luncheon and received a ton of compliments.  The pockets are a wonderful addition.  The dress is a bit too stretchy to carry keys or phone, but the pockets work nicely for a credit card, cash or lipstick.  I am 5'3"" and 165 lbs and ordered a large.  The empire waist is very flattering and very cute when paired with leggings and booties.  I plan on ordering more colors."
5.0,"This is a great bag. The quality was amazing. It was big, the strap was long. It just wasn‚Äôt what I was needing and/or looking for and therefore we returned it."
5.0,Looks cool with the simple decorations and my friend loved the designs!
5.0,"They DO run small and I accounted for that an ordered an XXL when I usually wear an XL.  These are absolutely phenomenal.  Made well, hold great."
5.0,Made well! Soft and comfortable. Was pleasantly surprised
5.0,"Cute shirt, fits as expected. Vibrant colors and washed well."
5.0,"For reference I am 5‚Äô7, 210 lbs, 40E, size 14-16 pants LG/XL shirts, hourglass shape. I got a size large because the XL wouldn‚Äôt have came in time. It fit comfortably but I would have definitely been better off with an XL as it gets a little see through the more it is stretched as you can see in the photos (it is however very stretchy). I would say with that being said it is definitely true to size as I am more often an XL than a L but still got away with it. The length was perfect - not too short, not too long. The chest opening was a lot - wouldn‚Äôt wear it to work for sure. I have big boobs so they were definitely making themselves known but since it was a date with my husband it worked for me. The dress was comfortable and I would order again, just in an XL  - but that was on me, not the dress or seller."
5.0,"Beautiful! Throw it on and looks great and feels like you're wearing your nightgown. Fabric is lightweight but not sheer, so no need for a slip. Couldn't be better!"
5.0,Loveeeeed it!
5.0,They look very nice and expensive looking. They don't feel cheap at all. They make my son look very nice in his church outfit. Definitely recommend buying.
5.0,"It's a great big, pashmina-sized, nearly sheer scarf.  The print is gorgeous and it can be worn many ways!  Love!!"
5.0,"I really like this watch, once, I like a nice simple watch that is easy to read and looks good, and you can't beat the price.<br />I would not hesitate to order this again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I got this watch in discounted price"
5.0,I am very happy with the quality of these sandals. They are worth the price and a lot more in my opinion!
5.0,By far the best reading glasses I've ever bought. They look really good on as well.
5.0,Durable and lightweight. Perfect for daily use. Matches most anything.
5.0,"Loved these leg warmers, used them with leggings and hiking boots most of the winter."
5.0,Great bargain.  Scarves are exactly as seen.  Cant wait to wear with a nice sweater.  Would be a nice inexspensive gift for someone.
5.0,"I was always putting my mask down and losing it. Now I can take it off, now it always stays right where I am!"
5.0,This was for my bulldog loving niece. She loved it
5.0,my original broke within a few weeks.  Pori Jewelers were quick to respond and replace the necklace for me
5.0,So comfortable.  I love they sit about the tummy!
5.0,"These kids suspenders and tied bowtie set is the cutest thing in the world. I cannot believe how cute it is. They are just prefect for kids about 2-6 years old. They are heavy duty 1&#34; wide suspenders and bow tie width: 2&#34; x length: 4&#34;. It fits them very well. They come in other colors and looking cuter with these on. How can you pass these up. These are also fully adjustable to make sure that they fit very well. You do not want them to look too lose or too tight. Plus, they seem to really like to get dressed up and looking good too. You can wear them with shorts or pants and a nice dress up shirt. You can put the suspenders up or down either way still looks very good.<br /><br />I got these at a discount to give them a try and review."
5.0,"Just perfect, never had any problems."
5.0,"Very cute, sometimes the bow comes off but I am able to re-tie it on and it looks much cuter after I re-tie the bow back on.! Very cute on my daughter"
5.0,Gift that was well received.
5.0,I love my swimsuit it‚Äôs cute and comfortable
5.0,great !! awesome!!
5.0,Well worth the price. You do need a slip but the dress is really cute. Fits great. I received so many compliments!
5.0,"They're beautiful. Just know that the tip of the tower will occasionally poke through the cufflink hole again, but it doesn't go all the way through and unlink. Just the top."
5.0,Very good quality and fits well
5.0,No dislikes. All was favorable
5.0,"Great for the price. It did have some extra threads and not-perfectly-finished edges but serves its purpose. Been wearing for a month, no issues with the seams or rips. The belt tends to slip so I just double looped it around the belt hoops. Color is just like the pics. I'm 5'4&#34; and a size 14, the large fits perfect and ends just above the knee."
5.0,"Very nice, comfortable glasses.  Light but durable."
5.0,Product delivered as expected<br />Authentic & fit great!
5.0,High quality cargo pants. I wear these for work primarily but also casually. Lots of pockets.
5.0,Very pleased with the product nice and warm fits just right !
5.0,"Verry beautiful ring, super happy I found it. I actually purchased a very similar ring through different web site before I found this one and even with discount and coupons it cost me three times the amount I paid for this one. I was a little worried that because it's so cheap it will be worse quality but to my surprise it turned out to be even better :) It is true what others say, it looks way better in life then in pictures"
5.0,Good quality Christmas t shirt
5.0,Nice shirt! Flattering and pairs well with leggings!
5.0,"I'm very picky when it comes to dresses, so believe me when I tell you that this dress is very flattering. I wore it to a wedding and received a bunch of compliments! The material is very light and flowy and is not restrictive at all. I ordered it in M and it fit perfectly. For reference, I am 5'6 and 135 lbs."
5.0,"What can I say.... much much better than expected. Great quality and the fit is just incredible good for me. Talking for those who knows how difficult is to be petite trying to get a nice dress. I am 5'2 , 98lbs and the XS is made for me."
5.0,"My daughter likes this band for her cheap Timex watch.  Comfortable, secure, and cute pattern."
5.0,"I am a huge fan of our national parks, and I collect pins from every park I visit on my hiking backpack. After losing one of my precious pins, I looked for a better solution, and found these. I couldn‚Äôt be happier.<br /><br />There aren‚Äôt any directions included, but these pin backings are very easy to use. You have to loosen the backing first by using the tiny included hex wrench before you can put it on the pin. You then tighten it with the wrench. Super easy, and super secure.<br /><br />One tip: make sure you have your pin in the correct orientation before you tighten the backing all the way. Depending on how tightly you put on the backing, you may not be able to spin the pin."
5.0,A little bit bigger than I thought but still fits good
5.0,Who doesn't love a good princess dress? Fits well and seems to be made well too. My daughter sleeps in this and plays in it all the time.
5.0,I have worn this a lot and I am a hairdresser hands in water all day long still rose  Gold beautiful ring for sure
5.0,100% confiables
5.0,"This was EXACTLY what I was looking for; soft, flowy and COOL (speaking of temperature). Perfect for layering and diminishing that little Mommy pooch."
5.0,So cute and got many compliments this summer on this suit!
5.0,Great choker. Simple and elegant
5.0,My daughter love these shoes. She is a regular size 13 and they fit perfect. She loves that they look like tie shoes but actually Velcro.

5.0,Bought these as party give seats. I absolutely love them! Great color choices!
5.0,These are gorgeous and I'm so glad I got these! I still wear them when I want to feel a little fancy.
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my son. It's a very grown-up looking Star Wars watch. It's not the star wars watches we grew up with.  Also, my son has a bigger sized wrist and this watch actually is loose on him. He finds it to be very comfortable to wear."
5.0,"My friend was having a hard time finding a legit Prince Costume. We ordered this and got a good high quality item. The purple color is a nice plum color, it is made with some thicker fabric so it will keep him warm for trick or treating or just being outside. The pants were floor length and have enough fabric that they could be resized (longer). It is always a little scary ordering costumes off the internet, but this one was a WIN."
5.0,Me qued√≥ a la medida. Es ligera y c√≥moda.
5.0,These glasses are the most comfortable and stylish glasses I‚Äôve ever had and will definitely buy more

5.0,I'm very happy with these at the price I paid.
5.0,"Love this wristlet. Just the right size for the essentials, including my iPhone 6. Was worried it was not genuine Vera Bradley because of the inexpensive price but it was the real thing. Very pleased with product and shipping experience."
5.0,"My boy has outgrown his snow pants we bought for him 2 years ago and I found this pair. It fits well on him and keeps him warm during snow tubing.  For the price paid, it‚Äôs definitely well worthy."
5.0,Bought it for my boyfriend as a thoughful gift. He liked it. I like that it was sturdy and not cheap looking.
5.0,Item is exactly as pictured. Material is soft yet durable. I will order from this company again.
5.0,I love this outfit! The fit is perfect. The material is actually pretty thick. It was a winner for my bike ride - great exercise apparel.
5.0,"Cute, the hook is flexible. Nice materials."
5.0,"Best. Dress. Ever. It's so attractive. I'm a xxl, 5'3&#34;, and I thought I'd never find pretty clothes again. This is perfection."

5.0,"Our 12yo son loved it.  We ordered the medium for him and it was only slightly to long, so the fit was pretty close to what was expected."
5.0,"Perfect for a ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù joke exit at work! Lots of laughs and attention getter, easy to transport in purse."
5.0,"The best product, I purchase so many and this socks are the best perfect for my job standing all day long great support.Thanks."
5.0,A beautiful necklace. Better than I expected.
5.0,I like these shoes. Perfect and true to size
5.0,"This was just what I was hoping for. I wear it with tanks and jeans and also with various sundresses. It is more on the casual slant, but I have worn it to weddings, etc. without feeling underdressed. It is nice to have for those evenings out at chilly restaurants. It is darling and fits well. I am typically a small and the small fit really well."
5.0,"Love this shirt,very beautiful, nicely put together"
5.0,Just what I wanted. I love it.
5.0,Very light weight.  Absolutely adorable  Love the color.
5.0,"Great purchase whether you're going to use it for a costume, for the outdoors as it's very warm over a jacket, or both. I couldn't stop wearing it once I got it! Authentic, made in mexico, warm, will last forever!"
5.0,"The color selection is very asthetically pleasing, doesn't look obnoxiously fake, and allows you to wear a different color to match an outfit.  High quality steel that did not irritate my skin/piercing.  Budget friendly, too!  Buy these bad boys for sure."
5.0,"Granddaughter loves them and that's all that matters...... to her !!!!<br />Price was good, delivery was earlier than projected, quality seems good. Charging cable seems robust enough to last awhile, with reasonable care.<br />Only draw back I see is that where the switch is on the charging port, running jumping etc. causes the lights to change, the button is getting pushed by her feet."
5.0,This chain is more than I expected and I'm very happy with it as a gift for my husband.
5.0,I love these and brought two more pair for my husbands co-workers and they love them. Make good Christmas gifts
5.0,waterproof and looks great!!
5.0,I love wearing these skirts in the summer. They are light and look great with flip flops or sandals. Great for all body types
5.0,It's a comfy mask as far as masks go. I don't feel like it hugs my lips like others I've had. The bendable nose bar slowly becomes a bit wonky but it's nice for awhile and hasn't yet made the mask not usable. I do get some comments on the style - not my goal as I just wanted a mask that fit.
5.0,I bought these for my ten year old and they are perfect. She will not leave earrings in bc she always says the backs hurt her ears but she hasn‚Äôt complained about these. She always pushes regular backs on way too tight and she can‚Äôt do that with these. I ordered other earrings from this company for my two year old and love them also!
5.0,I made a bracelet with this for my niece when she passed her RN board tests. It is professional looking with an awesome touch of elegance. She loves it.
5.0,I like it because it covers the whole glasses and still look nice. It also protect your eyes.
5.0,"Fits exactly how I expected. The fabric is great, soft, stretchy. I'm big chested and finding dresses that look pretty on me are difficult. This is a winner. Would like to buy more colors."
5.0,Bought for a genderbend cosplay. Bought larger after reading other reviews and it ended up a little big but it‚Äôs ok cuz I can wear layers under it. Good quality for price would recommend
5.0,"I like it.  It‚Äôs overpriced, but nice."
5.0,I loved it! You can see through a little bit but you can put some shorts on and voil√†!
5.0,"Really cute jacket, highly recommend! Very classy, rose is a great color! Will order again!"
5.0,"I have always wanted to do bar laces but hated dealing with super long shoe laces and the method it takes to achieve them!<br /><br />These work perfectly! Easy to install and doesn‚Äôt take a long time! However it does feel a bit uncomfortable if the tongue isn‚Äôt lined up.<br /><br />Also I was the one who asked about dying these! AND THEY CAN BE DYED! I wanted a mustard yellow color to match these limited edition Converse I have, and using Rit DyeMore and the stovetop method, I was able to achieve that! I‚Äôll try to dye some a dark forest green as well."
5.0,"Super cute, but goes lowwww in the front."
5.0,this band is the best after market band I have used with used with my Garmin vivo active watch. I came with a good working tool to remove the pins to reduce the length to fit my wrist and the clasp is top notch. The finish on this band is also exceptional and makes my watch look very fashionable! I really like this band!
5.0,It‚Äôs so cute and very useful. The alarm is really loud. It brings little pouches for your lipstick and hand sanitizer. I‚Äôm attaching pepper spray to mine to be extra safe. As a female I totally recommend you to get this for protection!
5.0,"My 9 year old daughter absolutely loved this, was perfect for Halloween.  :)  the tail and wings laid flat, but you could fix that with some wires or something I would guess."
5.0,I bought this for my daughter as a gift and she loves it!!
5.0,"You pay a lot more for this stretcher. Almost double the cost of a cheap one. But it is a well-made wooden 4 way stretch,  not a 2-way like most others. If you have expensive hats you want to keep in good condition or if you could use just a stretch to make a good fit, this will do it for you. I'm glad I bought this one and not a cheapie that I'd probably not be happy with."
5.0,"It's great. Good material. It's not heavy, it fits nicely on your shoulders with CO2 Tank Filled &amp; all 6 Pods full. Nice big pockets. It's awesome. I bought one for myself. First one was a gift, and I loved it so much, I had to get myself one!"
5.0,These socks are a fun addition to the holiday attire.  They just add to the Christmas spirit. They also wash well.
5.0,"Nice masks, thin fabric."
5.0,Exactly as described and runs true to size.
5.0,I wish I hadnt read the reviews for this. Everyone was saying it ran too small so I decided to order up a size. Turns out its too big. The sizes are accurate and it is very well made so ill be keeping it for when she grows.
5.0,So I got this for my mom on Mother's Day.... Just a small cutesy thing.... She called crying because she loved it.  I'm going to go with 5 stars because it totally gave me extra brownie points with my mom! And it looks super pretty!
5.0,Really super soft and comfy. I love it!
5.0,Very impressed with the product. i would buy them in another color for aure üëç
5.0,"This is my second minimalist wallet and it‚Äôs the best so far. My first one I picked up at a street fair and my ID never fit in the front pocket right. That‚Äôs why this one is such a drastic improvement. I can fit my work ID, a Metrocard and my driver‚Äôs license all in the front clear pocket. Each of the outer pockets can hold 3 IDs and a business card or two. That‚Äôs the max, but that‚Äôs quite a lot. I can still access my folding money at the top quite easily.<br />The RFID doesn‚Äôt block the signal to my school ID yet still gives me piece of mind about random scanners. Fits perfectly in my back pocket. I can‚Äôt recommend this more."
5.0,This is cute outfit. The fit is great and true to size. It's a good quality fabric as well.
5.0,It work fine and fit good please  with it.üòÑüòÑüòÑ
5.0,Cute earrings! Perfect for fall/thanksgiving. Lightweight.

5.0,Love this fleece/jacket!!
5.0,"My 7 year old was huggy wuggy for Halloween and this mask was perfect for his Halloween version. The paint was easily scratched, but other than that it worked perfect."
5.0,Granddaughter loves these and told me they keep her toasty warm.
5.0,"I love it! So versatile, should've bought it sooner!!"
5.0,Excellent for a budding chef. Ordered for my nine year old and he loved it!
5.0,So flowy and comfortable. Good fit with adjustable straps. Versatile style is great for hanging around the house or for going out.
5.0,great for many things from handling stamps and coins to just keeping your hands from getting body fluids on items that are sensitive.
5.0,Came on time and was exactly what I was looking for
5.0,"Very Different, Yet Black & White. Love It!!!"
5.0,"When I first saw this necklace I was in aw. The pictures showed this gorgeous necklace. I knew I wanted it. I purchased the necklace and awaited it's delivery. Coming from overseas the shipping felt like it took forever. Even so, it still arrived before the estimated delivery date. It was so worth the wait. The pictures do not do it justice. I am very pleased with this purchase and would definetly recommend this product. (I received this product for free or at discount using Amazon Review Trader in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of the product.)"
5.0,"Cute, comfortable and stay in place."
5.0,Super comfortable! And fits perfect
5.0,"I ordered these a while ago, and I still have them and love them. The quality on these are amazing.  The hold has not faded at all. They are still like new. Best purchase,  this store has legit frames,  on trend and great quality."
5.0,"they fit like a dream usually they blow out because i have a bigger head then usual but they fit perfect on my face and keep the sun out of my face, i bought 3 pairs of these now i lost two at the beach but would get any other glasses for the price. ok on my third pair now lost the first two at the beach and i hope these last a lot longer only time will tell"
5.0,"Great, comfortable, bought a second pair."
5.0,Perfect for daycare!
5.0,I usually wear xl and i bought xl since that was the biggest size. Very short even on 5'3 me but im not uncomfortably exposed. Perfect for 20s party!
5.0,Great hoodie. Quality matieral. Going to order more!
5.0,Love them holds my ID and gym loyalty card. And my sweating does not get to them.
5.0,These are as soft as anything you'll find at Lululemon and they are tight so they dont fall down during the workout!
5.0,"These were for a granddaughter who loves flashy dresses and fancy shoes. I bought them too large, so will have to return and reorder them. She was wild for them!"
5.0,"This is a really beautiful dress. It is made with that delicate material that falls apart if washed too often, so I suggest hand washing and drying rather than machines (if you have ever had one of those awesome hippie dresses, you know what I mean- they unravel after two washings). The fit is beautiful and it is a very flattering dress. In fact, I am ordering it in another color. The one thing I wish I could change is the length. It is a little too short. And I am only 5'5&#34;. I wish it had at least another inch. I like my long dresses to really come down as far as possible without stepping on them. This brushes above my ankles. Still, love the dress!"
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress!  So comfortable and versatile.  Great for the summer but if you want to wear it in the winter, a coordinating turtleneck can be worn under it - add a scarf for accent and you are ready to go anywhere!  The material is soft and flows nicely.  Love this dress!"
5.0,My friend loves these muffs. She carries them in her purse and when she goes out there they are. Compact and warm. :)
5.0,"This wallet is BIG. I love it, I can get everything I need in this guy, with room to spare. The closures seem durable as any I have used before. Nice smooth leatherette. Zippers (3) all work fine for now, look like they will hold up a while. For the money it's a good buy. Would buy again."
5.0,I used this product to make rings with embroidered flowers and they worked perfectly to showcase the tiny flowers.
5.0,"Arrived today, just what I was looking for"
5.0,Loved the pajamas. I bought these as a gift for our pastors daughter who loves Yoshi and Mario! Material could be more soft.
5.0,Very comfortable and have lasted a year. Bought them last year at christmas time and they are still holding up. Most comfortable house shoes if you have foot pain. I would highly recommend them.
5.0,Bought it for my garden and it really is perfect!  I looks great and is very sturdy.
5.0,Quality made. Good thick fabric. Hat could have been a little more fitted.
5.0,Love! Got it as a gift for my husband for rededicating his life to God!
5.0,"It's nice, like it a lot"
5.0,Awesome product! I usually wear a size 6 but I got an 8 and it fit perfect! It's not too low and covers just enough.
5.0,Love the size of my new bag. Brand new!! Authentic!!! Love!
5.0,Got quite a few compliments on this jacket.
5.0,"Very cute and super warm set, it's a little big for my baby but next years and I believe couple more will work fine. Quality is great! Love it!"
5.0,"Seriously, this is the cutest hat! And, bonus, it's comfortable and warm. My baby has a larger sized head for his age and it still fits him. So I would not expect this to fit too tiny of a noggin. :-)"
5.0,Beautiful. Great way to add sparkle to a corsage or boutineer
5.0,Excellent value highly recommend.
5.0,Just got this and for the first two days I‚Äôm loving it. It is a suede like material which I wasn‚Äôt sure about but it‚Äôs good:
5.0,got it in wine fits perfectly! easy to walk in also.
5.0,These are great when I work out with out shoes and I don‚Äôt slip. Fit great and look great. So comfortable.
5.0,Love this bracelet. Pretty rose gold color.
5.0,"Use these everyday, look just as they do in photo. Sometimes have had issues with soap dispensers but not with this!"
5.0,Looks great. Like that you don‚Äôt see a elastic band. Nice room for my junk and doesn‚Äôt ride up my leg.
5.0,Great deal for good product
5.0,Love the fit. The material is soft and not see thru. Definitely going to buy another one again.
5.0,"Soft and comfortable. I ordered a large and wear a 10.5 shoe and they felt a bit tight, but not restricting. The heel never slipped down and they felt fine after a 5 mile hike.<br />If you dry them on low and give them a quick stretch before wearing, I think they'd fit up to a size 12 foot with out issue."
5.0,"I wanted fingerless gloves for my weapons so I wouldn't cutt my hand as I use to they work very well but the glove, if you put it on, the top of it is thin but a great product all around"
5.0,"This Turquoise pendant with necklace is stunning!  The quality is excellent, the silver is stamped with the silver grade, the size of the pendant is perfect (not too big or too small), and the color is beautiful.  Very impressive."
5.0,Actually used it for an Easter themed 12 Ft Skeleton and fits perfectly over it's ribs! the quality was nice. It lasted over a month outside in the rain and sun and the quality and colors stayed vibrant.
5.0,Just the right size. Holds a lot for a small bag.
5.0,Love all of Cate and Chloe's jewelry.  This ring is beautiful wore together or separately.
5.0,It's very attractive and &#34;cool&#34; at the same time. My 15yr son doesn't like wearing a wrist watch so he wanted a pocket watch. This is even better looking than the picture. He says it even glows in the dark.
5.0,"Stays in place,  they don't slip off wgen your walking. Great fit"
5.0,Bright colors an filters make it a little bit easier to breathe
5.0,I love this set. I'm currently wearing the one with the balls covered in rhinestone. I highly recommend this set. If you ever have a scan done or your nipples are sore it comes with a clear plastic set.
5.0,"The material is thick, has textured lines, and sparkles. I ordered the blue in a Med. I am 5'11  153lbs.  34B cup (a small top would have fit better).  You are able to tie it as tight as needed with the strings and adjust the top easily.  The only negative for me was the strings, they didn't stay in place.  If you cross them in the center of your stomach they will roll up when you sit. You could tie it tighter to reduce the amount of roll but it will create a skin bulge between the strings."
5.0,"I wear these as well as my boyfriend and let me just say this, these are some of the most breathable underwear I have ever purchased. They are so soft and fit amazing. I normally buy these as a 2 pack from Target but I saw Amazon offered a 3 pack for about the same price and I had to jump on it. Don't stop making these amazing products!"
5.0,Love this bracelet I wear it everyday !
5.0,This fit me perfectly and is so comfortable. Has held up well through several washes and all day wear. I want one in every color!

5.0,Good product  as described
5.0,They are so grate
5.0,"This dress is wonderful. I have worn it several times and always get compliments on it. It is loose, but not tent like. I wear a size 8 usually, and I am 5'7. I got a medium and I think it's perfect."
5.0,Love the way this headband feels and stays in place! Bought for motorcycle trips and it's amazing!
5.0,"Absolutely loved this dress! It is very comfortable and was the perfect length. I am 5'10"" and finding dresses that are long enough can be challenging...this one was perfection."
5.0,Beautiful dress fits perfect I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 so with heals I look amazing
5.0,never been stopped for a compliment on the street for a hat before -- but was stopped today for a compliment on this hat. I don't take it off much. kind of at home in it. Just Love the Color......
5.0,Very stylish and fit well! Only complaint is the metal that goes around your ears doesn't have any sort of rubber protectors.  Otherwise great price and cool glasses!
5.0,I absolutely love this piece. It is one of my favorites now. It is heavy but great quality. Totally worth the purchase.
5.0,"So pretty, so soft and I got so many compliments.. I was told many times how slimming it was.. I love this shirt and want it in all the colors.. it is long but almost the perfect length for leggings (or leather pants :). ) I‚Äôm a 16, 5‚Äô3‚Äù and ordered a xl.."
5.0,I bought this is a gift for my best friends birthday and she loves it!!!!!!!
5.0,I wear it every single day and even sometimes shower with it.<br />It does not fade away nor does it feel like it can break easily.<br />I myself would LOVE to see a band that says &#34;Fill&#34; in it and the color would be yellow.<br />Worth the Wait and the ammount I paid.
5.0,Very nice. Not real large but fits my wrist.
5.0,They came in the mail quickly and fit perfect in my Oakleys.
5.0,I wish i would have ordered other colors fits perfect also the material feels great on my body.

5.0,Gorgeous and very comfortable. Highly recommended
5.0,I ordered this toothless hat for my 8 year old son who loves the how to train your dragon movies and he loves it. It came in just like the picture and is a soft hat.
5.0,"The item is compact in size, but it has everything I want to shine my shoes.  The polish goes on smoothly and buffs well.  I like the compact size and the pouch seems reasonably sturdy for plastic."
5.0,Good size and all were easy to tie/fold. Really protects my face from sweat from my hair
5.0,"She says they fit.  I prefer my jammies quite loose but she doesn't care.  No ""extra,"" room but she didn't complain."

5.0,I loved these unicorns. They are so cute.<br /><br />These earrings were lovely. They were pretty. They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. I think they would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure on my ears. I thought they were a reasonable value. I would recommend them.<br /><br />It is nice that they are real sterling silver.
5.0,Not mine
5.0,So pleased with this purchase I was a bit skeptical due to No prior reviews but I can honestly say that I‚Äôm over pleased with this genuine leather handbag that‚Äôs not small or too over sized not to mention the great price and fast shipping directly from Italy!
5.0,"Well made, fits as expected, kept me warm and loved it so much I purchased another one! Also, you can‚Äôt beat the price!"
5.0,The hat seemed to be a little flat on top with no support.
5.0,My Grandson got to SEE Santa dropping off presents for the first time! Carries on a family tradition.
5.0,These shoes are so cute and comfortable.  And the quality is so good.

5.0,"Awesome, great fit. Came quickly."
5.0,Fit my DW-9052 perfectly.  Cheaper than buying another watch because of a broken strap.
5.0,"I'm really happy with these watch bands so far.  The leather is thin, but it still holds up better than the last leather band I purchased for more money.  For the price, if I wear this one out I'll just buy another."

5.0,Nice adjustable velcro clusure.  Nice color and shiny thread for logos.  Great unique gift.

5.0,A great rain jacket. The jacket fits perfectly and is comfortable to wear. It repels rain and isn't too hot when worn in doors or in a vehicle. It is roomy enough to be worn over a sweater or heavy shirt and the adjustable cuffs are a nice touch. Recommended.
5.0,My wife loves this and we don't worry about her loosing them since they cost under $10!!! great gift for any occasion
5.0,Bought this to wear under my wedding dress! Held up great and worked perfectly for what I needed! Pleased!
5.0,"Nice piece of jewelry , arrived sooner than expected"
5.0,"This is an extremely beautiful necklace. What you cannot tell from the photo is that the emeralds sparkle because they are faceted, though the photo leaves them looking dull. The craftsman ship and presentation box are wonderful. Thank you!"
5.0,FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WANTED
5.0,"Great piece, wife loves it!"
5.0,So cute!! Love it but wish the shorts were a bit less clingy. Was hoping for a flowy fit but still really cute.
5.0,beautiful ring I wear it all the time in Texas we like things big and this is a big show stopper
5.0,"This was a great costume, got so many compliments and the kids could not stop staring they really thought Ursula was there.<br />Down side the zipper was very small hard to zip and unzip arrived would break."

5.0,Gave to son in laws for Christmas. Good quality!
5.0,"This shoe horn is fantastic,  I have arthritis and a knee that doesn‚Äôt bend so getting dressed can be a chore this shoe horn is very solid so it won‚Äôt bend at all. I would highly recommend this product for everyone who suffers like me"

5.0,Great product for the kids
5.0,I wore it to my goddaughters baptism and it was perfect. It is so cute and looks really nice on. Fits really well while hiding unpleasant things. Looks way more expensive than it was and you can really dress it up.
5.0,"Easy to snap, strong hold; use for LEO belt, holster, gun, and ammo"
5.0,"I love love love this dress! It's so comfy and just the right size. I bought a small and it fits  perfect. I always worry about dresses being too long since I'm pretty short but it is above my knees, which is the perfect length for me. I am 4'11&#34; and weight about 105 lbs.<br /><br />And pockets!!! Omg! All dresses should have pockets!!!"
5.0,I loved these.  So cute!  But wish they had thicker plush in the foot lining.  Wore out in 3 months But what more could you ask for by the price?!
5.0,Fits great and seems well made

5.0,"I bought a medium GreenBay hoody for my mom for her birthday. I was a little nervous at first, because of the size. But not only does it fit her perfectly, it‚Äôs super soft and lightweight, but you can tell that it will definitely keep her warm. She loves it!! Definitely one of the best hoodies I bought hands down! 10star easily!"
5.0,Excellent for slogging around at the beach or anywhere else.
5.0,They are a comfortable fit
5.0,"I wanted a couple of belts that I could wear over a top, but under my blazer. These thin belts are very classy and easy to wear. They are nice and narrow and very flexible. The buckle is simple but cute. They are packaged nice enough for gifting.<br /><br />Very nice product! Classy!<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
5.0,I love this dress. It does run a little small. Mainly because the bottom doesn‚Äôt have stretchable thread. I returned my usual med and got a large and it fit great.  Fabric is comfortable and good quality.
5.0,"I give this product five star for its quality, thickness and comfort. It‚Äôs a great value for the money."
5.0,Very good quality! Will definitely be getting more !
5.0,"This is a great cultist robe and hood combo! Wonderful value, but it is thin, almost see through fabric, so having something underneath is a must."
5.0,"This dress is super cute and comfy. It‚Äôs a high low dress, so therefore the length is great for me since im 5ft 4 1/2"
5.0,This dress fir really well. I am 5'9 210lbs. I have a bit of a gut and did not feel as though it was stuck to it. I plan to buy it in more colors for the summer!
5.0,"These are adorable, affordable, and surprisingly pretty warm! I just got it today and already have received many compliments !"
5.0,Love this thing. Slip it on and attach the suction cups to the under side of the tray and BOOM. Mess can be easily removed and rinsed in the sink. No baby baths or deep cleaning high chairs or chair straps
5.0,These worked great!
5.0,"Have Ben looking for a sweatshirt that had a tight bottom band, and Russell makes just the one I was looking for. It also has fleece lining that gives you more warmth."
5.0,First- the length- perfect! I was afraid that tops would show when seated. No problem as they are high enough for a secure no-show. They stay up. All day. Love them.
5.0,what a great comfy bra !!!
5.0,"I love these socks, they are comfortable and fit well. I wear a woman's size 9 and they fit."
5.0,"Fit as expected, very nice item..."
5.0,Very good materials and soft
5.0,"Great shirt my son absolutely loved it, it's more of a dry fit material not a T-Shirt so very light cool material. The graphic on it is just amazing and I cant describe it but it's not like an iron on it's in the material of the shirt so as you wash it wont fade or peel...Definitely recommend and definitely buying another one. Also very fast deliveryüëç"
5.0,"Exactly as advertised, a super cute shirt for my own fossil hunter!"
5.0,Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves it!  She reports it is very comfortable and fits very well.  She has already ordered a second one in the same color.
5.0,"Nice quality socks, fit well."
5.0,Love the headbands glad I got them as a gift
5.0,"These socks are super comfy and soft, I tend to wear them with my converse and my running shoes.<br />They might fit a tad big if you've never had converse socks before but I've had converse socks for several years so I expected them to fit differently than most pairs of socks I own.<br />I would highly recommend these especially if you're breaking in new converse because they offer extra padding around the heel and toes that typically rub with a new pair of shoes."
5.0,Great necklace and perfect gift for any mastermind or TS fan. Necklace is durable and well made.
5.0,My husband ordered these for using while he goes hunting in the cold Michigan weather and he loves them ! He was looking for the perfect socks to wear in his boots that had the perfect thickness..not too much to overwhelm him but still gave him the warmth he needed and they are soft! Will purchase again ! They look exactly as pictured!
5.0,"Flattering fit, loved it so much I ordered it in 3 different colors!"
5.0,Great used for Stones concert .
5.0,Delivered earlier than I was expecting and is nicely made and comfortable. Easily one of my favorite jackets.
5.0,I love them for my daughter
5.0,I'm 5'9 160 moderately athletic build. Ordered a small and they fit perfectly.  warm and comfy.<br />Appear to not be knock offs.  well made .. ordered two pairs.  wish there were more color options would likely order more.
5.0,I love it! It's perfect!
5.0,"Lovely handkerchiefs. They were a gift so I have not actually used or laundered them, but their appearance was perfect."
5.0,This is a really cute shirt and nice quality.  I‚Äôm very pleased with it.
5.0,"Great wallet.  Just not exactly what I was looking for.  The fabric is not the highest quality, but it has held up well to this point.  I love the hidden pocket inside.  It's a great use of otherwise &#34;dead space.  The fabric is textured to give it a leather like look.  The color is basically a perfect match, maybe a little more subdued in real life since there isn't a blue-light background.  Great choice for an inexpensive wallet."
5.0,Very sexy. I wear a size 12 and probably should have gone 1 size up but they weren't offering an XL. Fits snug and hugs all curves so extra spanx for me LOL. Due to the snug fit I will not wear to a formal event but the material and design is beautiful for a spring event. More casual in my opinion. I would definitely buy it again and you cannot beat the price!
5.0,These are the best masks for wearing all day.
5.0,Awesome scarf. Going to be a belt for my sweater dress.
5.0,all i can say is sexyüòç sexyüòç sexyüòç üëçüëçüëçüëç
5.0,"Actually fit, I struggle to find anything in this fabric that ever fits my shoulders with out tugging. Ladies if u have wide shoulders, you know who you are this is great. This shirt is a little wider at the bottom then I prefer but looks cute with with front tucked in to my shorts. Its not see thru at all. Soft .. NO stretch."
5.0,"Beautiful dress. First I thought that it's little bit tight in the bust area and under the bust,but actually thanks to adjustable straps that was very easy fix. When I pull (shorten)  the stripes the dress fit FANTASTIC. Lovely. Great for the price. Length and color are just perfect. Sexy. Recommended.<br />I am size 16 and purchased Large."
5.0,Love this hat!<br />There is not much else to say. I wanted a brim to keep the sun out of my eye but not a baseball hat fan. It‚Äôs also cold so I wanted a winter hat. I also have a bun most days and that fits out the hole perfect.
5.0,Baby prefers these water shoes! Stretchy and easy to get on little feet.
5.0,"Very  nice watch,  excellent value proposition. There is not much about the watch I don‚Äôt like. As others have mentioned, the band is not great, but given the specs this doesn‚Äôt warrant docking a star. I purchased the 22mm Black - BARTON Elite Silicone Watch Bands - Quick Release. Fits great and looks good.<br />No disappointments with this Casio."
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Just like the photos!
5.0,I love this dress! It‚Äôs so soft and I love the color! It‚Äôs true to size! I wear and medium and the medium fits perfect!
5.0,Perfect fit. Padding is removable. It says hand wash but I've washed mine in the machine several times with no issues.
5.0,"I like these fur like gloves. Some of the stitching around the glove was missed, but I fixed that myself. When my nails are done and I have on my nice rings, this is my go to."

5.0,"Loved how comfortable, stylish this dress is with pockets!"
5.0,"She has a small collection of them, and these are among her favorites.  So far they have lasted a year with an eight year old."
5.0,They are warm my wife loves them.
5.0,Very nice quality and look great.
5.0,Really nice and comfortable I recommend buying a size or 2 bigger as their sizes are smaller than ours XL fits like a large
5.0,"This is absolutely adorable and super cozy and comfortable.¬† We have the 3T for my 3 year old.¬† She wears a 3T in most things and is 34lbs and 38"" tall.¬† This fits her well and she will likely be able to wear it again next winter.¬† As of now, it's knee length with a boxy fit in the waist.¬† She is wearing it with the sleeves rolled up.¬† The grosgrain ribbon belt is cute but there is a bit too much fabric to cinch in a cute way on her with the way it fits this year.¬† She has worn this alone with knit tights and maryjanes but it would also be cute with leggings and boots.¬† I can also see this with a sweater or sweatshirt over for cold winter days.¬† Highly recommended. ¬†"
5.0,"High quality workmanship and reasonably accurate.  I've had this for a few days now and it's currently losing about 9 seconds a day.  It's been pretty consistent day after day.  That's about all you can expect from a budget self-winding automatic watch with a Seiko NH35A movement.  The movement allows &#34;hacking&#34; and you can manually wind it if you haven't worn the watch for a few days and need to power up the spring.  I haven't tested it in the water yet, but they claim 10 atmospheres (100M) water resistance.  That's good enough for me.  The crown screws down tight and you can see a small rubber o-ring that seals it inside.<br /><br />It is getting a LOT of looks due to the size and the &#34;industrial design.&#34;  The face is very clear and easy to read and the hands glow in the dark.  I liked it so much that I bought another one a few days after the purchase for one of my older children."
5.0,GOOD QUALITY AND FOR THE VALUE.  NICE FIT.  NOT LOOSE AT ALL.
5.0,Soft lightweight fabric. Perfect tfor warm weather. Simple to wash and dry
5.0,Redefines comfort.
5.0,"Elegant watch, nicely packaged, everything needed to size it to my wrist. It has a tool to take links out. It nearly wrapped around my wrist twice. But with the links removed, it fits nicely.<br /><br />The watch face is large, so it's a little big for my wrist and the black on black make the hands difficult to read.<br /><br />But it looks very dressy."
5.0,Fits perfectly and is comfortable. Hold it‚Äôs shape after washed and the butterfly‚Äôs are bright and nice looking.
5.0,I love the feel of this material pretty colors.
5.0,Many compliments with the dress!  Great festive look with luxurious feeling fabric!  Washes up perfect.  I line dry mine!
5.0,"I love it, and it's perfect for any occasion.. and looks elegant for me.."
5.0,This is my favorite face mask to wear. It is easy to breathe through which helps since I have to wear it 8 hours a day. I tried one but plan on purchasing more since I like it so much.
5.0,These are great sunglasses and they are hypoallergenic which is awesome for the price.
5.0,This dress fits perfect.  It's like it was tailored just for me. Im normally a large but measured myself and went with the xlarge. Take the time to measure. You will be glad you did. This  dress is made to accent breast and bottom of curvy women.
5.0,Was comfortable and cute. Washed well I will order another one soon
5.0,I love the colors of these glasses straps. It's fun to match then to your suit. They are durable and stay on... Even when you fall off a standing paddle board!
5.0,Great fit and comfortable to ride in
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised. I usually never order clothes online because I worry if it will fit right. This dress was perfectly sized, color, & is now one of my favorite dresses. The quality was great."
5.0,Super comfortable!! A little on the big side. I'm 4'11 and weigh 129 ordered a small could have done an x-small.
5.0,I‚Äôm obsessed with these I do actually have to wear glasses but i have to be on my phone or computer a lot so these hopefully will help me until my appointment they are comfortable and stylish I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Will be buying another pair as a back up!
5.0,Very  very nice for my workout
5.0,Wear these to run and they are great!
5.0,Perfect length. Not too long but enough to cover everything that needs to be covered! Glad I purchased one.
5.0,I love this shacket. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it in spring.
5.0,My 4 year old loves her big girl earrings
5.0,I wear hats or caps in the winter.  This black velvet cap was just perfect.  I ordered another one to be sent to her and she called me and said she loved hers too.
5.0,"Freakin A, absolutely perfect!!!"
5.0,Fit perfect nice material
5.0,This dress is so elegant ! Looks really nice in person just as I hoped. It‚Äôs true to size. I bought a size medium and I weight 135 lbs and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù. I wore it for a friend‚Äôs wedding and it was just perfect!
5.0,Went on very nice. Previous ones I've had I had to stick in the freezer to be able to remove all letters from paper side. This was not the case and went on nicely.
5.0,Esta lindo solo que vino bastante arrugado
5.0,"This was the third Gwen costume we tried. This was finally the right fit and style! It does not appear to be cheaply made and is a slick material. It‚Äôs probably not supposed to be reversible, but you can wear it that way (backwards) without the hood on the head. It‚Äôs shown both ways in the first picture. Worn backwards the zipper is in the front. I‚Äôm not sure my five year old would be able to get a back zipper undone to go to the bathroom when at school.  She loves it! I would say the gloved hands and built in ballet shoes are pros and cons. It completes the look, but I know the gloves will get dirty, unable to wash hands without taking it half off. While wearing regular shoes the bottom blue ballet shoes will be covered, but great around the house! I‚Äôm happy my daughters excited! My daughter is five, but tall for her age-long legs. We typically go up a size to a 6, but based on size reviews ordered a 5T. It fits perfect! I hope that helps anyone else trying to survive Halloween costume chaos!"
5.0,Exactly as described and promptly shipped after order.  I will be buying again.
5.0,"Super cute dress. It is fairly thin, so I had to wear a slip underneath."
5.0,Love these earrings. At first I thought they were too big but they aren't. I love the color too.
5.0,"Actually a little larger than I expected, and a tad heavy, but they're metal, not cheap plastic, and they look great. Great earrings for such a low price."
5.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. It's a flannel type material and as a result is quite warm, which was a plus for the rainy fall day but became a bit too hot on the dance floor. The dress is overall very comfortable, the pockets are awesome - I can fit a cell phone and other necessities in them without having to carry a purse and they're deep enough that nothing fell out. I got several compliments on it.<br /><br />The dress is a bit long as others have noted - that was a good thing for me, but others may not like it. For reference, I am 5'3&#34; and the dress hit just below my knees."
5.0,Good quality fast shipping :)
5.0,I liked this dress but it was a little long. I'm 5'2 and ordered the small. It fit well otherwise and has pockets!
5.0,Super Case-- I love it..
5.0,"I like the look, I like the feel but the size was WAY off on these - unable to wear the pair I received. Length was fine but waist was several inches off -not even a belt would work. However, it seems they sent the wrong size so I did not deduct - I would absolutely buy these again in the future assuming I got the right size or was able to return."
5.0,I m very disappointed!! It turned my wife's arm green!!! Grrrrrr!!! Can someone please help me in this matter.. Thank you in advance.M.Bisc...
5.0,I love this product and purchased two...one for me and the hubby!
5.0,These are too cute! Well made and lightweight...
5.0,Perfect fit and keeps you cool!
5.0,"I was hesitant at first to order something that looked so cute in pictures, fearing that it would look nothing like that in reality. The top is exactly as pictured!!! Some other reviews complained that the neck strap looked weird, but my hair completely covered it so I didn't care. The small fit me perfect. I am 5'1 with a 32d-32dd bust for reference. On to the garment construction: it covered all the important bits if you know what I mean lol I didn't use pasties but you definitely could if you want extra &#34;protection&#34; against slips. The material is not very comfortable, but I wore it for a whole night out and had no real complaints on comfort. The zipper is a little tough but just be gentle with it."
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, Color as advertised, Color has stayed even after multiple washes, fast shipping, fits. My only complaint is the underwire for the chest area. The underwire poked out after the 2nd wear. I have to push it back in before wearing and adjusting it as I wear it. I have to figure out a Permanent solution to keep the wire from poking into my chest.  Overall though, absolutely love it!"
5.0,Beautiful case great price
5.0,they beautifull
5.0,"When I opened it, I was surprised it looked better than I thought it would.  With antique in the name, I thought maybe it would be an &#34;off gold&#34; color. It looks like regular gold.  I like the twist which makes it sparkle and with the twist, it won't look bent link some flat chains.  I hope it stays shiny for a long time.  I plan to wear it as a stand alone chain with t-shirts and knit tops for summer and winter."
5.0,"A fantastic item, along with the service & price.  Many thanks!"
5.0,"Beautiful with delicate details. Its just as pictured and fits just as expected with this choker style. Although it‚Äôs very subtle I love the elegant touch it adds to my outfits, it looks great on its own or layered. Not too sure how it will do in the long run yet but I definitely recommend taking care of it and not showering with it on in order to prevent it from tarnishing quickly."
5.0,"I was worried about it being to small in the chest area but it fit just right and if I don't tie the draw strings I have more room. Good quality too, i'm actually surprised."
5.0,A great fabric with a wonderful feel...it also fits perfectly and is very flattering for older women like me to wear dresses that have a waist!  It could make us look ten years younger!!!
5.0,Purchased as a gift & they absolutely love it.
5.0,you can use your index finger to utilize your phone and keep your hands warm. I'm happy and satisfied with this product.
5.0,"perfect in cold or mild or warm climate...light, compact, and easy to wear, not tight but just right."
5.0,"These are cute as a button, I can't wait to find the perfect outfit and accessories for them!  The only thing I find strange is the ankle strap?  The latch used as any normal strap is there but, there is a strange clasp that you use as well so instead of having to undo the normal buckle you just unhook it with this secondary latch.  I am not sure how well it will remain secure when you are walking around in them as it is not closed on all sides of it.  I just received them so I will have to add additional info once I have had a chance to spend the day in them.  If anyone has further info on the clasp I would appreciate hearing about it."
5.0,"These tanks are exactly what I was looking for‚Ä¶ Love having three of different colors‚Ä¶ Fit well, actually make me look a little better than I shouldü§£"
5.0,Love these gloves! They fit great and are decent quality. Perfect costume accessory.
5.0,"Easy to put together, and It works just fine."
5.0,Keeps smudges & fingerprints off Amazon Show which we Love!  Bought 4 for us and our children so we can all chat & leave messages!  Love the music üé∂ !!
5.0,My four year old loved this. It is a good quality for the price. It came in a gold box. It is a nice size and easy to put photos in.
5.0,My daughter love her lab top case.
5.0,looks elegant
5.0,"these are amazing!! extra large frames which i love, however they were sliding off my face. very simple to fix though, just gently bend the metal part inward and it will fit a smaller head just fine."
5.0,perfect for both my kids.
5.0,"My young son has several pair of converse shoes, but isn't adept at tying laces yet. I have bought several pair that are like these, but have plastic ends; they break pretty quickly. These have upgraded to metal ends and higher quality elastic. They do look like regular converse flat laces unless you're looking super closely.<br />I got medium for lowtop size 1 and they just fit. If the shoe was any bigger or hightop, I would have needed large."
5.0,Perfect and cute a little big but still cute my lil one finally can‚Äôt take them off
5.0,The design was excellent just run big and stretches. I had to use my sewing skills to adjusted. Great for Cosplay Stampunk!
5.0,Could not be more happy with the purchase. Great quality for a great price!
5.0,This hoodie was beyond nice. The material and durability is spot on.
5.0,"wohooo these are am-az-ing too shine up my jews! i'll def buy again! so cheap for this quality,im so glad i have them"
5.0,The colors are exactly like the picture. Love them!
5.0,"I work outside a few times a week and always wear this hat when the sun is out. The mesh at the top of the hat is very breathable and keeps your head cool. The hat keeps your head, face, and neck completely covered from the sun."
5.0,I purchased this necklace after Christmas at a discounted price and I am very happy with it. The green rhinestones are very vibrant and overall the necklace is attractive.
5.0,Super deal and exactly what I needed. I downsized my purse and was tired of a big wallet. This has been perfect.
5.0,It goes well with almost any color.
5.0,"A little bigger than I was picturing in my head, but that just made it better.  The buckle is a bit cumbersome, but it's worth it for the &#34;bling&#34;!"
5.0,"It is my second one.  The first one has been broken when changing the battery six months after the purchase. It is a beautiful watch, easy to read, because of the dark background."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:906bae4440677eddf71884069748de01]] It was a hit!!
5.0,Nice and thick they do a pretty good job of absorbing sweat but I have had headbands that work better.  They are made very tight and after a while can give you a headache.  I have an average size American  brain housing group so I think these were designed by Asians with Asians in mind.
5.0,Love this belt! Goes well with my style easy to use and fits great
5.0,I bought this top for a friend and she absolutely loves it. She got plenty of compliments when she wore it. Great buy
5.0,I gave these to my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them! Great quality earrings!
5.0,Love wrestling
5.0,They were somewhat large on me (I ordered a large but that's what I am) however it's not bad and they just sit higher on my hips. Super comfy and nice quality!!
5.0,I like this anklet though it was somewhat pricey.  The charms are nice but the cord is made of thin cotton strands.  I probably failed to notice that when I ordered it.  I've worn to beach and pool and it is holding up well.
5.0,Perfect for my gf who is a police office. Just something simple to show her that I care
5.0,They were good size
5.0,This jersey looks like the REAL thing! If only it had his signature!! WOW!
5.0,Purchased to replace a tshirt my dad lost when he was younger - it is great and he wears it often!
5.0,Supers soft shirt that fits just right! I am a very busty lady and it is hard for me to buy tee shirts. This one had me jumping up and down! It fit perfectly without riding up on me. I was thrilled. And the material is so soft and breathable I will probably check the seller for more.
5.0,"Nice t shirt . Fits good, decent quality ."
5.0,This watch rocks! Highly recommend it to women and girls - the super light up feature and durable without being gigantic size is great! My coworkers all want one. Lots of compliments - even from strangers!
5.0,Wore it under an open back dress I bought for a wedding and it was perfect! Didn‚Äôt bother me at all even dancing all night. Easy to apply and didn‚Äôt hurt to remove.
5.0,I love this dress!! Great fit even for tall women (6'1&#34;).
5.0,Too short for my taste! It is very pretty print
5.0,This is one watch you have. Very good craftmanship has went into the making of this watch.
5.0,Very cute top. Great for spring and summer
5.0,Cute band. Fits comfortably.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress. A little starch makes the dress fit just right. I would recommend buying a white petticoat for underneath. Love this dress for the spring. Only had one spot of miss-sew which I was able to fix myself easily.
5.0,This ring is absolutely gorgeous. Bigger stone than I was anticipating but that won't stop me from showing this beauty off.  Arrived a day earlier than expected.
5.0,My wife is going crazy over her sunglasses!!!!
5.0,"Bought them as gift for my nephew.  Fit is true to size, great quality and comfort for the price."
5.0,"I remember first having this watch when I was around 7. Now that I'm 34 I went onto Amazon and got this same style watch. There is something special about the simplicity of this watch. Now-a-days everything is about the next big thing (Apple watch, android watch, etc. etc), which don't get me wrong, is fine.... But having the reliability of this F-91W on your wrist will go far and beyond what any new wearable can get you. For the price you can't beat it. You'll have a watch that will be maintenance free for more than 5-6 years. Exactly how it should be."
5.0,I am a size 8-10 and I ordered an xlarge and the fit is perfect. I wear a 36B bra. Thanks to the reviews I knew to order a size or two up!
5.0,Love these glasses. Got plenty of compliments
5.0,Super great item! As described.
5.0,Very nice!  Great color
5.0,I love this. Its so fem and pretty. Id buy it till the cows came home and beyond.
5.0,My little one loves them!
5.0,"Smart cute Blazer. Very well made and s√∫per elegant. Really good value, Calvin Klein woman clothing has a great fit. Original and Jet Set look. Very Chanel. Pettit fit. Try one size larger if you are mid or robust. Im size 8,130 pounds."
5.0,The 5 year old loves it
5.0,Got this purse for a killer deal as a gift and it was perfect!
5.0,I have bought multiple items from this company now and have never been disappointed. Love the pockets! Love the material! Overall great products.
5.0,My husband is very happy with these shirts.
5.0,very classy and stylish
5.0,Wife love it. Good customer service as well.
5.0,The kids loved them. Good quality.
5.0,"This wallet exceeded by expectations.  It is high quality and perfect for my checkbook, register, ID & credit cards.  The color matched my purse perfectly & the leather is beautiful.  I highly recommend.  You can't get anything better for the price.  Wonderful!"
5.0,Beautiful and well made dress!  The bodice is lined with cheery fabric and the fabric of the dress is what you'd expect in an expensive women's shop. I got lots of compliments when I wore the dress.  Caution!  When ordering check the sizing chart!  The waist has no give at all (no elastic) and the bodice is for a buxom shape but can be arranged with the criss cross ties for a smaller person.
5.0,It‚Äôs really pretty and pretty comfortable
5.0,Genius clip to secure these.  Our 5 year old struggled with other goggles but the adjusting on these and the clip are perfect! I wish I had ones like this when I was a kid bc i would have lost much less hair bc of the tuggng strap!
5.0,These earrings are super cute! The one issue that I have with them is that they are relatively hefty in weight for studs and the backing post isn't tight enough to keep them from rotating. I'd like a better back to them so that I don't have them moving as much.
5.0,These r great. They stay up and help with swelling of your legs. Hand wash and line dry. You will not be disappointed.
5.0,"Very nice, pretty and lightweight."
5.0,Our daughter has audio sensitivities. These work great and let her be in all sorts of situations that she previously couldn‚Äôt stand. Very happy to have found them!
5.0,"Absolutely love this top! Stays in place, doesn‚Äôt roll up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 usually 125 lbs, but currently 9 months pregnant at 150 lbs and still ordered the small. And it fits over my belly! Will be ordering more for postpartum too"
5.0,Works great and the side bars really help keep that gradual oval. Works great in all types and material hats.
5.0,Love these! This is my 12th pair of 90 degree pants!
5.0,I bought this shirt for my nephew who is an engineering student in college.  He loved it.  Everyone thought it was great.
5.0,"For reference, I am 5'0"" about 125 lbs and wear a 34C bra. I know this chart says that based on my size, I should order a large, but I went with my normal size and ordered a medium, and I am so glad I did. It fits perfectly. A large would have been too big, so I say to order your normal size.<br />This bra is very comfortable  and fits great. The fabric feels good and the quality is great. It was very well made and it does not pinch, scratch, or anything. I love the style of this bra, but was afraid it would cause some fat bulges around my back, but it did not. I would say it's a medium impact sports bra and I would not mind going for a run in it.<br />I would definitely purchase it again. I have another sports bra from this brand, but by far, this is my favorite one."
5.0,These are great for the price. I was actually surprised to see how nice these are. Very good quality.
5.0,"Had to return my first order, had no issues.  Was very easy to work with."
5.0,"This ear jacket is more comfortable than others.  I enjoy having a screw in the clip-on.  Some jackets just have a clip-on which hurts my ear after a short time.  I‚Äôm able to wear my long hair down with a part in my hair on the side of the earring jacket,  I just tuck the hair behind my ear or put my hair back with a decorative hair piece.  People of all age have complemented on this Fairy."
5.0,This gift put a smile on my precious great nieces face! Mission accomplished! Thank you for the fast and accurate service!!
5.0,I get compliments all the time on these!
5.0,This is perfect for keeping all of my charging cords and electronic gear in one place when traveling. It eliminates me going through every pocket of every bag I'm carrying.
5.0,Very cute.  I actually thought they were going to be crappy but I love them and do does my son
5.0,"Perfect, as described!"
5.0,"Soft, comfortable, casual swing dress. The color and fit were great! This is a lovely dress (with pockets!) that can be dressed up or down depending on accessories. It's extremely comfortable to wear, the fabric is very soft, and the fit is flattering."
5.0,Love this dress. Super flattering and I love the pockets. This dress fit true to size. I'm 5ft5in and 150 lbs. perfect length and fit. The dress style like this with short sleeves order a size down. I've gotten compliments every time I've worn the dress.
5.0,"Was a gift, she liked so much."
5.0,"I got my dress about a year ago. I love it, washes well and dries fine. Keeps its shape and I get compliments on it all the time. I wear it to work often. Can look fancy with heels or more casual with sandals. It's a go-to for summer."
5.0,Amazing top! One of my favorites thus far on amazon. Great quality!

5.0,"Put these on and instantly loved them. They fit great and I like the length. They are stretchy and comfortable. First wash they bled made some shirts pink but the color on the pants remained the same. I also bought these in black, large. I can fit into both but the extra large feels better. Nice pants. Will see how long they hold up."
5.0,Highly recommend it luv it
5.0,"I bought this to use as a dressier option for my Pebble Time smart watch.  I also purchased a nylon band that is similar, and this allows me to interchange the bands quickly.  I use this one as my normal band, and switch to the nylon when I exercise or do anything where I would get sweaty.  Works great!"
5.0,"I'm 5'1&#34;, 116# and the small fits me perfectly."
5.0,"It's so cute, but it's so short... Just an FYI, like you wouldn't be able to actually wear this and have your butt not show if the shorts werent sown in. Great quality though and as long as you're not trying to be modest, this will be a great addition to your wardrobe!"
5.0,I really like this anklet. Looks nice and you can't beat the price!
5.0,I loved the dress on me
5.0,It‚Äôs really pretty and flattering on. I bought to wear as a wedding guest. Although it‚Äôs great I would be surprised if it holds up after one use.
5.0,My little boys absolutely love them!
5.0,"This cap is lightweight, comfortable, and looks great. I have to wear a cap all day and some are not very comfortable. This cap looks great and does not feel heavy on my head."
5.0,"Fast shipment! Color as described. I'm 5'0 138lbs and I ordered large (44) and it fit perfect, not too tight or too loose. I can't wait to show it off at the beach!!"
5.0,"SUper cute , love it , I‚Äôm 169 pounds order M  , fits good , colors are the same of  the pictures ,"
5.0,The dress was too long for me but its beautiful. I had to return it.
5.0,"Be sure the area is clean of any dirt or oils. I was applying them inside of a tent in 92 degree whether at a camping festival so sweating was inevitable, but I only lost one pair because I wasn‚Äôt fast enough. Lol they stay on for like everrrrr  once theyre on. My areola is kinda big so it was peeking out a little on the flames, and clover.... but you others couldn‚Äôt tell, and they weren‚Äôt showing in pictures. Decent material"
5.0,It is great but I ordered the wrong size
5.0,"Diffientely fake, turns in about 3 days of continous wear!!!  Very complicated removing the links"
5.0,Love this dress. Washes well.I hang to dry and it does great.
5.0,Cute! Comfy! I‚Äôm glad I purchased.
5.0,Light and fit nicely has a draw string instead of electric to put pressure on you head
5.0,"My leather shoes have been getting wore down in its color and they were starting to feel rough, put this stuff on it and it brought back the color right away and made my shoes softer. I would highly recommend this product for your leather shoes and seats. Currently putting it on king ranch leather seats and after two coats it is bringing out a nice roasted brown and making them much softer to a leather feeling."
5.0,"My husband & I love this wallet so far. Plenty of room & actually a lot of extra for my husband since he does not carry much in his wallet. It will hold 9 cards & your driver's license. It always has 2 slots behind where you keep your cards that you could put things. It has 2 middle slots for holding money or receipts. The wallet smells amazing!! It comes in a little box and once you open the box all you can smell is the leather. I am very pleased with this wallet for my husband and thankfully he likes it too because he is super picky to wallet shop for.<br />I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest review, but that does not effect my opinion on this wallet at all."
5.0,These are my third pair of Pikolinos.  It's hard to believe how comfortable they are beginning the first minute you put them on.<br />Little pricey but the quality is there.
5.0,This dress was perfect for Orlando's Diner en Blanc. The fit was better than expected.
5.0,"I bought 3 for future gifts, and I am very pleased with quality , and the shipper."
5.0,The shower sandals are perfect. The gym i go has a nasty slippery tile floor and these sandals are perfect. highly recommend.
5.0,I'm so loving my shades. Worth the cost
5.0,"I ordered this in a Medium based on size chart and other reviews. The material is not super stretchy though so the medium technically went around my hips but with no give it was way too tight. I'm 155lbs with 29&#34; waist and 40&#34; hips (athletic but curvy). I reordered in size L. Base your order on your hip size not your weight. Fit everywhere else is great, although as other reviewers commented, the sleeves are tight (not a stretch fabric) near the wrists."
5.0,Great headbands and love the men‚Äôs version. Very simple and the black hides sweat and stains. Stays on head during lifting workout and basketball games. Great quality!!
5.0,Washes well very comfortable
5.0,"These are great if you‚Äôre pregnant and don‚Äôt have a big bump yet. I highly recommend and tell all my friends to purchase. I also like that they come in multiple colors.  So easy to use, convenient and functional. They allowed me to wear my jeans for longer."

5.0,"I have bought 2 pairs of these capris and really like them! They ate comfy with the ribbed waist, pockets and very light weight and breathable for hot weather.

5.0,Delivered on time! As advertised. I would highly recommend this purchase!
5.0,This is a flattering and comfortable top. I just wish the seller made it with more fabric choices. I love the cut of the shirt but don't love most of the patterns offered. I got the black top with the flowers and it looks great with a pair of black capris!
5.0,Nice dress ordered L. I typically wear a large in tops and I have broad shoulders. The dress hung off my shoulder like the picture. I ordered the purple dress and it looks like the picture. Nice bright colors. I received a lot of compliments while on vacation.

5.0,Like everything including styling
5.0,"They move up and down as needed and offer good sun protection, they stay where you put them"
5.0,"I have these in two colors and not only are they comfortable I get compliments almost every time I wear them.  They look great with jeans,and can be worn either all the way up or at a slouchy height.  I have minions so I am always looking for comfortable shoes .  I have other boots..dressy and casual..the sheep wool ones I have are comfortable but I tend to shuffle my feet...not with my muck luks..I walk normally..with a bit of swagger.  üòé"
5.0,Literally my first review for an Amazon product and I have to say these are awesome.  Have had them for about 2 weeks and worn a couple times.  They are extremely comfortable and regulate temperature really well.  The elastic waist band is higher quality that most so it fits my body better.

5.0,"Lovely and comfortable, just perfect."
5.0,"This leotard is your basic black leotard that can be used for dance or gymnastics.  I have been a fan of Capezio for approximately 30 years.  I purchased Capezio for my daughter when she danced, and now I'm purchasing the brand for my granddaughter.  You'll find Capezio in most dance wear boutiques.  The leotard fit as expected.  It stretches in both directions, so she'll be able to get lots of wear out of it.  It washes up great.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,I bought this for my son. He is very happy with it.
5.0,"It's beautifully designed very feminine while being 100% practical, I love em and can't wait to use them for nursing my son due in a few months, this is my third baby and I wish I'd of found these earlier especially for the price, I order a little big because my chest always blows up once the little one gets here"
5.0,"Love this shirt, very comfortable and looks great"

5.0,Fits a bit small
5.0,Very satisfied with these lenses.
5.0,love it  delivered on time
5.0,"Fits my garmin 4s vivoactive very well. In fact, I dare day it's better than the plastic silicone watch band that came with the watch. The garmin band reacted with my skin and sweat and often stunk. This band is made from a stiff material but feels very durable. The placement of the holes make it feel very comfortable on my wrist-I have a larger wrist. This was such a great added bonus as the garmin band was either too tight or too loose. This band is just right. I wouldn't recommend taking it on/off often to change band styles. I dont think the pins would hold up to that abuse, but the band would dunk."
5.0,Exciting boot type slippers.
5.0,Great exactly like pictured
5.0,These are the only black leggings I buy! They are a perfect fit and I love the wide-ish waistband. The length is perfect and they don‚Äôt get super stretchy after just one wear!
5.0,"Very comfortable, hides tummy bulge without tummy control. Not real glamorous but gives you a sporty, chic look and feel.  Feels well around the bust, gives adequate support and shaping. It's a keeper."
5.0,Love the day and date indicators. Well built and last one I had lasted 10 years and was still keeping time when I got this one.
5.0,I‚Äôve worn this for about a week with a variety of different outfits ranging from business casual/work from home (aka sweatpants) and I LOVE how this necklace elevates any look! My favorite pairing right now is with turtle neck sweaters. So cute! I‚Äôm not super picky about gold jewelry looking ‚Äúreal‚Äù but I like the shine of this more yellow toned gold pendant. The pendant also has a nice weight to it. Overall this is a great ‚Äútreat yo self‚Äù gift-or gift in general!
5.0,I've ordered 3 so far. All are good quality. Not much else I can say about them.
5.0,Love this bag. Exactly as described. Good workmanship.  Sturdy. Elegant. Playful.<br />My kind of fun bag to have and it goes with everything.

5.0,"Comfiest clothing I have ever worn.  The material is smooth and soft, fits to my waist, hips and legs perfectly in XL without pinching, scrunching or prickling.  If it wasn't 105 outside, I would wear them constantly.  Recommend these to anyone looking for comfort and practical work out clothing."
5.0,"Arrived quickly. Beautiful colors. Charms are lightweight and so gorgeous.  Love getting these in bulk, too. Way beyond expectations!"

5.0,"Nice knit polyester blend ties, color and pattern is interesting without being overwhelming. They tie well and hold a knot and don‚Äôt seem to wrinkle easily. Fancy? Nope, but functional and affordable"
5.0,The sunglasses are very cute.
5.0,Cure made the kids in my class laugh! Thsts what I wanted it for so mission accomplished!
5.0,"Like the hat, was proud to serve with MACV"
5.0,"These shorts are pretty comfortable. They are fitted and look pretty great. The length of the shorts do extend past the knee which is great if you are not wearing knee pads to help a little with scuffs. It is not a replacement for knee pads of course. I do have the Troy Lee Rage Knee pads which are a little bulky. Since the shorts are fitted, the knee part does look odd since it sticks out and overlaps the knee pads sticking out a bit (I'll add a picture on my next ride). For this reason, I think I would prefer one size bigger for preference.<br /><br />The shorts do have velcro straps on the sides to fit the shorts better. They have two pockets that go deep on the front side with zippers for security. Has some ventilation cloth in needed areas and work well with padded shorts. Material is great, not too think but durable enough for my terrain since there are a lot of thorns in my area.<br /><br />I would buys these again. Really liked these better than my Rockbros MTB shorts. I'd be willing to try these pants and try one size larger for my preferences."
5.0,easily stays put on heel and doesn't slip off!
5.0,I love this pullover!!! I wear it for walking and exercising outdoors and it‚Äôs perfect! I also just wear it on a day to day basis Doing errands! I hope they come out with more colors because I‚Äôll buy multiples! I‚Äôm 120 and I got a small. I wanted it not so skin tight so it fits me perfect.
5.0,Using for two years and find the braided belt is the best and most durable I have ever had. Just went to order a second one to have 1 on jeans and 1 on short pants - but disappointed they are not available
5.0,The best shoulder bag ever.
5.0,So easy to carry an extra one in your bag. Convenient drawstring allows for creating the best fit.

5.0,I love this band as a nicer alternative to the sporty neoprene one
5.0,It's soft and comfortable
5.0,"Bought for my son, he really liked them."
5.0,"Good quality, and nice color too."
5.0,Jeans were too small for my daughter but the seller was very cooperative in working to refund my purchase.
5.0,"This off the shoulder dress can be worn as a dress or as a top with jeans or any pants of your choosing. I enjoy wearing mine  both ways. As a dress and as a top. It's VERY fashionable and VERY comfortable. It's lightweight. The material feels great against your skin. The dress is GREAT to wear during the Summer and warm months. You can dress it up in heels or dress it down in flats and boots. Yes boots. I wear my boots<br />all year long depending on the warmth and coolness of the weather. Even dressed down this dress is going to gives off a chi'c fashionable style and look. I like that. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank you to the company, seller and to Amazon for making this dress affordable and available to the public to purchase.<br /><br />  Kimberly Ivy"

5.0,"I just received my tanks today, and I love them!! Thank you Karina!! I received Soul Searcher and Compassion tanks in XL and I couldnt be happier!! Wonderfully made, great material, it moves with you! I am a bigger girl, big busted haha, and I was told these tanks run on the smaller side.. which they do... BUT its nice, they are form fitting and very attractive! I generally like my tanks and shirts loose, but these hold in all the right places and actually make you feel sexy! Highly recommend!! Great job!"
5.0,"Absolutely love this item.  Chain broke two days after wearing it.  Recommend buying a stronger chain. Other than that, perfect for the price."

5.0,Worked well for my kids needs.
5.0,"Oh how do I love these shoes?  Let me count the ways...!  Ha!  These are fabulous.. FABULOUS.  One warning, I have literally ruined my feet and I hate wearing anything but these.  This is now the 3rd pair of these I've owned... they last about a year.. but I literally wear them all day everyday about 5 out of 7 days.  I have several foot problems.. an over extended tendon, plantar faciatis (sp?), wide feet with an incredibly high arch.. so when I find a shoe that makes me this happy.. It should be lauded as the shoe of all shoes.  I mean I get it.. its a flip flop.  Its  a nice flip flop people.  I wears well.. it wets well.. it walks well... it beaches well.. I went for the tan.. its pretty versatile.. I should probably mix it up and get another more festive pair..you know, for special occasions.. I recommend these.. I've re-purchase them.. I've gifted them.. I love them and your feet will love you!"
5.0,It is larger than expected which is a nice treat! I love that it's a two pack. I haven't actually tested it out yet so when I do I'll edit this post but so far looks very sturdy.
5.0,"Beautiful. The colors are true to the photo, but maybe just slightly more on the red scale of things than yellow (gives it a warmer feel and I like it better). To those who can't tell in the photo, it's definitely not cotton; it's sheer. Still very beautiful and perfect for autumn."
5.0,Washes well. True to size
5.0,This bow tie was perfect size for my 7 year old.
5.0,"When i ordered this I was kind of scared that it would be a cheap looking watch. I got it as a gift for my husband and I must say I was very impressed when I received it, it has a good amount of weight on it. He received so many compliments for this watch. It's very different to the style he usually goes for but this has easily become one of his dailies. You would never think that i paid so little fot it. He's had it for a few weeks and mi problems with the band or the time. And it doesn't make a sound which is a huge plus for me."
5.0,"Literally my favorite blouse this fall! I live in Texas, so it doesn't get too cold, so this blouse has been perfect and super cute with a pair of skinny jeans!"
5.0,GREAT BELT..<br />good price
5.0,Very pretty piece.  It fits true to your wrist size.
5.0,I have had a hard time finding a cream that doesn‚Äôt irritate my arms. Some creams worked for a short time. This cream has been great for over a year now. Love the thickness and light pleasant sent.
5.0,I normally wear a small or size 2-4 but bought a medium due to reviewer recommendations. It fits comfortably and the material is not sheer at all.  It has a adjustable tie on the inside waistband for perfect fit around the waist.  Very happy with purchase.
5.0,Impressed by the quality of leather.. compact and stylish!!
5.0,Makes a very necesary product cute and stylish.Very soft & durable. Love the colors and designs and the free pacifier clip was a bonus - it was going to be the next I purchased. Very happy with them! = )

5.0,"SO cute! Fits perfectly, and a lovely look across the chest. This will be my go to dress."
5.0,Received many compliments on the dress. Love the material.<br />My only thing is I wish it came in petite as it is very long. Someone 5'7&#34; or taller would definitely benefit from this dress.

5.0,"The Orvis Ladies chambray shirt is great for outdoor activities. Fits well, fabric feels nice on your skin, wears well, and washes well. No ironing needed. Lasts for years. Great buy"
5.0,"I saw some of the reviews for purchasing this jacket and decided to go ahead with it. It fits true to size and the quality is good- competitive for the price point of this jacket. If you want a simple solid staple jacket, I would recommend this product. I will say it may not be warm enough to wear alone in degrees less than 35 Fahrenheit but layer well enough it will keep you decently warm. Definitely a jacket to keep you toasty in terms of chilly season in California."
5.0,Good quality fits as expected and comfortable to wear
5.0,"I love this dress, it's beautiful. Got it for a wedding. I appreaceate the service from this business and will be buying more from them."

5.0,I REALLY LOVE THIS TOP.  I'VE WORN IT SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY AND FEEL VERY GOOD IN IT.  I'VE ORDERED A COUPLE MORE.  THANKS SO MUCH.
5.0,"The stretchy material makes it fit like a glove.  I‚Äôm always between a large and an XL.  I ordered the large and it‚Äôs a body forming fit.  I love it.  I‚Äôm going to order another one in an XL for when I want a looser, not so sexy fit."
5.0,I love it. It‚Äôs neat and so cute.
5.0,"Gettin' old sucks, but at least I feel cooler and can read."
5.0,"Looks and feels like genuine leather and very well made.  No one HAS to own leather, so it makes a great option.  Color is true to the picture."
5.0,"It was a birthday present for my daughter , she just loves it."
5.0,Great shirt to wear with leggings . Super comfortable one of my favorite shirts .
5.0,"I tried these on a couple of times and wasn't sure I'd like a ""plastic type"" sandal, but these are VERY comfortable, with nice shape and arch support to the bed.  I ordered the brown color, and I also like that you can't tell immediately that they aren't a regular leather sandal unless you look closely. Haven't had them long enough to comment on durability, but enjoying the comfort."
5.0,"Will be ordering more of the shirt in other colors, I like the fit and the comfort of the shirt. I am also a huge fan of the longer backside as to cover my hind end while wearing tights."
5.0,"Great gift. Fun bag with great compartments. Perfect for pool, beach, or backyard bbq. I bought 2 for gifts then ended up getting one for myself."
5.0,Worked for what I needed it to
5.0,"Was concerned that these would appear dinky, but was totally pleased with the simple elegance that they provide whether you're dressing up or dressing down.  They are exceptional and I highly recommend.  The color and size of the pearl are very nice."
5.0,I put the pin on the side of my hat and it fits just right
5.0,"My brother used this shirt as a last minute costume for a costume birthday party. At first, it was a little stiff, but after we washed it, it was much more comfortable."
5.0,"Some people were saying this was for a little girl. I'm tiny framed, but a grown woman. This bracelet is super cute and fits me just right. In all honesty though, I wouldn't recommend it for a large boned woman."
5.0,I ordered both a size large and extra large as it was described as running small. Both fit about the same. The fabric is stretchy and very comfortable. Washed up very well.Love the length of the dress as well as the sleeves. It's difficult to find cute dresses with sleeves and a length thats not above the knees.  My husband liked it very much. Very versatile. Can be dressed up with jewelry for dinner out or not for more casual wear. Gave the smaller one to my daughter who liked it as well.
5.0,This years pair are blue. I believe that they are my 4/5th. Pair in 20 years. I don‚Äôt wear shoes all summer until it gets cold. Best recommendation from me. I wore them on roofs and launching my fishing boat.
5.0,For money highly recommend. Glasses are clear and do fog up when on the water
5.0,"Just received this for my birthday, and it is so elegant and classy in person! The mesh is dark and glides over your wrist, while the steel colored jewels give a hint of sparkle when you move your hand. The face has just a touch of an abalone sheen to it, but not distracting. So glad I received the watch - hope it remains unscratched for a long time!"
5.0,Order bigger then what you think is right im 5'3 130 i ordered 27 and they fit but skin tight 28s would of been perfect they dont make it with a button hole so prepare to cut it yourself other then that i think these are  brilliant
5.0,Exactly as described. The matte finish is especially nice. They're very attractive and do their job.
5.0,"I got black frames with gray lenses combination and i'm impressed with how the tint of the lens is very dark. My favorite part about the glasses is how other people can't see my eyes through the lenses. I like the fit on my face, the nose is comfortable and does not pinch but it also doesn't feel like the glasses are going to fall off. They feel very sturdy, made of thick plastic but not too heavy. Super happy, they feel like they're going to last a long time."
5.0,"Soo happy with the color, length, fabric and style!!  I was on the fence about which color to get and decided to take a chance with the orange/green/blueish one in medium and it is sooo pretty!!  The length could not be any more perfect which is a huge win for buying a dress online!  I am 5ft 4&#34; and weigh about 136-138 lbs.  The lightweight fabric is wonderful for a Texan summer or any summer for that matter.  I can't wait for a day at the beach for this.  I could wear it over a swimsuit nicely or just with a tank top to hide the girls ;) lol.  I also tried pairing this with my knee high boots and it looks real cute I think with a pair of leggings in the fall would be a nice transitional way to use this dress and create a new look.  All n' all I love it and am very happy with this purchase.  I did find that it takes some getting used to with how it fits my around the bust, I think my torso is just a different size than the model so it looks a bit different.<br /><br />I received this dress at a discount for my 100% honest review,  the discount has not changed my review or opinion of this product in any way."
5.0,Soooo ADORABLE and very very comfortable!
5.0,"Was given as a gift and my friend just loves it.  It is a bit smaller than I had expected, but lovely."

5.0,It was perfect for my 15 month toddler. It was part of her Halloween costume and the fit was great and so cute!
5.0,the fit was perfect. roomy enough to lounge around but not to big or too small
5.0,This is the ultimate pendant for Yahwists. I've bought several of these over the years.
5.0,"Very stylish and cute top. I love it, highly recommended."
5.0,Great looking for a young girl. Inexpensive but looks expensive
5.0,"I don't know who designed this graphic tee by Skays, but it is quite reminiscent of the sarongs you see in Indonesia, bright, cheerful and creative, as well as the batik print fabrics and artworks. This is a look I like very much, and the shirt itself is comfortable and eye-catching. I would rated it halfway between ""fit as expected"" and ""too small"" as the XL is the *tiniest* bit tight on me (5-4, 170 pounds). I may wear it tucked in for this reason. Would recommend going up a size if you like a loose look. It's got a crew neck, is wash and wear, and would be perfect with jeans or denim shorts.<br /><br />Review of SKAYS Womens Graphic Tees Plants Print Short Sleeve Crewneck T-Shirts for Women Dressy Casual Summer Blouse Tops"
5.0,Great boots fashionable good fit fast delivery
5.0,The grandson‚Äôs loved them.
5.0,Beautiful necklace and my niece loved it!
5.0,"Good quality, look great and have a nice seal around the eyes."
5.0,This hat is very flattering for my face/head with enough front brim width for sun protection.  Other bucket shape hats I previously tried were not flattering on me.  I also have a small head so the detachable chin strap is very helpful.  I turn the strap to the back of the  head so it doesnt show.  I plan to wear this throughout all seasons.
5.0,I originally ordered these for my daughter because she is a swimmer & has has several different ones to try - so i told her to try these out & let me know. She thought that the nose piece on them was gonna hurt her - but they turned out ok after she just tried them . Didn't leak & syayed in place. I may need to get my son a apor for when he goes swimming.<br />Thanks for the opportunity to try these out @ a discount to review.
5.0,It is the perfect size for me.  I am short and slim. Not too long or big waist.
5.0,"Had to learn to adjust a watch for the 1st time, but now it's an amazing fit and a stylish watch! Such a nice piece - I've been wearing it almost every day. People comment and I just love it anyways. 5 stars!!"
5.0,This wand is really very beautiful.  The velvet storage bag is a nice added touch.  I know it‚Äôs going to be well loved Christmas gift!
5.0,"Love! I'm a US size 6-8 36 C bought a Large, fit perfect! Pretty sheer as expected. Beautiful shirt. Will post photos."
5.0,The only thing that could have made this dress better ... pockets! Otherwise this dress was very comfortable and flowed with every step.
5.0,Fits as expected. I washed and dried this shirt and i didnt even need to iron it! Will be buying again
5.0,"We used this in a children‚Äôs play and it held up very well. It fit our little leading lady (age 11) perfectly, so may not be the best for adult sized heads, but we were very happy with it."
5.0,Just what my tree needed
5.0,One of my favorite sports bras. Im a 38D and purchased a large. It keeps me secured without being too tight.
5.0,"Fits great on my 4 yr old, she feels and acts like Wonder Woman when she puts it on and swims."
5.0,Use as a bracelet or anklet. Purchased as a gift for a twenty something. she really likes it. It looks really nice on -and looks much better in person than online.
5.0,"Happy to say these shorts in charcoal gray appear to be comparable to the ones I bought as far back as the 90s and still wear. (I say ‚Äúappear‚Äù based on the fabric and construction since I‚Äôve only washed them once.) Most longtime customers know Lands End suffered a big drop in quality in recent years, but I also ordered a couple rib knit shirts and I think the old Lands End may be making a comeback!  Superior quality fabric, no shrinkage or color fading, etc. There are a couple style differences in the new and old shorts worth noting. The shorts that just arrived are about 3 inches longer, which doesn‚Äôt bother me because I just wear them around the house and while gardening. The elastic waist band is slightly (only very slightly) wider. Not a problem because the elastic still lays flat and is very comfortable, just noting it for anybody who might care. Barely worth mentioning. I‚Äôm hoping these shorts will last many years, but winter just started around here, so it‚Äôll be a while before I start putting them to the test."
5.0,Great quality goggles.  Easy to adjust and a good fit for my 5 year old.
5.0,I like it and I have alot of people ask me where I got it from
5.0,Love it and love the looks
5.0,Cute kitty set! I really like the tail especially. It's high quality material and well filled. Nice fur. It doesn't look or feel cheap at all. It's got a belt buckle attachment that works well. The ears are darling and I love the details added. Makes me a unique kitty! The collar isn't exactly my style but its nice to have it in my drawer with other collars in case I need a statement piece for a particular outfit. Overall I'm quite happy with this set and glad I got it. Would recommend to others. Good value for the price. Would buy again in other colors!

5.0,It is a wonderful product and I would purchase another one when this one wears out.
5.0,Women's Elegant Crossover Bathing suit very nice would reccommend to friends and family... fit true to size sizing chart was accurate.
5.0,"I'm almost 5'5&#34; and weigh between 125 and 130 lbs. My bust size is 34B. I was a little worried about this product, but honestly, it fits great! The material seems high enough quality that as long as you are careful with it, it should last a while. I wouldn't recommend this for people too much larger than me, because I love the way it fits and it leaves a little room between me and the dress which I like."
5.0,"I have taken a shower and swam with it on and it defiantly feels like really gold the only part that gives it away is the color, because real gold does not shine as bright as this one does but overall pleased."
5.0,My son like his hat
5.0,"My third SpiBelt (only because I wanted yet another color combo...still using the other two.) Fabulous little invention. Holds my iPhone (older model 4S), house key, ID, and a credit card or cash. And it DOESN'T bounce - stays in place comfortably, even on a long, sweaty run."
5.0,"Very pretty, soft material, stretches,  belt doesnt go all way round :/. I order dress, should have went down a size or two.  I ended up giving it to my sister who loves the dress. So pretty."

5.0,Not bad sunglasses for the money.
5.0,"Really comfortable, true to size and overall nice quality"
5.0,I had a heck of a time actually getting this item and I will say the seller is TOP NOTCH.<br />I won't go into great detail but this man is a solid individual and sells a well made product that does what it says it does.
5.0,Got these for my brother-in-law as a Christmas gift/joke.  But these are really well made and much thicker and heavier than I anticipated.  He'll probably be wearing them more than I expected.  Great quality - great fit idea for the OU fan.<br />Definitely recommend these.  Will remember these for next year gifting for other family members.
5.0,"I bought this coat for my 10 year old son after he requested a non-puffy coat. He loves this coat! It‚Äôs not puffy, but he says it keeps him very warm. So far we haven‚Äôt had too cold of temps here (lower 30‚Äôs) but he says it‚Äôs warm enough now that I don‚Äôt think the very low temps this winter will be a problem. I highly recommend this coat!"
5.0,Beautiful! Fits perfect! Very flattering for curvy girls! Covers all the right places and makes you feel very confident! So comfortable! Love the material
5.0,Awesome. Seriously the best fitting slippers ever. They don't slide or slip off while walking up or down stairs and they are SUPER COZY. Now if only I could find my size in other colors too.

5.0,Beautiful and unique pin!

5.0,"Great top, fits perfectly, can be worn day or night."
5.0,Loved these glasses. Hoping I could get these replaced because one of the arms broke through basic use.
5.0,"I love this bag, it does have a strange fishy order on the inside, so I turned it inside out, febreezed it and let it air out for a few days and smell gone. Great quality and can fit a ton of stuff in it."
5.0,Great shirt. Fast Shipping ! Thanks.
5.0,"I needed sun glass that didnt irrate  my ears, this one is comfortable, affordable and love the style and it comes with a case a major plus for me so I have them with me at all times, thanks for this product"

5.0,"I love these soft, comfortable shorts! Good quality. Great breathability for tropical weather. High quality material."
5.0,"My son loves them, I appreciate the way the button is hidden and tucked away on the inside of the sneaker. They come with a charger cord to recharge light and the fit was as expected. The shipping was quicker than expected and the shoe is well made."
5.0,good quality bands will buy more!!!
5.0,NICE COLOR TOO!!!
5.0,"This is WAY better quality than I expected!! Fits my 3.5 year old perfectly, has perfect stretch and the material is nice - thick, quality and doesn't seem likely to tear easily (like many online costumes in the past have.. I'm thinking of you, Catboy & Owlette)"
5.0,Love the fabric nit to heavy
5.0,Really nice pair of sunglasses. You can't beat them for the price.

5.0,I love it and wear it so much! It‚Äôs comfy and cute and definitely worth buying!
5.0,Best work shoes ever
5.0,"If you want a belt that truly hides the bulkiness, I would definitely say well worth buying."
5.0,"Bought a vitaly chain and this chain... absolutely loved this chain. It was way brighter and better looking than vitaly Miami chain! Says the gold color lasts many years, we will see how long. I did order 2 but the other has black spots so I returned it. Prob bette too but 2 at a time."
5.0,My dad love it. Good quality.
5.0,The best swimming googles ever you have to try them they are great we just need more colors that's ut
5.0,Love the fit. True to size! My husband says i look like a young girl. Bought XL n I'm 65. Love him and this pants more! Gonna get more!
5.0,"I bought these for my client. I had bought 2 other brands that were the same, general style. My client tried them all and LOVED these. The insole is very cushioned and supportive. And it is great that they are adjustable 3 ways. And they are priced very reasonably and seem to be very good quality."
5.0,"Just be careful with sizing.  I can wear anything from a women's 10 to 10.5, but these fit me in a 9.  Luckily I had tried them on in a store.  I found them here for $15 cheaper."
5.0,Fits a little large but adjusted straps.  Liked very much.
5.0,Husband really likes them .
5.0,I do not usually write reviews but this is an awesome product. Which far exceeded expectations. I often forget I am wearing them as they are as clear as my regular progressive glasses. I will probably buy another pair as a spare.
5.0,Completely in love with these!! I have had a ton of complements!!
5.0,"Excellent shoes, feel real good"
5.0,The necklace and earrings are really beautiful!  Can‚Äôt wait to wear them!!
5.0,Bought these for hot yoga and they are great. The interior liner is a great feature. The absord moisture and I find comfortable. Going to by 2 more in assorted colors. Just wish I could find a knee length model.
5.0,I love all the yellow box sandals
5.0,The quality the style the comfort I thought I was going to be disappointment when I received the shoes but once I took it out the package and tried them on my feet OMG these are the best they‚Äôre comfortable they look good they‚Äôre different and yes I ordered another pair in a different color I am totally blown away
5.0,Love the quality . It‚Äôs for my brother . He will love it
5.0,"Hard to find 3rd armored div hats, but found this one.  I really don't like the tab or buckle size adjusters on the back of other hats. Really pleased that this hat has the velcro size adjuster which does not put a pressure point on the back of my head (buckle type), or get old and break (the plastic snap ones)."
5.0,"I bought this for $10, and I thought it was going to be pure garbage. I figured I would take a chance. Not only is it an awesome bag but it‚Äôs durable and sturdy. It‚Äôs also very beautiful in the black and white. I was amazed how much I loved it, and with all the different pockets I now have a place for everything. this is a must buy."
5.0,Love it beautiful it glows in the dark
5.0,True fit. Great colors.
5.0,"One of my close friends was married a few weeks ago, after having a conversation about suit pins the week before and how he wanted a good quality USA flag pin for himself but couldn't find any. So as a surprise I ordered 6 these a few days before his wedding, one for him, me, and the rest of the groomsmen. They arrived faster then expected. He was very happy with them and was proud to represent his country on his wedding day, his wife wouldn't allow us to wear them for the initial pictures but we wore them for the rest the day/night. He liked they how they are &#34;Proudly made in USA&#34;, which was the first thing he asked me when I took them out. We all liked how they aren't very huge like most pins, was just the right size and didn't move around. Also as a bonus, if for some reason to decide to run for political office you are all set haha"
5.0,"I ordered this for my daughter to use as her dance bag. She is able to keep her tap, ballet, and jazz shoes on the bottom away from her clothes in the top making it so much easier for her to keep up with all of her things. Since she changes shoes during practice I don't have to worry about other things being pulled out and lost. The quality could be better but it will be more than sufficient for her needs. Don't expect &#34;Coach&#34; quality with this pricing but overall a very nice bag."
5.0,Great but fits like two sizes bigger!
5.0,These definitely are kids glasses. They are very comfortable and I recommend!
5.0,GREAT sunglasses at a fantastic price.
5.0,I purchased this set for my 13 year old and she loves them. They are good quality and are holding up well.
5.0,'The best gift to gift'.
5.0,"This dress is amazing, bottom line. I purchased the b&w in a M. To begin with, the product arrived promptly and was well packaged. The dress was carefully folded, but it did not overly crease because of the fabric, which has a nice quality (stretchy) and does not feel cheap. This dress is so flattering and feminine that I dob't even care that it makes my arms look kind of fat. My one complaint is, as a big boobied gal, that the dress does not have enough give in the top and it has a tendency to gap. I either safety pin it or I wear and cover over my bra so it doesn't look too obscene.<br /><br />I've worn this dress casually, professionally, and for parties. It's a real winner and I would highly recommend it."
5.0,My mom loved it. It was one of her mother's day gifts. Well woven. trendy.
5.0,"When the hat showed up, I was not disappointed in any way. The quality and the look are fantastic. The price is also quite reasonable. Definitely would buy again from this vendor, and from the manufacturer."
5.0,"Nice product to get that old time riding cap look, but it also works great in keeping the sweat away from the eyes. Be aware that it does run a bit on the small size but for the low cost it is still nice. Thinking of getting the camo next."
5.0,"Good value, great design and its comfy!"
5.0,Dress fits great üëó<br />Received lots of compliments ‚ò∫Ô∏è<br />Love it üåª
5.0,This fits me perfectly and I ordered 2 more. I love the look and the length. The color is exactly what it should be. It's nice and light weight which is what I wanted for the warm weather.
5.0,Good thick mask to show off my pride
5.0,Love it.. will be buying it in white too!!!
5.0,"I bought this for a plus sized friend, did not fit her. So I kept it. It is adorable. I get many compliments on it daily."
5.0,Very cute.  Nice canvas material.  Definitely worth $30.
5.0,It is definitely the prettiest in my display case.
5.0,Love the set. Was missing a couple items. 8g plus and the rubber rings to the 2g tapers and plugs. Other than that everything was there. Great set over all. When I wrote the seller of the missing items they sent me a whole new set! Will order other items from them again!
5.0,T-shirt fits well.
5.0,"I bought this sleveless blouse (2inches larger than my usual size) . It fits good. It can be made bigger if we open the stitches in the sides. color, fabric, stitching is very good. Looks nice with my 'soft silk' saree.  They have given a sleeve also, that we can attach if we need one.  Thanks to the seller and the manufacturers for this beautiful blouse."
5.0,"Cute and simple bikini for a pool party or beach day! It fits well and is true to size and somewhat versatile considering the simplicity. It looks good with the top upside down too and wearing the bottoms backward gives a little more lower belly coverage. I also like wearing the bottoms backwards for more of a cheeky look rather than the full bikini coverage. For reference, my measurements are 43-35-47 and I got an XL."
5.0,Cute and holding up well on my new kindergartener's backpack!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress.  I was being recognized at an awards ceremony and it was PERFECT! Great quality,  perfect fit and the price is a bargain.  Would highly recommend! Returns and replacements were easy too. The first one showed up with a hole in the seam and I had a replacement dress within 2 days."
5.0,It's a nice sleep mask. I love the comfortable material and it's very soft. It also does a good job of blocking out all light. I will recommend this product to everyone who needs a sleep mask!
5.0,Just wore this to the city last nite. Looks beautiful on! Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, small opening and unfortunately could not get it on. Wish it had a hinge!"
5.0,This shirt is cute and comfortable! You can easily dress it up or down. It was fast and efficiently shipped and fits beautifully! I recommend Amelie Boutik to anyone!
5.0,Love that they don't pull my hair or rip out strands of hair!
5.0,The dress is gorgeous and fit me perfectly. This is my third dress from the company and I couldn't be happier! Looking forward to wearing it at my reunion
5.0,Perfect and breezy.  The new flex waist helps me because I tend to tear pants and shorts at the hip when I squat.<br />Im 5'6/ 250 with a 38W and  these are not too long.
5.0,"I have been searching for warm socks for years. These socks are warm and soft, everything I've been looking for! They come beautifully packaged in a nice box with tissue paper so it'll make a perfect gift. I've been wearing a pair since it was delivered to me and I just don't want to take them off. They are SO cozy and warm."
5.0,I started buying one of Patty‚Äôs tops and that‚Äôs all it took . I saw the reviews and couldn‚Äôt resist this one . I bought a small it fits perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 122 lbs soo flattering just like everything else .
5.0,"I loved the super-soft fabric! I think it can be both lounge wear or dress wear. I have a longer torso, so the waistline initially fell in an odd place, but it is so stretchy that I could kind of mould it the way I desired ... or I could tuck it up a bit to be an empire waist. BUT--I had my daughter try it on (she is much shorter), and she came out of the bathroom instantly cute with the waistline just right. LOL. Needless to say, she has already adopted it as hers! She also loved the fabric and style (and the pouch it came in)."
5.0,I got so many compliments on the blue and gray necklace.  It is a really nice set. I am going to purchase the blue and pink set also.
5.0,"Great band! Looks nice, easy to install and strong magnets make it stay put. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,As expected. Wish maybe they had a little rubber strip to keep from slipping but honestly they don‚Äôt even slip that much. An hour long workout and I might have to adjust once. If I feel like it.
5.0,Product was a great gift!
5.0,"I can't say enough great things about this shoe stretcher! I didn't even know these existed until a friend mentioned it to me. I ordered shoes I loved for my wedding, but one was way too tight and was just not going to work. As a last resort, I purchased this stretcher. It took a few minutes for me to figure out how to use it, and there are warnings about overstretching, so my first try was not very effective because I was worried about damaging the shoe. On my second try I stretched it farther and left the stretcher in the shoe for several days. I just got the shoe out and tried it on, and I could not be happier. The shoe fits almost perfectly when before it was painful to wear it for more than a few seconds. I will use this for years to come, and my feet wish I had found it much sooner. If you've ever had shoes that were too tight, you need to buy this. You will NOT regret it!"
5.0,"It‚Äôs a little smaller than I thought, but it still looks good. Love it!"
5.0,"Well-made scrub hat. Strong material, reinforced sewing"
5.0,Nice fit with some stretch..comfortable
5.0,"Ordered for my son who is very thin, but tall, maybe 6‚Äô. He said the sleeves are a little short.  He probably should have ordered a large."
5.0,They are the perfect size. If you have a big or short hairstyle they complement very well. Would purchase again!
5.0,"IT,S PERFECT IN ALL ASPECT."
5.0,"The wife likes the item, more importantly<br />I like it<br />She looks good in the items"
5.0,I bought this for a Christmas present.  Love the look and the price was right
5.0,Love their designs (I own two pairs but looking to expand) and quality is nice.
5.0,Great Price. Sturdy. My 5 year old daughter loves it.
5.0,The material is great. Stretchy. I have A small chest and wide waist/thighs so it‚Äôs a little loose up top but not much at all.
5.0,This cap fits comfortably under my helmet. The brim is very helpful in keeping the sun out of my eyes.
5.0,These socks are so cute on my 5 year old! Love them!
5.0,Wear it everyday with no issues
5.0,Stretchy easy fit. Very comfy.
5.0,Love the style. Thick and warm. I have received many compliments. Would definitely invest I'm other colors.
5.0,Great shirt and my sone loved it for christmas
5.0,"It Feel so sofe and warm, and the botton not Scratching the baby face than zipper"
5.0,"not too thin or thick , these are great. very cute Kept some and gave two pairs as a gift. Love! highly recommend."
5.0,"These are the best fitting, most comfy workout pants I own. I get compliments all the time and people ask where i got them. Highly recommend!"
5.0,This product is a gift for someone.
5.0,nice fit very comfortable
5.0,What I like about the produce is that it fits.  I ordered it a bit oversized because I believe due to the material that it will continue to shrink.  Be prepared for the material to pill when you wash it.  I washed mine inside out because of this expectation.  It could have been made a little thicker because of the associated cost but overall it gets a C minus on the scale.
5.0,It had a bunch of little holes in it & I didn't like that
5.0,"This is a nice little quality piece. I especially like how the micropave set rhinestones sparkle. Doesn‚Äôt look cheap. I‚Äôve been wearing it for about 2 weeks now with no issues. Very comfortable to wear that you hardly notice it‚Äôs there. My body‚Äôs PH often discolors and turns my fashion jewelry, especially if it‚Äôs made with any kind of copper in it. I‚Äôve even showered with it on (although I do not recommend it) just to see how well it would hold up. So far this piece has held up nicely. Definitely a fair price for quality."
5.0,My hubby absolutely loves this brand.  Very comfy and they need no break in .... Comfortable fit from day one
5.0,It's cool for summer wear
5.0,"These are the ones you‚Äôll reach for when you come home from a hard days work!  They also look nice enough to go shopping or anywhere else in public.  Love them, will probably buy more."
5.0,Thought it was not going to be as cute as it is.
5.0,My favorite thing I've bought on this site. I wear it all the time. The locket stays tightly closed and never opens on its own
5.0,These are by far the BEST touch screen gloves that I have found!  Ordered a second pair! Not real thick yet still warm enough for cool weather.
5.0,"It does not look like it does on the model, and it exposes everything underneath. Definitely not made to walk around the resort with if you don‚Äôt have shorts on."
5.0,He needed leather non-dress gloves and he keeps saying how much he likes them.
5.0,I already left a review- They're just fine & the price was right.
5.0,"Pretty expensive, but beautiful quality and workmanship.  Pleasure to do business with this company.  Good service and good customer service"
5.0,"Can‚Äôt beat warm toes in the OR. Wife places socks in the Amazon buggy, I buy it and surprise her with ‚Äúlook what I bought you honey‚Äù these will keep your toes warm in the OR!"
5.0,"I love these Ryka shoes.  I purchased my usual 8 W; they fit well, are comfy and lightweight.  The colors, turquoise with lime trim, are so cute and fresh for summer wear.  Ryka is my fave brand."
5.0,Best fitting glasses I've ever had
5.0,"Fantastic night driving glasses, the best we have ever found. Really knock down approaching vehicles headlights glare.we feel much safer at night now."
5.0,I purchased these as a gift for my friends birthday and she absolutely was in love with them. They fit perfectly and the style was dead on.
5.0,Great gift idea for a Lakers fan!
5.0,Its just Perfect. my head is kinda big so this hat fit perfectly. just the way I like it. Its a little bigger than my head so its not tight on me. The hat is tall enough and has perfect color. JUST LOVE IT
5.0,This is one of my favorite shirts ever!!!!
5.0,"Great quality, great price and I'm impressed!  I bought this for a teenager and she absolutely LOVES it!  A simple design for a simple girl -- she's not into flashy, glitzy jewelry.  She's worn this necklace almost everyday since she received it (about 8 months now) and it has held up perfectly!  Still very surprised by the durability of the chain - A++++!"
5.0,"Love this dress! I haven‚Äôt got to wear it out yet, but it is so cute. I love the detailing and the lace on the back! I got the color green and it is gorgeous. The zipper does get caught where the material changes though. So I put a little lotion on it and it zipped right up. I purchased for elegant night on an upcoming Alaskan cruise! Can‚Äôt wait to wearing it! Definitely recommend!"
5.0,"The pendant is pretty, looks very nice."
5.0,"I just got this today and had to write a review. Sorry I didn't take a picture! I have the body type that can be hard to shop for. I'm 5 '4"", about 116, but larger up top and not too slim in the middle. I got the small in black and it fits so well and is so flattering! The cut by the shoulders is totally unique and different than any other cold shoulder top I own. It looks really good and even elegant, like you could wear it out with a skirt for a nice evening. I'm buying two more, another in black and one in navy."
5.0,Gift for my son. He loves it!
5.0,"I LOVE them!! They are so light and fit perfect. I went back online and saw all the options, wish I had ordered more of these than the other glasses I got. Who knew there were so many types of woods. I just can't tell you how much I love them I'm a lifelong customer"
5.0,It's great and look fantastic on me. Thank you.i
5.0,So comfy and fit great ! Love it
5.0,Perfect gift for my wife. I love lion king and she loves hearts.
5.0,"High quality RFID travel belt. Holds passport, large smartphone, money, and cards securely. The belt is very light. Zippers are simple to use while the belt is on. And the clear front window makes use of the phone easy, once the securing clip is popped."
5.0,"Very pretty, little larger than thought. If my mom was still with us she would love.<br />I will give as gift to someone who loves hummingbirds!"
5.0,"The color is right, comfort is good, and they are comfortable as well."
5.0,Sounds good and  easy to connect
5.0,Great for teachers gift good quality
5.0,Refreshing smell and leaves your skin so soft
5.0,i got this at very discounted price which is $2.99 it would nice to have more  i leave this my honest message and no bias .
5.0,Perfect for dishes and cleaning :)
5.0,I‚Äôm 118 lbs and 5‚Äô7‚Äù and order a size 4. I got tailored a bit so it would fit on my waist and and add a little more fabric under it so it would puff up and it looked amazing! Loved the dress...
5.0,"I love this underwear so much for my 5 year old son. I purchased these last year and I've been so impressed at the quality and how well it holds up with multiple washes. The material is soft and there's no itchy waistband. My son has grown, of course, so I came back to get some more undies in the next size up. There were a lot of reviewers mentioning the sizing and how they run big. I didn't notice this last time so I was worried their sizing changed, but figured worse case he could grow into them and I could order more in a smaller size if they were too big. They looked big when I first received them, but after one wash they shrank slightly (not a ton). He's a size 6 so I purchased the 6/7. They fit him perfectly. I'm so grateful I stumbled upon this brand last year because they are now my go-to undies for him."
5.0,A coverup that is lightweight and lovely
5.0,"I bought this bracelet as a gift for Mother's Day as she always referred to her grandchildren (she has 3) as her bunnies. When she saw it, she instantly knew the connection and began to cry. She wears it every day.<br /><br />I ordered this item on a Thurday and had it by Sunday., which was absolutely perfect."
5.0,Great alternative to buying the OEM.
5.0,My grandson loves this and it fits as expected.
5.0,I love unique accessories! If you're looking for a watch that draws enough attention to be a conversation starter...this is it!
5.0,It's two sided....you can wear it either side. It was priced well. The colored side is bright smokey topaz colors the other side a filigree design. I love it.
5.0,Cute and stylish...love them!
5.0,I love is cute! üòç
5.0,A mi hijo le qued√≥ perfecto
5.0,I love this holder for my daughter‚Äôs bows. It looks great on the wall and is a good size. I haven‚Äôt even filled it all the way with bows yet.
5.0,"I bought these for my all animal loving daughter so she could switch out her earrings, but more because her ears can't handle the cheap earrings. Her ears are doing great with these, not reacting at all and she loves them so much!"
5.0,Totally Comfortable
5.0,My son loves this. Well made.
5.0,"Looks just like the picture. Comes in two pieces, that you tie & wrap together. Looks good on me, but disclaimer- I have implants. This top won‚Äôt offer you any support, so you may need a stick on bra or boob tape. But the shape gives a nice cleavage effect that I‚Äôm happy with."
5.0,My daughter was excited about the necklace! Highly recommend
5.0,"Stretchy and flouncy, it's definitely fun to wear. It is very comfortable and accentuates the hips without showing every ripple you may have."
5.0,Very nice & well made but far too large for me.  Did not realize it was a PLUS size & cannot find regular size.  Beautiful print but I gave it away to a friend much taller & different frame.  Wish they had this in regular size available it‚Äôs a beautiful print & would buy again
5.0,Super comfortable.. soft fabric.. fits great
5.0,Good buey
5.0,I love this strap!! So comfortable and it makes my watch look feminine and sporty. Very affordable .. Fast ship!
5.0,i wore this on new years eve for a more vintage yet pretty look and i was so in love with the style and the detailing and the fabric was soft and stretchy. definitely recommend
5.0,Aretes est√°n muy bonitos mi hija sufre de que sus orejas no cualquiera arete le queda porque le causa da√±o en sus orejas y estos aretes que compr√© desde el primer d√≠a que se los puse le encantaron ya tiene un mes con ellos y no se los he quitado los recomiendo
5.0,SOOO cute! Love this top!
5.0,The happiness of the 16 who received it
5.0,"So soft and cuddly! Exactly what I wanted.  Runs slightly large, especially sleeve length, but absolutely love it!!"
5.0,"These gloves are butter-soft, warm, and comfortable.  They look great--the button detail is very attractive.  I have very large hands for a woman (think Seinfeld's ""Man Hands"" episode)-- I bought the XL and they fit well.  I thought the cost was very reasonable for this quality.  Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"This is a beautiful, sturdy and stylish bag. Classy but yet casual. Well made and just the right size for all the essentials with some room to spare. Seemed a bit stiff at first but after a week it has relaxed a bit. The leather has a nice texture and it doesn't seem that it will scratch easily which Is great because I hate it when my purses get raggedy. For $200 this was an investment for me but I am thrilled with the look and quality. No more cheap purses for me. Thank u Ralph Lauren!"
5.0,"Make sure to order a size up.  Cuter in person. Love these sweaters, perfect for the holidays."
5.0,Very good fit and warm!
5.0,"It was for a gift, she loves her sail moon t shirt. Best and fast"
5.0,"This is the first bathing suit I‚Äôve bought that isn‚Äôt right in the hips/bottom opening. Many other suits cut you off there, creating a bulge, but this one is super flattering. I‚Äôm tall and pear shaped, but this worked well for my shape. Not great for a long torso, but if you order up it‚Äôs an OK length. Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, seem pretty sturdy, fit well."
5.0,Very nice. Wife was very happy.
5.0,"This dress fits my daughter-in-law perfectly -- she's a perfect 'M' but tall so it fits her above knee.  It has an attractive empire waist (slimming).  The dress I got is a polyester mix fabric, as opposed to all 'cotton'."
5.0,"Great crossbody bag, good quality and detail for the price! The gold accents haven‚Äôt tarnished after months of use!"
5.0,Awesome find!
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how SOFT this sweatshirt is! I was a little worried that it would not be very warm, but it has been the perfect addition to my outfit for these cool spring nights in the mountains. I really love how soft the interior is, and the exterior is silky smooth and so comfy. The colors are very vibrant and have held up to washing so far. This is a little thinner than your average sweatshirt, but actually keeps me just as warm! I also love the pocket for additional storage - a must for a busy mom of toddlers who inadvertently ends up with all sorts of random collections by the end of the day! I also LOVE that this is more stain-resistant than other sweatshirts that I have. It fits just as expected, running slightly on the small side. Overall I would recommend this sweatshirt. I will update my review after I have had it for a while."
5.0,"I'm female 110lbs 5'2, I purchased xxxl men size just because I wanted something that would hug me like a blanket, this exceeded my expectations on a faux fur coat. Its soooo soft and falls around me just right, love the ears. I got the coat in black."
5.0,"Fits very well with the adjustable ear loops and soft. I like the image of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" imprint on the mask! And it is washable!"
5.0,"Socks are long enough to fit over longer and bigger legs.  They provide firm compression (15mm Hg), grasp the leg firmly all day and are not prone to drooping, even with moderate activity.  Can take repeated washings without losing compressive value."
5.0,It covers well but is light enough for hot summer days. This is my favorite dog-walking outfit because of the pockets for holding waste bags and a flashlight for night time walks. It also launders and dries easily without any wrinkles. Might just by a couple more!
5.0,I would buy them in other colors.
5.0,These pants are my favorite! Fits nice for my shape and for tall people. Well made. Very happy customer!
5.0,"Practico, lindo y muy c√≥modo"
5.0,This dress fit perfectly and made me feel classy and sexy. I did pin the split as it does go up to the panty line. Other than that the dress was perfect for my graduation and I plan to wear it to a wedding next month.
5.0,I would buy from this seller again. I love the way it looks and fits. Very good quality just as advertised.
5.0,Awesome I ordered this from my five year old obsessed Pennywise fan and thinking of ordering one for myself as well yes I'll be that Mom rocking the crazy Pennywise hat a lot of it shipping time was no time at all it came with Indies not even I think it came overnight as a matter of fact excellent I would definitely order from them again totally satisfied customer
5.0,"These are super soft and very warm, so necessary during this winter we have been having!"
5.0,Saw this on Amazon by chance and got it for my son for Xmas. He never even knew they existed - and it‚Äôs his favorite and most used Xmas present this year. He likes to make TikTok videos with it.
5.0,"This is a very nice, stylish and classy looking key ring.  It even came in a classy looking case."
5.0,"Quality lights for the price. All 40 worked. Since I divided them amongst my two kids stockings for Christmas, I was pleased to find that they evenly divided the colors up so each kid got an equal amount. A big deal with two competitive kids worried about &#34;fair&#34;. They made for a memorable Christmas morning light show. Excellent Value, really for any occasion!"
5.0,These are some pretty iridescent earrings.  I purchased the blue and gold earrings. The two tone blue is a nice combination.  The gold earrings really sparkle.
5.0,"I always believed that I was a good packer, but these cubes make me an excellent packer! I used these cubes during a recent cruise. Not only did the cubes allowed me to efficiently pack my items, but the bonus came from the use on the cruise. Space was a premium in the stateroom. I was so happy to have my things organized in the cubes. I just place the cube on the shelves - no need for drawer space. The cubes stacked nicely and the pretty red color was pleasant.<br /><br />I only used the cubes once, so far. But the quality appears to be sufficient for multiple uses for a long period of time. I glad I purchased these cubes."
5.0,Lovely and soft! Bridesmaids loved the dresses.
5.0,"I ordered this cute tee 3/5/2017 and it was delivered 3/21/2017.  For the low price I paid, I was not expecting such great quality! The shirt is made of a high quality stretch fabric that has a nice brushed feel to it. It is a fitted style so if you want it to be a bit roomy you should consider ordering a size up. Over all this is a great product, better than pictured, and well worth the price! I highly recommend."
5.0,"I was trying to give my watch a make over and wanted to try something different compared to the usual silicon bands. I‚Äôm glad with my purchase, the first thing that I look for is the click noise that the watch strap is supposed to make when install a strap and it did meet my expectations. The other thing I love about this product is the two loops for the strap to loop into. Other products come with only 1 , but I feel 2 are essential when it‚Äôs leather so that it fits snugly.<br />If this is your first time trying leather my recommendation is treat it like a leather belt or a shoe, the first couple of days I felt uneasy but it‚Äôs just breaking into it and now I feel very comfortable and it goes great with all outfits."
5.0,I have a fairly large chest and this fit perfect still fitted enough in waist to look good but not super tight so show my mom belly ( I‚Äôm working on) wearing to supercross with jeans or leggings and it will work out perfect. Will try and post a picture later
5.0,"Honestly, I don't care how long they last - they come in a 3-pack. The most important thing is not only can I see, but these glasses fit my wide head!"
5.0,This is a nice bra. The only one my daughter will wear. I've purchased many from W-Shoppy; an awesome company to do business with:)
5.0,"Amazing shirt, nothing else needs to be said"
5.0,These headbands are my favorite brand. They are super cute and can be worn casually or while working out. They definitely keep my ears warm! They are nicely cushioned without looking too thick like bulky winterwear can oftentimes appear.
5.0,spacious fittimg
5.0,They are perfect I love the diffence faces. I don't care for the 6 pk only having 4 faced and 2 plain blk ones. Idk if that's the bundle I picked but it's heh. The kitty is my favorite. They do have a imperfection on all the mask one ear band is sewwed in crappy. It hasn't caused any issues yet. So I'm trying not to worry to much if anything I can probably fit it. I'll include a photo of what im talking about.<br /><br />One ear band is a full circle the two ends are sewed to the mask but the other side of the ear is like two pieces of band got sewed together crappyly.
5.0,I feel like a woman
5.0,"I was going to say that it fits my XL frame like a medium.  Well, it is a medium.  Soft, comfortable fabric.  Love the tiedyed color.  Short for me, just covers butt.  Need to order the correct size because I love it except for the small size, lol."
5.0,nice looking and the yellow tint blocks out sunlight really good
5.0,"Larger rim than the other one I had, which is great."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  I typically where an 8 but I got a 9 simply because the tip is pointy and I don‚Äôt like my toes bunched up. The 9 fits perfect and the heel is the perfect height.  I didn‚Äôt want anything to high or uncomfortable.
5.0,Son hermoso buen precio Yego r√°pido y buena calidad los recomiendo
5.0,"Very nice and well made! Room for metal card holder, dollars/change, phone, compact, lip balm, receipts and more. Expands quite a bit. Zippers are well made and sewn strongly. Might cost a bit more than some, non leather clutches but it's very high quality. Super pleased!!"
5.0,"I love this hat, it fits just right and it looks hip and its warm!"
5.0,We gave these out at my daughter's emoji birthday party and they were a hit!
5.0,"These are really cute shorts. The fabric is super soft, and the print is adorable. One caution: they are very short and the fabric is thin enough that they work better inside the house as sleep shorts or as lounge wear than as something to wear outside."
5.0,"Holy Grail of athletic leggings! I have wife hips, have had 3 children, am a little squishy from mid thigh to my navel. I feel supported and smooth in these without feeling pinched or smothered. I'm 5ft6 and 165lbs. The large fit great. The do seem to compress, so a little tight but I think the next size up would have been too loose. I love the placement of the he pocket because they seem to add an extra compression layer to that outer hip saddlebag area. I love the color, and am ordering 2 more. The material is soft, feels cottony, not reflective at all. I haven't worn them out and around my puppy yet but I also think that they wouldn't pick up much pet hair, or lint like some of my leggings seem to attract like magnets. I also think that the seem work is very flattering and somehow accentuates both curvy shapes and less curvy shapes, somehow, like magic. I couldn't be happier with these. If something disappointing happens as far as wear and tear I'll edit my review. But I'm really happy so far."
5.0,Well made. Nice colors. A little pricey but very good quality.
5.0,"Perfect for decoration or a night light. I purchased this light for my 6 year old niece, and she loves it.  The light settings are adjustable to rotate colors, or remain on one color."
5.0,"I bought this as a carry along jacket for those ‚Äúpop up‚Äù showers in the Caribbean! Fit in my purse, without taking it over, and is easy to fold into the pocket and quickly unfold for use. Good purchase!"
5.0,TRUE SIZE.SOFT.
5.0,Looks like the old and fit great
5.0,A little too big but it's great
5.0,beautiful and fun! Thank you for the prompt service.
5.0,"This time when I ordered this hat I received what I wanted. The first time I ordered the hat it was crooked on the bill and I returned the hat for a no problem refund.I waited about a week and ordered the hat again and this is probably now my number one hat.<br />These jersey hats are beautiful and look expensive,you won‚Äôt go wrong."
5.0,"My wife was very skeptical, but after she tried it on with the filter in place she thought it was very comfortable and much less awkward-looking than the mask, so we are quite pleased with the product."
5.0,"I am 5'0, 130 lbs, 34 bust, 29 waist & 37 hips and the small fit me perfect."
5.0,Fits perfect and good movement for padding
5.0,These work well to reduce inflammation from arthritis or overuse of hands/wrists in repetitive motion. I use them and have given to others (including my manicurist) - who are all as suprised as I was to find that they really do work! KEEP ON ALL THE TIME for best effect.
5.0,Bit bigger than I thought but it's good
5.0,This dress really did the trick! I wore it to a farmhouse wedding and received lots of compliments! My fianc√© was quick to tell everyone how inexpensive it was. lol they were proud of me getting such a deal. Oh and they look great paired with my Hunter rain boots!!! Xoxoxo<br />Boogie! Lol
5.0,Haven‚Äôt wore it yet
5.0,"These earrings arrived looking exactly as they were pictured. They are a beautiful deep blue, and the quality is very good. I will definitely order from this person again as this is not the first time I ordered from them, and I have always been very happy with their work!"
5.0,Excellent! Quick delivery and very pleased with the pendant!
5.0,"Perfect condition, authentic."
5.0,I received my dress a day early and honestly was a little scared to try it on. But after much dismay it fit perfectly and is very compfortable! I ordered my size from the sizing chart and it was correct. I love it and can't wait to wear it!
5.0,This is the cutest bow. I love all things Care Bears and baby bling bows are great. This looks so cute on my little girl and I own a ton of baby bling bows.
5.0,"This was such a soft, cuddly robe! My granddaughter loved it and didn‚Äôt want to take it off! Highly recommend!"
5.0,New but quality seems fine.  Exactly what I hoped for
5.0,Me gusta el producto
5.0,"Muy buen producto se ajusta perfecto al reloj, y le da una imagen muy bonita."
5.0,"Purchased for wife for stadium games. She loves it. It has a crossbody strap so she can keep her hands free. Closes with clasp so no worries safety (some tote bags we saw didn't close). Great size, holds wallet, cell phone, sunglasses, without issue. Happy with purchase."
5.0,"These were a gift for my husband. He loves them.<br />I followed the guidelines of sizing down, and that worked out perfectly for him.<br />They also look great!<br />Thank you, Orthofeet!"
5.0,These socks are so adorable. Going to put them in easter baskets
5.0,Just as it appears in photo. Washed several times -  size remains true.
5.0,"Does exactly what it says it will and I can not put on my own bracelets when I'm traveling or I don't want to bother my husband.  And it was cheap, too!"
5.0,They fit well. Love the pockets! And are very attractive
5.0,I was surprised exactly what I want.
5.0,Great ring love it-the comfort fit is very comfortable and it is a good weight
5.0,This is a beautiful and well made tie.
5.0,Live this dress top part is see through but thick enough if you wear a skin color bra you would be fine the great length the only thing is the arms are kinda tight. I orderd the biggest size in the red and the arms seem like an average size stress not an xl but its okay not comfortable but good for pictures.
5.0,I've had them in all week and haven't gotten infected ears. Usually it's when I take earrings in and out but I've been sleeping in them and although the stars are sharp on the edges they haven't stabbed me or anything crazy.
5.0,"Great dress! I wore it to a friend's wedding and was very comfortable. The dress has a good stretch, but keep in mind that it is also very unforgiving and form-fitting. That being said, I would buy it again in more colors."
5.0,Best sunglasses ever! Seriously amazing quality and fast shipping
5.0,Perfect gift slightly larger than I expected but liked the size.
5.0,Ove the results
5.0,"Nice & light, but warm blanket.  Very nice color quality.  I was headed up I-75 North, with this blanket in my car, just about to cross the Michigan border.  My car stalled before I could cross over.  The blanket seemed to have something to do with this, because there is nothing wrong with my car.  After getting into Michigan, finally, this OSU blanket disappeared from my car, nowhere to be found!  After returning home to Cincy, OH, upon entering my family room, I found the blanket in its normal resting spot on my sofa.  I cannot explain it!  Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, but I will leave you to decide which this is."
5.0,Tama√±o y excelente comodidad
5.0,"Large, beautiful, shiny ring! The center stone itself is enormous, but the 2 stones on either side do not disappoint!"
5.0,These earrings are even prettier than in picture.
5.0,"Love the knit fabric, drapes well and they are so comfortable."
5.0,Great fit! So comfortable! So cute! Love these!
5.0,Really nice case for my controller with room for accessories. Love it.
5.0,The necklace is beautiful it long on my 11 year old but not so much on my 12. But my girls love them
5.0,"I love, love, love this watch! I got it for Christmas last year and I am still wearing it. I have accidentally gotten in the shower with it still on twice and it is working just fine. None of the crystals have fallen out and I dont have any scratches on it. This is my favorite watch I have ever purchased."
5.0,Looks perfect under my dress! The slip under the tool prevents it from being itchy. For someone who is not very girly I love the little poof it gives to my dress.
5.0,"This is easily one of the cutest sports bras I own. I love the design on the bra straps and how it is all throughout the straps. Along with being very cute, it is also extremely comfortable, it doesn't feel tight on my chest at all(which is easy for me to have that happen from having a big chest area) allowing me to be able to breath while giving me the support I need. I am very satisfied with the quality of this bra and highly recommend these bras to anyone in need of a cute and comfortable sports bra."
5.0,I‚Äôm obsessed with these. The quality is great for the price and I wore these in the pool and to the beach for 4 days without any show of tarnishing. Will be purchasing more.
5.0,Great cases. Kept my sunglasses safe and secure during a trip halfway around the world‚Ä¶
5.0,"Cute, comfortable, will be buying different colors if this dress"
5.0,i bought this for my nephew's birthday. he loves it and wears it all the time!
5.0,"Hollywood, here I come!!"
5.0,"I did put this is the washer and dryer, and it came out just fine. Cold water and low heat. Have gotten several compliment s. Would order again."
5.0,Top 10 purchase.. Will probably buy another one.
5.0,I got this for my daughter and she wears it all the time! Very beautiful even for dressy occasions!!
5.0,I love the skirts. They are super comfortable and feels good on the skin.  I am 250lbs and purchased a 2xl and its perfect. Will be buying more
5.0,My kid loves it very comfortable and it fits perfect
5.0,Very pleased.  Fit well and nice protection from sun
5.0,My 3 year old loves it although mommy has super bad vision and can‚Äôt see anything on the watch display because it‚Äôs so tiny
5.0,"All three of the same belts, just different colors, are exactly as I had hoped they would be. Very pleased with product. Price point was even better!"
5.0,I really like this romper! I've had a hard time finding one that I really like but this one is cute and comfortable.  If you want it to be a little loose I would size up.  The straps are adjustable so you don't need to worry and it dipping too low but it gives a little extra room for it to be flowy. I also really like that the elastic in the middle is a wide band not just a small line so you can easily pair it with a belt to dress it up.  The material is super soft and could be easy to wear out o just lounging around.
5.0,I get compliments on these all the time! I love them so much the design is great and really well thought out
5.0,"Beautiful dress size, quality , clothing material everything was good."
5.0,"I love these and so do all of my friends!<br />You can actually see well out of them, too!<br />Definitely great if you want to be all 'merican.<br /><br />:)"
5.0,Fit well. I range from 8-10 in size and  I ordered a size 9. They were a little long by an inch or so and I‚Äôm 5 feet tall.  Overall super comfy and a great purchase.
5.0,So flattering on! Love it. Will definitely buy more in different colors.
5.0,Great quality. Fits just right. Very comfortable.
5.0,The Speidel Scrub Watch Replacement Silicone Rubber Band was a more handsomer looking piece than in the photo. Very happy and it's looks even better than the original watch band.
5.0,Got these for my mother and she loves them.
5.0,They're a bit long on me but they're super soft.
5.0,"I received my bracelets in a timely ship and was very pleased with the quality and colors, only 1 I didnt like and I took it to work and sold it quickly. I am ordering 2 more lots and will write another review if these are the same as the first as far as quality and shipping time. For me the shipping isnt as important as the quality. So very pleased with the first purchase."
5.0,Very fun to have a little bling üòä
5.0,"Such an adorable outfit. Really nice fabric, great quality stitching. Top is a little large and fits my toddler like a dress buuuuuut it‚Äôs all really nice. I‚Äôve even washed them and they haven‚Äôt shrunk or discolored. I totally recommend."
5.0,Great coverage in rainy weather as long as the wind is too bad. And a bonus use is in the Summer while mowing the yard or just being outside and needing a simple and effective way to block the sun.
5.0,"Looks great, washes great, feels great.....ordered the black as well"
5.0,"Very cute, but it didn't come with the swirly charms"
5.0,Great watch band. It's very easy to put on and adjust. It shipped with extra pins and a device to help remove links and put the band back together. It's really light weight and takes the look of the watch up a notch!
5.0,One of the best ive come across
5.0,Purchased 1 (size M) to see how it fit and if i liked it.  After wearing it the 1st time I hopped back on-line to order 2 more.  The length is just right and they wash and dry well.
5.0,My wife loves it and wants a purple version now.
5.0,I love it and so does my family
5.0,Item is as described and my husband loves it!  Quick shipping!
5.0,"Great purchase, very pleased"
5.0,Very pretty.  Lots of compliments on these masks. Dressy and comfortable.
5.0,These are great socks.  I have a large foot-shoe size is 13 and these fit OK.  They have non-slip stuff on the sole which works well.  I also got another brand which was way too small.
5.0,These earrings are gorgeous for every day or evening. The fit is great. Easy to take on and off. I love them and am ordering 5 more pairs to give away to friends. I am so glad I ordered them. Thanks!
5.0,"I originally ordered this in pink.  I loved it so much I ordered another one in pink and a third in blue.  These are fantastic tank tops.  They don‚Äôt really have any stretch to them, which surprised me, but they fit so well that it wasn‚Äôt necessary.  The pink tops are a bit see-through, but the blue adds a bit more in the modesty department.  A regular bra is all that is needed (or pasties if that‚Äôs your thing).  Once I‚Äôve gone through my summer clothes that are packed away, I may order a few more of these tanks.  Versatile, comfortable, and economical.  Oh, I‚Äôve washed all of them in the machine on cold, but have decided to drip-dry them just in case.  I like them too much to shrink them on accident."
5.0,Bought it as a date night dress for my wife. The dress was exactly what she wanted and she loved it!
5.0,"I have 3 of these, all are this color... just in case they ever go out of stock... enough said"
5.0,I am giving this a 5 star because I can actually wear them. They are good quality for the price. I have very sensitive skin when it comes to jewelry and I'm going on two weeks without any irritation.
5.0,I wear a 2x and this dress is the perfect fit. Wore all summer long
5.0,"Well made, nice material"
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this suit! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù- 142 lbs 36D and ordered a size 10. I wanted something that I could wear until I lost some lbs- this allows me to adjust how much cleavage I want to show. It‚Äôs supportiveness in the chest area and slims at the tummy. Full coverage in the upper back- hiding my ‚Äúrolls‚Äù. Full bottom coverage as well. The blue color is amazing!
5.0,My son loved this design and the quality is very nice.
5.0,This is a very professional looking jacket and fits perfect
5.0,Well made and washes nicely.  Holds it shape and does not wrinkle.
5.0,"Cardigans are trendy this season, and this one is a great pick if you're looking for a warm and comfortable sweater. Made from acrylic materials, this sweater has look and feel of thick merino wool. The cable pattern is classic, and the fit is slim, with enough room for layering. (I'm an athletic six-two, 172, and the Large fits just right.) Beautiful sweater at great price."
5.0,I was ordering this last minute and I never know what size to buy so I was sooo grateful for the belt loops. If I were to order again I would size down but other than that it‚Äôs perfect!
5.0,This is prettier and also more accurate than I expected
5.0,I purchased four of these tops to wear under tunics and pullover sweaters to wear around the house.  They're really nice and we'll made. The colors are nice and didn't fade or shrink after machine wash.  Recommend them for casual wear. The seller packaged them well
5.0,My husband loves these shorts as they are super comfortable.
5.0,Amazing for  grinchmas we did this year.
5.0,Cute top and true to size
5.0,I simply love this dress. It fit just like it does in the picture. This is my most favorite dress. üòäüëç
5.0,"Nice tie chains. They are sturdier than I expected, and am happy with the look of them"
5.0,Got it as a gift for my little sister. She loved it
5.0,Serves the purpose.  I like having glasses handy and upright.  Good for the cost- hasp with my purchase.
5.0,"It‚Äôs not cheap, but like all First Lite products, the quality is excellent.  Bought this for hunting, but it‚Äôs so nice and so warm it‚Äôs become not only my hunting jacket but my everyday winter coat."
5.0,Perfect summer dress. Bought for a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments. Length was right at the knees Fits as expected. Very satisfied.
5.0,Great at keeping the bee‚Äôs out!
5.0,"Love these earrings! exactly as pictured, really a very pretty pair to have. The rhinestones are small but noticeable, pearls have a pink tinge to them, glad I got them."
5.0,This product is perfect for winter. Perfectly worked when I was cleaning snow. Recommended for people who stay East coast. I suggest the company to add more buttons to the gloves to tighten. Love the product üëå.
5.0,Got this for my 11 year old son to wear with his clown costume on Halloween. He loved it and other people did too. Went well with the costume and stayed on top of his head.
5.0,I original bought this necklace as a gift cause it looked like something my daughter would wear.  I then became a little worried about giving her the necklace after she made the statement that she hated people buying her jewelry for a Christmas present.  It seems they never get something she really likes.  Much to my relief she really did love the necklace and was glad i bought it.  I told her about her statement and how it worried me.  She was happy with it.
5.0,I really like this top. Material is soft and breathable. Goes great with leggings
5.0,"I was surprise when I received my purchase. The photo has four pens, but I only received one pen. My Red Hat Store has these pens for $2.50 each."
5.0,A gift for my father n law . He loved them
5.0,Giving as a gift..
5.0,"These are SO good! I am into slippers and have tried so many. They are soft and comfortable and have a nice sole to go outdoors,  but it is soft enough to wear around the house and feel cozy and not clunky. I am a true size 6 and got the 5.5-6 and they fit perfectly. They are not scratchy anywhere and warm. I could see someone with narrow feet feeling like they are too wide, maybe? The strap with toggle can be adjusted if you want them to be more snug, but they are great for me with it cinched or just left loose. I want to buy another pair in case I can't find them again later. They are that good! And the price makes them even better."
5.0,I have never had a piece of clothing fit so perfectly!  I am so pleased with this dress.  I am 6ft and normally wear a size 14 so I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly and the length is to the floor.  I just ordered another one in a different color.

5.0,Gloves are extremely soft and of a good Spandex quality material. Will keep your hands warm in 30 degree weather and let you use your phone in the process. We used them to ride our road bikes in such weather and trust me in those temperatures your hands will be the least of your problems with these gloves üòÇ
5.0,Super cute and have lasted a while. I got the M and they are a little too big for my face but I think the S would have been too small.
5.0,"It‚Äôs soft, cute and comfortable. My favorite pjs"

5.0,"This is my second pair of Serengeti's. Love the performance - high quality lenses and style.  But you do have to watch the screws at the temples - my last pair after 6 years came loose and the lens fell out.  Repaired, but happened again and lens broke.  But these are so good and the price point is so great I will just need to watch the temples."
5.0,Love it! Great fit for my nephew!

5.0,No dislikes. Good fit
5.0,"Looks great so far, easy to install and super comfortable - I‚Äôll keep you updated on the wear and tear after a few months.  Love the chrome finish. It matches my iPhone XS perfectly. This will be my daily driver for sure."
5.0,I bought this bathing suit on a whim. For the price I figured I had nothing to lose! I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs very flattering in all the right places and doesn‚Äôt ride up. Both my sister in laws loved it and bought it as well. Waiting for the day we all have it on together at the pool!!

5.0,I gave this gift to my daughter she loves them the light any much everything else he has
5.0,I read the reviews before I purchased these for a gift. I'm glad I did as my boyfriend wears a twelve So I purchased the 13/14. I glad I did otherwise I'd be going through the steps of returning them for a bigger size. He LOVES them and it's hard to get him to take them off when we run errands.
5.0,"I rode with these boots for the 1st time at Willow Springs Raceway in +100F heat. The boots were very comfortable and flowed lots of air keeping my feet cool. Build quality looks impressive, only time will tell how they hold up."

5.0,I LOVED THIS NECKLACE. PERFECT STATEMENT FOR ME

5.0,"I absolutely love this blanket! So soft, perfect throw blanket. I wish I could get it in king size for our bed!"
5.0,"Fanatstic fit, not too bulky, are super gripy and keep hands dry! I am just over 6' and wanted cute but functional winter gloves withou having to get men's gloves. I got large in these and they fit perfectly, if not just a tad long in the fingers. These are a outstanding value and I plan on getting another pair. Thank u!"
5.0,"I ended up buying this in multiple colors. Love the fit and pattern. It‚Äôs not one of those sweaters that shed when washed. I also have a dog, and it‚Äôs not sucking up all dog hair like some sweaters."
5.0,I like them.  They fit very well and are comfortable.  I LOVE the pockets!
5.0,"I could not get this over my shoulders/boobs so had to pull it on/up over my hips. Once on however it fits really nicely. I ordered a small - I weigh about 125lbs, 5'4&#34;,  36 C - it does not compress the boobs and keeps bra fat smooth/in as it is cut quite high under the arms but very comfortable. I would certainly recommend it."
5.0,"Bought them for a gift, they are really nice and the cable to attach to luggage is very sturdy."
5.0,"I‚Äôve been wearing and collecting Vuarnet Sunglasses for the past 7 years and have yet to see this particular pair on Vuarnet‚Äôs U.S. or E.U. website or ANY other seller for that matter.<br /><br />The transparent amber frame color and blue polar lynx lens combination are striking and yes, they are authentic Vuarnets (I own the same frame in a different color/ lens combination purchased in Paris at an optical shop on the Champs Elysees). All the characteristics check out:  nylon frame, proper markings and ‚Äúv on ski‚Äù engraved at the top of each lens. Superb quality from Vuarnet as always.<br /><br />I held off purchasing these for well over a year. Should have bought them when they came down to $207 back in the summer.<br /><br />Now I‚Äôm glad I pulled the trigger. Great addition to the collection."
5.0,"These are good quality, super comfortable, and I looovvveee the pockets!!"
5.0,"My wife LOVES it! Soft fabric, and beautiful color... She says it makes her feel &#34;elegant&#34; Fits perfectly..."
5.0,"I wear a size 8+ in most hats, which means that a hat that's size 8 still leaves a red ring on my forehead and a size 8-1/8 sits down around my ears like I'm a kid wearing his dad's hat. This stretcher works great to stretch out a hat just enough to make it comfortable, but there are two small issues:<br /><br />First, you have to stretch it repeatedly. It works great, but eventually the hat goes back to it's old size. This isn't the stretcher's fault, but it's something you should know--if you wear several hats (as I do), you'll be repeatedly stretching each one before you use it. I could see buying several of these and leaving them in each time, but if you have more than a couple hats you're starting to talk a lot of cash.<br /><br />Secondly, it's not quite big enough. The threaded rods are just a little short, so to get a good stretch I have to unwind it all the way out to the point that it starts to come apart. Admittedly, I'm an edge case with my zeppelin-like head, but it's still frustrating.<br /><br />Over all it does what it sets out to do for the majority of people, but could have used just a couple more threads on the rods."
5.0,Love this top.  Very versatile
5.0,"As everyone knows, pants are much more difficult to shop for than shirts. So, I had mixed feelings about ordering these pants on Amazon.  I must say that these pants fit well, feel comfortable and look good. I am most pleased and will not hesitate to order more. Relief!"
5.0,This is my mom‚Äôs favorite mask. She gets compliments all the time.
5.0,"I bought this watch for my son because of the durability of this brand, its quality, he loves his watch, I hope it lasts forever"
5.0,"These glasses are perfect. I can see through them with the same vision as a pair of my prescription glasses. An awesome backup pair.<br /><br />I use a -5.50 in this pair, but my vision is pretty bad. I would go low if you're not sure of the strength you may need."
5.0,"Honestly, I was sceptical given the low price, but these are GREAT for keeping your lower legs warm in the cold winter weather!<br />I imagin I'll be living in these until it warms up in the spring."
5.0,"I learned if you wrap scotch tape with the sticky side out around one finger that you can peel back the protector and use the sticky side of the scotch tape to remove the little specks of dust stuck to the screen protector, unfortunately I went through a couple screen protectors before I found this trick"
5.0,Capezio is a reliable brand and the material is high quality. The fit is comfortable and ideal for the colder months of ballet.
5.0,"My eyes are very light sensitive (after cataract surgery).  Driving at night is much easier with these glasses. Better yet is driving on a cloudy day when there is a lot of glare. These glasses make everything clear, but reduce  glare perfectly."
5.0,Fun socks for dad!
5.0,Very nice and comfortable. Very well made. Adjustable fit. Fits well. Highly recommend
5.0,"Very soft material, true to size. My boyfriend loved it!"
5.0,its a little small but i like the overall material and quality. It breathes just right and it doesn't show the skin when fully stretched or expanded. Would recommend and buy more of this!
5.0,Fit is great and high quality
5.0,Great product<br />Great seller<br />Will repeat business<br />Thank you!
5.0,Small delicate chain.  Overall a nice piece.

5.0,Very very nice gloves. Wished I would have bought more than 1 pair
5.0,Surprisingly nice...very happy with it..would be great for a cruise or fun classy beach party!
5.0,"WOW! This jacket is so much nicer than I expected!  It's lightweight, yet warm; very soft & comfy, inside and out.  It's a tighter knit than a generic sweatshirt - more like a fleece blanket."
5.0,"I use them for finished cross stitch projects, to mark the year I completed them. I paint them with clear finger nail polish before securing them on my projects"
5.0,"Last spring I kept holding my umbrella over my backpack because I was worried about my laptop getting wet. This year I won't have that worry! This hiking umbrella hooks right to my backpack and covers both me and my backpack so whether I'm hiking across campus or hiking in the forest, I'm covered."
5.0,Great!!!üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
5.0,"I love these boots! Every weekend I go listen to live bands and dance.  These are very comfortable to dance in. And the best part is they look great with all my Royal Bones, Jawbreaker and Hellbunny apparel!"
5.0,The  purse in nice
5.0,The jacket was a bit heavier than expected. I am very pleased with the quality and fit.
5.0,Awesome colors. Better than others expected.
5.0,"I received the wallet today. This wallet is rather large. But it can represent a clutch instead. It isn‚Äôt leather. Which I love. If you are a vegetarian or vegan it‚Äôs perfect. Love the color!! It actually holds all of my credit cards, insurance cards and rewards cards. This is the first wallet that actually held all of them without being so bulky that it wouldn‚Äôt close."
5.0,"Gorgeous, thick, fasceted and well made. Lots of blue fire flash.  I love it. Just what I eanted."
5.0,I love the way the jogging suits fits perfect I had to order a size up but it's comfortable
5.0,got several of these for the ladies on my list - they'll b pleased!
5.0,Perfect size for a backpack purse. Good amount of pockets and slots to keep organized. The only thing i dont like is that when you adjust the straps. They tend to flop around. I kind of wish there was like a little strap slide to kind of keep it secure and close to the body as opposed to Hanging loose if you need to adjust it at all.
5.0,The golden color makes it beautiful with the straps.
5.0,"Great product. This product does fit big, which is nice for someone with big good like me. This product was better than I expected.  The seller made sure the package was shipped on time and packaged neatly."
5.0,"Bought my husband his first pair in Cambria, he absolutely loves them! Will have to start a collection for him. Love that they‚Äôre made in the US as well."
5.0,"This jeans are seriously everything! I ordered the Girlfriend ultra light and they look very close to what you see advertised. I absolutely love the fit. I‚Äôve paid much more for Eunina jeans and can honestly tell you they are a higher end boutique brand that‚Äôs good quality. These have little stretch to them. So I do suggest that you pay attention to the sellers size chart found up by the photos. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô tall, weigh 133ish and normally wear a size 4 or 7/27. Because girlfriend jeans are meant to fit loose for the most part, I sized down according to the size chart to a size 3. Which is generally my size for my preferred fit in mom jeans or girlfriend and they‚Äôre perfect. I did follow the size chart though. Just pay attention as the others listed by this seller are quite different. I‚Äôll be ordering another pair in the future and by the chart shown I‚Äôll order my regular size for the pair I have my eyes on. I chose to roll these twice and they hit just above my ankle. The waist hits just about at my belly button. While a straight fit throughout my legs, by sizing down I was able to achieve a fairly snug fit through my waist and bottom. Love the look of these, the wash is perfect with the distressing and the holes line up as they should. As with most of my overly distressed jeans I will wash on delicate cold cycle and hang dry. Putting them in the dryer once dry only to soften and relax them a bit.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend these. The seller shipped promptly and they arrived wrapped appropriately. I hope my review has helped someone. I personally rely heavily on reviews myself so if I‚Äôve helped, please click below and let me know. Should you have questions, you can post them above in the appropriate area. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and in the mean time Happy Shopping!<br /><br />Miss Kelly"

5.0,My granddaughters love the hats good fit for kids but not for adults.

5.0,"I love everything about this dress! The fabric is really nice, it's not super tight, and it looks really cute on. I'm 5'4&#34; 130 pounds and the medium fits great! It is a little short so it would be very short on someone tall."
5.0,Product as listed‚Ä¶thank you
5.0,Why is this thing so cheap?! This ring is amazing and looks high quality. Maybe you should charge people more. Don't gouge us though.
5.0,I love these earrings. I will order more!
5.0,"Loved the casual look. Fit is great. Comfortable. Washes well. ***Disclaimer: I hang all my clothing to dry, so I cannot confirm if this item would shink if put in a dryer***"
5.0,"The dress is very elegant and fit perfectly, price was good. Don't forget to take your measurements before buying."
5.0,love it not enough space but still love it. already got compliments from it.
5.0,"Works good , when you use it"
5.0,"Super cute. Colors are brighter than the picture (they look as you'd expect superman colors to be). Fit perfect. A tad bulky, my toddler has to kinda spread his feet when he walks, but they are plush shoes so that's expected. Cute shoes."
5.0,Bought this for a geocache I'm making. Looks realistic in this side view skeleton head I've made.
5.0,"I love the longer length, they sit right above my knee, I'm 5' 5&#34;.  These are very high waisted and have a drawstring on the front.  I didn't find that I needed the drawstring tight to keep the shorts up, they are a nice snug fit with an elastic above the drawstring, perfect for working out or over a swimsuit for thigh coverage.  I also like wearing them around the house when just cleaning since they are quite comfortable.  They are a stretchy material.  I got the grey and they look the same color as pictured."
5.0,Thank you for such a pretty bracelet I'm enjoying it so much that I told some friends about it.
5.0,"I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I love this lingerie!  It is super sexy and fits amazingly!  I am 5'7&quot; and 126 lbs and usually wear a size small in womens clothing and lingerie and so I ordered a size small in this and it fits perfectly!  I love it so much, I am wanting more!  My husband loves it as well.  It fits amazing and feels amazing.  It is also made of such good material so it is very good quality.  Very worth the money!  I love the rhinestones on the clasps!!!!"
5.0,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.
5.0,Excellent! I love it!
5.0,Ordered 1 size larger to get good fit but nice shirt. Good buy.

5.0,Its is absolutely beautiful great for spring summer and fall...light weight very feminine
5.0,its the best
5.0,"It is very vintage 90s mom style pants. I love it so much. It's hard to find good, thick quality denim jeans for a good price thats slim fitting. I am 5'8 and 115lbs. I am slim and tall and most stores only sell skinny jeans or jeggings that are overpriced and I hate it. Most jeans are tight on the waist but because I am not thick on the legs, they are so baggy it looks like a skirt. These are good quality and high waisted heaven. LOVE IT"
5.0,Fit right and I love it!
5.0,Wife loves it. Fit perfect.
5.0,"I purchased these for a cruise to Alaska in June. They fit perfect, comfortable and look really nice, and will buy again if I need more. They arrived on time, and very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,They look just like the picture online and fit great around my two large pieces of luggage.  Sometimes I have them packed so full it‚Äôs hard to zip them closed.  Now I won‚Äôt have to worry about them bursting open as the baggage handlers toss them around.
5.0,I LOVE this shirt!!  The quality of the fabric and workmanship was very impressive! I will be ordering from this company in the future.
5.0,Arrived quickly and intact. Plastic is well made and a good buy.
5.0,Lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones.
5.0,"Absolutely love these boots. Have them for 4 days and I got so many compliments I seriously can't believe it.<br />The fit is a bit on the small size. They are warm and nice thread. Perfect for Seattle weather.<br />Having a bit of an issue with the zipper on the left boot, fingers crossed in won't die."
5.0,Very confortable for my 7 month old.
5.0,I use as a project bag. Can see what‚Äôs in it. Love it!
5.0,Very comfortable. Fits well on the wrist. I wear to work as well as an every day watch.
5.0,Lovely earrings and good quality.  Made a great gift!
5.0,"From reading the other reviews I knew to order a size large (I'm 5'3&#34; and 130 lbs). The large fit perfectly!!! Love this outfit, and what a bargain :)"
5.0,Great gloves. Warm and cozy (but not water-resistant at all) and easy for my 4 yr old to get on himself.
5.0,"So soft, so comfy, love them!! 5'8 130 lbs ordered both medium and large. Both fit great. Large is longer a little baggier."
5.0,Comfortable and ease of sliding into show to walk out the door without lacing and a shoe horn.
5.0,"You give me a v-neck long sleeve anything and I'm happy.  You give it to me in white, add any detail to make it look like something other than the same old t-shirt, AND make it super comfy and I'm blabbing about it to anyone who wants to know.  So, you get all of that in this shirt, but you also get a shirt that holds its shape (no shrinkage, no twisting fabric or seams), doesn't pill, and is seemingly impervious to most stains.  It's a polyester/spandex/cotton blend and in the pics it has been washed 7 times already and still looks amazing.  It's lightweight, like you could wear it in summer and not be uncomfortable.  I keep items this fabric weight in my wardrobe year round because I layer.  We have 4 seasons here, and it's not uncommon to go through three of them in a single day, so layers are basically life.  I really like the twist front detail.  I've got a bit of a belly going on, so I feel like it hits me kind of higher than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm also 5'9""ish so it probably sits lower on most women.  The fabric is not completely opaque.  I think in the pictures you can see where the waistband of my leggings ends under the shirt.  So yes, you can see darker fabrics underneath it.  I'm wearing a white bra under it in the pictures and I tried to take them in direct light so you could judge the ""see-throughability"" of the fabric.  I think that covers pretty much everything with this one, why it gets plenty of repeat wear & a definite 5 stars."
5.0,"This dress is light weight and very feminine.  I got lots of compliments when I wore it to a gathering.  I ordered the medium and I am 5'4"" and 131 lbs."
5.0,Fast shipping. Clean stitching. Cheap leather compared to other wallets.
5.0,My son is very picky about his shoes.  He loved the style and most of all he said they were very comfortable.  Like walking on pillows
5.0,"Great piece, that fits well and keeps me warm,but is easy to take off and carry."
5.0,"They are the perfect size, just as I expected, fast delivery."
5.0,Beautiful!! A set for every outfit..
5.0,"This is a great peice for layering, the long sleeves and thumbholes are super cozy, and the fit& flare shape is flattering (if you choose a size that is not over-large for your frame, as modeled in product photo). I wear a size 18-20 and the XXL fits on my bust, but is loose elsewhere. The fabric may not hold up so well, but for now, i love it!"
5.0,"great socks, worth the money."
5.0,"Gave these as a gift to my mom and mother in law for my wedding. We all had different shades of the robe. I was nervous it might be too small, but it worked out perfectly for them. Really flexible to anyone's shape and size. They still use them at home in the summer."
5.0,"It arrived sooner than expected, and it is gorgeous!! I'm very happy with this purchase. Thank you:-)"
5.0,Very comfortable! I love how this dress has the wrap that makes it more flattering. I want this dress in all colors.
5.0,Package came very quickly and the hood is great in the cold temperatures I walk to class in blizzards sometimes and it keeps my face nice and warm! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality face mask to run in he cold or just to walk from point A to point B.
5.0,"Wow! This vest is awesome! Wore it for a 14 mile run today. Fit well, stayed in place, extra pockets are wonderful and the surprise pony tail holder, loved it!"
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Very easy to put on and very comfortable. He's had DVT in the past and his Dr took him off his blood thinner because of bleeding issues so of course support socks are a must. These got the best reviews so we gave them a try. Not disappointed at all. Thanks Wanderlust!
5.0,Fun watchband
5.0,Es lo que buscaba
5.0,These earrings are very nice and light weight.
5.0,I really like this nightgown. The material is soft & fit is great. This is 5th one I have ordered. I have all colors except purple. They wash well and the oldest gown is still like new..color wise etc. Well made.
5.0,I so Love this dress. Beautiful!!! The material is awesome the fit is awesome and the look is Awesome. I will be ordering another in a different color‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
5.0,Very pretty. My 7 year old thinks its beautiful.
5.0,"Does a great job of keeping my shades from slipping forwards as I run, bike, or hike.  I don't really notice them when I'm moving, but they aren't quite comfortable enough for all-day wear.  Since they just slide on, I usually flip them up when I don't need them.  I look silly, but that's not the fault of the product ;-)"
5.0,I love that these socks actually fit me!  I have very small feet (women's 5.5-6 or youth 3-4).  I ordered the women's small and the heel of these socks is actually on my heel instead of the bac kof my achilles or my ankle.
5.0,"I love everything about this shoe, especially the straps that make it easy to adjust them"
5.0,"I‚Äôve been working my tail off trying to get in peak physical condition for myself. These T‚Äôs are slim fit and highlight the arms, shoulders and chest I‚Äôve been working so hard on. I also have them in black and they have the same amazing fit!"
5.0,"This bag is exactly what I was looking for - comes as described and much better in person than in photos. Love the zippered pockets, the roomy bottom and two lengths of straps. Quality stitching and zippers, along with attractive black waterproof material and brown embellishments make for a conservatively stylish, everyday bag that can go from work to evening to weekend ! I am ordering at second one at the 14.99 price, because I think this hidden gem won't last long and this is already my favorite bag!"
5.0,"Well this happened to look like our cat. THe last thing my child needed was another sweater, right? BUt she loves it! IT is super soft, cute and washes easily."
5.0,"If you're like me, you hate paying for a shirt that advertises something. The only thing this will advertise is how big your guns are (or how much work you need to do). That's fine by me."
5.0,Beautiful dress!!! Beutiful color!!!
5.0,Help with foot pain
5.0,Love very beautiful colors.
5.0,"This was a gift for my mother, she loves them.  They are so soft she wears them with or without shoes, mostly inside the house without shoes, BUT both with shoes or without they still are comfortable."
5.0,I am very happy with the product however I ordered 19 and received 18.
5.0,"For the price for two pairs of glasses you can't go wrong. They seem to be holding up quite well, I am very happy with the quality for the cost."
5.0,I loved it. I was looking for it everywhere but I found it here and I had to get it. Thank you.
5.0,Perfect for a little ones costume closet
5.0,Was really happy when I opened the box and got the hat. Very nice hat for the money. Looks sharp. To me it's a summer time hat or everyday warm weather hat. Very please.

5.0,"They are comfortable for running, and hold up pretty well."
5.0,I love this dress. I received so many compliments from both men and women.
5.0,This dress is AMAZING. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 150 lbs and got a medium. It was perfect. I also have SUPER long legs and the dress still went all the way to my knees. The sides of the hem are slightly above but the front and back are longer. The material is light and flowy and the neckline isn‚Äôt too wide. I hope I can eat more soon!
5.0,Works great- comes with so many that I dont feel bad when we lose them with every use.  Cute colors!
5.0,this is good but will be ordering more
5.0,"I love the magnetic closure, it allows the Fitbit to rest comfortably on your wrist. Getting lots of compliments on the color!  Would buy again."
5.0,This is such a pretty bracelet the flowers are so adorable. My daughter fell in love the moment she seen it which was just what I wanted. The shimmer and shine of the crystals is so nice and goes so well with the silver. The flowers are so unique and beautiful I am so impressed.<br />The clasp is nice and sturdy and very easy to use. It fits well and looks lovely. The settings are so nice and tight no worries of a stone coming loose for me. This is an excellent bracelet that I am so glad I was able to get. It can be worn anytime and look lovely on. This is one of my favorite new bracelets that I been able to get in a while. I will have to order myself one also. I am so glad I was able to get something so pretty it's an excellent bracelet<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.

5.0,"Fit is awesome, it's warm too"

5.0,it is excellent in quality and arrived within 2 days of order...We are using it for our annual Halloween Party..I would recommend this cloak
5.0,"I have tried other money clips, and most cannot handle the change in wallet fullness. Typically the clip is either too tight and you can't fit money in it, or after you have filled it once, it can't get tight enough to handle less bills.<br /><br />This money clip adjusts nicely to any amount of bills, and flips up to make it easier to add and remove bills. Is only about half the bulkiness of my old wallet, and has made a huge reduction in hip soreness from sitting on my wallet."
5.0,I brought this dress for my daughter to wear to her aunts wedding and it was a perfect fit.
5.0,"Good quality! I was expecting something different and I got impressed! I bought it because I have back pain and I can't use satchel and shoulder bags anymore. This backpack goes well with everything and I pretty much use it every day now. My back doesn't hurt anymore (this is not an ergonomic backpack or anything like that, but it definitely helped me) and I can tell it's sturdy and it will last a few years (I hope!)."
5.0,"Arrived quick, exactly as describe.  Wish I would of ordered more. Smooth and soft. Works well with pm2.5 filters thxs!"
5.0,"My pup, in the attached photo looks fantastic with the jewels"

5.0,Thank you. Product arrived as scheduled and was exactly as advertised. :)
5.0,"I bought this for a friend for his Birthday,it seems to look and fit very nice."
5.0,These are well made and work well for those wet or muddy days.

5.0,Ought this for my toddler daughters first ballet recital. Worked perfectly. Fit was spot on
5.0,This dress is beautiful and the material is really soft. Fits as expected.
5.0,"Took a day to break them in, but after that they're very comfortable, provide great stability and support, and light cleats for both grass and turf! It's low cut so they are prone to ankle injuries."
5.0,Soft and as described. Not too big.
5.0,"I had no problem with this purchase and when I got them, my daughter was very pleased with them.  She will look like a princess on my wedding and she's very happy."

5.0,Great nose ring fast delivery
5.0,[[VIDEOID:6e830530922ef0dc54fdd7e8efdaa87f]] Wow! Love it! Not a mask wearer since the beginning of all this comic craziness but in WI most stores are now requiring them. In my protest I found this lovely face covering. Its made of stretchy mesh with no fabric barrier you can breath through. I wore it to one store and got stopped 8 times to so people could say how beautiful it is. We are also being made to wear them at work and several people I work with have purchased this since I started wearing mine.
5.0,"I bought these for a 6 year old.  She has a big foot, and her size 2 was not available, so i got her a 3.  When they arrived, she was ecstatic!  She very much recognized the emoji on the shoe.  It looked like they were going to be too big, but her lil fat foot fit, with some room to grow into.  She said they were soooo soft and comfy.  Happy kid!"
5.0,"The colors are vibrant, the fabric is soft, it's top quality.  Very nice shirt."
5.0,This shirt doesn't show that I'm overweight and that's really nice.

5.0,I love this dress.  It is very flattering.
5.0,"It has high elasticity breathable fabric, soft, wrinkle resistance good quality.When exercising, it absorbs sweat quickly and dries it quickly, making sure I don't feel uncomfortable due to sweating.It can give my skin an excellent feeling of comfort no matter where I exercise."
5.0,Very satisfied with my purchase. The pattern and color (dusty blue) is so pretty and unique (I'm picky with my florals too)! The material is thin but doesn't look cheap at all. Sleeves were a bit long on me but I'm fine with rolling them up.
5.0,"They seemed small at first, but as soon as I tried them on, I was in yoga pants heaven. Love the fit."
5.0,I suffer from headaches and staring at a computer all day at work doesn't help at all. I can tell a huge difference with these glasses and never look at my screen without them anymore. Even use them when on my cellphone and tablet. I don't have the eyestrain and I don't get headaches from all of the computer work like before. Love them!
5.0,"This hoodie is perfect!! I ordered a large and the fit is exactly what I expected. It's so soft and warm without feeling bulky. The design is awesome and hasn't faded at all. I get so many people asking me where I got it. If you love Halloween and hoodies, get this!"
5.0,"Love the colors, tassels are super cute. They are slightly bigger than expected but a great statement piece"
5.0,"My daughter love it, she said is very comfortable. She wears it with colorful socks and it looks adorable. (Did not received it on time, but when I contacted the The Scoop, it was sent overnight, no questions asked. Maybe it was lost, I really did not know, but it was a great customer service.)"
5.0,Vibrant colors and good thickness---not flimsy at all.  Love the design.  Recommended item.  I use it at work but will buy another for home and gifts.
5.0,"These bands are great! Very similar to my original Apple band. I have ordered a few others before, they were did not slide and lock on the face of the watch as easily as these ones do. Comfortable during wear. I‚Äôm very please with the purchase and the price!"
5.0,"Bought these for my grandmother & mom last year. They both have health issues with their<br />feet & ankles. The snoozies were so soft, and not binding around their ankles."

5.0,Beautiful medal. Excellent quality
5.0,I get at least 5 compliments a day on these.

5.0,Dad loved it. Looks a higher quality that regular ball caps. Good variation to have for his cap wardrobe.
5.0,I use these for creek walking. Read the reviews first so you know what size to order.<br />I read the reviews and that helped me decide on the size. The size I got was right on.
5.0,They feel great. Nice and thick material def not summer tights

5.0,Good crop top for the price. Compare the quality to tops from Forever 21
5.0,Great value!  Comfortable and great readers.  A++
5.0,Very cute necklace and ear ring set. I wear it with my casual jeans and Yankee t-shirt to get some team pride emulating! Only thing is I'm right handed and to put on the necklace with the charm flipped to the emblem side I have to use my left hand to manipulate the latch which I find awkward. When I get a chance I'm going to try to flip it so I won't have to struggle.
5.0,"Just received them, they look good"
5.0,"Purchased one for my grandaughter and liked it so much, I purchased one for myself. It's dainty, sparkling and comes with a strong box chain!<br /><br />Update: I wore mine for the first time on New Years Eve, then New Years Day and one of the cz's fell out. I hope this doesn't happen to my granddaughters. I plan to return it and I'm unsure if I will reorder until I see how the other one wears."

5.0,"The Valdler Womens Feather Mesh Net Sinamay Fascinator Hat is a perfectly knitted and carries intricate details especially when it comes to the composition of the flower (and artwork) or the different layers. These fine details comprising the hat makes it very pleasing and eye-catchy. The material comprising the hat is composed of fine smooth texture. The hat is well-made, is quite sturdy, and is very light in weight. The colors are very rich and creates a unique Victorian feel to it.<br /><br />These hats are more specially tuned for special occasions and gatherings. They can also  just to be worn for entertainment purposes, and may also be worn for elegant dressing. This hat turned out to be a perfect gift for my sister, who was very surprised when receiving the hat, as she had lost her earlier one. As for her, the hat easily cliped into place, was easy and comfortable to wear, and perfectly matched  the dress she had worn. In all honesty, this hat can be worn with any dress and would perfectly appealing. What makes it very unique, is that the hat does not cover the whole of the head and so it is not very irritating when it comes to wearing it.<br /><br />I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Love the dress fits as described.
5.0,"This is a nice gown. I'm 5'5"" and weight 180 and bought a 3xl and it fits loose and comfortably. It washes well too. I wish it was a little longer, but I always have that problem with gowns. The gown come to a little below mid calf."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and typically wear a small. Followed instructions and ordered a medium. The fit is AMAZING. This jumpsuit is so flattering! I‚Äôve paid more than double for others and this is by far my favorite jumpsuit in my closet. Worth the wait for shipping!! Would bye more if they sold it in other patterns or solids!
5.0,"I like the look of this bracelet for ""blinging"" up  my outfit for a Murder Mystery character I am portraying.  It is not too large  and stretchy though. I have medium sized hands and it stretches over and onto the wrist fine.  I would be concerned if I were a seriously plus sized gal with large hands and wrist.  I am wearing a huge CZ  ""diamond"" ring, long drop pearl and CZ earrings and a very long ""pearl"" necklace.  All from Amazon.  Amazon makes pulling a costume together soooo easy!!!"
5.0,"Lovely! Bought a few more for gifts, and although they are all different, all are beautiful!"
5.0,"This is a thick, soft, 100% cotton sweater.  The fit is great & it washes well.  Shrank a bit in the dryer, but still fit just fine.  You might want to size up"
5.0,"Is just like the picture, but for me was small"
5.0,"Beautiful, Material is made well‚Ä¶ up too sizes"
5.0,love them I get a lot of complements on them would buy again!
5.0,"Arrived today, I should have read the other  reviews on their page. I wear a Levi's 34, Bockle's 34 was too small.. bummer! Sending back for a 36 hopefully it'll work. I love the leather they use, it's great, very soft/pliable (not the hard like cardboard ones, that come from Pakistan you see on other sites) and they look to be well made. Once I get the sizing right, I'll be an even more happy camper!<br />[[ASIN:3999861517 Bockle¬Æ 1991 lace-up leather pants W34/L36]]"
5.0,"Love the blue and gold lettering on this t-shirt. I do think it would be a nice addition to add something to the front of the shirt -- maybe the Greek Deltas over the heart on the front? All in all, a very cute shirt and the lettering on the back is really striking and stands out."
5.0,The product arrived on time and worth the price to represent my frat.
5.0,"I love these gloves, they are super cute and I get many compliments on them."
5.0,"My McQueen fan loves these, and they are adorable on."
5.0,This it runs small I didn't try it on right away so I couldn't return it if I had I would have ordered a size or even two larger.
5.0,Too bad it's not machine washable.
5.0,purchased these boots for husband who works in maintenance for a major construction company. He says they are comfortable and lightweight.

5.0,Great jeans & super comfortable.  I am pleasantly surprised with my purchase
5.0,"great size, color is perfect.  have worn them a number of times now and no discoloration whatsoever has occurred.  i love them"
5.0,"They are very nice, cute and soft inside.  They are a little large for my 7 year old"
5.0,I would recommend this product/case to anybody wanting to keep your glasses organized and nice!
5.0,Another beautiful piece
5.0,I ordered a Large. I'm 5'7 weight 144lbs and I'm 36B. This dress fits perfectly. Previously I had ordered the same dress in blue with polka dots and had to return it the fabric was so cheap and ugly but this dress has more of a satin finish. It can also depend on the seller.
5.0,"This bathrobe really is perfect.  The color is a nice warm pink, the sizing is perfect.  It is so very soft!  Looks very well made.  It is a nice birthday present for my niece and I know she will love lounging in it this winter."
5.0,Heavy-duty and stunningly beautiful! I love these earrings!
5.0,Fit nicely and comfortable.
5.0,"Love these. Too much fun to wear. Fold up flat enough to fit in most of my glasses cases. Well made, good quality and I will order from them again."
5.0,"I received my earrings very quickly in the mail, and I was thrilled with the size, coloring, and craftsmanship. Timberline also included an extra baggy with two earring backs in the package along with a postcard of a map of the southwest that had a little heart from the location & name where the turquoise is mined. I wanted a pair of turquoise to live long-term in my second hole on the lobe, and these are exactly the right size. Happy to support this lovely company."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9fd227d558fc231f4db7fa38a2707021]]
5.0,"I wasnt expecting much from leggings bought blindly online. I prefer trying on clothes in person because everyone knows womens clothing varies wildly from brand to brand. These exceeded my expectations. To be fair, they ARE too small at first but if you stretch the waist a bit to pop the elastic, they'll be far more comfy on your tummy and hips. They are thick, so no see-through worries and they feel like high quality leggings, honestly. I plan on purchasing more in other colors soon!"
5.0,The shirt dress is well made with vibrant colors. It is oversized
5.0,"This dress is extremely soft and comfortable. However the material is a little heavy so I may not wear it very much in the summer.  I purchased the red in a large, my measurements are 34DD- 28-38 and I am 5ft 3in tall. The sleeve length is perfect and the bottom of the dress falls right at my knee cap.  The material is clingy but not so much that it shows every bump and bulge. Hubby said it‚Äôs attractive and tasteful.  I was afraid the red would have more of a faded shade but it is FAR from faded‚Ä¶it is a gorgeous and intense shade of red. It‚Äôs a dress that can be worn to work or date night‚Ä¶with fashion or fine jewelry. I‚Äôm actually thinking of wearing it to my class reunion. I received this item at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"This is awesome! Me and my best friend love wolves, and this is the perfect charm!"
5.0,"Loves this product. The color is not the deep brown as shown in the picture, it's more of a lighter brown"
5.0,"Sturdy and don‚Äôt irritate my skin. This is exactly what I was looking for. With there being more sizes, it was a huge help because different piercings and different ears call for different sizes."
5.0,I bought this for a two week trip to Europe--it folded well and fit in my travel duffle. I was glad to have it on the cold plane and in our various Air BNB's. Very soft and cute pattern--the fabric held up well when I washed it too.
5.0,"Really great Fitbit band! Was a little stiff when I first got it, but after wearing it for awhile it's very nice and sturdy. Not worried about it fraying or the stitching coming undone."
5.0,These were an awesome choice for our 6year old. She loves them and seem durable enough to last.
5.0,"Bought it for volleyball and it's perfect! I love the rubber grips to keep it in place during the entire game. It's also not too tight, so it can be worn for hours without causing a headache."
5.0,Very comfortable....a bit smaller than expected
5.0,"Awesome for the money! Have the option for either a small or thicker buckle. Also has drilled lugs, which make it super easy to install and remove straps. Will definitely be buying again whenever I need an extra buckle."
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for a teenage boy who loves Legos and he loved it! It was exactly what I wanted for him!
5.0,2GoEco Large Reusable Bags are perfect for my needs. I tend to shop at multiple grocery store chains; therefore I prefer generic reusable bag designs. The bags are large enough and strong enough for my shopping style. The three pack of bags are a neutral and attractive design.
5.0,Just what i needed..
5.0,Order it for my daughters banquet. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it would have enough room in the chest but it fit perfectly. It‚Äôs very thin material but lined well enough so it‚Äôs not see through. True to size. Exactly what I pictured when I ordered it.
5.0,"Great quality and look. Love them, great price!!!"
5.0,Love thus pair of sunglasses!!
5.0,Great shirt made very well recommended to anyone looking to buy one
5.0,As the headline says.  It was pretty comfortable from the get go.  I have a PAM 111 with rubber strap and was looking for a more comfortable leather options and decided to gamble on the is one for $20 and give it a try. It's great.  I used the Panerai hardware on this strap and it's good to go and gets more comfortable as time goes on.  I haven't put the rubber one back on since I've had it.
5.0,"Loved the fingerless gloves. Quality was great, very stylish and fit perfect"
5.0,"I like the material of the tank tops and the price for all four is not bad at all. You can wear it alone or layer it with another shirt or add a cardigan. I wear a large and it fits perfect. I‚Äôm 5,3 weigh 155."
5.0,"Love this dress and have received many compliments wearing it. It's a very flattering cut. The pockets are super convenient, and impressively, they don't add bulk at the hips like many dress pockets do. Material isn't super high quality, but it's what I'd expect for the price point. I also like that it's got a high neckline, so no worrying about it being too low cut for certain occasions."
5.0,I like that it is reflective at dusk and dawn and fits well..enough room to put over jacket..
5.0,The tool to remove the links is a bit cheap the pin bends and breaks really easily.  I had to use a jewelry tool to put the pin back in.
5.0,He likes it. It's a very strong man type bracelet
5.0,I would definitely order this again!!
5.0,Very pretty and well made.  Fits nice and comfortably around my wrist.
5.0,"I gave these to my dad who is a commercial fisherman and has arthritis and his hands, he loves them. So easy to use, heats up fast, stylish, and confortable."
5.0,I have no picture but in all honesty it kinda made my nose a little sore other then that it looks so cute on me and ended up losing it ü§£ thank you
5.0,Just too cute for words!
5.0,"I sued these to support st Jude‚Äôs in my first half marathon!! Not blisters, no issues!! I didn‚Äôt even wash them before using.  I wear a size 11 in shoes and the large fit well for running.  I would buy another pair!"
5.0,These pants feel great on. They don't slide down off you bottom when you squat or bend. This is my second pair and I will buy more.
5.0,"Love this dress! It fits perfectly, nice and flowey and the 'off the shoulder' is perfect where you don't have to keep yanking it down. Pockets are a plus!"
5.0,"really nice! bought one for me one for my girlfriend, both love it!"
5.0,Very comfortable dress! Wore it to my daughters Kindergarten graduation!
5.0,"Arrived on time, quality product, packaged well, and good value."

5.0,This set is so soft and comfy. I love the colors. It's a great lounge outfit.
5.0,I wore this to a fall weeding and I loved it. it fir perfectly.
5.0,"I get compliments cause not a lot of people have it and it looks great, doesn‚Äôt change color, doesn‚Äôt stick to skin or give rash. 100% recommend"
5.0,Really cute and great price.
5.0,"I wanted these boots so bad but was afraid to buy. They are actually what I had hoped for. BOOTIES just a little above the ankle. - love these beauties. Fast delivery. Perfect fit was a 71/2 for me. Size 8 would have worked also. - I wear a 71/2 to an 8. Half a size up would work if you have high arches to make easier to put on or wider feet. True to size tho, My feet are not wide."
5.0,"I absolutely love my dreidel bag. The construction lives up to the amazing Betsey Johnson standards. For a small pocketbook, it has a lot of room inside. I have received so many compliments when using the pocketbook. Great addition to my Betsey Johnson collection."
5.0,Totally worth the shipping wait. Very nice pin for $2.20.
5.0,"Lightweight, stylish, very functional glasses."
5.0,It was very easy to attach and comfortable and pretty.
5.0,oh yeah

5.0,No dislike love the coat & My<br />granddaughter Love the coat<br />too<br />She wearing to school LOVE. IT
5.0,Love that I can now wear my ortho flip flops around the house in winter.
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt! I love it so much, I bought the same shirt in black. It‚Äôs so effortlessly elegant and comfortable. I feel so sexy in it. I bought a large. I‚Äôm 38B and a size 12."
5.0,Slippers are great.  They will be even better next winter as they are toasty warm.<br />Thanks for these as described.
5.0,I would like to purchase one but do you have the same one but with color white instead of blue in the interior?
5.0,Just what the description says.
5.0,"Feel like a celeb in these. Thought they were blk.though but they are dark purple oh well at least they are dark framed lenses are. Not purple. Kinda large on my round face,would prob. Look better on square faces.but still look good .good add to my sunglass collectionüò∑!!-"
5.0,Made a fun Halloween costume. Comfortable but a little hot
5.0,Super nice and pretty
5.0,"Really nice, a little big but really cute."
5.0,"The replacement rubber soles for the front of the shoes were definitely huge, but it could easily be cut with a scissors. And so far i did put them on the brand new shoes (didn‚Äôt use the heel part since I put a different protector for it) that I just recently purchased, but didn‚Äôt get the chance to use the shoes yet... I will update I guess after a few uses of my shoes. So let‚Äôs wait and see."
5.0,I find these socks to be top notch and a good buy. Fit well and stay on good.<br />I recommend them.
5.0,I BOUGHT A 2X ITS FITS PERFECT.Im 5.3 and weigh 180 I'm large busted.The material is very soft and light weight.I sweat bad at night and found these to really help they dont make me hotter very comfortable.I already ordered ever color and wished they came in more colors.They have pockets in the pants which I love.I washed and dried them and they remained  the same as when they were new.I simply love them.
5.0,The product is perfect. This is the first retention product that our baby hasn‚Äôt yanked off
5.0,Just received this today and I love it! Soft fabric and it‚Äôs a flattering fit!
5.0,Love how comfortable this is.  So cute and colorful!
5.0,Still love them!!!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! So flattering to my figure.
5.0,"I am 5'3 and 125lb and it fit me perfectly over pants and a sweater. I am happy that I finally found a Halloween costume that I won't be freezing the whole night. It is pretty well made, came just as the pictures presented. The only thing is that I realize not much I can do with it besides make up so if you can do a make up to make this a fun costume go for it!"
5.0,"Love this bag! There are five zippers on it, and the longest one includes another zipper area inside. There are two pouches---one on each side of the purse that have elastic at the top which is a bit snug to get a cellphone in, but a perfect place to put a nail file or a pen. I keep my cellphone in the part that has the longest zipper as it is just easier to get to. The strap is wide and long; however it is adjustable."
5.0,"Great looking belt.  I have a 35"" waist and it fit perfectly.  I am not sure it would fit someone from 98 lbs. to 198 lbs. as they advertise but I would think it would easily fit for a 30 to 38 inch waist."
5.0,This dress is one of my favorites
5.0,Keep my my feet and ankles from swelling great sit comfort all day
5.0,I only carry western type satchels from Amazon and this one is perfect to me.
5.0,"Liked everything about this sweater...comfy fit and material, can dress up or down."
5.0,"Very nice, came in a timely matter... I love it..."
5.0,Product was just like picture. Super cute and durable.
5.0,Great fix. Wraparound feel. Good UV protection. And they look cool.
5.0,"Fits great! She loves it so much much she wears it over her clothes.<br />I got a 4-5T so she would have room to grow. She wears a 3T, but is moving into 4T. Straps are a little loose but that‚Äôs an easy fix."
5.0,Perfect fit and doesn‚Äôt make me hot
5.0,"I like these masks, especially the pink one, (even though I hate pink) for the fit. They are easy to put on and take off, they don't hurt your ears and are so easy to breathe in. Now that it is ragweed season they are a livesaver. I like the room they have to breathe and fit around your nose. The filter sets in tight to keep things out but not uncomfortable. The only thing I didn't like is sometimes when I bend over the velcro would come loose. It could be my fault for making it too tight around my head."
5.0,Very cute item works well in the sun
5.0,"I received a message that delivery would be delayed, but they really arrived quickly.  I had not seen this snowflake design before, and I think it makes a very nice tray for winter jewelry."
5.0,"I ordered the xxl because I was wanting them to fit loosely.  I don't have big arms and XXL was the largest size available.  They fit rather snugly.  I can't imagine how they would fit if I ordered the size based on my actual arm size.<br /><br />But, they look really nice.  They seem to be made of quality material.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-25-2022:  I liked these so much that I bought the red-white-blue set to wear on July 4th.  Those look and feel so nice... and patriotic."
5.0,"Amazing! I have arthritis from my knee to my hip because i have a titanium rod from breaking my femur in half. I bartend full time and am in constant pain with swelling, sometimes cant even walk to my car it hurts so bad. Purchased these compression socks, wore them twice now while working, and  no pain and no swelling for the first time in years! Im ordering more right after i finish this review."
5.0,Color is vibrant and fit is as expected
5.0,"I know this is suppose to be a tunic type top with a relaxed fit, but mine almost frayed out at the bottom like a dress, not into my legs like the pictures show. So paired with tall boos and socks, it didn't quite look right. Still cute and soft enough to wear around the house, but I wasn't abled to get it styled like the picture showed."
5.0,Excellent well made great price my son loves them very airy and light
5.0,"The fabric is a little thin but fits very well, which is perfect for an office environment.  It‚Äôs well made and drapes nicely.  I love it."
5.0,"very good looking sox for a man, perfect acessory for the stylish male"
5.0,"My husband works outside and needs good sweatshirts. I bought him two and he loves them. They fit and are snug at the wrists, which he likes."
5.0,Nice perfect for me..
5.0,My Grandson loved the shirt!!!
5.0,Great value compared to OOFOS
5.0,"These gloves are great, super warm and are very comfortable. The touchscreen feature works well. I would highly recommend"
5.0,Is as advertised!  What else do you need to know.
5.0,Very nice and big!
5.0,Sailors cap fit well on my dog. I prefer to wear the captains hat that way he doesn‚Äôt forget who‚Äôs in charge.
5.0,My husband is 5‚Äô8 and is about 192lbs and this fit him perfect! Its really nice and breathable and comes together very well! The only modification we made was we stuck some velcro on the shoulders so the edge poked out and stayed in place better!
5.0,"I got the three solid colors (red, gray, and blue) for only $16. Very nice quality. Comes in three separate plastic bags. Made a good father's day gift."
5.0,"Really like these. I'm 4'11 and 105 lbs, I ordered small and they fit ok. They are slightly loose in spots and not as fitted as some of my other leggings so when I order again I'll probably see if they have xs, but they are still pretty good. Love the color! Comfy! Love the pocket"
5.0,Exactly what a person should expect.... Thank you
5.0,"I go on home inspections as part of my job and we spend time outside and inside, so I needed a jacket that would be sturdy enough to take on the rain, but not so warm I start to overheat when I go inside. So far, this jacket seems like the perfect option! I can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can put it to the test."
5.0,"Omg üò≤ My son is absolutely in love these are some of the best she is very lightweight but definitely good performance this would be good for your child if he or she play basketball, but even if they don't they are still excellent shoes and can be worn for every day activity definitely good quality five star rating"
5.0,Very flattering top that works great with leggings.  Very pretty and comfy.....will be ordering another.
5.0,This Abco knee support has worked very well for my wifes weak knee. She wears it during the daytime hours and has great results. This is our second one and will continue to use as long as they do the job.
5.0,Beautiful earrings... love them
5.0,This color is beautiful on a black dress. The shape is more of a very large square. You can't not tell what the design is until you look at it fully opened. Orange is my color!
5.0,Great fit and material.  Our son loved them!
5.0,"Hands down the best headband I've ever owned. It does not slip, slide, pop off or squeeze my head -- even when running! I even forget I have it on."
5.0,Love these shirts!  Well made and attractive!  Ended up purchasing two sets!  Thank you!
5.0,"really beutiful and cute for the office, for a party dinner. Just super cute"
5.0,Don‚Äôt hesitate to order ! Love them
5.0,Love these spandex! Wear them all the time
5.0,"These are good sunglasses!  Quality, No Glare, Good Fit, Cool Style n Fair Price.  Like em!"
5.0,"The jacket is a perfect jacket for everyday walks, providing protection from the outdoor elements without unnecessary bulk. Great buy."
5.0,Awesome glasses come with a nice little bag would buy them again
5.0,"Fast shipping, perfect fit when following the provided sizing chart & I will be ordering more in other colors!!!! So happy with this shirt & showing my MI Pride!"
5.0,Fit as expected since I bought a larger size because others stated that it runs small.
5.0,Comfortable and soft. Bought 2 sizes larger to have it fit a little big and not be tight round my upper arms. I followed the other reviewers direction about ordering a size or two up and it was a good suggestion.
5.0,I really liked üòç buy it!
5.0,1.  I am a pretty true American size 12. I decided to go with a 14 since you can take in something too big. Can‚Äôt do much with something too small. It fits pretty much perfectly. So glad I went with a 14! Although the lace up back does seem to be pretty forgiving.<br /><br />2.  It is a little more shiny than I would have liked.<br /><br />3. But for the price is am super pleased!! I love it!<br /><br />(Picture from a quick try on straight out of the bag.)
5.0,"Super cute! Though when I got mine, it is not strapless. Still great though!"
5.0,Love this beanie so much! Matches my ATW scarf perfectly!
5.0,"This is very lightweight fabric, perfect for southern winters. Cute subtle ruffles, looks darling with western (or other) boots, especially with hat. Sweet with belt but I wear it without a belt and get tons of compliments. A perfect fit for my 5'6"", 133 lbs. Side zipper for nice fit without being too snug. Roses are a peachy pink (not rosy pink) and cream. I wish there were other colors because I would sure order more! I love dresses, especially feminine ones with an old-fashioned or prairie look. This is it!"
5.0,"Fits well, stays put at any speed, very comfortable and provides the sun protection I want, even down to my neckline behind my head.<br />Recommended."
5.0,A little wide but they are true to size! I wear a 9.5 but i bought a 10. I could have prob done a 9 but i have narrow feet
5.0,"The earrings are a nice weight, do not feel cheap and the disks are solid, not hollow like other gold items under $100 tend to be. The posts are grooved at 2 places so the nuts hold on really well and feel very secure. I have slept and showered in these on occasion and they are very comfortable, no irritation from the alloy mix and a perfect stud for a second piercing."
5.0,Comfortable and they look great
5.0,"These are the best no-show socks I've ever worn. They are snug with a no-slip back, so they don't fall off like many others do. They are relatively breathable and don't get as sweaty as some other pairs I've tried. The price is on the cheaper side, too. I'll be buying more from this company in the future, for sure."
5.0,I were this with the black silk cord necklace.  Love it.
5.0,"This hooded bathrobe is wonderful!!. This hooded towel has a very roomy hood for its size, it makes me happy. This robe fits cozy and the sleeves roll so I can get down to business if necessary. This robe is absorbant and comfortable. I would recommend this robe to friends. I received a discount in exchange for a unbiased review. I approve of this robe!!"
5.0,These are really cute. They aren't as thick as the name brand ones but for my 3 year old grand baby they worked. Worth every penny!
5.0,"No complaints. It is perfect for spring, summer and fall.  I'm 5'2, 129lbs and the medium fit perfectly."
5.0,Very stylish !!!!
5.0,love these keeps you nice and warm
5.0,"Really nice little swim cover up! It is pretty see through and thin, but as a cover up I think it's just fine. I was worried about size (one size) as a size 16 short woman (5ft 3in) but it fits great!"
5.0,"Super super cute! I love him to death. Like everyone else was saying, he‚Äôs a lot bigger than I imagined. The only complaint I have is that for the price I bought him for, the material seems a bit on the cheaper side, however the fabric of his boar head is still pretty soft."
5.0,Compression sleeves fit comfortably. No hassle shipping and price right. The fabric is light weight and washes fine. I tore my calf mussel and need the support they give. Plus they look good.
5.0,Wonderful Gift!!!
5.0,"Great fit, looks great."
5.0,8-year old so pleased!
5.0,"Cute, very nice for the price"
5.0,I took a chance and shipped this direct to my mother for Christmas.<br />She needed one like this. And she loved the new one. I tried for pink but settled for blue. Fine.
5.0,She just out grew ALL of her 2T clothes well before we thought she would but i thought 3T would be too big. This fit PERFECTLY
5.0,"Bought it as a gift for my mom, its not as thick as I expected but she loves it! Fits her perfectly."
5.0,Loving this watch band!<br />The colors are brilliant and it‚Äôs comfortable and stays where you put it!
5.0,Already did I believe
5.0,"This dress exceeded my expectations. The quality is amazing and it's super cute. It fit perfect, not too big not too small."
5.0,Everyone loves these earrings. so cute!
5.0,"When I made my friends and spouse wear other animals, I wore this one, and they said I looked cute."
5.0,I used this to make my own Kentucky Derby hat.  Quality of hat was good.  Could‚Äôve worn it without my alternating it.
5.0,Was a present for my wife. She has several bands so she can change them for different occasions. She likes this one too.
5.0,A perfect combination. Fit well. I love how they look and how comfortable they are to wear. I‚Äôll definitely buy more pairs
5.0,I bought them for my 13 year old son. He loves them. Look very cool
5.0,have received many compliments on this necklace.  The price was also great.
5.0,"Can't beat these sunglasses, although a little large for my large head, they are just what the doctor ordered. Not sure if these are men's or women's sunglasses but nonetheless, they are nice dark polarized sunglasses.  I even wear them when it's cloudy.  Exceptional value for the $."
5.0,A little big in the waist for me but still fits well overall. Will be working out in these pants and love that I won‚Äôt have to be constantly pulling on them to keep them in place.
5.0,"Took a while to get here, but it was a good price and I love this hat- the fit, material and look! Plan on ordering more in different colors."
5.0,The greenish blue is like a Tiffany blue in person - I get alot of compliments on it.
5.0,I found this shawl to be exactly as described and perfect for my needs. I will be using it as a light wrap over my dress for church but I'm sure there are many other occasions to wear the basic white that I purchased.  I certainly plan to buy others in different colors as the need arises.
5.0,"my girl and I each wear one. I wear the &#34;Hers&#34;, and she wears &#34;His&#34;.  Everyone thinks it's so cute."
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful!  I get more compliments on these earrings.  They are small, elegant and fit perfectly.  Love love love these!"
5.0,"I have long legs, (36"" inseam) and I bought the XL- Long's, and they fit just right.  Just a little below the ankle, which is perfect for this type of trouser.  They are loose in all areas so they don't ride up when sit down.  You might need a set of the suspenders that go with these because they fit a little loose, as they are designed to be worn over your clothing.  Full length zippers make them a snap to don over your regular pants, but if you choose to just go with some long underwear under them, you might be puling them up a lot without the suspenders.  Other than that, they are a really nice, well made, high quality item.  And you wont find a pair of primaloft trousers  for this kind of money at a outdoors retailer. Especially as nice as these.  These are really nice, and would be good for clearing snow, sitting in a tree stand, ice fishing, snowmobiling, etc...I'm certain they will be very warm when winter rolls around."
5.0,Very well made and they look so cute!
5.0,Great shorts. Fit perfect.  Very comfortable. sexy but not over done
5.0,"This o product is cute, and light weight! It was a perfect gift for my friend!!"
5.0,"I am in love with this jumpsuit,  am not much of a dress person.  This suit gives you so many looks in one can wear it over and over and each time with a different look.  It does not come with instructions but I went to Youtube and learn a few ways of tying it up to my liking."
5.0,"I cracked my old belay glasses and didn't want to pay nearly $100 for a replacement. But found these here that were under $30!  And they came with a nice case, cleaner wipe & a cord to hold around your neck.  The one that I cracked I paid around $70 and had no wipe or cord.  This was a great deal and these work great!  I rock climb a lot and this saves your neck from straining it and being painful.  I definitely recommend these!"
5.0,"Excellent cleaner! I have used many others and this is by far the best! My necklaces and rings are sparkling! Also, it is great that it is all natural.  I am a happy customer and highly recommend!"
5.0,Love them! Absolutely üòä
5.0,These make my legs feel so good!
5.0,The size is perfect just what I expected very comfortable the zippers are extremely well-made money well spent.
5.0,wife loves this !!!
5.0,Love these - always have extra on hand
5.0,Built like a tank this is a solid classic.
5.0,The dress exceeded expectations for cost
5.0,Love this dress!  I get compliments every time I wear it!
5.0,I‚Äôm putting Christmas money in the bag.  That way my loved one will get some spending cash and a stadium appropriate bag to keep stuff in.
5.0,I really like the product it works well. I use for my mirror in the shower and for my glasses it's a very good product would buy again.
5.0,Bought this for our beach trips. It can hold 4 large beach towels and a beach blanket with room to spare.
5.0,Great T Shirt. Love ir
5.0,I've purchased in multiple colors my daughter loves them.  They are the only shoes she doesn't pull off. I do think they run a little big!
5.0,"They cost almost nothing, dry quickly, and they feel great without limiting my movement.<br />Not sure on my sizing for shorts but for underwear I use XL, the XL sized shorts fit me perfectly."
5.0,Really cute on and fairly durable.  I have had to tighten the sides but I also wear them every day.  Would definitely buy again.
5.0,great love the colors had the sizes I need
5.0,good  job
5.0,"I love this dress! It was inexpensive, looks good on me (I think), and I got a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,This product is very good. I like it very much. It's much better than the other one I bought in another store. I just recommended it to my friend yesterday and he is ready to buy it
5.0,Review is for Men's Cycling Jackets Waterproof Hooded Packable Lightweight Running Windbreaker Reflective Rain Windproof Bike Raincoat 3XL. The color is very bright. The fabric is very lightweight. The size is as expected and the tail is very long. The hood is very nice because it can be cinched closely to your face to keep the rain off. The only shortcoming is that you have to fold it into a very small pack if you want it to fit into the built-in pocket.
5.0,Great buy and nice look and feel
5.0,Perfect size!<br />Amazing texture :)<br />A lot of packets
5.0,My 8 year old granddaughter loves her new nightgown! It‚Äôs soft and comfortable and fits great!!
5.0,I'm a brown skin girl so these turned out to be a great buy in brown as a nude panty! Very comfortable. I work as a CNA and need underwear that is comfortable with all of the moving around and lifting I do and these fit the bill perfectly.
5.0,Love them! Great value for price. Supper cute and lightweight.
5.0,Bien hecho lo recomiendo
5.0,I wear this every Sunday and its fantastic. My pastor loves it and wants to put one in a church raffle. It fits perfect and very cute. I get compliments every time i wear it. Thanks<br />And fast shipping
5.0,"I love this, it isn't so heavy that I cant wear it on my ear, it is a really cool piece of jewelry and I like to wear it out, its a one of a kind piece of jewelry that I get a lot of compliments on, I would definitely purchase from this seller again, it is bendable so I can bend it around the shape of my own ear, a really cool piece of jewelry...."
5.0,"like shirt.  A little smaller than most shirts in the 3X size, but wearable.  Love the blue."
5.0,"The gift for our daughter she love it blue her birthstone color and diamonds sparkle in the sun, I was very happy with  over all."
5.0,"They are all super cute, and I got 10 for the price that you would pay for one choker at Urban Outfitters. They came in a little drawstring bag, and they're pretty decent quality. If you don't want to spend a ton of money on chokers, but want a lot of variety, this is what you should go for."
5.0,This is a cute jacket to throw on when you want something that isn‚Äôt too heavy. It is very soft. It is true to size. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs the perfect size. My only complaint is that it took a month to get here.
5.0,I love these beautiful crows for my party .
5.0,Great looking dress. Material is nice and stretchy. Very long which is good because I can 5'8&#34;. Got the medium.
5.0,Great tank! I want more colors now!
5.0,What can I say?  The family loved them.
5.0,The necklaces are absolutely beautiful as the stones shimmer in the light!
5.0,"Love this wallet , very well made and priced good.."
5.0,Love this! So comfy!!
5.0,Love this tunic ... very comfortable
5.0,Got them on time and they look grate
5.0,"I ordered this suit in 42L.  The suit arrived securely packaged with useful extra-wide hanger included.<br /><br /> The jacket fit perfectly.  The trousers needed hemming to 32&#34; which was expected since they are unfinished. The pants had ample excess fabric length for finishing with the preferred 11/2 inch cuff.<br />Overall quality was surprisingly good- excellent construction, half-canvas lining, fasteners and other details found in much more expensive suits. The fabric is solid, giving the desired non-polyester appearance.<br /><br />I would recommend this suit to anyone as an example of a bargain suit that is not cheap-looking at all."
5.0,"I really like this hat. Even though I‚Äôve got a giant noggin, it fits pretty good. It‚Äôs very light weight and it‚Äôs my new favorite lid to wear to the mountain bike trailhead, or on hikes. Just make sure to hand wash your hat to keep it looking great for years.  Great hat for my outdoorsy lifestyle. Good purchase!"
5.0,"I bought a pair of these a year ago and loved them so much that I finally bought a second pair, this time with the pocket option. I normally wear an XL pant but from reading other reviews I decided to go up to the xxl. They fit just right and so comfortable. I love the pocket for my cell phone and will likely order more in the future to replace my other black pants.  The pants I bought a year ago are still in really good shape and the black has not faded, so I‚Äôm sure these will hold up too!"
5.0,"Been wearing Nike Shox for the longest, wouldn't have anything else on my feet,"
5.0,Really cute! Perfect for dressing up some hand painted scarves I made for the holidays. They are<br />a surprisingly sturdy weight for the price and the rhinestones are very sparkly!
5.0,Was a gift for a friend.  She loved it.  Very beautiful and well made.
5.0,"Love it, have gotten many compliments on it."
5.0,"These pants came fast and fit as expected. I am shorter, so I needed to roll them up a little more than your average girl. They are tight when you sit because they are not like those stretchy jeans which wasn't a problem for me. These pants do not flatten your bum. These are a very flattering fit."
5.0,Love it! It was a little big but I'm really tiny though.  My family wears masked everywhere we travel. We even started a Facebook book page and have a pretty good collection going. Check out pics of us wearing it![...]
5.0,"Finally pure, soft, great quality cotton bandanas that breathe.  Wash and dry well.  The size is perfect.  A little pricey but well worth it compared to other bandanas out there for sale."
5.0,My little loves the robe! Very soft!
5.0,"I bought this bag for a Florida trip back in July.  It held up great and is very spacious without being overwhelming.  I was able to comfortably fit a beach towel, sunglasses, sunscreen, change of clothing, wallet & keys with room for a few more items!  I used it again for a trip to the Hampton's and a few more times laying out in the park near my house/the beach and it is still holding up.  As other reviewers have stated I didn't like the pom pom that came on the bag but it is easily removable."
5.0,"The color is so nice, the perfect pink."
5.0,"Better than expected, color was spot on.  You will need to steam it.  Cups are built in and appreciated not having to wear a bra.  Wore this as Matron of Honor and got many compliments."
5.0,I have it on a backpack and it looks great and helps to identify the backpack.
5.0,"Got these for my friend that is a Mickey Mouse lover, and yes, she loves this gift!"
5.0,I bought a medium and am 5‚Äù4 150lbs. I was plesently surprised when I unboxed the sweater. It fits great!! I get nervous when I purchase clothes online...but I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
5.0,This works great fur a Nepeta cosplay hat just tuck the ear flaps and paint the face
5.0,This is probably one of my best belt I've owned. Thank you so much!!
5.0,My granddaughter wears these daily and they wash and wear great. I‚Äôve bought a second set. Excellent!
5.0,"This thing is great,  get lots of crazy looks"
5.0,"I am 5‚Äô 2 tall, 122 lbs, small fits me perfect, I love one-pieces because they feel secure and still allow you to be active on the beach without worry. The color is so bright and the material and quality was nice."
5.0,This pendant is lovely.  Nice size and nice chain also. My sister loved it and diamond is her birthstone which made is very special.
5.0,After wearing this comfortable waist trainer I felt slimmer than before. It fit really well. This is very very comfortable to wear. When I wore it it doesn‚Äôt even look like I am wearing it .
5.0,"Ordered one for my granddaughter and it was so cute, I ordered another for my other granddaughter!"
5.0,Very beautiful and delicate necklace. Bought this to hold a pearl pendant. Very dainty but that was what I was looking for.

5.0,Great quality. Fits as expected.
5.0,very beautiful and wonderful
5.0,Very cute!!  Great price!!  Get lots of compliments üòâ
5.0,These facemasks have worked out the best so far! They fit well and didn't for my glasses while wearing it. I would buy them again.
5.0,These capri pants fit well and look great. They made the perfect bbq outfit...comfy and just colorful enough!
5.0,I sanitized and put it in without any issue. I love it and it makes me feel a little nore confident in myself. Stretching to a 12 isn't painful at all. üëçüèª
5.0,Product is really cute and loved the freebie it came with!
5.0,"This is really beautiful but if you want it to look like a shirt underneath a sweater you have to pin it to the sweater for it to stay in place,  Then it does not go all the way around the collar but it still looks nice."
5.0,I bought a LOT of these in France but evidently not enough because I soon ran out.  I saw these on Amazon and they are the exact same as the ones you buy off the street vendors in Paris but better quality for about the same price.
5.0,"I liked the way the top fit and how it looked on me, and with pants I bought it to go with."
5.0,"I purchased this dress for a wedding at the end of March. I wanted something with long sleeves just in case the weather was chilly. I was concerned that the fabric would be too heavy and would not be appropriate for spring. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the material is lightweight, enough so that I ordered it in another color for a wedding in May, you can't beat the price!<br />The fit is perfect! I am 5'6"" 140 lbs (on a good day), 34 DDD, an hourglass figure, and hips. The dress is extremely flattering; providing proper coverage while accentuating my figure. I ordered a Medium and it fits like a glove! I cannot forget to mention the POCKETS, one of my favorite features of the dress!"
5.0,"I love this necklace so much. I wear it everyday. really cute and trendy, comfortable and easy to take off when you need to."
5.0,"Dress was a little to large on me. But this is a really nice dress. Best quality dress ever bought from Amazon. I wish the small would of fit, but I have a great solution to make it work. Still giving 5 star because of quality.  My measurements are 31 29 32 weigh 105."
5.0,This was bought for my son. He loves it.
5.0,Beautiful dress! Many compliments.
5.0,I wore this dress for Easter. Fits as great. Love it!!

5.0,Amazing detail!!! Great materials and stunning quality!! I absolutely love it!!!
5.0,Great product! Liked it so much I ordered one in white gold also.
5.0,Fit me absolutely perfect. 5'3 and it hits me mid thigh
5.0,"Absolutely happy with this purchase! I was looking for a big purse for a carry on and for weekend trips. This is perfect! Looks like it will hold up well. I can fit my chargers, my Kindle, makeup bag, jewelry and wallet. So thrilled!"
5.0,"Hot, Hot, Hot!!!"
5.0,I used this on a charm bracelet.
5.0,"The rubber is the same quality as Oakley's original which, unfortunately, is no longer available for the XX Metal frames. The earsocks take quite a bit of effort to slip on but they are snug and don't rotate as easy as the OEM's did.<br /><br />Pricey, but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
5.0,"Worked on my pixel 2xl and pixel 4xl, even with case on. Can't beat it for the price if you have a spare x box one controller laying around."
5.0,Nice pants! Comfy n cool. A little short on the leg but I‚Äôm 6.4 so expected as much. Gotta wear boots so it don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm wearing capris.:)
5.0,Runs a bit small in size. Snug fit. Keeps my hands warm. Lightweight
5.0,Cute and Nice Finishing of the product.. Very compact.. Loved it!!!
5.0,"Super cute. I can usually wear M/L in shirts, but decided on the XL (just so I can get a looser fit and honestly would much rather have the shirt looser than too small and have to deal with returning it). The material is soft and stretchy. I actually wear this shirt frequently to add some pattern to my outfits. I have noticed though after multiple washes that the black polka dots do seem a little faded, but overall still a great shirt at a cheap price!"
5.0,"I order the slipper and purse & I love it size 11 yes, because they run small. But if it smelling glue just wash it down with a towel and soap. The sparkle from the diamonds omg so cute"
5.0,I love this sweater.  The color blocking is trending now and it is super cute and not too expensive.  It fits true to size.  You can size up if you want extra baggy look.  It is not super heavy which I wanted to be able to wear in the early fall months.  Great with jeans and white t shirt!  I have received a lot of compliments on this sweater!  Highly recommend!
5.0,"Fits perfectly without damaging edges, very pleased"
5.0,Quick ship and great product!
5.0,"I had been looking forever for a boot that was low enough to run around town in and found it in this.  I have wide feet and off the mark found these comfortable.  They are not wide made, but due to the perfectly soft leather it molded around my feet without the usual pain, especially when other boots have seams inside and stiffer leather. Would not hesitate if you wnat to look chic and comfortable, my husband thought I looked really cute :)"
5.0,This necklace is very beautiful. The chain is really thin but I still like it. It fits my neck perfectly.
5.0,These boots look great with the Captain America womens costume for my upcoming event.
5.0,"5‚Äô5‚Äù 32DDD and the medium fit perfectly, length, width everything - bought this for a wedding and couldn‚Äôt be happier"
5.0,husband loves these pants.
5.0,I love this dress! Super comfortable and looks great with some jewelry to jazz it up!
5.0,This is the right size for what I was looking for. It looks nice with outfits and is a comfortable weight.
5.0,"Very pleased with the quality of this product.  I purchased a medium, but it would have been snug over my other clothing, so I returned it for a large.  Very easy transaction!"
5.0,I love it!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüëèüëè
5.0,Nicely packed and a very good product.  Exactly as stated.<br />They must be sterling silver because my ears have not yet started itching.
5.0,"This is a really pretty dress and s great solution for a simple wedding or pre wedding bash.  Only thing is the under color is nude, which really wasn‚Äôt that bad, but I was not expecting it.  It gave it nice contrast"
5.0,"The hat is perfect! Looks exactly like the oicture, very cute."
5.0,I was worried when I ordered this considering there were no reviews. I wasn‚Äôt sure what the quality would be especially since the price was so reasonable. I was very pleased. The bag seemed to be very well made. The print was beautiful. The material appeared durable and of very good quality. Inside was lined with very nice navy blue pinstripes. Lots of pockets and plenty of storage. Zipper closure. This was a secret Santa gift and the recipient was very happy. So far it‚Äôs a wonderful purchase. Hopefully it will live up to my review.
5.0,"Manly band. I put this on my new Traser Tornado many moons ago, and it is simply perfect in every way for me.  Had it for months of daily use, and it still looks absolutely brand new.  Could not be one bit happier with a watch band.  Was unaware of the whole world of &#34;NATO&#34; style watch bands until finding this one, and now I am a &#34;lifer.&#34;  And the four-ring would be the only version I would ever use (threaded it per best instructions).  If I ever buy another one for some reason, it would be this exact same one from this exact same seller."
5.0,"These are my new favorite earrings; I got compliments on them the first day I wore them.  These earrings look MUCH more expensive than they are; very elegant and stylish. They're lightweight, comfortable, and beautiful."

5.0,Gooood.
5.0,Must have for a true Angry Birds fan!!!
5.0,"Worked perfect, easy to install"

5.0,"The detail in this buckle is beautiful. Thanks,"
5.0,My boyfriend is size 38 and the XXXL fits him really good.<br />Check the size shart!!!!
5.0,These mittens are great. I love that they are warm and cozy and especially that they're on a string so they don't get lost! The adjustable velcro wrist straps also help ensure they stay on my toddler when they need to. My daughter loves the penguins and I love that they're so practical!
5.0,"Fit as stated, no issues"
5.0,I got this to make a really cool Cosplay prop for my 8 year old son. We watch The Mandalorian together and really enjoy the show a lot. It‚Äôs getting a make over. I can‚Äôt wait to make it look like a mini movie production prop he can hang on his wall.
5.0,I love the gold chain down the sides. I love the fit. They also have some stretch to them. And the quality is really good. They're well made.
5.0,"Nice wallet for a good price. Did not test the RFID feature, but I like the design - which us the main reason I bought the wallet. I like the way it's organized for cards, IDs, cash. Leather is good quality and craftsmanship us good also."
5.0,It fit just right. I liked it.
5.0,I was very satisfied with this product when it arrived. It is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I really like how it was made.
5.0,The lenses are very clear and so far leak proof. Very comfortable on my face. Bought them for two other swimmer friends and they also like these goggles very much. All of us each ordered a back up pair!

5.0,"So far so good!, a great piece looks expensive, can't wait to show it off"
5.0,Very nice. It was bigger and roomier than I expected.
5.0,"It fits perfect also with a bump. I am 28 weeks pregnant, 161 lbs, 5.2‚Äù and I ordered a Medium.<br />Really nice, soft and stretchy. Comfortable for pregnant body too.<br />I recommend it I would buy again!<br /><br />Only cons so difficult to iron."
5.0,It feels genuine and came in its original box. Absolutely love it.
5.0,perfect for disney
5.0,"This is gorgeous! I have a cream color pea coat and this really pops over the cream tones. It‚Äôs thick and warm, yet lightweight and breathable. It does just fine in the washer and dryer. It showed no signs of wear and tear and it didn‚Äôt shrink. This is what I call champagne taste on a beer budget! You can look like a million bucks and spend very little doing it!"
5.0,Love the design and simple hard case.
5.0,Far too epensive
5.0,Quality is great and it is super cute!
5.0,Really like the look and feel ..great under shorts to keep cool and dry
5.0,Good product at a very fair price.
5.0,"I am 5'3 and weigh approximately 137. I ordered a medium and it fit PERFECTLY. It looks exactly like the photo, feels great and I am very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"These are nice basic high quality shorts of the quality I have come to expect from Hana Anderson. They fit true to size. The fabric is thick and durable, yet comfortable and stretchy. We have some Hana Anderson clothes made of this same material that have survived 3 children and are still going strong, which is more than I can say for most of our kids clothes. These didn't shrink pill or bleed in the wash. They are well stitched. I wish they made some with pockets (kids love pockets) bit these are definitely good shorts!"
5.0,"It was a little bigger than i expected ( the watch face ) , but the quality is great. Looks fantastic. It comes from China, but it was delivered weeks before the 'window of delivery'. 100% satisfied! 5/5 stars!"
5.0,"Awesome offer, perfect fit, this was a gift to my wife"
5.0,Love this bag..bought another one in a different color..great size..light-weight and great transaction..Thank you.
5.0,Cheap. great for bike riding
5.0,"Although I have not had these for long I was impressed by their durability. They are not flimsy and they came with soft cases, and were packages together inside a box. They work well to help my eyes when using the computer for long periods of time, and came with a blue light tester. I am definitely happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I got this for my dad for a holiday gift. He absolutely loved it. Looks better in real life than in the picture. Good quailty, which was what I was concerned about."
5.0,These bands are a perfect fit and easy to change. The price was way less than originals.
5.0,This ring was for my Halloween costume but now I wear it on the regular.
5.0,The charms are a lovely addition to my bracelet. They are exactly as described and were received in a timely manner.
5.0,"Once in a while I go looking for new underwear of this type.  I tend to find a brand or type that I like and stick with it.  I will definitely buy these again soon, perhaps in different colors.  While I do not find the &#34;bulge&#34; part to be necessary, the rest of the design is great.  This is an all-day comfortable pair of underwear which is a bit surprising given their shape and design.  I was pleasantly surprised that everything fit in securely enough and that is the issue that led me to start seeking this kind of underwear in the first place.  Comfortable and snug, almost possible to forget they are on, and made better than the price suggests.  Id call that an overall win."
5.0,"I love it. It's cute and comfortable. Multi-purpose. I wear to work, church, out to dinner, anywhere. I have it in the wine color and in yellow. I was coming back to see if they had any more colors because I would love a few solids. Hang it up and it's good to go anytime."
5.0,"For the price, this dress was a great value! Very cozy & comfortable. The shoulders do sort of ride up, so I keep having to tug at my sleeves, but that's not a big deal. I am usually a size 4 in dresses and I'm 5'8&#34; with 32A bra, and I felt that size small was perfect in fit and length."
5.0,Nice fit and finish.  I like the cargo pocket for my phone.  Dressy enough for Florida evening attire.
5.0,Good-looking shirt.  Fits great.  Easy transaction.
5.0,Just as described. Love how heavy it is and size is perfect.
5.0,Perfect. Purchased to see on my boyfriends hockey jersey
5.0,"Good purchase!  I have installed them and they feel good.  I used them for a 1980 Honda CM400 E.<br /><br />&#34;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&#34; Romans 3:23<br /><br />&#34;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#34; Romans 5:8<br /><br />&#34;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&#34; Romans 6:23<br /><br />&#34;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.&#34; Ephesians 2:8-9<br /><br />‚ÄúNow we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.‚Äù Romans 3:19-20<br /><br />&#34;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#34; John 3:16<br /><br />&#34;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&#34; Romans 10:9-10"
5.0,Helps with my plantar facsitis.
5.0,Good size and pretty
5.0,"I wore this on a plane trip for protection of me and my clothes.  Perfectly comfortable, reasonable price. I‚Äôm short and though the legs were long they had a nice elastic at the bottom so I wasn‚Äôt tripping. When I got where I was going, I threw it out. As a girl I picked this more convenient two piece suit instead of a jump suit."
5.0,Great to workout
5.0,"Since &#34;steady clothing&#34; doesn't make the official drive jacket anymore,  this is probably the best one you could find."
5.0,good socks  my husband is wearing
5.0,"Choose 2 sizes larger for a comfortable waist fit or 1 size larger if you like a very snug fit, otherwise a very pretty skirt! LA in NH"
5.0,Great tee!!  Wish the cotton was softer but can take care of that after the first wash.
5.0,"My husband has three pairs of these joggers and said they‚Äôre the best ones he‚Äôs ever had. He‚Äôs not usually enthusiastic about clothing, so trust me when I say that‚Äôs a big deal."
5.0,I am very happy with these crystals.  They are beautifully done.  Thank you.<br />Linda Harrison
5.0,"Very comfortable pants, and fit very well"
5.0,My daughter loves this ring.  She wears it everyday.
5.0,Amazing piece.<br />Fast delivery-packaging was great!<br /><br />Must have for any MCU fan!
5.0,I just got this necklace today and is very pretty. The rope it comes on is very nice and you can adjust it to the size you want. The workmanship is great. The stone is just the right color and the entire necklace is not very heavy. You almost don't know it is there. I would buy it again in a heart beat. The only thing bad is that if you wear it all the time like I do the silver finish comes off and not it is starting to look ugly.
5.0,It was delivered promptly. Stretchy material. Kind shapeless. It is as shown in picture.
5.0,"This is my second one ,first one lasted me over 10 years .  Great product . I got one for my wife also ."

5.0,"This dress was very nice , I love the fit"
5.0,Love them. No adjusting period. Thinking about buying another and I just received them
5.0,The bright colors the perfect fit the quality of the material were all what I expected.  The look on my granddaughters face when I put it on her was more than I expected.
5.0,Such a cute skirt! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 119 pounds for reference. Skirt is form-fitting but not inappropriately tight. I would prefer if the buttons would lay flatter but it‚Äôs fine. Overall it looks fantastic and is very versatile. Highly recommend!
5.0,"I don‚Äôt know what size I got a large or xl, but it was big on me. It was cute but made me look fat..."
5.0,"Love this too, exactly what I was looking for.üëçüèΩ"
5.0,"This a great replacement band, it.looks and feels very good on my wrist"
5.0,I bought these or my mom for her birthday because she‚Äôsa sucker for weiner dogs. She absolutely loves them and has worn them every day.
5.0,Perfect fit and very comfortable. All the people complimented the fit and style. Absolutely love them
5.0,Great price great boots nothing left to say.
5.0,"Arrived quickly.  Items as described. Very well made. Lightweight & compressible when empty or partially filled, so take up little room. Color options help easily differentiate contents - we use red for medications/ first aid kit, blue for electronics, etc.  When used in closet or car, can attach labels to zipper pulls to know contents even if mesh not visible."
5.0,Nice looking design of crab. Looks solid of chain
5.0,"Love this dress! It‚Äôs super cute, and nice and light weight for summer. It‚Äôs a great length for me- but I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1‚Äù so taller people would need to wear leggings with it."
5.0,Good product. Good size
5.0,I have been carrying this purse for a year now and still in great shape! I definitely recommend!
5.0,"Very flattering top... on the long side, like picture, so it's cute with leggings or close fitting jeans or pants."
5.0,We bought sleeved this for a father/daughter dance and it is super cute and appears well made and pretty (especially for the price)!  The only thing that I don't love is the length of the dress....it takes just the right shoes to make this a perfect outfit.  It wasn't worn for that dance but is worn to church and is very pretty.<br />The tank top style dress is not nearly as pretty or well made. It was quickly returned.
5.0,Butt size matters
5.0,"Packaged neatly in a small box, the band included 4 screws and a small screw driver for installation. Nice."
5.0,"Great material,  I liked the color. Magnet clip is very strong,  holds cash tight.  Very small and hardly noticeable when in back pocket"
5.0,"I've re-ordered this item many times for duffles, gym bags, briefcases, etc.  Never disappointed;always pleased."
5.0,"This is a pretty, whimsical blouse.  Good quality for the price.  The medium is cut very generously.  It looks just like the picture."

5.0,"This is toooooo cute. Don't know how effective it would be at keeping out a virus, I will probably wear a surgical mask underneath. But it is so danged cute! I get compliments every time I wear it."
5.0,Fits well and is super soft.
5.0,Has a bit of a chemical smell but I washed it and smells great now. Works perfectly with my masks for teaching.
5.0,I love these sunglasses!  They are well-made and very chic.  They are comfortable to wear and the lenses aren‚Äôt two dark but they block out plenty of light when I am driving.  It comes with a  soft case and a hard case and a cleaning cloth.  I misplace sunglasses very easily but there‚Äôs something about coming with a case already that makes it easier to keep track of.  Such good quality for the price.
5.0,"Like:<br />-The material contains 80% cotton which makes these socks soft, breathable and comfortable;<br />-These socks look and feel like professional basketball socks;<br />-Four pairs with different colors in one pack, good deal;<br />-I wear 8 size shoes, these socks fit my feet very well;<br />-I feel great when I wear them and play basketball.<br /><br />Dislike:<br />-If has to find one, that's they are a little thick for summer days."
5.0,My daughter absolutely LOVES hers. Wears them everywhere
5.0,Awesome just a little snug in between I would go a size up
5.0,My teenage son loves hockey and loved this shirt!
5.0,"Far better quality than I was expecting, the red is deep and it seems to be very solidly built. Very happy with this purchase, might get more in different colors for my GF, she loved it!"
5.0,The cosplay is made really well and the color is beautiful
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, love how well it fits and how soft the fabric is."
5.0,super cute. My daughter worn them almost everyday. They were her go to sandals. Easy to put on and super cute. No complaints.
5.0,True to size and quality material. My son loves it.
5.0,Shirts fit good and are comfortable
5.0,"Everything about this bra is a big fat YES.  Let's start with the material.  It's soft, flat and thin, but strong.  It's like a second skin.  The padding for the cup is barely there, and it is there as a shaper only.  I love this. The band, also thin, and feels like soft skin.  The entire bra feels like a second skin.  There is no strappy, digging in itchiness to this bra.  It just holds stuff in place!  Like it's supposed to!  Unlike other ""comfortable"" bras that come in s,m,l sizes, this one has adjustable shoulder straps, and for me that is all the difference.  In the past the lack of adjustable length on the shoulder straps have caused me a great deal of pain in the neck, shoulders and head.  This bra has a good length in the shoulder straps, so it does not pull on the shoulders.  The band is tight enough, and is also well adjustable.  I wear a 34DD, and I'm 5'4"", 120 lbs.  I got a medium, and it seems a wee bit on the small side, however, I'm not sure that I would have been happy with the band on the large size.  I prefer a tighter band.  Last, not least, I really like the way my breasts sit IN the bra, and there is band between my breast and my skin.  I hate bras that squish my breasts back onto my skin.  This holds them and does not do that."
5.0,These are the most awesome reusable fangs ever created by man.  They lasted a long time and many people commented on how realistic they looked.
5.0,I love these flip flops. They are very durable and my legs and feet aren't tired anymore at the end of the day.

5.0,Our Grandson loves the look of the shoes. Right now is wearing a size 9 T and I had ordered a 10T. He will grow into them.
5.0,Slow shipping but other then that good product
5.0,"My son loves these pjs he wants to wear them every night. They are very soft material and have washed well. If your kid likes the Rainbow Friends these will be a hit. They have nice stretch to them, the only drawback to me is I think the waist runs a little snug, other than that pretty true to size. My son is an 8/10 in big boys clothes and the 10 fits nicely with a little room to grow."
5.0,"Solid ring shipping was quick, Ordered for my sons girlfriend, I‚Äôm going to order one for my daughter!"
5.0,"Got them for my girlfriend , She loved them Thanks, Kool Looking and She Said They Work Great , Thanks Again"
5.0,"Super comfy, cozy, and a must have basic. I bought in white, tan and black and I may need more colors! This turtle neck is thick, soft and has great structure. The turtle neck can come up above your chin for warmth, or if that's just your vibe. But I fold mine over. This is the perfect addition to any closet. It is not super tight fit but it is figure flattering."
5.0,"The way these give a pop of color peeking out from my sneakers during jogs is just so cute. They're very comfortable and make the morning jog comfortable. They don't slip down and long runs aren't a problem, my heels don't even get tore up like they used to w/ my old socks. Really great jogging socks!"
5.0,I just them for a baking class and the kids at my job loved them

5.0,The first time a girdel actually flattened my stomach.
5.0,"Great watch, looks real nice as well. My only issue is the band is pretty thick leather and it's difficult to bend the end to set in band holder at the end, but not enough to lower my rating"
5.0,Original pero un poco d√©bil la tela pero es original
5.0,Bought one for my two teenagers and husband! They love it!! Very nice quality hat with nice sound.  I'd definitely but again.

5.0,The pj fit me pretty good.
5.0,Very attractive. Received many compliments!
5.0,"Very happy with these, I have annoyingly beefy calves and I am pleased that these do not feel like they are cutting all of my circulation off as soon as I put them on. Now, after sleeping in them a few hours, I can feel it, but that goes away quickly if I pull them down and then they are kind enough not to de-circulate my ankles in that position.<br /><br />FUN colors. Playful but not trite. A really good package! No regrets."
5.0,"Love these owl necklaces...so cute with a t-shirt or a nice blouse.  Heavy weight material, not cheap or flimsy...great price too!"

5.0,Very beautiful and very well made! I love them!
5.0,"I beat up my runners and therefore my socks take a pounding. I got about 12 months of good wear from the last 3 pair, so I purchased 9 more pair and was so happy when they arrived. Who knew socks could make a grown man so happy."
5.0,"Oh, how I love this purse! I previously wore a Vera Bradley crpssbody, but then I began bullet journaling and I wanted domethong that could keep my journal separate from my wallet & keys. The compartments are the perfect size to hold a planner with any tools you feel like carrying. I keep some colored pencils in that spot. In the middle section, I throw my gym lock & lifting gloves. It's a great, functional bag. I really like the color of my grey & gold bag. The shimmer is not too much and the gold accents help me wear it with every outfit."
5.0,This shirt is so soft and comfy.  The little cuff on the sleeve is just the right touch to make it seem a little dressier than a T-shirt.  Works well for after Christmas also.
5.0,Is so cute good quality  my daughter love the sparkly

5.0,"Looks better than expected,  sturdy for sure. Can't go wrong."

I'm a 40B bra and I have a 42 inch waist. This piece fits big girls too!<br />It was minimally scratchy, it's stretchy, and it was pretty easy to put on despite how confusing it looked when I pulled it out of the package."
5.0,"Nice hat, almost to nice to wear. Material looks glossy, which is nice but now I don't wanna wear it."
5.0,It's suuper comfy and it's breathable

5.0,"I've owned many watches. My Seiko was wonderful. But when the calendar ran out, no way to reprogram for the future. I've also owned a 1K watch, very disappointed. This Citizen turned out to be the VERY BEST watch I have come across. Would but it again in a minute."
5.0,"This is truely a beautiful pendant.... looks much better than pictured..... Comes with a sterling silver 18"" chain that is very nice, but I have a sterling 2.3mm bead ball chain that this pendant looks great with... I give this a five star rating!!!"
5.0,Cute but small. Had to re-order larger size.
5.0,I was looking for a dark house coat and they seem hard to find. I don't usually order clothes on line because I never know what size to get. This is a little big but for an house coat I really don't mind. Love the big pockets . I've had mine for a while now and it washes very well. Very well made.
5.0,"Nice bracelet, you can feel the healing properties the second you put it on."
5.0,"I ordered this and was skeptical about whether it will fit me or not. But when I received it, it fits perfectly well."
5.0,Love this for kids!
5.0,"These are really cute earrings.  They are not too big and not heavy at all.  They look and feel just right.  I wore them out to a semi-formal work event and received a lot of compliments.  I will wear them again to the office Christmas party next month and at any other events I can slip them on for. If you are looking for a cute, inexpensive earring for all your upcoming holiday parties, or winter weddings I recommend this one."

5.0,"**Update**<br />After reviewing my band V-Moro reached out to me apologizing for the trouble I had experienced and offered me a refund of my money and a new free at cost band of a new material. I am very satisfied with their customer service and recommend them to anyone looking for a new band for their watch.<br /><br />The band matches my gear s2 perfectly, and since it came with the tools to adjust the links it also fits me perfectly too. Only downside for me is that the clasp that opens to put on the band is made of stainless stell as stated on it and it's causing a reaction on my skin, preventing daily use."
5.0,Looks an awful lot like my cat. I love it.
5.0,Many compartments to hold lots of stuff. Great for an on the go Mommy like myself; I can just cross it over my shoudler and still chase my toddler with no problems!
5.0,"These boots are similar to Bogs.  They are water-tight, warm,  and are really cute.  The only thing I would change is to make them a little shorter.  They come just below my son's knee."
5.0,"Easy to use, appears to be stretching my hat gently.  It is working."
5.0,Great top for yoga!
5.0,"Great sweater, soft, fashionable and comfortable. However there were no labels on the sweater. Not the designer label nor the washing instructions label, therefore i have no way of knowing if this is a fake"

5.0,"Did you know that &#34;taco cat&#34; spelled backwards is &#34;taco cat?&#34;<br />I purchased this as a gift and had it shipped directly to my giftee. Was bummed that gift receipt or gift wrapping was not available (I didn't want him to see how much I paid for it) but eh, what can you do. The recepient of my gift has told me the tie was very well received. I even got a small photo shoot with the tie and different shirts. Even a superman style shot! (His favorite &#34;techno kitty shirt and the tie)."
5.0,"She loves it,but she haven't wore it yet"
5.0,"Quality seems good. I am using for a trip in a couple weeks, so I will see if zippers last."

5.0,Great beanie logo looks amazing!
5.0,Bought this ring for my girlfriend and she loves it.
5.0,Excellent chain! It is hard to clean in the little crevices and what not but that‚Äôs because of the style of chain. People leaving bad reviews because it tarnished need to do some research!! It‚Äôs silver and silver Will tarnish! Buy stainless steel if you don‚Äôt want a chain that tarnishes. I‚Äôve had several local jewelry shops just give me the polishing cloths to clean it too. If you wear it a lot just give it a good wipe down with one of those cloths and it brings the shine right back to it. Stop leaving bad reviews because you don‚Äôt know what your buying! Silver tarnishes folks!
5.0,Received scarf just as the weather was warming up and it was ready to start dressing for Spring.  Perfect colors!  Super price!

5.0,"LOVES it, not the highest of quality but you'll get some wears out this top :) Fits as expected and it will hold up after washing but it doesn't offer much support, you'll be able to wear a bra with this no problem which is great since you really get no support."

5.0,"Haven't had a chance to use the umbrella yet, but I know that Totes makes good products"
5.0,"cute for the price and the rust color will be super cute for fall. nice material, stretchy but not too tight fitting. i am usually a small and i got a medium and i am glad i did. I could have fit into the small, but it would have been more bodycon style and not flattering"
5.0,"These worked better than I thought they would. They initially felt odd behind my ears, but I quickly adjusted. They really help keep my glasses from sliding."
5.0,Excellent!! That‚Äôs a keeper!.
5.0,"Great quality leather slip on loafers for boys. My son loves it. Very comfortable, very soft. Looks stylish. I'm impressed."

5.0,I love it and I  can't wait to take on vacation
5.0,"My 15yo lost his last cross necklace and had asked for another one. I ordered this and when I handed it to him, he just glanced at it. A short time later he came back and asked if I knew it had writing on it and I just smiled. He said it was really cool, liked the verse, and likes that black steel look. He does like to wear a shorter necklace, so I shortened the chain up for him, that‚Äôs a personal preference and not an issue with the necklace."
5.0,"Nice shirt, runs a little small"
5.0,My favorite so far as I love stars
5.0,"This watch is the perfect size, not too big not too small.  I can easily see the time without reading glasses.  The face glows in the dark.  And the watch is thin so your shirt cuffs easily slide over it.  I searched a lot to find a watch thin enough and inexpensive before I found this one.  It's too bad it's not still availble."
5.0,"My three-year-old wanted stick-on earrings, and I had a hard time finding any in stores. Luckily I found these because they are exactly what we were looking for: simple sparkly shapes in a range of colors. We love them!"
5.0,Just what I wanted like
5.0,I received this product free of charge with the promise of writing an honest and unbiased review. This is the first time I have done this and was not sure what to expect.  I was surprised to receive the necklace promptly and to see it's quality.  It is a beautiful piece - exactly like as pictured. I have worn it twice and received so many compliments.  The necklace it truly a sparkling eye-catcher and could be worn for special events.  It is stunning when worn against black.

5.0,My wife enjoyed this purchase.
5.0,Awesome world map! My daughter and I love keeping track of all the countries we‚Äôve visited!
5.0,so cute and fit well true to size
5.0,The construction is really good and the fit is even better. All the toes fit perfectly and the profile is low enough to be hidden by most shoes but not so low that it slips off the heel or is uncomfortable.
5.0,looks good just like the picture.
5.0,Its a shirt... it looks like the picture... and i like it better than a couple others.
5.0,"i ordered this because i kept losing my tongue rings all of these are so pretty, now instead of missing pieces i can rock a different ring everyday!"

5.0,After reading the other reviews and waffling back and forth I finally ordered this shirt.  It's gorgeous!  Fit perfectly and actually designed for the female body.  I didn't have any problems with the buttons and love the French Cuffs.
5.0,"These belts are the only belts my 5 year old can operate by himself. When he started attending a school that required belts as part of the uniform, I worried. But then I found these and our problem was solved!  They are also very well constructed, hold up well, and look great!"
5.0,"My 4-year-old nephew LOVES the watch...he won't even take it off to go to bed! He's learning to read the numbers to tell the time and is quite tickled with himself, as we are!"

5.0,Super comfortable watch band.
5.0,"I got this for my daughter. I am always hesitant to buy clothes on Amazon, but she loved it and it is really soft material."
5.0,I wear this shirt alot in the summer. Comfortable and no issues with shrinking.It fits great and nice thick material.Very comfortable. Holds up good. I had is for a little while now. I would definitely buy again.
5.0,Love it and now one of my favorite shirts!
5.0,Good quality bands. Printing shows up well. They serve to start a lot of conversations.
5.0,These leggings are perfect for Spring athleisure attire!  You can dress them up or down and I sometimes wear them to Yoga.<br />Namaste!
5.0,"these pins are printed very nicely and come with a metal backing. I have put one of them on a regular canvas backpack and it hasn't fallen off nor looked like it was, and i walk a lot from class to class. The only fault I have with this pin is how spun around they get as it can be very annoying that i can't see the cute design in it's intended form. The pins are a decent size and can be admired from a far."
5.0,This shirt fit perfectly and the quality is great ! I can not wait to order more!
5.0,"Love t the e shape,too small, can fit a key and lipstick, not phone"
5.0,Great sunglasses . Are the cheapest ones that owned but my favorites. I will reorder in grey .  They look way expensive that they are .
5.0,I am size 0-2. Quality is as expected. Think it is a good purchase since this design was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping did take couple weeks since it came from mainland China.
5.0,Elegant and beautiful on me. Can‚Äôt wait for the weather to change so I can rock it. Love love love it!
5.0,"Depending on the brand, I am usually either size L or a size XL. I went with the XL with these and I probably should have gone down to the L. However, I can use these as a pair of sledding and shoveling pants so they are going to work fine for me. The shell is extremely waterproof and the fleece lining is warm and feels good on the skin. The front boasts two deep zip up pockets that could easily hold keys, a wallet, or a cell phone. There is a lot of stretch in the waist to ensure a comfortable fit. Also, the pants feature a clasp rather than a button so they're very convenient to put on and take off.<br /><br />The zippers are high quality and the fabric is tough and tear resistant. The pants have some reinforcement on the knees so these are a perfect choice for active outdoor activities. These would be a great pair of pants for snowboarding or winter hiking.  If you live in a cold climate, these pants would make a welcome addition to your wardrobe."
5.0,damn good socks im 5'1 117lbs and they fit amazingly
5.0,"These are so cute and fit just right with the perfect length (not too short where it's hugging your knee caps, but not too long that they might as well be pants). I like the fit too, they don't flare out at the bottom so it's a nice flattering fit. Great for work, the material is soft and stretchy! I've bought several different pairs of pants from this brand now, you can't beat the price either!"
5.0,I love it! It's so soft and light which makes it comfortable enough to wear during the summer if you want. The ghosts on it are adorable and the purple on the scarf is more noticeable than the picture shows but it's not incredibly bright.
5.0,I love it. It's a very unique dress and I've received many compliments.
5.0,Just what I was looking for! Very durable and should last for years!
5.0,Super useful for marking kids shoes. Very resistant to every day wear and even when they get wet. Love these labels and have them in all my kids shoes.
5.0,Beautiful and fits smaller heads. Had no problem reshaping after folding. Great buy for the price. It will completely keep the sun of your face! Also can be used for fancy dress attire
5.0,"It is so hard to order a large sized ring ""online"" but we just got tired of going to this jewelry store and that one. The diamonds really sparkle which accents the solid square gold background, and the sides equal out the other two for a real appealing overall look.  We are so happy we took the risk to order online.  We both love his ring."
5.0,"Wish I had these before I retired. Perhaps my knees would have not been replaced. But, I enjoy the comfort so much, I own six pairs. Thank you Vionic."
5.0,"Definitely size one up when ordering these, but once you do, you will love them! I wear a size 9, but ordered a 10. I wear them out every weekend and dance for hours without a problem. I love them and always get lots of compliments. (I am not an exotic dancer, just out having fun)<br />I am fit but trim, my legs are muscular but not thick. I'm 5'9&#34; 125# and they fit great, if this helps.<br />These boots are sexy AF, and you'll feel fabulous wearing them.  Be prepared for a TON of compliments!<br />Trust me on this, you want them!!"
5.0,I love this dress! This is my designated job interview outfit because it makes me feel so pretty and confident. Only problem at all is if you are a little heavier (like me) the pockets made my hips look even wider. Problem solved with a cute shrug though üòä
5.0,"I‚Äôm always unsure about buying things online, because they NEVER fit right. But these surprisingly do, and I‚Äôm extra happy the pads come out!!<br />I‚Äôm a 36C and bought a large."
5.0,I love love love this thermal shirt. Best thing about it it is soft. Wifey likes soft.
5.0,"Very nice quality fabric, Workmanship is good. I love it!"
5.0,Love my natural straw panama hat
5.0,I like these knit gloves because they keep my hands warm and aren't overly tight.
5.0,"Love this, it is big and it does glow in the dark.  Came in time and was very well packaged!!!"
5.0,Great looking for the money!!
5.0,"Can wear it different ways, has tie belt too! Gonna buy another!"
5.0,"I'm petite, it's a little wide for me, but overall happy with the purchase."
5.0,Bought these for my husband. Fit arm of glasses perfectly. Much better than the ones that hang down from the middle.
5.0,"Material very beautiful and fit perfectly,I got lot of compliment for this dress"
5.0,"They're a little thin, but they're fine.They're socks."
5.0,These work great for making 1&#34; bottle cap magnets! Super easy to use and look great.
5.0,I bought this to sleep with my long curly hair down. The wide band makes it very comfortable.
5.0,Looks great and just the right size for carrying keys around. Nice sturdy design that I hope will last for a long time
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. My husband loved it
5.0,"Gift for daughter. She loved it! She‚Äôs been wanting something similar!  It‚Äôs held up nicely. The quality is spectacular, and the Rose gold plating hasn‚Äôt faded at all!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful piece, it looks fabulous.  My niece was wearing it during the holidays and I had to have it; I bought two, one as a gift."
5.0,"Looks great, others want to order this watch for themselves"
5.0,Love the feel of the material and the shirt is very comfortable.  I plan on buying all the colors!
5.0,I absolutely love this!<br /> My husband got it for me as a mother‚Äôs day gift. It‚Äôs gorgeous and the quality of the pendant is wonderful. However the chain was very cheap and I was not pleased with that at all. I just when and got a chain I liked.
5.0,Great material love the fit
5.0,"Good fit, ordered a medium for 5'8&#34; 148lbs. Pretty cute even when worn at full length."
5.0,"Good gosh some people can‚Äôt be happy with anything! I work outside and freeze my butt off most of the time disassembling gigantic pieces of metal and rebuilding them and these stop the wind from cutting my ears off! I have a big head and they still fit well, I guess if you have a very oval head they wouldn‚Äôt work well as some reviewers have said in other words.<br /><br />But I love them they have been a lifesaver more than a few times and stopped ear aches and runny noses! Thank goodness for this product in the -20 degreee weather! (Adjusted with wind chill factor)<br /><br />They are adjustable too which is GREAT! üëç"
5.0,I've been addicted to watching oyster openings on Facebook. I didn't want to spend that type of money and thought I'd try this.<br />I AM SO IMPRESSED and got a beautiful peach pearl.<br />My daughter and I even made our own silly video opening it lol.<br />I do plan to get more! Super impressed!!!!!
5.0,Plantar faciaitis feeling better after a couple days wearing these.
5.0,This top fits perfect and love the way it feels and looks. I will buy again
5.0,"I really loved this product, so easy to use, perfect size, good quality! And loved the color too!"
5.0,This item arrived on time. It fits well and it will really be useful this winter
5.0,"Fits great! I ordered a size 4/6 based on the size chart (my waist is 27 inches, hips 37 inches). There is a little extra room around the waist but that's perfect for tucking shirts in. The skirt is very soft and looks much more expensive than it is. It's nice and thick material and long enough on my short frame (I'm 5'1) to be appropriate for any occasion. Love it and def recommend!"
5.0,"I love, love, love this purse! Perfect size for me and my busy life style and if I don't want to carry a large load I can take out the smaller purse  that nestles inside the purse and it comes with an even small one (I use as a coin and card purse). I get a lot of compliments on this purse."
5.0,I am very pleased with this watch band. The quality is better than expected. The finish is a near perfect match to my galaxy watch. It comes with a very thick protective plastic to keep from scratching until you receive it. I like it because it is a different link pattern than most watch bands. My only concern is for people who have very large wrists (over 8 in. or 23 cm). I am an average size man and used it as it came and it fit perfectly. If you have extremely large wrists then I would ask the seller for a couple extra links.
5.0,"Great product, the polarized lens are perfect for the beach."
5.0,The product has a very good light material and the craftsmanship is very good too.<br />This product is the second item I had purchased from Grace Karin on Amazon. They both fit perfectly and the quality is exeptional considering the price.
5.0,Bought these for a gift. They seemed durable and good quality. Granddaughter love them
5.0,I like It !
5.0,Beautifully made... comfortable to wear.
5.0,Love the dress‚Äînice fabric and it fits true to size
5.0,"A tad small but my favorite sundresses are these. Super comfy nd great material. Just don‚Äôt dry , it will shrink"
5.0,"I have had these glasses for about a year and felt compelled to write a review due to my experience.  These are truly a pair of quality sunglasses with great fashion appeal.  Previously, I had a pair of Ray Bans which were more expensive and yet of poor quality.  They were made of plastic and the area above the nose cracked after only a few months of use.  These Carrera's are made of metal and the only issue I've had is that occasionally the lenses pop out if you drop them from height.  They are easy to insert so this isn't a big deal.  I've gotten numerous comments on how fashionable the glasses are, so you don't sacrifice form for function.  I highly recommend this product."
5.0,S√∫per suave y calentita
5.0,One of the few masks I can wear that don't hurt my ears and it doesn't give me the suffocating feeling like a lot of the other masks.
5.0,Liked the fit also color..No dislike at all
5.0,"Comfy, pretty, and a silky fabric. What's not to like?"
5.0,Easy on and off. Nonslip texturized bottom. Keep feet warm and prevents blisters from flippers.
5.0,works great; no messy paste or water
5.0,"You may laugh, but I bought this to work in an area of my yard that I have to keep poison ivy under control.  Also we have snakes in our area.  Not a fisherman.  It works great and I feel safe in it.  When I laught to a friend what I had bought, she didn't think it was funny but actually a smart idea."
5.0,"Great fabric, good length for wearing with leggings or jeans during the fall weather"
5.0,"I bought this case back in April. Use it every day and there is some wear at the corners now, to be expected. I also take the phone in and out daily as a plain cover is easier to use at home. The holder in this case still holds securely. It is easier to get phone in and out than some envelope type cases I have had. Buying a second one. Only wish there was greater color selection. Otherwise, case is the best you're going to find if you want one that protects your phone without the cost of an Otterbox plus can hold ID, a few cards and money."
5.0,I got the one in Natural. Very beautiful and very spacious!
5.0,"N95s can be a pain to find, and expensive, and last I checked, KF94s (which have a 94% rather than 95% block rate, hence the name) are sufficient for all current variants, but regular flu masks are not, so they tend to be the main mask I use. They also come with a little plastic clip for the straps, so you can clip it behind your head instead of behind your ears - particularly useful if you need it for a full work shift and not just a store run, as you won't have them tugging on your ears the whole time. It also seems to form a bit of a tighter seal, so I always use the clip regardless.<br /><br />Do note that KF94s come in 3 sizes, so make sure you get the one that's actually going to fit your head. Also, make sure whatever brand you get is KFDA approved and made in Korea - Chinese knockoffs of both these and N95s are often garbage that fails to actually meet the standard."
5.0,These were amazing. Beyond my expectations. Pictures do not do them justice. They are a good necklace size.
5.0,Nice size for a man. Husband loves them. Durable
5.0,Really sturdy and holds all my keys in place. Also available in really cute colors and designs.
5.0,Awesome socks cant find in stores
5.0,"The key fobs arrived in perfect condition. I ordered the shiny silver hardware, and that is exactly what I received. The directions were easy to understand. I did practice a few times before I really got the hang of it. They are exactly what I wanted."
5.0,I love this swimsuit! It's a one piece but doesn't look like an old lady suit! It has a great classic look to it!
5.0,Really comfy and soft! Will go great with my Cbone Pokemon cosplay.

5.0,Love it. Just as shown. And really enjoy the adjustable links üëçüèº
5.0,"It came WAY earlier than expected- 3 weeks, to be exact. It's soft, cute, and it even has a bit of pink for the inside of the ears.<br />It's become my new favorite jacket for cold weather, and it looks absolutely adorable with my bunny earmuffs! It's amazing quality<br />for the price-  the outer fabric feels very soft and fuzzy. The inside is white and feels like a satin-sort-of fabric. It isn't particularity<br />designed for harsh winters-  it's not very heavy. If you live in a cold climate, this is more of a fall jacket. I, however, live in a place<br />that only hits around 40-70 degrees in the winter, so I'm extremely excited for when the temperature drops from 100 degrees Fahrenheit<br />to 60.<br /><br />Would I Buy This Again?: If I wanted to buy it for a friend as a gift, I wouldn't even hesitate!<br /><br />Would I Buy From This Seller Again?: Of course!<br /><br />Do I Regret This Purchase?: Not at all.<br /><br />(I apologize for the low-quality photos- it was late at night. I will update them later.)"
5.0,The headwear is very good sound quality and touch sensitivity
5.0,"This glass is very fit my face, I'v tried other glasses but they always small or heavy, this glass is the best glass i ever used."
5.0,"I purchased a medium I'm 5'3&#34; with 34DD and a baby belly that I'm still trying to work off. This dress hid the not-so-great areas and I get tons of compliments evey time I wear it. Very tempted to purchase another, this dress is going to get a lot of use."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äù2‚Äô 180 lbs and I got a large and it fits great! I got the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù which is blue and the purple which the top half is pink but regardless they are my new favorite dresses!!!! It hides my gut as best it can be hidden and the length is great! I just need to wear a comfortable heel with it.
5.0,"i am a Certified Licensed Athletic Trainer and Emergency Medical Technician of thirty years.  The size is perfect for sideline injury management and also as an emergency trauma kit. The construction rivals the more expensive types that you see at the college and pro level but at a third of the price.  There is plenty of room to  hold everything I need for both settings. Good work.<br /><br />Chris Thein, MS, LATC, NREMT"
5.0,100% Great Product So far! I‚Äôve just started wearing my Fairy Black Mother Dreadlock Cap as of today..<br />I will give you a update later on next couple of weeks<br />So far very very comfortable slept in this cap for at least 4 hours! Never had to reposition this cap!
5.0,"I don‚Äôt usually purchase undergarments online unless I am familiar with the brand.  I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect with these, but was very happy I‚Äôd taken the chance after inspecting them.<br /><br />The color variety is very nice and each color is bright.  They are well made and stitched evenly.  The leg holes are both a perfect size and the elastic isn‚Äôt too tight.  The designs are very pretty too.  Although you don‚Äôt get to choose each design I was very happy with what I received.<br /><br />I ordered a large because I don‚Äôt like for my undies to be too tight and they fit great.  While they are ‚Äúhipster‚Äù they don‚Äôt go up too high.  Nor do they go below areas that need to be covered up.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with these. They are very comfortable and soft.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,This a beautiful and comfortable shoe.
5.0,Just the right small size.
5.0,"Looked great, design was intricate, and held up well during lots of dancing and activity."
5.0,Kids love these!!!
5.0,Not cheap but works well and the colors are cool....work outdoors a lot in Summer and was tired of yearly sun burns on the back of my neck....don't know if the sun is brighter now... or if it's age related.....no issues this year......even wear them in Fall and will this Winter....cuts down on the wind.....d

5.0,These capris fit perfectly.  they are not too tight but have enough support to give a smooth line.
5.0,Great for pregnancy and flying
5.0,Fit perfect. I was able to work an entire bar shift with no problem. I have to wear a mask at work due to the plandemic bs.
5.0,I have a huge laundry basket and the handles have long since broken off. I got this as a replacement and it works well and looks good. The handle clips fit into the weave of the basket perfectly.

5.0,"Soft, comfortable and easy wear...ALL is GOOD!"
5.0,"Extremely pleased with these computer glasses.  Just couldn't be happier.  I also ordered much more expensive glasses at the same time, which were also an excellent product.  However; did not see a huge difference, except for a touch more glare reduction on the expensive ones.  Five star product and company.  More value than you pay."
5.0,"I have a pretty irregular hourglass shape that usually makes dresses too small in the busy but too large in the waist. I was pleasantly surprised that with this dress that problem was minimal! Honestly, it fit pretty much perfect with my bust. The slit up the front is amazing. Dramatic but not uncomfortable. I highly recommend adding a belt if you‚Äôre an hourglass. Turned heads all night."
5.0,"Got this for a Halloween bakugou cosplay. It's perfect. Vibrant color and sturdy spikes. Adjustable size. I added a light chain in the front, which is pulling on the front slightly. Word of caution, sensitive skin people- it's a comfortable choker, but for me it leaves an irritation mark on the edges due to the material. Goes away with a little bit of time."
5.0,This product was just perfect for jewelry I made. They also came in just in time for my project. Thanks
5.0,"Great sun hat. The first one was so nice (and a great price) so I bought another in a different color. It doesn't make me hot like other hats have, and it does a great job keeping the sun off my face; looks cute too! Folds easy for packing & doesn't leave wrinkles/crush the style."
5.0,These earrings are so cute!! I got the white & they go with a lot. They are lightweight & the perfect size.

5.0,I like everything about it it fits very well I‚Äôm very comfortable I love it
5.0,"If you love something different, you will love this.  I ordered a second, slightly larger to wear on different fingers.  color is great.  indent of rose is not really shown to true beauty in pictures.  is much better in person.  very substantial and heavy piece.  receive compliments.  but I love it.  love, love and love again.  wear it very often.  so glad I ordered."
5.0,"It met my expectations a lot. I love it, now I can take out links myself with going to the Jeweler."

5.0,"my husband wanted sweatbands and alot of them bought a pack of these and orange ones, he is a happy man"
5.0,I love this suit!  I was afraid it would be too big as I normally wear a size 4 or 6 in most things but the fit is great!  I really liked the padded push up bra as it enhances my figure.  I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 115 pounds and this suit fit great in a size 8.  My husband loved it and said I should get another one!
5.0,These earrings are just too cut I bought them for my little niece's birthday can't wait to see face.
5.0,These are fantastic. Love the colors and the top and bottom ribbing doesn't roll or pinch. Great support! Highly Recommend.
5.0,"Initially I ordered the purple pair and received black instead. The following day I returned them (the return process was SUPER easy) and within 2 days I had the proper replacement. I'm very happy with these. Simple, stylish, and I love that there's no tint on the lens. Thank you!"

5.0,I love my chic earrings!!!!
5.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Very high quality dress, looks like a much more expensive dress than what we paid, and is definitely higher quality than many of the dresses we saw in the mall.  I have bought formal dresses for my daughter from Amazon in the past and they have always fit well buying standard sizes, but since this was for her prom we paid extra for the custom sizing and it fits her so well I am glad we did.  The beading on top is so pretty, super sparkly under the lights which she loves.  It has as short train on the back which we weren't expecting buy my daughter loves.  My daughter is 5'10&#34;, 140 pounds, 34C bra, athletic build.  Normally wears size 6 jeans.  She did not need a bra with this dress, the top was thick enough.  The part that goes over the shoulders is slightly sheer.  Customer service was amazing, contacted us right away for measurements, and shipped the dress really fast.  Would definitely recommend this seller, and would buy again.<br /><br />EDIT- the pics inside were from my cheap camera phone and make the dress look a bit more purple.  the pic outside was taken with my husbands nice camera and is a truer representation of the color."
5.0,Si muy c√≥modo
5.0,These type of pants seem to be the only kind that I‚Äôve been wanting to wear this summer. They‚Äôre loose on my legs I don‚Äôt have to worry about them feeling tight after I eat. They are so breathable as well.
5.0,Super warm and well made
5.0,"This has everything I like in a dress an A-line with short sleeves to cover the top of my arms and pockets!  It's so cute on, I feel the waist could use a little more definition but that solved easily with a little lemon yellow belt or a wide black belt.  You could dress it up or down.  This dress is a little snug on me right now but doesn't look unflattering.  The fabric is pretty forgiving.  It would be cute combined with a little cardigan and dressed up with some strapped black heels or dressed down with ballet slipper type shoes."
5.0,Comfiest sure I've ever worn ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"Love the Amber tint. Comfy fit, sharp style. Winner!"
5.0,Got them for my girl...she absolutely loves them...only set she wears anymore
5.0,I really like these pants. They are very breathable and great for work.
5.0,"Five stars is not enough. I have so many nice things to say but can‚Äôt write it all lol. Comfortable and extremely beautiful. I normally wear medium to large but only xlarge was available, I purchased it but it‚Äôs too big üò©üòû I wear 10 on top and 12 on bottom. I kept pulling the belt tight to fitüòÅ. I will keep and wear it. BEAUTIFUL AND CLASSY. I weigh 189 pounds if that‚Äôs useful to anyone."
5.0,"mild fabric flaws in coloring, but not very noticeable. I ordered 2 sizes larges than what I would buy from Kohl's and the dress fit perfectly."
5.0,"This bracelet is nice, I really wasn‚Äôt expecting the quality. It came in a nice package even comes with a suede case to keep it in. It‚Äôs not a flimsy cheap metal, the stone is good quality too. It will go great with anything to stack other bracelets or watch."
5.0,Perfect! Very thick padding on the bottom where you need it. Warm!
5.0,Nice blue color cabochon surrounded by shinny stones.  Exactly as pictured.  Ring is true to size with the center about 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch.
5.0,The material is so light and cozy!
5.0,Thank you! Great service.  Perfect quality
5.0,Very happy with this purchase. All cages are good quality
5.0,My sister likes its pastel leather cover. It adds a nice fashion to her everyday style.
5.0,"I like it true to size, same as picture, very beautiful"
5.0,"Beautiful quality hat shipped in a box to protect it, unlike other seller's that ship in plastic envelope. Id buy again from this seller."
5.0,"Update: Was told that the blue flower dress looked amazing and ""hit in all the right places"" so even if it felt tight, apparently it looked super cute. :) I ended up buying a third dress, the black with red flowers.<br /><br />Really cute! I took a risk ordering an XXL given the size chart. I'm 52-42-52 and normally a size 20 (size chart says 14-16 for an XXL). 5'3 245 lbs 46DDD. I bought the black dress with the extra straps and the blue flower dress with normal straps. Both hit just above my knee, perfect length.<br /><br />The material is very stretchy to accommodate. It fits a little tight but not as bad as I was expecting. It clings to my hips a little but with black/print dresses you don't really notice. I think lighter colors would be a lot less flattering on bigger bodies.<br /><br />Not bad for the price, great casual dress. I will say the fabric is THIN, I took a pic holding out up to a window and you can see the shelves behind it through the fabric.<br /><br />Also HOT TIP LADIES: Your underwear has to match your SKIN COLOR, not the fabric color, in order to be invisible under clothes.  White underwear under a white dress will still show. I keep seeing that in reviews so I felt like it needed to be said."
5.0,Good small bag
5.0,Pretty and cozy!
5.0,"Yes, I can‚Äôt wait to give it to my granddaughter."
5.0,Cute and fits great.

5.0,Excellent product and a value for the price.
5.0,Nice looking and comfortable to wear. I‚Äôm really happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I loved this product! I went through the reviews & decided to get a size up & im glad I did it fit perfectly! it has a tie string on the inside of the pants so you can tighten the waist, it also has pockets. This product is for shorter people since its pretty short but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I definitely recommend this for people 5‚Äô4 or under!"
5.0,Extremely soft and very comfortable lounge pants. Fits perfectly not too long like some pants I have purchased at department stores.
5.0,"I had an initial ring, necklace and bracelet and these earrings go perfectly with my set"
5.0,"As described, thanks!!!"

5.0,purchase.is well worth it.
5.0,just beautiful. love them very comfertable don't know they are in my ear.
5.0,Product received was just like advertised. Seem to be a quality product. Will make some little girls happy on Valentine's Day.
5.0,Shufu
5.0,Superb quality!
5.0,I love this! you can dress it down or up and the material good for the price.
5.0,I loved the simple design so that's the main reason I bought it. It is true to size and washes up really well.
5.0,LOVE this swimsuit! The material is a little but the price is unbeatable!! I thought I would never find a swimsuit that was supportive AND flattering but this is perfect!! I'm a size 12-14 and I ordered the XL.
5.0,Pretty good quality. This is now my second of these vests. The first I used regularly kayak fishing in South Florida with no problem. I took a break from kayaking for a bout a year and left the vest out in the Florida sun and rain. A year later the zips still work no problem. One of the straps broke (expected) and there was a bit of fading (expected)  but I figured they zips would have rusted and the jacket would be unsusable... but they did not. These are absolute quality and would recommend. If u actually care for your jacket properly (unlike me) this would last a long time.  I'm 210 lb male.. jacket fits great. Very comfortable and will definitely hold my weight if I needed to float. I can see no reason to pay 3 to 4x as much for a simple life jacket.<br /><br />Also many pockets and nice if you just need a simple no frills life jacket for kayak fishing.  As I mentioned earlier I left my jacket outside in the South Florida sun and rain for a year and the fishing hooks I had inside the front pockets did not rust out. I thought they would be a rusty mess but they were protected enough to not get wet. I really can't ask for more out of a jacket for this price.
5.0,LOVE these jeans!!!!!‚ù§
5.0,"Absolutely love these. The ones on a chain always pulled my hair. These are light weight and because it's braided, no hair pulling !"
5.0,Bought for my son. He loves them! They are  his favorite pair.
5.0,This is so pretty! It does run big so based on other reviews I ordered a small and it is just right. I am 5'0 and usually wear a 6-8.
5.0,Well made. Classic look.
5.0,I use them for driving
5.0,The only chaps that match my HD vintage looking jacket.
5.0,"As promised, as delivered."
5.0,I love it I was not disappointed at all !
5.0,I love wearing them . Super comfortable.
5.0,"Totally worth the price. The band looks way better than the original one my Timex Expedition [...]  came with. The band looks exactly as pictured in the product description. it is genuine leather with white cross-stitching. Be aware that the band is very thick, so I do not recommend for women's watches or men with slimmer wrists."
5.0,These are great! I break out in anything that has cheap alloys (eg nickel) and I have been wearing these nonstop for almost a month with no problems. The backs are small but I haven't had any issues with them staying on‚Äìthey fit tightly.
5.0,"First of all, I'd like to say that the seller shipped these very quickly. When I went to check the mail, I was pleasantly surprised to find them in there! I ordered this and a few other pieces. Let me agree with other reviewers here by saying that these pieces are beautiful. The weight is wonderful and the stone pieces are vibrant and colorful. Will order again!"
5.0,"excellent indeed exactly what I was looking for, best qality. It can be the perfect present to a friend as  well."
5.0,I‚Äôve been using these socks for about 4 months now and they have held up to washing and drying. I‚Äôve tried not to put them in the dryer but honestly most of the time I forget to take them out and they get tossed into the dryer with everything else.<br />I‚Äôve bought some expensive compression socks and these are the same quality. They are tight fitting. You can put them on as you would normal socks. Use the directions on how to properly roll them up your foot/leg.<br />Overall I‚Äôd say they are well worth it.
5.0,Great product. Packaging was excellent. Easy on and off for the dog. Love the matching vest for me!
5.0,Just adorable! My 11-year-odl loves it! It does run a bit small so order up - but order! It's really cute.
5.0,"Thin material, good for a light jacket. Fits very nicely! Very colorful back, looks awesome!!!"
5.0,These are the nicest set of underwear I have purchased yet.  I love love love that the elastic area near the groin is fabric covered.  My 5 yo daughter has worn several sizes (and designs) over the past two years.  They are sturdy and wash well too!
5.0,"Great quality, looks great. Great price. Great customer service."
5.0,"Much smaller than I expected however, it is very cute!"
5.0,The shirt was exactly what is pictured. Arrived on time. I wanted it to be loose... so I ordered a large... but I should of ordered a medium MAYBE a small. Don‚Äôt size up. True to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 122lbs and it was very big.
5.0,Gifted to niece. Loved it and fit amazingly
5.0,Love these! Comfortable
5.0,My fourth pair of these socks!  Love them!
5.0,I wear the necklace every day and never take it off.  It doesn't catch on my clothes and goes with everything.
5.0,Very good quality and true to size
5.0,These fit great! I‚Äôll be buying more for sure
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my wife.  She prefers this style of night gown- warmer than open shoulder top and comfortable without binding in sleep.
5.0,"I purchased a diifferent silver anchor from a company out of Haiwii, and it was flimsy and far more expensive than this one. For $12 this is a well made, sturdy piece. I have a son in the Navy, and I am very glad this anchor is nice to look at and as mentioned, sturdy. I wear it every day."
5.0,Good styling with side panel and buttons
5.0,I love this dress but it‚Äôs really short! I use mine as a beach coverup because it‚Äôs too short to wear in public but it‚Äôs still to die for!
5.0,"Just as described this spider added some scare to the Halloween display and for the price, this is the biggest one i found."
5.0,I've had this band for a while now. Seems like a better quality leather than cheaper wrist bands I've bought in the past. Looks sleek with my samsung watch!
5.0,The socks are super comfy and a great value!
5.0,Love this. So adorable
5.0,There are pretty nice. They have grippers on the bottom and stay on my foot nicely. I wear a women's size 10.
5.0,Love them my feet are comfy and warm
5.0,"These heels are great.. very comfortable,the strap over the toes even give a little stretch for extra room and comfort .. I love love love these heels..."
5.0,I love it really pretty
5.0,All my friends think I‚Äôm from the future now. I bought these for Halloween but they are comfy and I look like a cyborg from 2024.
5.0,I bought these earring because I wanted some smaller hoops to wear. These are great! They are very light. My skin isn‚Äôt sensitive to the metal. I love them
5.0,"I was so glad I found this for the price it was! Because it's cheaper than most other sources, I was worried it would be cheap quality but that was not the case at all. It arrived on time with good packaging. It's slightly more tight fitting than a regular t-shirt, but you shouldn't have to order a size up to accommodate. It fit just right!"
5.0,My husband received these slippers as a gift and loved them so much he bought a pair to give to his father! Great support!
5.0,exactly what i wanted. this was the perfect gift and it was amazing quality. took a bit of time but was definitely worth it.

5.0,"it fits well ,colors are nice"
5.0,Love theses perfect for my multiple piercings
5.0,"Bought this to take on my vacation so I could keep my personal items close, and it worked out fantastically! I love the sturdiness and design, and it was big enough to hold my cards, phone, keys and mask while walking around."
5.0,"It was the perfect length for me 5‚Äô3 with short heels. Looks amazing , got tons of compliments, most people couldn‚Äôt believe I got it from amazon. Also Verg comfortable!!"
5.0,High quality and very comfy socks!
5.0,"Beautiful, good quality and easy to use. I've ordered and used two sets for acrylic pouring jewelry. My personal keychain (pictured) has held up well for about four months so far. The pendant trays have a nice depth and the glass cabochons fit snugly."
5.0,I have a few of these in different colors and I've always liked the quality.
5.0,"LOVE this dress! I was so worried buying this but I am so glad I did. I purchased it for my wedding rehearsal and I'm in love. Fits perfectly and runs true to size. I will say unless you are very tall/have very long arms the sleeves are definitely a lot not 3/4 and more like full sleeves, but I just sort of pulled them up to make it shorter. I was worried about it being hot with the longer sleeves but the dress is pretty thin and cool so I think it'll be perfect for all seasons. It IS a little more on the thin and see through side though, so you may want to wear something underneath for extra coverage. Besides that, I definitely recommend!"
5.0,Very cute shoe. Love it
5.0,"It fits very comfortable, looks expensive! Nice choice of stones."
5.0,I love how it fit
5.0,The pattern is so pretty.  It is very comfortable and washes well.
5.0,"This is a sparkly feminine watch, the main features being crystals and black marsacite (spelling?). It it has a smaller face that is easy to read probably because the face itself is plain. The stretch wristband is comfortable and has remained shiny and tarnish-free.  I've had it awhile now and it keeps time perfectly"
5.0,These earrings are awesome! I love how there are different colors so they can go with any outfit! Definitely recommend them and the price is good!
5.0,A weighty bracelet and makes a statement!
5.0,My daughter has developed a onesie addiction. Shes going to love this one! Such a cute design.  Not to mention super soft! I csnt wait to give it to her at Christmas!
5.0,"I love this band.. it‚Äôs super cute, easy to install and the elastic holds it in place nicely.<br />I‚Äôm a bit concerned the white fabric overtime will get dirty but I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything different from any other super expansive band.<br />It‚Äôs very comfortable, I barely remember I‚Äôm wearing it... 5 stars!"
5.0,"Beautiful!!  Very nice quality , packaged well ,necklace is  light weight for a statement necklace ,and made well.<br />Exceeded my expectations ~ looks so much better than ordering image!"
5.0,Super comfy and cute. Washed a few times and still the same size.
5.0,These beads are very nice and I love the colors! Each bead is a little different from the others and I love the silver trim around them. These have been great while making bracelets. Well made and easy to use. I really like these beads.
5.0,"I really love the fit and the look of this shirt. It's very slimming, washes extremely well and is well made. I bought both colors available and wish there were more! It states it's &#34;irregular&#34;, but I have found no flaws at all."
5.0,A well made product
5.0,Hermoso reloj
5.0,These sandals are vey cushy and comfortable.
5.0,I love the dress. This is my first time buying clothes off amazon
5.0,loved these. got the job done
5.0,"Very pleased with the fit of this dress! I knew I was either going to love or hate the twist in the front, and I LOVE it. I am 3 months postpartum so things are on their way back to normal, but definitely not 100% so I was hoping the twist would hide any extra belly and it does! Some reviews I read said otherwise so I was hesitant, but so glad I went for it because it is perfect! Also the buttons are just what I needed to be able to breastfeed my baby and wear a dress at the same time :-) I definitely recommend this dress, especial if you are postpartum/ breastfeeding! I am 5'7 and about 138 pounds in these pictures and I was 123 pounds pre-pregnancy, just to give you an idea of my frame. I ordered a medium and maybe could have gotten away with a small, but I didnt want to wear any sort of spanx under it so I was glad I went with the medium."
5.0,"Its noticeable, but still discreet. Seemed to stay in really well. I slept in them and showered and it didnt fall out."
5.0,Get your true size
5.0,Nice and sturdy for a waxed style bag. Love the zipper
5.0,"Have been looking for chenille robe for my mom that didn't zip or have button. This is PERFECT! My mom is 170 and 5""1"". Falls half way between knee and ankle. Snaps easy. Absolutely beautiful. Actually contemplating getting one for myself.<br />Well made. No complaints."
5.0,Hat is beautiful and good quality for the price.
5.0,Just got them today and will be buying them as mothers day gifts.... They are perfect for the price....
5.0,Got for my son and he loved it!
5.0,ordered large and they are still a little tight...
5.0,"Awesome belt!  High quality and works perfectly.  Looks just like a regular belt when buckled.<br />I have sciatica caused by a damaged vertebrae and I realized a few month ago that when I sat down my old belt would exacerbate the sciatica.  With this belt when I sit down, especially in the car I just tap the release to loosen the belt to a more comfortable setting.  When I stand up it only takes a second to readjust the belt so my pants don't fall down.  It's so quick and easy no one will notice.<br />Why didn't I buy one of these YEARS ago?!?!?!"
5.0,So beautiful. Ladies go and get yours.
5.0,So cute..can't wait to give to my daughter for her birthday.
5.0,Had my lenses put in this frame for a family reunion. Lots of fun! Thanks!
5.0,"fits amazing, modern style, the quality is absolutely amazing, you get more of what you paid for"
5.0,"5'1, 120lbs, 34c and the med fits great. Very modest- perfect for my 3day /week water aerobics. Washed well and holds up great in high calorine. I have the pink which looks just like the pic. I'm ordering another in black."
5.0,Ordered to wear for a wedding and worked awesome!! Danced the whole night and held up the entired night.
5.0,"I never thought of wearing a Buff until I started to watch some of the videos about the Appalachian Trail on Youtube.  I saw some of the hikers wearing these and I did a Google search to see what they were.  I then check out some videos on wearing buffs.  I was so impressed that I decided to give them a try and now I wear them all the time.  Normally,when I'm hiking, I just wear them as a neck warmer but if the wind starts to kick up and my face gets cold then I will pull them up to the bottom of my eyes and they do an amazing job at keeping me warm.  You can also pull them up so it covers your entire head but I haven't tried this yet because if it is that cold I just wear a hat.  but you do have that option.  If you have never tried a Buff before check out some of their videos on how to wear them and then get one of these, They are the best."
5.0,This top is really nice.  The sleeves are lacy but not see through and they fit true to size.  It is so comfortable and hangs long enough where it is very comfortable.  Can be worn dressy or casual.  Great buy for the price too.  Love it.
5.0,My granddaughter looked like a princess!!!
5.0,"These socks are great! These are the only dress socks I have tried that don't make my feet wet! I never worry about foot odor when wearing these. For me, no dress sock stays up on my leg all day, but this one does a pretty good job of trying. The only thing I noticed about these socks that were a little odd was that they were shorter than most of my other dress socks. Great purchase, will be buying another set!"
5.0,"This bracelet is nice. On the rugged side of jewelry and it goes nice with jeans, boots and and any top. I really, really like it. It seems made well and has no chemical smell.<br />Come wrapped in a plastic sleeve together with a velvety feeling pouch. Nice packaging if you intend to use it as a gift. Shipping was swift and on time.<br /><br />Having all this said, it is way too large for my wrist. (See attached picture).  I could actually slip it off if I wanted to. I wore the bracelet all day yesterday, and it being so loose it got caught on to clothing and my bag, etc, and actually unclasped itself. Luckily I didn't lose it. I still give it 5 stars because the product page did list that the length of the bracelet, and had I measure my wrist, the size would have not been a surprise. So take my advise: Do measure your wrist before ordering.<br /><br />Overall a really nice piece, I just wish they offered it in different sizes.<br /><br />Please be aware that I purchased this bracelet at a reduced price in exchange of my objective review reflecting my genuine opinion. I do not reap any benefits by leaving a positive review or any repercussions for leaving a negative review."
5.0,Excellent price and fast service.
5.0,"I bought this BEAUTIFUL necklace set so my daughter and I can have something special to wear as she has started school so we don't feel so far apart during the long school days. Both necklaces are beautiful, elegant looking and super lightweight. They're very durable and you can adjust the size. They're easy to clasp and didn't tangle. I recommend you buy a set for the special little lady and you in your life. It's super special to have an elegant reminder that he bond we share as mother and daughter is strong and breathtaking just like a butterflies designed wings."
5.0,True to pic. Ofc it changes color so be careful if allergic to fake jewelry.
5.0,"I love this print! The shirt itself is a good quality cotton and is a unisex fit. It did take quite a long time to arrive, but was worth the wait."
5.0,The color just as expected and it fits perfectly.  I am going to buy two more sweaters in different colors.
5.0,"Bling bling! This mask is comfy! Took a minute to get here but I forgot I bought it on sale for like 3 bucks and then it came at the perfect time, so the wait wasnt too grueling. Super cute, buy it."
5.0,Bought it for my wife. Perfect fit
5.0,These pants are so comfortable. I ordered 5 more pairs after I received them because they are a great light weight comfortable pant at a great price!!
5.0,Dig the fit.  On point
5.0,I LOVE THEM ALL AND BEST SELLER
5.0,"Purchased these slippers as  gift for our son for Christmas. He was hesitant to wear them at first (loves running around barefoot in the house, like most toddlers) but has grown accustomed to wearing them and now asks us each day to help him put them on. I've been very impressed and surprised of the quality. They have held up thus far to my son's usage and have not faded and torn. They appear to be much better quality then we had originally anticipated. They fit as expected for our little ones feet."
5.0,Awesome belt. The bow is so cute!! Fits perfect!!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! I am a 42DD and I ordered the XXL.  It fits perfectly! The top is stretchy so it fits snuggly and is slightly see through so I'll need to wear a nude bra but that could  be because it is stretching to fit the girls but it is so damn cute on!  The material send to be of a good quality along with the rest of the craftsmanship. Now granted, I have not laundered it but if my opinion changes I will update my review. I can't wait for girls night to wear this thing!"
5.0,Love the quality so much I had to buy a black one also.
5.0,Love the blue color and the case.  Very pretty
5.0,Very well made! Both of my girls loved their dresses! Definitely didn't expect them to as nicely made as they are!
5.0,This is for a stocking stuffer
5.0,"After much research , I've found this version of Sliver Edge very hard to get a hold of.<br />Matte Black frame prizm black polarized are perfect combination Oakley should of made avaliable to all.<br />Anyway many thanks to seller ,They are perfect."
5.0,This outfit is so cute and I cannot wait to wear it on my girls weekend coming up! Good quality and fits true to size.
5.0,"Quick service, my daughter in law loved it!!!"
5.0,Nice bright colors fits prefect
5.0,Cute and adorable!!
5.0,Detailed just as the picture I love it.... So pretty
5.0,"Great hat, high quality."
5.0,These are lovely earrings and the shine is great.
5.0,These pants remind me of $130 G-star pants but are $100 less. The fit is on point!
5.0,I love the way it's made but it's way too big wide and it hangs down to the top of my upper lip. Totally unseemly on my face. I can add pictures if anyone would like to see them
5.0,"These earplugs work well, blocking most noise, and they are so easy to use. I used to use foam ones but they are annoying to insert and come out of place easily. These are a snap to put in. They can be washed and won't get icky as the foam ones do over time and I expect these silicone plugs will last longer. They arrived just in time to use when the Blue Angels were in town!<br />I received a discount with a request for my review."
5.0,They are perfect......
5.0,LOVE THIS !!! THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL!!
5.0,Bought as a gift for my granddaughter and her American Girl Wellie Wisher. They fit perfectly and are very soft.
5.0,These earrings are seriously gorgeous! Lightweight so no pulling on the earlobe and very high quality silver & gold. The tri-color is beautiful and have received many compliments. Makes me feel like I have a little Hawaii with me as I wear them everyday!
5.0,"Little wider than expected, but nice none the less"
5.0,I Love It !!<br />üñ§
5.0,"Nice shirt and print is good , had for a bit now and washed it a 100 times still looks good"
5.0,Love the umbrella. It is very big.<br />Good value for the price<br />It came with the top cracked but the provider sent a replacement part right away. The color is perfect.<br />I am very happy with the purchase!
5.0,Material has elasticity and is very soft. I got this dress in  blush pink. I normally do a medium but had to get a small.
5.0,Love this dress looks great by itself or with a sweater. Photo shoot was amazing in this!
5.0,"The material of these pants are thick but still stretchy. I am 160 pounds and 5' 4&#34; and ordered a L and they fit perfectly and create the illusion of a slimmer silhouette which I love! For winter, I'm going to use them as leggings under my boots too!<br />Disclaimer: I received a discount for these pants in exchange for my honest review"
5.0,I wear a size 8 fitted New Era cap and these fit my &#34;fathead&#34; perfectly! I've received many compliments on their look as well!
5.0,One of my favorite hats to wear out in the sun!<br />Great coverage going down sides and back of neck and does a good job of covering areas in front of face.<br />Love the tie in the back too--makes it look very feminine and adds a little something when worn with jeans and or a dress.  Great price for this hat too!
5.0,Great quality a little small
5.0,"I ordered four of these earrings for my daughter's and nieces. They are super cute. The stones are shiny and didn't notice weak post like other reviewers mentioned. The earrings do come in a cheap plastic bag and the backings aren't the greatest but they work. The earrings are far from perfect , but are awesome for the price. I'd suggest getting a small box from a dollar store or small bag to gift them in. I'm happy for the price"
5.0,Love this shirt and this company! I will purchase from them again. Shirt fit my body perfectly as described. Great deal!
5.0,you sure get looks at the beach...I'm probably not the best model but who cares I like them!
5.0,Fits perfect and absolutely adorable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and about 31 inches around up top. A small fits well and hits exactly where it should.
5.0,"Excellent value, eloquent in appearance"
5.0,product given as a gift.  It looks fine.
5.0,"Just returned from Indonesia.. very long flights! Stockings were comfortable, secure. I hardly thought about them for 22 hours of flight! Legs felt great. Cool design was a fun extra!"
5.0,Nice hat! I wear it a lot üòä
5.0,Love this vest. It's quality made and fit as expected. Washed well!
5.0,Excellent quality! These lined leather gloves fit & look great. Measure hand carefully to assure proper fit.
5.0,"Love this dress ,if they had other colors i would purchase another as well ."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:e9c5fe68df4cc56cd38ac08ce0831365]] Cute little headband halo. The halo connects directly to the headband, so it does sit a little lower and more forward than those styles that are on a post. The lights are pastel colors and blink. It comes ready to go with batteries in. You do have to pull the tab out to engage the batteries."
5.0,"Love these fleece lined clogs. True to size, nice and cozy lining, and you can toss them in a washing machine (in a bag preferably) and keep the lining fresh. Completely waterproof and are great in any weather. Can wear them around the house as slippers too. I‚Äôm buying another pair!!"
5.0,washed very nicely
5.0,"Love it. Lengthwise, its only goes down to just above ur ankles but aside from that it grabs and compliments all the right places"
5.0,"Good quality graphics and shirt.  Bought this as a backup to my first shirt I bought two years ago. Has held up great, but I love it so much I wanted a spare."
5.0,received so many compliments while I was in Hawaii
5.0,This was a gift for my son and he thought it was Awesome. He loved it. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS SHIRT!!! I was skeptical when I ordered it, but because of the novelty of having a built-in mask, I ordered it anyway. The fabric is almost silk like to the touch, and the mask hides itself beautifully when not in use."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my best friend and she adored it, putting it on the moment she saw it. The fabric was really nice too."
5.0,"Very well made shirt. And cute! But the arms were a bit tight and the material is thick. Not great for a summer shirt, but will be perfect come fall and winter. Also, I'm 5'4&#34;. This shirt is quite long on. I'll actually wear this as a dress."
5.0,"Breathtaking! It fits my 2month old comfortably. She was a preemie, born a whole month too early, so it hasn't been easy finding things to adorn her lovely head."
5.0,Shipped super fast. Very carefully made and packaged.
5.0,"As a frequent attendee of EDM events, I'm always on the lookout for new, exciting items that will turn heads at clubs and festivals. These light-up suspenders are incredibly unique and can be paired with a variety of other accessories to make a pretty sweet outfit. They're classy enough to be versatile for more 'regular' events, too.<br /><br />As far as brightness goes, people are definitely going to take notice whenever you're near. Thankfully, the light given off isn't outright blinding; it's the perfect level to get you noticed and light up the space around you without annoying the crap out of everybody. Battery life is also really good considering the small power source.<br /><br />If you want something cool and unique for your next party, give these a shot!"
5.0,"Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of these socks, they're extremely comfortable and feel like they will last for a while. They are a little longer than I would typically wear, but not too long.<br /><br />My only wish is that there was more choice over the designs. While I actually like all of them, I would like to be able to have 2-3 of a couple of the designs."
5.0,Perfect fit.  Great quality.  Love them.
5.0,After I ordered and bought the adults kids Face Covering Face Mask that had Air Force On it and seeing it didn't go above my nose or below my chin and I had to throw it away I ordered this pair of Air Force Face Covering Face Mask From Amazon and it is just what I wanted. I only gave the kids masks a one star but for this pair I am giving it five stars. It not only covers my mouth. It covers my nose and goes around my ears as well as below my chin so this is the best. I am very happy that I got a pair because I did lose on one of them. I can even put it in my washing machine too.
5.0,"Soft, warm, comfortable to wear around the house. I bought another one in a different color and they both fit just fine."
5.0,Looked great on my man!! Everything in the photo came from Amazon!! Couldn't have been happier!
5.0,"Because I'm tall, I use this as a tunic dress with leggings. It's very comfortable and lightweight, but it's not made out of t-shirt material. It fit as I expected, and I really like it."
5.0,I get compliments all the time from this face mask.
5.0,"Perfect! I needed a &#34;wallet purse&#34; to keep in the &#34;giant sac&#34; that I carry around with WAY too much stuff in it. There's enough room for today's enormous phones and all of my wallet paraphernalia‚Äã and even a little extra room for chapstick, keys and a tiny external battery pack - cause you never know when you'll need a charge!"
5.0,"Love this blouse, received many compliments, gald I also bout it in 2 other colors as well.üòç"
5.0,"Love everything about those coverup! I bought in black and white, size small. Fits perfectly! Surprisingly can also wear with bikini bottoms that tie and doesn‚Äôt look weird/bunched up! Love love love!"
5.0,Super cute happy I bought it
5.0,It was meant for me but my daughter took it and she loves it so now I have to reorder me one.
5.0,I bought this item for my daughter.  She loved it.  I had bought an earring holder for myself (not this kind and not from Amazon) and my daughter wanted one. I found this one on Amazon and ordered it.  She likes musical instruments and I thought it was pretty. I like it better than mine.<br />It is more decorative.  It holds a large number of earrings.
5.0,"This hat took awhile to arrive but it was worth the wait!  It is well made, cute and very baggy!  It is EXACTLY what I have been searching for!  I wish it came in more colors."
5.0,"Thank you! Very comfortable, warm, and pretty, fit perfect I am size 7.5 -8 us size woman. Like the colors texture. I will buy again ."
5.0,I have received so many compliments regarding these Timberlands.
5.0,"I converted my old leather wallet into a fake wallet in case of mugging, and bought this as a replacement. Having a coin pocket is crucial for me, this one has two zippered pockets, one larger on the outside and smaller one on the inside. Turns out the small pocket is perfect for when I want to remove my rings for lifting weights or playing music, and they don't get mixed with my change. Funny that it's marketed for boys, but I guess I'm young at heart, lol."
5.0,I love this necklace. I have 3 of them in different colors to accessorize
5.0,"This was a gift.  She loved it.  Really tiny, about the size of your index finger like to the 1st line.  No complaints."
5.0,very nice dress.  fits well.  looks pretty.
5.0,"I received them quickly and honestly, I was hesistant but I tried them on and they are so comfy and perfect fit! Will have to order some other colors!!"
5.0,Very pleased with these masks. Just wish there were more fabric choices. Would absolutely buy more!
5.0,i'm 5'9 165lbs and the medium fits perfect. the hood is also nice and big and covers my head completely.
5.0,Turned out beautifully and my 220 pound Great Dane wears this well!
5.0,"Adorable, fits well"
5.0,"I have purchased several leg warmers in the past few years. I just want something that will stay up, fit, and keep my legs warm in the winter. I've been mostly disappointed until now.  These are well made, soft, snug but not too snug. They stay up without cutting circulation.  I just ordered another pair to give to my mom for Christmas."
5.0,It fits beautifully.. looks amazing
5.0,These shirts are so soft and they are actually long like the description says. Great for the big and tall guy.
5.0,"Love it, 5&#34;3&#34; and it's not to long. It's lite and airy too. I would recommend this cover!"
5.0,I absolutely love this necklace! The teardrop design is a beautiful touch to this piece.  I wear it every day with my sweet babies Raven and Penny's ashes inside of it. It holds up nicely in the shower as well
5.0,"Anyone who has worn no show socks knows that slipping off the heel is an issue. It does state in the description that they are anti-slip with silicone on the heel. They are not meant to be a non skid sock. The purpose of a bo show sock is so you don't see it with a shoe. There is no point of a no show just to wear around the house. So these absolutely serve there purpose. All the information is in the description, products don't serve less stars because you didn't fully read (or understand) the description."
5.0,We love them kids are having a blast with them.<br />Very nice product.
5.0,‚ù§ that o was able to put my sons # and last name on back.
5.0,Super flattering and adorable. Can be dressed up or down. I'm considering buying another in a second color.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it!
5.0,Good basic has as a starting point for a steam punk costume.
5.0,Super cute. It's hard to find a muslin that isn't mostly white. Came much quicker than the date given!
5.0,I just received these overalls and I've already worn them two days in a row. They're so comfortable and they hang exactly the way I want them too. I usually wear between a 12 and 16 so I ordered these in XXL just to play it safe. They're roomy just like I want them to be. I think an XL would've been a good option if I wanted them to fit a little closer to the body.<br />They're a perfect army green and made out of a lightweight but sturdy material holds it's structure and never clings to me. Totally perfect.
5.0,This is very cute. Does not pinch or dig in to make your skin &#34;play-do&#34; out of the cut areas. Looks more expensive than it is.
5.0,"I ordered a pack of three a free years ago, and when I finally wore them out, I bought another pack of three. I‚Äôm about ready to buy another pack haha. I like the saying ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt try to fix it‚Äù.<br /><br />Overall, the price for the tanks are great and that‚Äôs what keeps me coming back. They also look good on me (humbly speaking). I recommend them to anyone who is thinking about purchasing!"
5.0,"great buy, follow the size conversions. great for skiing"
5.0,"This outfit is super cute , comfy !  Great outfit for running errands ."
5.0,it fit great and looked just like it was pictured!
5.0,SUPER CUTE & WARM
5.0,Very pleased with gloves. They are very sturdy
5.0,"I love these shoes!  Fit real good, and are well made.."
5.0,love the bracelet. nice weight to it and it came in the most beautiful box
5.0,Looks just like it does in the picture
5.0,My husband wears a 10 to 11 shoe size so the large was a perfect fit.
5.0,It fits a little small at first but you can adjust the size for a perfect fit.
5.0,"Dress exceeded expectations.  Material is not see through, has a suede look but not the feel.  Colors look as depicted with a slightly lighter hue but it looks good.  It fits like a glove, I‚Äôll definitely wear the body shaper to pull in the lil‚Äô extras here and there. A dress for any occasion, except funerals. A little decorum for such occasion please.  Worth the money, came quickly and my dude will hate it for all the right reasons‚Ä¶ lol."
5.0,I bought this dress for my vacation to Jamaica and it was perfect to wear to dinner. I love this dress and can‚Äôt wait until the spring and summer time to wear it again.
5.0,I have always loved Isotoner gloves.  This pair replaces a pair I have had for several years.
5.0,"This band comes closest to the original Moto 360 black metal band and feels good too! The middle links are a bit bigger than original band.<br /><br />Pros: The links are far easier to add/remove than the original band as they don't have the stupid 2 piece mechanism of the original band.<br />Cons: Unlike the original band, the connector pins are separate from the band which makes it a bit of a hassle to hot swap(an not lose the pins). The price however totally makes up for this."
5.0,It was a gift for my wife. She liked it
5.0,Fit perfectly. Very sexy!
5.0,"It fits true to size. Wore it as a maternity dress,  very soft and comfortable"
5.0,"I like it, definitely makes you sweat tremendously when actually working out."
5.0,"Love these joggers! They are warm and cozy. Great for wearing around the house, running errands, and going for walks outside in 35-40 degree weather. I am 5‚Äô4 and 119 lbs and ordered size small. Fits perfectly! Not too loose. My only complaint is that I went to buy another pair in a different color and there are absolutely no smalls left.  Bummer."
5.0,The insert fits perfectly into my wallet.  It's even better than I expected because it has 2 more sets of windows than my current taped-together one.  Pictures and cards slide in from the center outward so they won't fall out accidentally.  Prompt delivery and great price.  A great buy!
5.0,"These were my husband's second pair of this sandal and the black ones seem to fit better than the brown ones did (even though they were the same size) -- a little longer, a bit wider, more stable on the foot -- and fabulous comfort and support, as we expect with Alegria. He wears these all the time -- indoor and outdoor -- as soon as the weather is warm enough for sandals. If you need some extra cushioning on the sole and a footbed that molds to your foot, these are exactly what you need."
5.0,"I absolutely love my labradorite gemstones! I even got them earlier than what the arrival date had stated, which was absolutely fantastic. I have already made a necklace out of one of the stones and it makes me so happy! It is a very pretty gemstone as well with its dark rainbow-like colors."
5.0,They were perfect to complete my daughter's Halloween costume.
5.0,Love it. So glittery when you apply it it applies beautifully my sisitets loved it that there getting there own.
5.0,Best fitting shoes I‚Äôve bought so far LOVE them!!

5.0,"Run small,2xl equals size14.Good quality"
5.0,I used these for easter egg fillers the kids loved them
5.0,Love this case.
5.0,My twin granddaughters wore these when they were flower girls
5.0,These are so cool. The beaded bracelets worn alone great and silver rhinestone so shiny.  I love these.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for a family member who is a breeder and she loved it.
5.0,I have Camo fever!
5.0,I bought these for my 4 yr old so her mask can hang around her neck when she takes them off and they have been perfect so far. I've washed them in the machine and they've held up. She loves the fun colors and the flowers.
5.0,"The fabric is pretty light, it fits good."
5.0,Nice comfy good fit feels warm but not overheating
5.0,just try itÔºåwarm and fitÔºåvery good price in Amazon
5.0,Great product bagged and protected fits great
5.0,"Bought to help kid on a week long trip with school. Have been using for every trip since. These are really a great help, lose less items with these bags. You can place these in your hotel room vs' loose items strewn about. Why did I just learn of their existence?"
5.0,I bought this dress for an event and it fits perfectly. I love it! I received a lot of compliments.
5.0,Wow! I am very pleased with its packaging and quality.<br />Fit perfectly for adult size. It also has an adjuster for comfort.

5.0,Church and I loved it
5.0,I'm happy with my Russell sweatshirt. It fits greatüëç
5.0,"They are Comfortable, light weight, breathable, cool, and durable while working. Exactly what I was looking for.  I bought 2 pair. On one of them the button below the waist snap came off on day 1. No biggie. I sewed it back on and am up and running."
5.0,"Comfortable watch that keeps time. You wind it in the morning, & don't have to wind it again for the rest of the day as long as you're wearing it. I get compliments about it all the time"
5.0,"Love these belts! I ordered the first one in pink and when it came in I jumped right back on the computer and ordered the rest of the colors lol. I have a 25&#34; waist and they are perfect. Even if your waist is a bit bigger they feel like they have some give, as they are pretty stretchy. They don't come unhooked like some other waist belts I've tried. Super super cute!!"
5.0,Great shoe for the money. Lightweight and comfortable. I walk five miles a day and they are perfect for walking
5.0,Very durable! I am pretty hard on these things since I have to use my badge so often. Have been using it for about 3 months now and it still looks like it did the day I got it.
5.0,This product is amazing. I wanted something to put my ring on while I was working so it wouldn't get ruined. I work with alot of concrete and lumber and whatnot. I also wanted something that would still look nice ever without the ring on it. The ring is super easy to take on and off and I recommend it for everyone that wears rings.
5.0,"El material es bueno, gracias"
5.0,Logo looks great!  Great customer service!  We ordered these to use in our elementary school's computer labs and are used daily by many kids.  These are holding up very well and logo is not coming off at all!
5.0,Wonderful quality (especially for the great price) and it fits perfectly !! I'm a 36D so I was scared it was going to fit to tight or something but it fits me very comfortably and is super adorable! I can't wait to wear it for my convention coming up !
5.0,"Very outstanding product. Good quality. Looks exactly like the picture...and the idea that it spins is an add on, havent taken it off yet. I will be buying from this company again."
5.0,"These are just what I was looking for. They have a nice fat padded back part, almost like a shoe tongue, that makes them easy to slide on. And cool texturing makes my feet look fast. They feel well made like they'll last a while too."
5.0,"I took the advice of a fellow Amazonian to order the shoes a half size smaller, since it runs large. The shoes fit perfectly a 1/2 size smaller. They are comfortable! I love these shoes."
5.0,"This dress is so pretty, I got many compliments when I wore it to my birthday party at the Disneyland Hotel. The quality is decent and the price is great. I normally wear a size med/large and purchased the xl and it fit great. The length is right above my knees, I am 5'5. I would order one size up to your normal size."
5.0,I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase.  Beautiful ring!
5.0,Bought for a gift for a newborn. Family loved it!
5.0,Just as good as a $50 band.
5.0,"Great for my MID grandson, who has limited fine motor skills and struggles with belt buckles"

5.0,Beautiful and a nice size for the price
5.0,"Darling sweatshirt! Very soft, & fit as expected."
5.0,"The leather is smooth and seems to be of good quality.  I love the shade of blue.  Passport, credit cards, and cash (both European and US bills) all fit nicely; in fact I was able to put two passports in it with no problem."
5.0,very pretty watch-sparkly in the sun. The band is a little stiff but am sure it will soften over time. Time is accurate so far
5.0,"So soft & comfortable, thicker fabric resists wrinkles, fits very well!"
5.0,I love it! And it‚Äôs so pretty!
5.0,Precioso el vestido buena calidad perfecto estoy muy feliz gracias
5.0,Absolutely beautiful dress and it is so comfortable!! I wore it to a wedding and had a ton of compliments. This is the type of summer dress you can wear anywhere. I ordered the navy and now I'm ordering the teal and white!
5.0,Love it. Very pretty watch for a best price.
5.0,Cute little socks. Fits perfectly for my two year old. It doesn‚Äôt fall off when he‚Äôs wearing tennis shoes with it.
5.0,"Got these for my daughter for cheer. She was having pain in her legs like she was getting shin splints from the jarring jumping that they do. She said the compression really helped without feeling too tight (she‚Äôs 15, about 5‚Äô6‚Äù and size 6). She‚Äôs a fan of the bright colors too."
5.0,This looks great I was a little scared at the low price thinking it was a low quality product. Not the case. Fits as expected 42‚Äù waist with plenty of room I hope I don‚Äôt need.
5.0,"Very nice detail on feather, so far has shown no signs of wear of breakage. Fits nicely in a cartilage piercing on the outer edge of ear."
5.0,My 4 year old wears a 5T. We ordered this in a boys small and it fit pretty snug. We absolutely loved it though. Good quality for a children‚Äôs costume.
5.0,"I love the stretchy fabric, it fits a lot of  clothes in the closet."
5.0,What Time is it??
5.0,It looks so beautiful.
5.0,Muy c√≥modos y suaves
5.0,Nice looking ring. Substancial and nice looking. Well made.
5.0,"These are great‚Äî squat proof, comfortable, and they look great."
5.0,This was a very nice hoody.  Brilliant colors.
5.0,Fits well. I will buy more colors.
5.0,"I bought this for my mother-in-law who likes to do beading. Based on the pictures, it looked like the band could be removed from the Fitbit holder, making it possible for her to bead her own bands. I can‚Äôt remember if the bands actually un-snapped or not, but she really liked the gift."
5.0,Ordered this for my Daughter's homecoming dance. Great material! Fits true to size.
5.0,Product is stretchy and shows all your curves! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and I ordered a medium. A large would‚Äôve been too big . Definitely gonna order another one !
5.0,Even came in beautiful packaging
5.0,This is a beautiful gown with great length although a bit on the large side; seems more like a size 3X.  I am 5' 10&#34; tall and these almost reach my ankles. Very warm and cozy for winter.<br /><br /> The only thing that I am not comfortable with is the elastic on the sleeves; too tight even on my skinny wrist.
5.0,Love it. More cute in person!!!!
5.0,For those looking for crosshair 2.0 earsocks:  These do work.  A couple of snips w/ scissors and they fit fine.  I suggest a TINY dab of glue on the front and back side.  They stay in place and are actually better than what were shipped by the original manufacturer.
5.0,Very pretty and fit perfectly
5.0,I couldn't locate the actual Garmin replacement band for this watch.  I ordered another brand and quickly returned it; it was much thicker and not nearly as flexible.  I ordered this one and crossed my fingers. It was basically identical to the orginal bands that come with the watch.
5.0,"These worked great! I started to ride my bike between my work and my husbands on nice days but dreaded the &#34;saddle sore&#34; that soon followed when I rode my bike. A coworker of mine, who is an avid bike rider, mentioned padded bike shorts. I researched them and found many are crazy expensive! I certainly wasn't an avid rider, just occasional and on nice days I'd ride to work after dropping my husband off, certainly not something I planned to do every day. I didn‚Äôt want to spend so much on something I wouldn‚Äôt use daily. I then found these. The price seemed more reasonable and they looked to have a nice cushion of padding. I bought them and wore them every time I rode. They helped TREMENDOUSLY! I still was a bit sore on a couple spots, but it was very minor and wasn‚Äôt even uncomfortable to ride again. They do feel bulky, especially when walking, but I would put them on ride before hopping on and take them off as soon as I jumped off the bike. They also washed and dried well. Great quality and I would buy again! They made my ride so much more enjoyable!"
5.0,I wear crazy socks all the time!  I got a lot of attention with these!!!  fit as expected
5.0,"I loved the ring, but it was too small and was out of stock for a larger size."
5.0,Love it. Fits perfect one me. I'm 5'2&#34; tall.
5.0,"I like the dress. I normally wear size 16, I ordered a 2x and it fits me fine. It can be dressed up or worn as a casual dress. It is very comfortable. I liked the combination of the blue and green colors."
5.0,"I love this black sports bra from Vibrant Vixen! It‚Äôs comfortable, good-looking, and has great support. I‚Äôve done yoga in it and the T-back allows mobility of the arms and shoulders. I‚Äôve been out running in it and it supports everything it needs to without chafing. It is seamless under a shirt, and cute without one. My only caution is it runs a little big, so if you are in between sizes I would go a size smaller."
5.0,Very stretchy. Perfect fit in allthe right places.
5.0,this is very lovely bra tube. I really like it. I would highly recommend it anyone.
5.0,Love these socks!  I need them to prevent my falling on my hardwood floors. They work perfectly.
5.0,I recieved this package of earrings not expecting much but I dont regret buying them! Love the rose gold color and how stunning then look
5.0,I was surprised how nice this skirt was. Nice fit and stretchy.
5.0,As described.  Fast shipping.
5.0,"They fit well, and don't fall down when you put something in the pockets."
5.0,"i'm 5'4"" and curvy/full figured and a 2x fit perfectly.  i was worried it would be too tight or too long but the length was well above the floor with 3.5"" heels, and it was well fitted in the bodice and just loose enough through the skirt. the elastic in the top stayed up well and was comfortable.  very impressed with this dress for the price.  i bought one in black for a night out at the Jungle Room and the Soho Grand in NYC for a 50th birthday and it was perfect with the right jewelry and clutch.  a few weeks later we had an outdoor family portrait and i bought another one in navy (to adhere to the color scheme of blue/white/khaki/pink) and with casual shoes, the dress was perfect yet again."
5.0,I got an XL.... I am 5'9 and in the 200plus club!! This dress is gorgeous....he loved it üòâ and so did I!!! Buy buy buy you won't regret it.
5.0,"Bought at an inexpensive price, nice fabric, nice fit,"
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my brother‚Äôs wife.  They both love it.  Perfect for a woman to keep it inside the purse.
5.0,You can dress it up or down it was so warm and very flattering
5.0,I use it for my grocery bags. Bought two in different colors.
5.0,Fit was is good. Would differently be to long for a shorter person.
5.0,"Buy 2 sizes larger.  Comfortable, fairly roomy pouch. Just remember that they are low rise. Had to get used to not pulling them up too far"
5.0,"This is a multifunctional item. It is a ponytail holder, a headband, and a earwarmer, all in one. Great item."
5.0,These are rocking update my sandals or great barefoot
5.0,Love this NorthFace hoodie. Can‚Äôt go wrong with the quality and workmanship of the north face. Definitely recommend for those cold winter days. Ordered a size large and the fit is perfectüòä
5.0,"This is a nice sized shoulder bag. Very tough and sturdy. Many, many pockets with zippers. I'm able to comfortably fit a 10 in tablet with a case on it and a Nintendo switch inside it's own separate carrying case. For me it's roomier than I thought it would be."
5.0,"I love these earrings but I do not wear them w/ the matching pendant- it seemed a little ‚Äòover the top,‚Äô so I wear w/ a chain w/o a pendant, or my Pandora necklace w/ no pendant. Very pretty."
5.0,awesome christmas gift
5.0,Right size and placement of bifocal lens.  Good frame shape for me.
5.0,"I was worried about getting a size 16 since the reviews said it runs small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 185 lbs.  It has a little stretch so it worked out. It is a bit snug so I would order up one size.  Great quality and covers up any unflattering areas (the reason I bought it)."
5.0,"Such a lovely bag I just adore this bag I use it simply for my survival things like my ferro rod and striker, fire starters knife first aid kit<br />Compass and it's easy for me to carry around my survival kit, I needed a bag to finish my kit and this hit the spot for me can't get any better awesome."
5.0,Very pretty blouse! I wish it came in a larger selection of colors!
5.0,"I bought the dress for a roaring 20's themed birthday party. I really liked it, I'm 5'1 and the dress hit a few inches above the knee. Not too short at all. Just a heads up, it's a lil see through, but very comfortable to wear."
5.0,Me encanta es de buen material. Y muy resistente.<br />No es ni muy grande ni muy peque√±o.
5.0,"Fit well and are flattering, well-made, and feel great! They do everything a pair of yoga pants could possibly do."

5.0,Nice if you are a hippie
5.0,Best nose ring I've bought so far! I've worn it almost every day for a year and the gold doesn't fade or rub off. Good for sensitive skin.<br /><br />For those of you giving 1 star reviews and saying it's too small‚Äîpeople have different size piercings! 1/4&#34; is a perfect size for my nose because the hole is so close to my nostril.
5.0,You cannot miss on this item. It worked well on our European trip and will last and become usfull in future trips. Love the zippers and velcro.<br /><br />Byron
5.0,The most perfect and affordable bridesmaid dress! It's easy to feel like a princess in this flowy lacy dress. I am 5'3 and ordered the small. I needed to get about an inch and a half taken off. I love this dress!
5.0,"Love love love these shoes! I wear them to work everyday and I'm on my feet all day long and walking on wet floors. Traction is great. Super comfy. This is my 3rd pair of AnyWears, each pair lasts at least a full year before I can tell they are starting to get worn out. Great shoes for a good price =]"

5.0,"I loved this dress, wore it to a concert and it was cute! I originally ordered an XL but it was too big so I bought a L and really could have went down to a M. I‚Äôm big up top and small at the bottom so since it‚Äôs stretchy you can go down a few sizes. Anywho it was still cute and I loved the material, worked well for a I highly recommend"
5.0,"Beautiful! I love that it has pockets. Fits as expected, lays right above the knee."

5.0,"Soooo precious!! Far better quality than expected for the price. The detail really makes it. Baby hasn't arrived to wear it yet, but we can't wait. May have to wait till she's a few months old, it appears to be a little big for a newborn."

5.0,This shirt is made of a soft light weight fabric. Excellent for working out in! I would highly recommend this shirt!
5.0,"This sweater dress is perfection!! The fit is just right. The waistband has no stretch, so you'll need to put this on over your head. There are slits on both sides of the leg and a strap across the upper back. I found the fit to be true to size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the small/medium.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."

5.0,"I ordered these shorts for summer and bought them because of the cute pockets. They are absolutely cute. I bought them in grey XL. I'm usually a large but took the advise of going size up. I'm glad I did. Love the linen feel. Not too stiff either. With some washing, they will loosen up and feel more comfortable."
5.0,I absolutely love this shirt. The cut looks amazing on anyone.
5.0,This item met my expectations.
5.0,Im happy with these glasses and would recommend.
5.0,The sunglasses are much more sturdy than I first anticipated. For the price I am very pleasantly surprised. Definitely good quality. They fit my face perfect which is weird because I always have a hard time finding glasses that fit my face. They even come with a bonus case that I didn't know about! Awesome! These are going to be great this summer!
5.0,Thin but perfect would definitely go a size smaller they stretch out throughout the day
5.0,love it. I have several.

5.0,Easy to use and very comfortable. Can hardly tell your wearing a belt . Seems to be made of good quality materials
5.0,It arrived on time and was exactly as described
5.0,"There is nothing I dislike about this shirt. In fact, as a 34 week pregnant Mama to 7, yes baby 8 on the way, I loved how it fit. There is spandex in the fabric, 5%, but it's not overly stretchy. It is a more relaxed fit but not loose. Their is a feminine cut to it not boxy, which is what I wanted.<br /><br />I carry relatively small, a medium is my normal go to size. I prefer my shirts to not cling to my every curve. Shirt tucks in nicely. It will make a great nursing shirt as well bc it can provide moderate coverage for modesty. I will be purchasing additional colors.<br />If your hesitant, remember it can always be returned. Hth."
5.0,"This necklace is BEAUTIFUL! I look at it everytime I walk past my jewlery box!! I can't wait to wear it. It's rich in color, light weight, not too big or small. It's just perfect and a GREAT VALUE. It is elegant but I think it can be worn for semi casual. The chain makes the necklace too. It is so pretty. You can't go wrong with this purchase!"
5.0,Incredible. My wife loves it. I will be buying another real soon
5.0,If you are a husqvarna fan it's a great hat. Just that right amount of comfortable.

5.0,This nightgown is so soft and cozy.
5.0,"I've been wanting pentagram earrings for a while now, but I couldn't justify paying high prices without knowing the quality. These, however, are PERFECT. The price range is on point and the quality of the earrings is great. They're well-made, lightweight, and the size is exactly what I was looking for. I love everything about them."

5.0,Super cute! I can't wait to wear it on vacation!
5.0,"Love the lightweight colorful backpack for our Florida trip. This backpack will be used on our vacation going to Disneyworld in July and at the beach. The material is very lightweight and live the colorful print. Added an LED light for nighttime use for higher visibility at night coming out of the parks and at the beach. Seems durable enough as a daypack and can be rolled up if we want to tuck it away somewhere when not in use.<br /><br />Added to this review after my 10 day Florida vacation trip. This lightweight bag went with me everywhere, easy to use, put in my items for the day, take it on fishing day trips, walk on the beach for miles. This backpack held up well and I used it almost every day. Very durable and love the attractive colors."
5.0,"Way better than cheap expensive Halloween store costumes. It‚Äôs long on me but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, but the fit was perfect."
5.0,GREAT QUALITY!! IT LOOKED GORGEOUS FOR MY DAUGHTERS SPRING PICTURES!
5.0,Beautiful  an shiny  perfect for the project I was working on
5.0,It‚Äôs great I‚Äôll buy more color
5.0,"I received this dress and it fist beautifully, not too tight or loose.  I have yet use it, since I purchased the dress to wear to a wedding coming up in late August.  I am 5', weigh 100lbs and small busted.  The length is perfect for me, it is midi-look which makes it in my case more 'formal'.  The material quality is great, not see through."
5.0,"Love this dress. It‚Äôs so lightweight, comfortable, and will work for casual or dressing up!!  Pockets are a plus!! I‚Äôm  very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Me encanta! Hace dos a√±os la compr√© y sigo linda
5.0,"It is a lot of money to spend on a bag but it is for a good cause and it is a great bag! I have used it for a school bag, purse, shopping bag, you name it."
5.0,"Perfect, Lightweight, and sexy!"
5.0,So impressed with the quality!
5.0,Love love love this dress. Fits great. Got one in both colors
5.0,Better than expected! Beautiful dress. It's a true wrap dress and I love that. Fits perfectly everywhere and doesn't show too much cleavage or my bra.
5.0,Awesome band! Super comfortable and looks fantastic!!!
5.0,Great soft fabric.  Designer sticking detail gives good fit  Love the color.
5.0,"Super cute hat and the fit was perfect.  It bends, which is nice to adjust when traveling."
5.0,I really like this faux leather skirt. Feels great on
5.0,"My 5 year old grandson loves the socks because he is learning to read with the Pete the Cat books.  Socks are perfect thickness, fit, and so cute."
5.0,This jacket is super cute. Not sure how long they will last. But they fit nice and serve a purpose.
5.0,it was the only thing my soon to be 10 yr  old daughter asked for. Thankfully Amazon had it and it came in time. It is really nice.
5.0,"I hate that I forgot to take a picture but I work in a mental health/substance use disorder facility. I love to use these for grounding tools with the patients. They truly love them. Not only do they get something pretty and new, but it's an attractive way to introduce grounding and calming. The necklaces look exactly like the ad and come in a pretty, zipper plastic pouch. Great quality for the money."
5.0,Very comfortable and perfect for hot summer days and nights. A little dressier than shorts for going out! True to size. It would be a great dress to travel with as it doesn't seem to wrinkle easily! Love it!
5.0,"This is a VERY well made bag. The best point is that money from the proceeds go towards feeding a child- what is better than that?. I fully recommend the purchase of this bag to everyone, not only for the re-usable part but for feeding the children that are less fortunate. WAY TO GO LAUREN FOR THIS PROGRAM- MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU!!!"
5.0,Just got this in the mail and it's very beautiful. Gold hardware balances perfectly against the black leather. Like that the zippers had protective  film so it wouldn't be scratched upon arrival. Wallet isn't too thick either. Perfect amount of space to store all my cards on one side and cash/miscellaneous items in the pockets on the other side. Photo slot on the outside is a nice bonus. Gift box was damaged when it arrived which is a bummer but the wallet itself was perfectly intact. Showed it to my mum who now wants me to order one for her too!
5.0,"After reading reviews that stated the stones were too small, I decided to go for the 3mm size. I think it‚Äôs too big for my nose. If you prefer your stone to be more inconspicuous but not tiny, then 2mm would be perfect. Otherwise I love them and how secure they are while sleeping/showering. Would highly recommend!"
5.0,"When this arrived, I literally said &#34;WOW&#34; out loud when I saw how nice and luxurious it looked. It arrived packaged beautifully in a very nice and elegant gift box. The git box is great because now I only pretty much need to put a bow on it and bam, I am done wrapping my husbands valentines day gift. The watch its self is absolutely gorgeous. The photos in the listing simply do not do it justice. It looks much classier and more elegant in person. It is shiny and sparkly and absolutely beautiful. As far as I can tell, it keeps time just fine. I also took it out of the box to inspect the clasp, which fastens securely. The band is expandable which is great because my husband has a large wrist and sometimes has a problem finding a watch that will fit him comfortably. Over all, I am very happy with this watch and I can't wait to give it to my husband for valentines day.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate as part of a special promotion. My review, my opinion and my experiences are honest and 100% genuine."
5.0,"I have an Autistic son who likes to wear and hide my reading glasses.  Because I need them for homeschooling and for teaching college in the evening, let alone my writing and editing on the weekend, I found myself desperate for additional pair in case my seeking turns out too frustrating.  I tried these on at night while he was sleeping and they were clearer than the ones I have been using for a year.  I loved them.  My husband happened to come around the corner as I placed the blue frames on and was very impressed with the design and overall look.  I was greatly relieved to feel that the frames were sturdy and the fit tight.  I'm hiding them now, but will be using them as my sole pair for work in the evenings come this fall as they are adorable and a better fit than my others.  Thank you!"
5.0,"It‚Äôs just great. Holds a lot more than I thought it would. Love the side stretchy compartment. Love the clip, I can twist once and clip it, so it won‚Äôt bother my piercings. Very comfortable."
5.0,"Very thick, warm, and doesn't shed. I was shocked at the high quality, and planned to only wear it for my cruella deville costume, but now I plan to wear it regularly. Very nice!"
5.0,"I am thrilled with these pierced earrings!  They were larger than I expected, but I like them.  I would recommend these earrings to others."
5.0,this is a Christmas gift for my 11 year old granddaughter who loves horses it is very nice looking didn't expect for it to look this good I hope she will like it.
5.0,"This is a great buy for the money. I ordered this for a formal dinner night on a cruise, and it was prefect! Very nice quality, fit as expected. I highly recommend this dress, you wont be disappointed!"
5.0,"This was perfect for my trip to Miami. Big enough to carry some cash, cards, and my phone. Small enough that it wasn't in the way. Great for traveling. Love the color."
5.0,My husband wears this while running early in the morning and late at night awesome multi function very good quality.  He is a bit bigger at the top so fits perfect adjust as needed I can wear it or he can.  Reflectors are surprisingly powerful
5.0,My bf is a Destiny freak and he loves this wallet. Good quality and design.
5.0,These are great. Perfect size for earrings and bracelets.  Would buy them in other shapes also.
5.0,Good looking and nice fitting socks
5.0,Fits and is gorgeous. So I gave it five stars. But I don't like dragon on the back. So I won't wear it. I will give  it away.
5.0,They look great. Exactly what I wanted. Started wearing as soon as I got them
5.0,Super Comfortable!!!
5.0,I love this bonnet! I have long locs down the middle of my back and this cap holds all my hair in it. I especially love the fact that I dont have to wear my mask with the straps around my ears all day! Will definitely purchase more!
5.0,This dress is sooooo cute! It is taking ALL my restraint to not buy every color.  It is so comfy for my daughter but she looks so stinking stylish in it. And it TWIRLS perfectly! One of my fav Amazon purchases this year
5.0,"These are the best shoes for new walkers hands down...I used them for my second child, and bought this pair for my niece, who will be walking soon.  They are perfect for little feet that need protection but also need to feel the ground.  We live in AZ and they helped protect little feet from asphalt burns.  They are great for the park.  They coming in so many cute styles.  They last forever and are washable.  Don't buy knockoffs - they won't last.  Spend the extra and get the name brand (Robeez) and you will be glad you did.  LOVE ROBEEZ FOREVER!!!!"
5.0,These boots fit perfect and so light weight. The exact look I was looking for in combat boots. Went to an event in the desert in Nevada and they were fabulous and resistant woth the dust. Easy to clean up.
5.0,Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it!  I was concerned with the fit because he wears a small size but the fit is good.  It really looks good on him.  Worth the price.
5.0,Good quality keychain. Adorable pic. : )
5.0,"I am currently a size 14/16 and ordered the plus size. These leggings are super soft and lightweight, although not see through at all. The fit was excellent. Lengthwise, these leggings are just above mid calf and snug as leggings are supposed to be without being tight. I think a 18/20 could fit in these leggings easily, but beyond that it might be uncomfortable or too tight. It's hard to find good leggings that aren't too thin, too thick, see through, or super expensive. Found them here and will order more."
5.0,These are my favorite bands! Very comfortable and they stay in place.
5.0,Very comfortable. I love it. It is so soft and very comfortable.
5.0,For students is the best
5.0,Nice comfortable mask. Well made. Pocket for filter which comes with 2.

5.0,My daughter loves this. I bought it for her and her pup.
5.0,Loved these shoes for my daughter. Fit great and looks great too. She loves them.
5.0,Great tight fit for after a workout to keep your muscle in rest.
5.0,Great material and very comfortable!!
5.0,I typically go for the subdued look and this fit the bill perfectly. Amidst a sea of colorful shirts this stands out. Great print as well as being well made. I do not have any issues with it.
5.0,Love the fact that there is no buckle right on belly.
5.0,Totally AWESOME and ABOVE BEYOND SERVICE!! I looked FANTASTIC!
5.0,Fit a little to small but very well made item
5.0,My baby girl looked awesome for her birthday party.  The outfit was really cute and was perfect for the party.
5.0,"Really sturdy, hold tightly and I have no fear they will come off by accident.  Worth the cost as they won't go missing."
5.0,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed this bracelet. I received exactly what is pictured, and it looks nice with my everyday dress. I put 2-3 drops of easential oil on the bracelet, let it soak in for a couple minutes, and then wear it for the day. Even at the end of the day, the oils were still diffusing and the bracelet kept the fragrance very well."
5.0,I really like it. Good quality. Almost feel like I'm in Australia for goodness sake!
5.0,Soft leather and prefect size
5.0,Beautiful designs and comfy fabric.
5.0,I love these! I hope they are available in mire colors
5.0,I was given a vinnibag as a gift and bought another shortly after. I've only used for liquor and wine but they work great on long international flights with lots of plane changes and baggage handling. But they start disappearing when people see them - you give a gift of a bottle and somehow they acquire your vinnibag with it! So keep a close eye on them!
5.0,Very bright and beautifully made
5.0,Awesome way better quality than the ones in the store
5.0,it glows in the dark
5.0,"I usually wear between a medium and lg. Bought lg and it fit perfect! I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù so it hit me right at the knees. Really nice dress, LOVE IT!!"
5.0,"UN RELOJ DE GRAN MANUFACTURA,  CON LA MEJOR RELACION CALIDAD PRECIO."
5.0,This ring exceeded my expectations - just the right size and really pretty.  I am very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"excellent product, ordering more !"
5.0,My kid loves this shirt it's super cute
5.0,I wear mens size 12 chuck tailor and was able to actually fit the shoe inside and lace these puppies up which worked perfectly for what I needed them for.  I bought the large (the biggest one) thinking they would probably be too small THESE RUN HUGE
5.0,"When we had to wear a mask wherever we went, I loved these, light comfortable and washable."
5.0,"Love it! I'm 5'6&#34;, 140 lbs and wear a 34D - medium fit perfectly!"
5.0,My Granddaughter lives it
5.0,"Ordered a small for my older brother, who is around 5'8&#34;-9&#34; and roughly 140lb. It fit him perfectly. It looks very similar to the photo, came well packaged and in time, and is made of a nice quality material."
5.0,"I love this bracelet!!! It is the most gorgeous combination of garnet and blue sapphire, and I fell in love with it the minute I saw it on Amazon‚Äôs website!!! The bracelet appears to be well made, and I will wear it every chance I have!!!"
5.0,"The Maya headbands have worked out well for me. My hair is a bit too short for a ponytail. These headbands keep my short bob with bangs off my face during spin and runs. Really comfortable and soft. I don't find myself constantly adjusting during activity, as I have with others. I love the donut print as well!"
5.0,Beautiful!  I bought 3 to give to my daughter and daughter-in-laws.  I love it so much I am going to purchase one for myself and another for a Christmas present
5.0,"a little wider than I thought, but I like it, good real leather, nice styling, reasonable price,  what more can you want?"
5.0,"This bag is just the right size.....not too big but large enough to put a book and a bottle of water inside.  The greatest thing about this purse, other than the fact that it looks beautiful, and very expensive, is that it is soft and pliable.  Not one of those stiff, hard sided purses.  It is a beautiful brown (I ordered the lighter brown...not the dark brown) and the color is fabulous.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I just bought another one in navy blue."
5.0,It‚Äôs SO cute!! I‚Äôm literally going to live in this for the next few weeks while traveling through Europe. Might have to buy it in another color too!
5.0,"Okay, okay it‚Äôs time to scale back on the puns and review these sandals. I‚Äôve had one whale of time with them! I‚Äôve used them as primarily beach and shower sandals at the gym. They are certainly a head turner and a conversation starter! My mother in law loved them so much I got her a pair as a gift. I‚Äôve had them for over a year now, and even with everyday use they‚Äôve proven to be extremely durable. The colors are also as bright as the first day I bought them. They are also sized properly as well. I‚Äôd highly recommended them to any afishinados out there!"
5.0,Very high quality had to buy two more
5.0,"The previous reviews are correct. If it weren't for the tag, you wouldn't be able to tell back from front. I just HAD to post these pics to show you what I mean. I am 5'2&#34;, 185 lbs and I went according to the measuring chart and got an XL. It fits well, it is very soft & has lots of stretch. It stretches so much that I probably could get away with a Large -- even with my fat arms, there's still stretch. The colors are even more vibrant than the pictures! Very happy about that. I am a short person, so the sleeves are a bit long, but that never bothers me. With that being said, you would think this top would go past my butt as well, but it doesn't. It covers some of it, but not entirely - which I don't mind. I am going to shorten the sleeves & use the extra fabric to sew scrunchies or hair bands to match. :o) I thought this top was rather expensive, but I guess since you can wear it as TWO different tops, it's worth it? Lol"
5.0,This necklace exceeded my expectations!  Really love it.
5.0,Looks so sexy on me.  Pleased with this purchase.  Get compliments.
5.0,These were exactly what I was hoping for! I'd been eyeing this product for way too long and finally ordered them. They're super comfortable and even with going down a size on the chart (I've been losing weight) they fit perfectly. The stretch is really nice and I love how vibrant the color is
5.0,"These glasses are amazing, they completely shield my eyes and correct color spectrum. My white walls usually appear yellow from the lights but with these on they are actually white. You will not regret this purchase"
5.0,"We were very pleased with these masks, as they fit very nicely and you hardly notice that you are wearing one."
5.0,"the top layer on top is like a thin single tulle layer, but for a cheap formal dress it got the job done."
5.0,Much more comfortable than the rubber bands. Super cute!
5.0,Got these as a gift for my friend and she absolutely loved them. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and very cute
5.0,I love this pendant!  It is beautifully made.
5.0,Feeling funky!
5.0,Purchased as an accessory for the Apple Watch I bought my husband that he did not want. He‚Äôs s huge fan of the traditional look of this band and eased the transition.
5.0,Very nice I like the way it fit.  different from other brands
5.0,"I have never found a pair of Judy Blue‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt like, and these did not disappoint."
5.0,Order for my Birthday came on time fit right. I got a large
5.0,Beautiful dog tag & great customer service!
5.0,Toughest laces for work boots I have ever bought over 25 years in construction. Holding up great in the snow and mud.
5.0,"This is one of the most useful things I've ever purchased, no exaggeration. I use it as a wallet in my larger everyday purse, with the wrist strap (which I usually leave on all the time) when I want to run into the store or not have a heavy bag, and with the shoulder strap for fancier events.<br /><br />The wallet is slim enough to fit in a medium-sized purse, but big enough to hold a phone, pill case, keys, etc.<br /><br /> I've been using it everyday for months, and it still looks brand new. The zippers and hardware are very strong and well made."
5.0,"Bought this for my husband's birthday.  He loves it and even said it was the real thing complete with fighting strap! Expensive,  but worth it!"
5.0,These were purchased for a craft project for my granddaughter. I was surprised at the excellent quality. Much higher quality than a<br />Craft&#34; item
5.0,Love these socks for my baby girl!
5.0,Nice size for charm bracelets
5.0,Beautiful and heavy.
5.0,"Very cute earrings. Very well made, not too heavy, very dainty. Look expensive."
5.0,"I got this to use as a leotard for my Vanilla ice cosplay! It fits perfectly and even covers my underwear!<br /><br />My measurements are:<br />Bust: 40&#34;<br />Waist: 34<br />Hips: 40&#34;<br />I'm 5'9&#34;, 185 lbs, and I got size 46&#34;. It's actually a little too big, but it fits well and covers absolutely everything. It's obviously not made to be used as actual clothing, but it'll work for what I need. It's very well made too which I wasn't expecting because I don't know the brand. Thank you for a great product!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:e5426c17f5e4c1a6ed6b8c63cdb23b49]] This coverup could double as a sundress! I wasn‚Äôt sure about it when I first put it on but after seeing the pictures, I really like it! It is a soft, silky material. The best part, it has pockets and I know most people love that feature! I will be looking at other styles that are available!"
5.0,It's a scarf what else is there to say. Length is good color is true to picture we hand wash and hang to dry colors didn't bleed.
5.0,I love these items I brought.
5.0,"It delivered on time. When I put it on it hid my belly, even though I'm still trying to loose my belly weight. The top fitted a bit small. It looks  great for the summer because it's still cold outside now. ‚ò∫"
5.0,My husband loves this watch. I had to tell him not to wear it with his cammies.
5.0,I don‚Äôt own a pair of high dollar shorts because of these. They‚Äôre the best!
5.0,"My 9 year old daughter loves her new glasses case.  1st week in but seems sturdy, came with a nice cloth to clean her lenses and she has been taking it with her everywhere - lots of compliments & super cute."
5.0,Very satisfied. I do recomend
5.0,"This handbag has a classic and clean appearance with three colors on the front side of the bag (medium brown, creamy white and pale tan) with the  neutral pale tan color continuing on the sides and back (a vertical line of stitching runs up the back side]. On my computer, the tan color looks to have a touch of pink in it but that is not the case - the pale tan coloring is a true tan shade. The bag measures 14&#34; wide [from side to side across the front]; 10&#34; high [from bottom of the bag to top edge]; 6&#34; deep [width from front to back]; with an 8&#34; strap drop [top edge of the bag to bottom of curve on the strap when standing up] - a little smaller than a tote sized bag but not by much. The handbag arrived with Calvin Klein tags on it indicating that it is leather with an original price of $248. The saffiano leather has the tell tale cross hatch markings on it so it should be water resistant. Please note that the bag material is kind of stiff due to the resin/wax applied to the leather - it holds its shape but is not necessarily soft if you wear the straps on your shoulder and tuck the bag under your arm. The bag has a snap closure at the end of a 2.5&#34; piece of leather so the bag remains somewhat open at all times [no top zipper closure]. The interior is lined with a pale tan color that is lighter than the outside of the bag and is printed with the words &#34;Calvin Klein&#34; in 2&#34; intervals. The words are in a very pale color so not highly visible. There are 2 slip pockets on the front side of the interior; a zippered pouch with leather pull tag is stitched down in the middle; and there is a zippered pocket on the back side. This bag will certainly hold whatever you need it to with some helpful organization since the zippered pouch in the middle separates the interior into two areas. The bag arrived in great condition - all segments of the bag were wrapped with tissue including the straps and inside padding helped to maintain the bag's structure during shipping. The gold hardware is shiny and seems to be of good quality - works well. Overall, the bag is a great neutral color for summer use."
5.0,This key chain complement my car collection.
5.0,Great fit.  Especially good for wide-ish foot. Light weight.
5.0,"I love this ring!!! I am a woman who wears a smaller size (7). It fit precut nd was not too heavy-looking for my finger.  Good quality stainless. Very, very pleased...and the price was right."
5.0,Very comfortable tee that fits well - long enough to wear with leggings - not too snug either.<br />Bright colors are a bit stronger than depicted.  Washes and wears well.<br />Very happy with purchase.

5.0,they cut the glare and protect your eyes while you swim!
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous and meaningful necklace, delivered quickly.  Recommend highly!"
5.0,"This play outfit was given as a baby gift. I was told by my niece that the outfit is of good quality, fit her little girl just right, and she received it from Amazon in record time, in fact, a day earlier than stated. Since then I have ordered several more baby clothes to be sent to her."
5.0,"It's a great print, won't keep you warm in very cold weather. Don't worry about that too much in Texas üòÅ"
5.0,Just right as a gift for a elementary and up age child.  It is all good.
5.0,LOVE it !
5.0,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!"
5.0,Cute flowing skirt.
5.0,"I stumbled upon these gloves online and am thrilled to have them just in time for the snow to start falling in Cleveland, Ohio. These are perfect for walking my dog, driving, shoveling, and just hanging around outside. I love the fit and the feel. They have two size adjustments on the strap for looser or tighter fit depending on preference and the touch screen capabilities are very convenient for using your phone out in the cold. I love these gloves. They are high quality and timeless style."
5.0,Clean and good material i would buy again for sure.
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves this costume. Finally a costume that will not be a one time wear. It is well put together and made with high quality materials. My daughter is 7 and the 8 fits her perfectly with room to grow.
5.0,"I bought this hat for my boyfriend and almost kept it instead (you can bet I'm getting the red one for me). Feels good on, looks great, and the material doesn't feel cheap either. Jellyvaders are embroidered, and none of the hat is made of mesh.<br /><br />The underside of the brim's logo IS a sticker, so I would use a stronger adhesive to attach it if you are worried about it coming off, but mine has stayed well without."
5.0,"My daughter is not very tall and is very slender built for an 8 year old. These are great! They are super comfy and very warm. Great for wearing with dress/skirt in winter. They have the firm fitting for around the waist, for super slender built. Worth it."
5.0,Got this for my cat lover mother to keep her change in.  She loves it.  It is very soft fabric!  Love it!
5.0,"Usually when you deal with a Company from China, it's a huge hassle. I was surprised,  came early and was of good quality."
5.0,OMG!  The most amazing sweater ever!  I loved it.  Fits like a glove and the quality is amazing.
5.0,Perfect size for littles that like to wear necklaces.
5.0,"Love this skirt.  To get the perfect fit, I followed the inches measurements given on the size chart (not my regular size).  Shipping was prompt and the item was packaged well.  Thanks."
5.0,"Starters for those who need it:<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 11‚Äù & 171lb. (athletic build), and this fits perfect. Enough room in the arms and shoulders, and perfect length all around (not ‚Äújust enough‚Äù; perfect length). Ordered a Medium.<br /><br />Great lightweight jacket for a lightweight price haha. Ordered this because I only own jackets for Winter time (more insulated), and wanted something that I could throw on for basically any season (yea that‚Äôs right, I‚Äôd rock it in Summer like a psycho). The fit is great and the quality is great. Something that if was a name brand in America would probably be well into the $60-$70 range; seriously."
5.0,"Love this got this for my little guy for his Fitbit charge 2 that used to be his sister‚Äôs, it works amazing and very durable even for a fidgety 9year old and it stretches well and holds up nicely he‚Äôs had it for a while now and still looks great!"
5.0,"Medium, 5‚Äô2, 125lb. A small would‚Äôve probably fit as well. But like the extra room. Also the funky, fluffy, foo-foo feathers can be removed. They‚Äôre buttoned on."
5.0,Perfect length and super cute. It's exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Very cute sweater, but if you‚Äôre going for an oversized look, order one size above what you normally get. Like if you‚Äôre an L get an XL etc."
5.0,Beautiful bag!  Love the many pockets on the inside to keep things organized!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. I recommend this dress.
5.0,"Great, very warm gloves."
5.0,"These are the same frames as my prescription glasses, so I bought 2 extra reading glasses to use the frames when my prescription glasses frame braked, which has happened twice already.  The place where I bought my prescription glasses wanted $85 for new frames, the reading glasses and frames are $18."
5.0,Recipient loved it and started to cry
5.0,"Even though it says to hang it to dry, I put it in the dryer (accidentally) and it still fits my daughter perfect!"
5.0,Bought this to replace the original band on my FitBit that was coming apart. This is very light weight and more comfortable then the original band. Can‚Äôt beat the price!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b61683dbf9c09651e0eaf5e118b295bb]] I love this messenger bag, it is very stylish, roomy and made well. It has lots of pockets<br />inside. One pocket on the inside has a zipper the other two pockets are open and great for putting your glasses,<br />lip balm or other items you want to be able to grab quickly. There is a large pocket on the back that also<br />has a zipper. All the zippers are metal and they zip smoothly. The inside is also large enough to hold a tablet.<br />The two buckle straps on the front are held down with a magnetic snap. It has a long adjustable strap for carrying<br />and fits great as an over the body bag or shortened and carried on your shoulder.<br />This bag looks great and gets lots of compliments.<br /><br />*I received a discount on this product in return for my unbiased review"
5.0,Good quality and fit.  like it alot!
5.0,I love my cardigan‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"I don't have an expensive purse, but the cloth ones I have offer no protection in the rain. This worked beautifully, with the different size purses I have. And now, I don't have to dry out all the stuff that use to get wet in my purse. I keep it in my bag at all times!"
5.0,"I love this G-Shock!<br />When looking for a new, stylish, and tough as can be watch, I had some other requirements that I didn't think I could find in a G-Shock:<br />-Not Huge<br />-Dive Quality Case<br />-Mineral Face<br />-Not overly expensive just for a brand name or style.<br />-Primarily a simple analog face with a second hand and small display, no dials or fancy bezels.<br />-Accurate as possible.<br />-Bright light. Buzz Lightyear bright.<br />-No bling, only biz.<br />This GA810 MMA-1A is everything I wanted and more. I love this watch, and haven't worn any others since unboxing. It fits my wrist perfectly and doesn't look out of place. (7.25 in) It's lightweight, has the classic band that is perfect after cutting to size, and is a joy to check the time on. It's a beautiful design and I have had no problems reading it in or outdoors."
5.0,They are perfect for baking cookies with my grandchildren
5.0,My mom a big prince fan and ordered it for her and loved it
5.0,When I saw these I honestly thought it was too good to be true. 18 pair of natural plugs for $20? No way. I assumed I would get maybe 1-2 good pair. I am completely blown away with how wrong I am. All 18 pair of these are fantastic. They are beautiful quality and they are true to size. I have had stretched ears for 8 years now and I have always worn silicone tunnels. It's been disappointing because I can never find good quality jewelry for cheap so I would always wear the same tunnels every single day. Now I can switch up the color to match my outfit. I am so happy and I would definitely recommend these. (I ordered 2G.)
5.0,MUY BONITA LA FALDA PERO CORRE PEQUENA HAY QUE ORDENARLA SIZE MAS GRANDE
5.0,Perfect size; perfect color; perfect look....Love love love these sunglasses.  Will have to buy more in different colors.
5.0,"Machine wash on DELICATE in a garment bag. The straps will wrap around the agitator and stretch, ruining the dress. :("
5.0,My 9 year old son wanted pitties like his sister üôÑ<br />These were an inexpensive substitute and he‚Äôs pleased with them üòú<br />I personally think they‚Äôre ugly LOL
5.0,So pretty and my daughter will love it for my wedding next year. Wanted something that looked like the set I will wear
5.0,Just what I expected and needed!
5.0,"These pajama bottoms are cute and lightweight. The elastic waist has allowed me to continue wearing them through my pregnancy thus far, which I appreciate. Super comfy and true to size."
5.0,Very light and effective. I took it for rafting and it‚Äôs waterproof.
5.0,I really love this and it is unique and sturdy. Placed on my back patio with a plant on it and it is exactly what I expected.
5.0,Perfect to use for concerts
5.0,"Order was processed very quickly, arrived as promised and the quality is excellent.  I will be ordering a few more for distribution to  friends."
5.0,Good quality and looks!
5.0,Hanging around
5.0,"Beautiful hat and ‚Äúchurch‚Äù white which means it‚Äôs very bright. Fits perfectly over my locs. I love this brand. I have 5 hats from them and ordering more colors, very firm and holds shape while after multiple wearings (I hang my hats up)."
5.0,"This is the best mask (of many) I‚Äôve tried.  After washing them they are ready to wear, not shrunk into little balls that are difficult to stretch out.  Unlike some masks, these have the metal strip for the nose, enabling a very close fit and reducing the chance that viruses will be inhaled through gaps around the nose.  Very comfortable fabric.  I recommend this mask over all others."
5.0,LOVE it. Can wear regular type bra and it really is flattering in the chest area. Wearing on my honeymoon. True to color (royal blue) not a navy blue which was great for me. I wear xl and that is the size I got and it fits! Not too clingy either.
5.0,My daughter loves her shoes.  Lightweight and comfortable. Very cute!
5.0,Me llego antes de lo esperado y me encanto
5.0,LOVE these earrings so much I bought my girlfriends each a pair! Perfect size and the color is beautiful.
5.0,"I wore this for my Hooding Ceremony for my Master's Degree. The dress was a perfect fit. I am 5'2 around 126 pounds and I got a size small. It was perfect for the weather as it was around 70 degrees. For the price, you couldn't beat that also. I got a lot of compliments. Love it!"
5.0,"Runs small,  order a size or 2 bigger. But SO COMFY and very trendy!!!  Ordering another in a different color!!!! LOVE IT!"
5.0,I really like the way these fit and they didn't shrink up too much after washing. The quality is what I would expect in this price range. And my husband said my butt looked cute in them ;)
5.0,These are amazing. Finally earrings that don't fall out or she can't take out.
5.0,It's a band that keeps your watch attached to your wrist! Boom!<br />No more holding it in place! Genius!
5.0,Great Quality for the price .
5.0,"Very cute and stylish, surprisingly not heavy on my ears. I have sensitive ears and they don't bother them at all."
5.0,more than one person has asked be &#34;where did you get that earing...love it&#34;
5.0,"Very soft, fits great, loose & covers the bottom. Gret with leggings! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 5‚Äù 145-150 lbs"
5.0,I bought this to make a Mary Poppins hat. It worked great for that. The hat itself is cute enough just wear.
5.0,Water doesn‚Äôt make it change or rust. True stainless steel.
5.0,"Great shapewear, fits perfectly and does what it needs to do."
5.0,My daughter loves making jewelry. These are so cute for her bracelets.
5.0,Size was great they look very fashionable just perfect for my face.
5.0,"Pop Fashion produced a fine, slimming top with this nylon/spandex blend.<br />It stretches out to conceal, and contain bulges.  I ordered a large, due to my longer torso.  It fits snugly, but I based the size I chose off of their given measurements.<br />A smaller framed, more petite buyer may even be able to use this piece as a slimming slip, as it could easily be pulled down as pictured advertised.<br />It is a very smoothing top, and definitely leaves seamless, and almost undetectable lines under clothing.<br />I chose to demonstrate the top using it as a &#34;body suit&#34; of sorts, and tucked it in.  Once I pulled another top over this cami, my extra inches in my waistline were well hidden. I've included a picture of the ribbing along the waist and stomach control area.  Also included is a picture of the straight topped backside. The top section has a much smoother, more nylon appearance.  It doesn't announce itself as slimming underwear, as it subtly looks more like a tank.<br />I was completely impressed with its comfort factor.  It wears like a basic tank, and doesn't cut into the body, the way some enhancement underwear does.<br />I gave this top 5 stars."
5.0,Cute and fit as expected.
5.0,Super cute dress but you do have to go up 1 or 2 sizes. Especially if you have hips
5.0,Such a unique and awesome look!
5.0,"I bought this hat to wear on vacation to the Outer Banks.  I love this hat, it's pretty and colorful and fit me really well. I had a difficult time choosing a color, they are all so pretty! I bought a hat with a wide brim due to my history of skin cancer.  It does a nice job of covering my face, back of my neck, etc.  The only problem was that it was SO windy that the hat wouldn't stay on my head, even with the chin strap; and the brim kept getting bent around.  (To be fair--even our beach umbrella couldn't handle the wind!  I always forget how breezy it gets down there!)  So in reality, it wasn't particularly useful at the ocean, but I'll be out and about to various lakes this summer and I think it will be more useful there."
5.0,You‚Äôll want to throw this one on for every occasion!
5.0,"I had order two other colors, love them, this one has seams I prefer no seams on the bust line."
5.0,"These socks are great, nice light sock. Not to thin, love that I got 3 different pairs of socks. Fit perfectly."
5.0,This was highly recommended and I understand why. Perfect. Comfortable
5.0,Beautiful watch. The band is short but it fits me. I need more information about the watc. It is a good watch.
5.0,"Decided I really did not want all of these, but waited too late to return them. Guess I can use them for gifts."
5.0,"The mask fits my face snugly, no air leaks. Some other KF94s were too big. It has adjustable ear loops which help with the fit. I bought these after watching Aaron Collins review on his Youtube channel. I‚Äôm happy with the quality."
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend to wear on his pinky finger. It looks absolutely fantastic on him! It's sleek with the perfect touch of masculinity. The craftsmanship is wonderful!
5.0,"Im 5'4, 145lbs with a 36DD and I ordered a large. This dress is simply beautiful.  The fabric is good quality and comfortable."
5.0,Very warm and great for cutting hay bales!
5.0,"Fits perfectly. I got a size small. For reference: 112 lbs, 5‚Äô3. Not too long and not too short. The tie in the chest area is long enough to tie around your neck. Cute for an off shoulder sleeve halter top look!"
5.0,So cute! Super soft! Nice quality!
5.0,Needed some extras for our neighbor so we got these. They fit well and no complaints. That‚Äôs about all you can ask for.
5.0,it's really good wathces for women. it's look so  nice on hand and size is good . i just reicived it and love them
5.0,"Gorgeous cover-up! The quality is great as well. The color is definitely green, not blue, but still looks wonderful. I've received lots of compliments on it already."
5.0,Adorable!  They look so cute on my 6 year old.  She loves them and they are holding up after a couple of months of wear.
5.0,"I like it, lots of compartments"
5.0,The pajama is thick and fit perfectly.
5.0,"Very soft, cozy indeed! This sweater was comfortable and fit nicely. The color was a beautiful rust color, muted, perfectly trendy. The laces' ends are free, so you may need to create end knots. If you're feeling crafty, go ahead and thread some lightweight wooden beads for lace ends. I'm very satisfied with my purchase & will be shopping this retailer again for additional sweaters soon. Thanks!"
5.0,I love that the body suit isn‚Äôt see through. It‚Äôs actually think so I love that. I did need help getting it over my shoulders. But it fits great. 5‚Äô3 200lbs
5.0,This turtle is too cute !  Looks adorable on my bracelet !
5.0,Excellent value with a little style
5.0,I bought this for a ball but it just did not fit my body type but it was an awesome look<br /><br />PROS<br />* Ships fast<br />* Great material<br />* Nice look<br /><br />CONS<br />I do not think this is a dress made for those that have rolls. The dress is form fitting so it's snug to your skin & I did not like that. But they do sell a dress with a ruffle cover this same design that I will try
5.0,"this is the perfect tank top to dress up or dress down! i am 5'6, and 230 pounds and have DD's and this was very flattering."
5.0,Love the dress pretty true to size the first time I watched it it faded
5.0,"Beautiful, makes a nice contemporary statement without competing with other pieces, love the design"
5.0,I love the material and feel of these shorts.  Comfortably casual but with a luxurious feel.
5.0,"I love this sweater! Fits great, lovely color!"
5.0,I always use this brand of visor. It helps get some of my sweat. And I love all the different styles they have. My hair is now dyed red so I had to get a mermaid one.
5.0,I like how my smart watch looks now
5.0,"Great product, got it on time and at a great price. I would definitely buy from them again!"
5.0,"The strap used to replace the original camera bag is of good workmanship. It is not made of cotton, but also chemical fiber. The original camera strap is also made of chemical fiber, which is much more comfortable than the original strap. And more beautiful!"
5.0,"I ordered their 'wolf ears', and they are really cute and comfortable. I will be ordering from Pawstar again."
5.0,"Shipped quickly! A little bigger and stiffer than I imagined, but it's ok."
5.0,"So far I love this band.<br /><br />I have a very sensitive skin.<br />And although nothing can beat the durability of the silicone/plastic wrist bands, these cause a serious irritation for my skin.<br />So I had to look for something more delicate, soft, gentle to skin.<br />It has the nice suede leather feel and look.<br /><br />I can not comment on the quality yet and I don't know if it is real leather.<br />If any defects come up, I will update my review.<br />But frankly, because I love the feel, for the price, I can switch the bands every few months or so.<br /><br />I ordered camel, it is a nice saturated color that really complements my skin tone.<br />Although the color is very saturated, it is neutral in the color scheme sense of the things and it goes well with anything I wear!<br /><br />Also, I have very small hands. Seriously, I mean, think &#34;child small&#34;.<br />And since there were no sizings on this band, I was worried it will be too large for me.<br />So if you are &#34;unusually sized&#34; like me, :)<br />I included the measurements in my pics to help you to decide with the size issues."
5.0,Very nice. Hangs beautifully but fabric is heavy enough not to look like a slip and I dont think you would need a slip if you preferred that.
5.0,Soft silicone rubber but really cute.
5.0,"Super soft, thin, light  comfortable.  And stretchy!!"
5.0,Absolutely awesome dress. The higher waist is very flattering and the material is great. Love the way it fits.
5.0,"Husband bought this for me for Christmas and I LOVE IT!! It's nice and long, kind of heavy but not too much. The chain is sturdy and the pendant is well made and looks very nice. Made this Whovian very happy!"
5.0,This dress is great; super comfortable and can dress it up or down depending on occasion.
5.0,"I'm 5'1"" and this top fits perfectly.  It sits just at my hips.  Seems well made and is lightweight and breathable.  Sleeves come just above my wrists which I'm happy about.  No pilling thus far through the many washings it was gone through.  I would recommend this cute top!"
5.0,Cute. Received several compliments for these earrings
5.0,My son loved this set for Easter and still plays with them months later. The lights went out on the bow tie but it‚Äôs still cute!
5.0,My father in law loved it. Good value.
5.0,Super cute and little!
5.0,"The material is amazing, thin enough for your body to breath and thick enough to not be see through. The size was perfect and stretched great"
5.0,Loved it so much I bought another one.

5.0,my girls love this dress

5.0,Le qued√≥ muy bien a mi hija
5.0,"It is stylish and fits my face perfectly. I love the oversized fitting which is currently the trend. Decent quality and worth the price, I've had it for a while now and it's my favorite."
5.0,"I love these shirts. Supper soft, all day comfort, wash and ware fabric. Supper cute. I have multiple colors and even the light ones aren't see thru."
5.0,"I liked the first skirt so much that I ordered a second one in a different color. It‚Äôs lightweight and just above my knees which I like. The shorts underneath are long enough and don‚Äôt ride up when I walk around. I don‚Äôt play tennis, but you don‚Äôt need to in order to wear these. You can wear these pretty much everywhere you go with a nice top. I find the material  very comfortable to wear in the Florida climate. The XL fits my height and body weight just perfect. Not too loose and not too tight. I have no problem areas except a little bit too much weight around the waist. But in the skirt it doesn‚Äôt show at all. I can highly recommend."
5.0,Awesome socks!  They put a spring in your step.  I bought them after a vein procedure but continue to wear them whenever I am going to be on my feet all day.
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to wash. I bought a second one in a different color!

5.0,"I bought these to have multiple masks for home, work, and cars. They are thick and comfortable."
5.0,"In the hot summer, the sun is strong, I need a hat for travel, I bought a beige hat, the size is right, the edge of the hat just blocks the sun shining on the face, perfect"
5.0,"we like that it‚Äôs not hi-cut like another brand we‚Äôd ordered. Fits well. Just got a snag but she‚Äôs worn it for a few months, through Nutcracker season."
5.0,Very cute good fit. Better quality than the bear
5.0,my purpose is not to cause chaos and debate in my store over if people disagree with me or not. so the wrist band is my subtle way of letting people know where i stand. i love the quality of the wrist band and have already received a lot of compliments.

5.0,"Just a little bit bigger than I expected,  but it works still.... it's still making me sweat and doing it's job."
5.0,I'm 5'5 and 260 pounds. I am pear shaped with a 38 inch waist. I ordered an XL and they fit perfectly. Very good quality for price. Length was fine for me with flats or heels and pockets are the best.
5.0,I like the design and the fabric is flexible. I don't like how it is similar to long underwear though I understand. I usually have my little one wear these after a bath!
5.0,Very nice umbrella. I would easily recommend this item.
5.0,Excellent build quality and perfect length!
5.0,"Needed a cocktail dress for a work Xmas party.  I'm 5 feet tall, 160 pounds and the XL fits well.  It hits me mid calf, which I think works for a 50's style swing dress.  Well made, nice looking, shape flattering dress!  Also looks nice with a red petticoat underneath to make the bottom a little fuller and provide an additional pop of color."
5.0,"BEAUTIFUL, STYLISH, AND CLASSY !<br />I was so glad I sized up like others suggested ... I ordered an xL but usually wear usa size 10.  I am 5'5&#34; tall, measurments are  36 29 39 and weight is 137.  The hem was right at my knee.<br />It fit perfectly and the material is a nice thicker weight too, but still can be worn in all seasons. It was not clingy at all, but even so,  I did put on a body shaper but that is just me, you may not need one.  This is now my favorite dress that I go to for church, weddings etc.  I hope this helps."
5.0,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of this beauty.
5.0,"These leggings are nicer than I expected: good quality fabric, well made, nice length.  The sage color is unusual and very attractive. Unlike some leggings, these do not have side seems which makes them more comfortable."
5.0,"I love my Care Bear onesie!!! It‚Äôs sooooo soft and comfy!  The hood is adorable! I have long legs and arms and a short torso so I never expect them to fit me perfectly (the arms didn‚Äôt have much extra length for me, but it still looked great!) I would order another in the future. I got a Medium and am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and wear a 6 in pants and a S or M in tops. Made for the most comfy and warm Halloween thus far!"
5.0,"I like the size and weight of this pendant and the color of the stones against the crystal. The crystal is not completely see through along the entire length, it has inclusions, but that is the natural state of the stone. I have black leather and silver chains I can use with it and both look great.<br /><br /> I just got it so can't tell yet about healing, but it feels good when I hold it."
5.0,Fits a little tight but works well.
5.0,Just as pictured! Highly recommend!

5.0,"This I a great diaper backpack. We needed something that can hold all of our kids stuff, but it also doubles as my laptop bag. It comes in handy when we go to theme parks.  And I love the side picket for chargers. The insulated pockets basically eliminate the need to use an extra lunch box."
5.0,My Parker 75 sterling silver pen totally recovered its original look in minutes.

5.0,Loved these! Will be ordering more!
5.0,Perfect lil guy
5.0,"I actually bought this wallet to replace a similar model that had a money clip on the back. That one held the credit cards vertically which caused physical damage to the cards over time from putting the walet in my pocket. I wanted one that held them long ways, but i became intrigued by this one not having the money clip.  Since i dont use cash that often i thought that i'd give it a shot, and you know, i dont miss it.  It was actually nice when traveling outside of the country to not feel like i was flashing cash every time i took the thing out of my pocket too."
5.0,"Very fast, the product is exactly the same as the pictures, really great service!"
5.0,"Just in time for Winter in the Windy City, this hat is warm but stylish! I literally get compliments everywhere I go I'm getting my sister one for Christmas. Great hat"

5.0,Love the bracelets bought one for me and one for my man. Sadly his did break while he was sleeping but contacted the seller and they were very fast to respond and are sending out a new one asap. Mine is holding up great. Highly recommend this seller
5.0,"I am madly in love with these pjs.  They are lightweight, super comfy and beautiful.  The only small issue I've read and experienced is the straps on the cami top pull loose.  I am handy with a needle and thread so it doesn't bother me to run a few stitches in the strap, but for someone who doesn't have that skill, they will be annoyed I am sure."
5.0,Looks nice.  Tho I don‚Äôt use it for everyday wear just special occasions.<br />Band is on the short side tho but still a nice band<br />Took forever to get
5.0,"I bought this earings for a very elegant wedding i had to attend, and I got a lot of compliments on them. I had friends that even thought they were the real thing!! (diamonds).<br />I truly recommend this earings!"

5.0,Looks good on the wife and she says they are comfy so win-win

5.0,"Nice, just as described. After 6 months using it, still looking the same."
5.0,"I've tried several &#34;affordable&#34; winders, this one is the best. It runs very quietly and has a ton of individual settings for each individual post. Oh, and it looks really nice too. HERES THE THING, these motors are belt driven, belts wear out on everything including these winder motors. So, prepare yourself for the inevitable, after about a year or two, one by one, each one will stop working and that is because the belt finally snapped... inevitable. Luckily these are incredibly easy to fix on your own for a whole .75 cents a piece and maybe an hour of your time. In a nut shell... you have to remove the cover piece that holds the posts (8 screws covered by felt tabs) and pick up some 1 1/2 inch o rings from the hardware store and simply replace the snapped belt on the motor. Your only other option is to buy a fancy Swiss winder box for several thousand dollars... up to you."
5.0,Lenses scratch easily but if you keep them in a case then this shouldn't be a problem. Constantly get compliments on these when I wear them out!

5.0,"Love love love this. For the price, it was made very well and fits great. I ordered a large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 159lbs. It fits a little loose but that‚Äôs okay with me cause it helps hide my mom tummy."
5.0,Super cute. Not too short. Perfect for a young girl.
5.0,"Worked outside doing snow yesterday & the wind chill was down 2 10 degrees<br /><br />Outside of gloves were soaking wet, inside was nice dry & warm<br /><br />I left them palms up overnight & were dry in am<br /><br />I do agree with the folks saying that the inner lining is loose, just take them off with care<br /><br />Overall, a good glove, just ordered a 2nd pair"
5.0,"I bought the size that correlated with my bra size on the chart, and they fit perfectly!<br /><br />I was worried about the bras not having an adjustable strap, but they're sturdy enough for my daily CrossFit workout, and comfortable enough for wearing around the house. Will definitely be buying some more :)"

5.0,"Wonderful product, really makes a difference when working long hours in front of a computer, highly recommended"
5.0,Delicate very pretty
5.0,fun at the farm stand
5.0,"I am in love with this short torso waist trainer. My first impressions were that the rubber felt weird and smelled weird. The hooks appear to be very sturdy so at first use, it was somewhat difficult to put on. After the first two wears, it was a lot easier to wear. Out of all the waist trainers I've tried, I like these the best because it did give me the hourglass waist shape and made my tummy look really flat. The best part?!?! It is VERY comfortable. The first wear, I had it on for almost 3 hours!!! As you wear it more, the rubber smell lessens and is more tolerable it's not a big deal. Other concern would be that if you wear something tight, the hooks are kind of visible so just be aware of that. Other than that, I really loved the product and wear it often!! As a disclaimer, I must state that I received this short torso latex sports waist trainer at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I bought this for my wife and she loves them. They are cute and she likes the way they fit. The lenses are not polarized but do have some sun protection. The plastic frame is light and comfortable These glasses are not adjustable. They come with a cleaning cloth, The plastic case they come in is really too small but the clothe bag works good for keeping the glasses protected. These are inexpensive and good looking glasses. I received these glasses at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Extra thick in heel and toes!! My son loves them and good price for Stance socks.
5.0,Was super surprised at how lovely this jacket looks. It's different than anything I've seen before and it feels like it's well made and will last. It's a little long on me so I might get it hemmed but with heels on its perfect. I def recommend.
5.0,"Bought this super last minute, was delivered quickly and fit perfectly according to size. I‚Äôm normally a small-medium but am 7months pregnant so I ordered a Large. Super cute!"
5.0,Bought these for my 6 year old granddaughter to wear to gymnastics. She loves them
5.0,"I adore these sunglasses! Mainly the only ones I'll buy now. I have quite a few pair and I will have every color of these as well. They do feel slightly fragile but I will check them out and come back to let you know. I love the pricing and quick shipping, each pair comes with a cleaning cloth as well. I'd definitely recommend these"
5.0,My sons pair!  Great item great for!
5.0,Awesome quality. Perfect. Used already had great comfort
5.0,"I have a 6 3/4 size wrist and older eyes :) the combination of 44mm case/dial size & color along with the big arabic numerals makes it easy for me to read the time. As with most Seikos I have to use my reading glasses to see the day/date complication unless I'm out in natural sunlight. The image shown is the wrong one, I've included images of what the watch really looks like.<br /><br />The dial is a beautiful beige/cream color, there are lume pips at the numbers only (the 12 o'clock has a triangular lumed pip for refgistration), the hands have lume as well and is long lasting; I can make out the time in the EARLY morning hours when I awake!<br /><br />I have not bothered to adjust the time, I've used it for 1 month and it's gained 30 seconds; this 4R36 movement is fairly accurate. I like the fact that the SRP635 can be hand wound and the seconds hand can be hacked, the crown is approximately 7mm in diameter and is easy to grip. This watch has an open display on the back so you can view the movement in action!<br /><br />NOTE: The description of the Movement is wrong, this is an automatic not an Analog quartz as listed.<br /><br />I find that most OEM bands are too big for my wrists so I removed the canvas strap & put this watch on a Moose Straps Nato; the band width information on the chart is wrong as well; the band width is 22mm not the 20mm that is listed.<br /><br />I measured the lug to lug length and it is 51mm, this covers most of my wrist but doesn't jut over the sides, the 13mm case thickness is not an issue when wearing long sleeved shirts etc. I tend to wear watches higher up (just behind the tip of the ulna more towards the forearm) so rotating my wrists for tasks doesn't cause the watch to bind/restrict movement.<br /><br />I plan on keeping/using this one for a very long time!"
5.0,These were a great addition to our dress up table for my daughters tea party!
5.0,Very cute!! A bit tight but we made it work. I would order a size up. My son can wear 3t/4t. I ordered a 4t and the overalls were tight. 5t would be better
5.0,Wonderful fit and quality
5.0,I love this shirt. Super soft and comfortable
5.0,"I use this for my hospital badge,  its super adorable"
5.0,Perfect replacement for one of my Invicta watches.  Very high quality; I recommend and will use this brand in the future..
5.0,My granddaughter loved them put them on immediately
5.0,Love that you get through belts with it
5.0,"For the price it's quite good.  The main dress material is &#34;clingy&#34; but not overly so--it shows your body shape but isn't skintight.  Get your normal size unless you want it to be extra flowy fit.  If you're short like me (5'1&#34;/155 cm) it WILL drag on the floor so be aware of that.  I would say unless you are at least 5'3&#34; to expect dragging, so if you're short either hem or wear heels.<br />Be aware that the sleeves are not sewn to the dress body at the front or back so raising your arms up high will cause the chiffon to drop from your arms.  I plan to attach them so that they will remain over my arms better.<br />For $15 I really have no complaints.  It's pretty comfortable for such a long dress and will suit my purposes perfectly."
5.0,Good quality. I'm pleased with the quality. Some of the charms at stamped front and back. Others are single sided. One of the charms stand up. Two of each design.
5.0,Warm. Nice colors. Well made.

5.0,Comfy and smooth fabric!
5.0,Beautiful product and speedy delivery
5.0,"I love it.  Been using it for a week now.  Perfect size.  Tucks in close to my side leaving the gun zippered area very handy.  My Glock 17, 9mm fits snug with no trouble getting it out.  Very sturdy shoulder strap. There are two main zippered compartments.  One small interior zippered pocket inside for personal items.  A small open pocket on the back that could be used for a small cell phone.  At both ends there are small zippered pockets for keys and such.  The belt buckle latch is heavy but fall right in to place on the magnet snap without help.  the material is very soft.  I would buy another if I could find one in black!"
5.0,Sweet for Halloween.

5.0,Granddaughter loves them and wears them everywhere her mom will let her.

5.0,I have received so many complements on this dress. I bought it for my daughters beach wedding. I love it so much I want to buy it again in different colors!
5.0,I think of it as a ‚Äúmuted‚Äù pink. It‚Äôs pink but a really cute pin. There‚Äôs like a soft hint of orange in the pink.
5.0,"I love the look - dainty, but functional. It is a bit tight for my credit cards, etc. but they do fit and I like that I do not need a large wallet as my bag is small."
5.0,"These were the best sunglasses I've ever owned, just perfect for me! The 2 that I had broke. I would buy several more if they were still available!"
5.0,"I love this skirt.  The colors are very bright. To me the blue is royal rather than navy,  which I love. The skirt feel silky."

5.0,Xmas gift for my wife. Looks great on her..

5.0,"I needed a yellow shirt...it's orange...it's cute, fits well, so I'm keeping it...but I still need a yellow shirt."
5.0,"There are different perspectives on wool socks, and personally I only wear wool socks like this year round. (Currently in South Texas) Even when serving America wool socks kept my feet healthy during all 10 deployments and only when I did not wear wool, did I have feet issues. They take time to adapt to but are my only choice now. These socks are very comfortable, well made, and not too tight around my lower calves/legs. This provides me comfortable and dry feet all day‚Ä¶even if my feet sweat. Give them a try and experience these for yourself‚Ä¶it may provide some foot relief."
5.0,"I love it! So cute, great fit, I love the buttons and that the fabric is stretchy enough that I don't actually have to deal with them. Amazing! This is my second product from Miusol and I've loved both!<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see is pockets. There is plenty of flow and room for them but Miusol if you could start putting pockets into these dresses and skirts that would put these over the moon!"
5.0,This swimsuit fit perfectly I am 5‚Äô3 165. Can‚Äôt find anything that is cute that fits since my weight gain.  This suit is really cute I got the large and fits comfortably!  I am going to order another one!

5.0,"Love these boots, so soft and comfy.  Fits true to size. I wear an 8 but usually get an 8.5 in these kind of boots as they are narrow.  These were a true 8."
5.0,Like Revs but the size was to big. I love my Revs insoles and slippers though. I will probably reorder a smaller flip fop in Revs.

5.0,Super cute! A lot fits ibside. Bought it for my 8 year old. We went to California. She fmwanted a cute bag smaller than a backpack. I want one too :) material and strippers awesome. And this light blue with white flower is soo cute.
5.0,Good quality not to big and fast shipping.
5.0,"This winter has been brutal in Minnesota.  I have tried different hats, scarfs, face masks, etc to keep my ears warm.  I finally bought a pair of ear muffs/warmers. Keeps the freezing air out and soooooo warm.  The price is very reasonable too.  My ears thank you."
5.0,"My husband is a big guy and wears an XXL hat. He has a medium-size beard, too. These masks fit him well. We've washed them two or three times each, and they are all still going great. The thickness seems good, not too thin and not too thick."
5.0,"I bought these earrings for a friend of mine.  I noticed she wore this same style of earring, with the bottom part coming from behind the earlobe.  Until I saw her wear this style, I had never seen them before.  So, when I saw them on Amazon, I thought I need to buy them.  The color of the star is bright and beautiful.  The picture does it no justice.  They were so sparkly, and looked very high end and expensive even though they weren't.  I gave them to my friend for her birthday, and she just couldn't stop talking and raving about them.  She wore them to work and everyone was complementing her about how nice her earrings were.  I am so happy she liked them.  I really liked them too, so I may order another pair just for myself.<br /><br />**It should be noted that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest evaluation of the product."
5.0,Nice clip........ a bit overpriced.. but still a nice clip
5.0,"Consider this an ego payment. A tee such as this, is one of those small rewards for self-sacrifice, hitting the gym and staying in shape.  This is a muscle-fitting shirt, and it flatters the firm male torso without shouting HEY, LOOK AT ME!  I purchased it in yellow (M) and it's just too bad the other colors were no longer available in my size. Why?  Because it's a winner."
5.0,Perfect for my Jamaica trip.  Lasted without fail.
5.0,I have ordered these before. Got different colors this time. Love them<br /><br />I noticed one reviewed said they were too baggy and then they shrunk.<br />Mine do NOT to that.  Fit perfect from the start and after numerous washes.<br />I suggest you order the CORRECT size and do NOT wash them in HOT water.
5.0,"Fits just as expected and very comfortable. No underwear lining in it, which I like."
5.0,I‚Äôm giving aprons to my daughter and family instead of stocking stuffers this year.  This is for my 5 year old grandson.  He likes to help cook so I‚Äôm sure he will like this.  The design is cute and I‚Äôm sure he will love the hat the best.  I think the fabric will be able to outlive even his rough handling.
5.0,"This is such a great hoodie.  I love Henleys, and this is perfect.  I love the lightweight, since I liive in Sonoma County, it's perfect 3/4 of the year, and layered the rest of the year.  I am in love with this hoodie."
5.0,Looks great! Adjusted to size easily. Clasp works very well.
5.0,"Excellent leather.  Excellent packaging.<br /><br /> At first I bought the fossil belt, total junk.<br /><br /> This belt is excellent leather quality, good stitching, nice buckle and sturdy. This belt would even be good for concealed carry with a holster.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Given as a gift to my son for his birthday.  It has a wonderful urban/business/dress crossover look.  Very stylish.
5.0,"I bought this the day before I went on an international flight. My Nike duffel bag ended up failing me and this arrived on time that same day and it was perfect to put essentials that wouldn‚Äôt fit in my carry on. It‚Äôs sturdy and for the price, it‚Äôs a bargain."
5.0,Works great at gun range. Nice tight fit!
5.0,I thought the price for this item was very fair for it being sterling silver.  Fits on Pandora bracelets just fine.  I have the silver one and my sister has the rope one.  It arrived in a timely fashion and came in a nice little red velvet bag.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
5.0,Beautiful booties! They fit nicely and are amazing quality. So glad I saw these while they were on sale.
5.0,Perfect for my husband. Comfortable. Fit perfect.
5.0,I am totally in love with this swimsuit! It is typically hard for me to find a swimsuit I love and that makes me feel confident and this one does the job! It‚Äôs the perfect balance between a more modest 2 piece and sexy! I‚Äôm usually a US SMALL and bought a small and it fit PERFECT! Totally fierce and perfect for Summer!
5.0,I charm is perfect and the size was requested . Beautiful
5.0,This pair of shoes is my 5 years old daughter's favorite.  Her favorite is my favorite!
5.0,I love the way it fit
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful and they really sparkle! My husband loves them on me, so naturally I always wear them! I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase!"
5.0,Pretty charm and am impressed how nice it is for the price. Recommend!
5.0,Perfect fit and sexy
5.0,Love them!  Fit great elastic waist came with a belt.  Just ordered 2 more pair!
5.0,Fantastic! Don't have a bad thing to say! I would recommend to anyone looking to wear multiple sizes! Highly Satisfied!
5.0,This is the best hand made purse I've ever had!!! I can't believe that with this kinda of super quality and they still can offer a lovely discount price!!! I decided to get another one for my dad's bday.
5.0,So as everyone else . No instructions.  But very easy if your rc friendly . Every screw was there with a couple extras . I decided to use the longer bolts and spacers to give it a 1/2 inch lift . There's a video on YouTube where he uses them in the leaf spring mount . But there was other bolts that fit better and same diameter that came in it . Works better with it lifted it Dosnt drag your truck down as much with weight. Ohh and no I did not use lights . Due to all the bad reviews of fire hazard ..
5.0,I'm only 5'2 so the torso is a little long but the fact that it's ruched around the belly helps to gather the extra material. The suit is very pretty otherwise.
5.0,This was a great buy. It fits great and looks cute too!
5.0,Great hat fits nice strap ticks good
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!!!"
5.0,"I love this shirt, so soft and cute"

5.0,runs true to size very comfortable
5.0,Fantastic!!!!
5.0,My customer loved her dog bangle bracelet
5.0,"Super soft, it is exactly how it is pictured."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5f5b21219ebb7bef06c3515a77b3be67]] Very comfortable and super durable! Easy to put on, doesn‚Äôt slide on the arm, great fit! Not flimsy and doesn‚Äôt look cheap! Worth it for the price!"
5.0,"The scarf is just gorgeous, my sister loves it! Very nice presentation box and timely shipping. Great!"
5.0,I usually wear a medium in leggings so that is what I originally ordered and they were a little loose for my liking so I returned for a small. The small fits perfectly! They are so comfortable and I love that cat hair doesn't stick to them.... BONUS!!!
5.0,"The twenty something girls i gave these to like them. They are pretty cool- they light up bright and very pretty colors. They are large, so great for some but if you have an average to smaller face you might find them really big on you."
5.0,Good product and timely shipment
5.0,"My 3 yr old son loves these.  I bought a few from a local dollar store and used them as stocking stuffers for Christmas and he still plays with them.  So when it was time for his birthday and I was looking for party favors, these came right to mind.  There a great option and buy, you get a lot for a little cost.  They fit perfectly on his little finger and the lights work even in the littlest bit of darkness."
5.0,"The story behind these is pretty cool, so I thought I would give them a try. This color is really nice. It's black and a little see through but not much. They are pretty thick - the construction is impressive. I like how the toe is reinforced as well."
5.0,Love these!!! Lightweight and super cute.
5.0,Practical and great price!
5.0,Love this top! So cute! Great cut for flat chested girls
5.0,So cute and fits true to size. I ordered a large
5.0,Boots fit great just what I wanted!!
5.0,These are amazing! So soft!
5.0,I love this dress.  It is so well made and lined I don't even need to wear a bra with it!  I am 5' 1&#34; and weigh 123 lbs.  I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly.
5.0,"This is the second time I‚Äôve purchased this bra. Love, love, love it. If you experience some underboob sweat, the bottom of the bra will have difficulty sticking, but it still works and it‚Äôs better than anything else I‚Äôve tried."
5.0,Russell Athletic is my favorite brand because of the soft lining.  The colors are true and they wash well and last long.  F. Parker
5.0,"Good quality, very reasonably priced!  Only wished it came in a 21mm width, but it worked out fine on my Oris 65....will also use at some point with an older tag heuer 2000....highly recommended!"
5.0,"Recipient said they were very, very comfortable."
5.0,very comfortable my daughter love it
5.0,I got so many compliments. They are hypoallergenic
5.0,Comfortable...got it for a discount. Love it..medium..5'4 142
5.0,Love my bag so much even match my sandals
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I am 5'10 and usually a size 14 so I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect!<br />I have gotten so many compliments on this dress. I wish they would make it in different patterns I would buy all of them.
5.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful!! I ordered a xl and it fit really nice ! The material is very nice and doesn't feel cheap ! It's also not see through . You can chose to dress it up or down . I didn't have to wear a bra with mines . Also the dress did not rise up often on me. It's definitely an amazing dress especially for the price
5.0,Very happy with this medal.
5.0,Great for a 9 yr old kid in California - she just  loved them and they wash well too and keep their shape.
5.0,"This is a form-fitting summer dress, which isn't easy to achieve. Most summer dresses, that actually keep you cool, are very loose. This dress allows for airflow by using a thinner fabric. Of course, for modesty, you need quality undergarments, but this dress allows for airflow without leaving you hanging out in the breeze, as it were. It fits exactly as described, is very soft and very comfortable, has a nice look to it, is stylish, but, most importantly, feels cool and seems to wick away moisture and dry quickly, when you spill on it or sweat in it. It is has been very hot here, this summer, and this dress has been wonderful, as have all of the dresses I have tried from this company. I love this and give it a full five stars, as a summer dress. In the winter, I'd be freezing. Right now, I am very grateful to have this. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. For me, this is a beautiful dress to wear and I am very happy."
5.0,I love them but they run small.  Just rec'd them yesterday and deciding if I should send them back for the next size?
5.0,Very pretty looks great with multiple outfits.
5.0,Nice and thick for winter which is wonderful! The fabric is like a soft t shirt material
5.0,The Fit was perfect and the fabric is very soft. i was very happy with this product.
5.0,These pants are so comfortable and flattering. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and about 125lbs and I got size Med so I can wear them lower. They are perfect around the waist and plenty long to wear a little heeled bootie. I‚Äôm going to need these in gray too!! Tank or sweater would look great with these to wear all seasons.
5.0,"Quite possibly the best and most accurate understanding of the Scandinavian mythologies and worldview ever written. Thats a bold statement, but also a true one. It is my most prized of my collection. Anyone who thoroughly studies this subject will undoubtibly agree with this author. In addition this book is beautifully bound on very good paper. Well worth the price for the content and quality of both the writing and the book itself. Anyone serious about Scandinavian religion should buy, read, and reread this work. If you truly desire to understand your ancestors and the mysteries they left us in our lore, fairy tales, and the runes this book is for you. My hat is off to Varg Vikernes. I only wish I could find the words to adequately express my gratitude for his and his wifes work in the study of ancient Europeans. Definitely a must read book."
5.0,"I have melasma and a deep love for the sun. This is not a great combination. The last several years, I used baseball caps for outdoor activities. This year, I decided to try these. I‚Äôm a huge fan! First, the chin strap is great for windy days at the beach. (Is a chin strap really more silly than be the scantily clad chick chasing down a hat that wasn‚Äôt secure? I think not.) Second, the material is breathable which is so much better than a cap. Third, the material really does dry quickly so you can wear in the pool without worrying about being soggy the rest of the afternoon. Fourth, the ponytail/bun hole is way more flexible than other hats. And lastly, my dermatologist is going to be so stoked! This is the best summer my skin has had in years!"
5.0,Like the amount!
5.0,"Works well, comfortable, looks good. You do need to adjust for size and for than a pin removal tool is best, you could use any point object tho."
5.0,"Love the design and fit of it, can't wait to wear"
5.0,These are great for me. Not all cotton but hold up well in the wash. Kind of like capri pants just to sleep in.
5.0,"Great for sensitive skin. I love Casio watches, but not Casio watch bands, which last no more than a year and irritate my sensitive skin. I bought this band for my classic w-71 watch, more than 10 years old, thinking it would be sturdy and durable. To my surprise, the lining is also gentle on my skin. I no longer experience any wrist irritation. The black band looks good too. My husband appreciated having the tools to attach it to the watch. I‚Äôve bought another to put away for him when his Casio watch band breaks"
5.0,"Adorable dress!! The ruffles are also on the back and not only at the front. It comes with a belt that is not fixed and neither have the strings that hold a belt ... I think it‚Äôs a plus, I always think that strings that holds the belts are so ugly. This is also a positive thing because it‚Äôs easily to swap to different belts. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, size zero or xs or xxs. The small size is the smaller they have. It fits a little baggy on me, but with a belt, it can be shaped to any body size. I love the color, it‚Äôs just different than your regular polka dot dress... it‚Äôs super cute!!"
5.0,Good compression socks!
5.0,Super cute !! My thin binders fit and even my laptop. Although the zipper is in the back it is manageable to use
5.0,"I couldn't believe it. 3 sunglasses for for $8? Has to be a cheap set. I went for it anyways and got them in the mail on time. I was instantly very very impressed with them. I threw them on my face and asked my roommates what they thought and all I got was &#34;wow, those are really nice&#34;. They were absolutely shocked when I told them how much I paid for them. These sunglasses are phenomenal for the price!"
5.0,I love this maxi dress. I am 5'2'' tall and small petite and this dress fits perfectly. It is a little bit long but if I wear heels that would be perfect. Great dress and I am already in love with it. Can't wait to wear it outside :)
5.0,"Very nice product ,good price, excellent Heat... it's nice that it's adjustable all around. I used it for deer hunting and it kept me warm on a cold windy day. I also use it for working in the garage and Outdoors in winter"
5.0,"I love this wallet. It holds my Iphone 6+, cards, and cash without too much concern. Been using it on a daily basis for over a year now. No signs of wear and tear."
5.0,Nice NATO strap for my Citizen dive watch. Not too thick & not too thin.
5.0,Bought this for my groom for our upcoming wedding. The navy color is perfect. It is shinier than the online picture but that's okay. For the price this is a great tie! He isn't a tie guy so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on the accessory. I highly recommend this product.
5.0,"I got this because my girlfriend and I got a new puppy. She loves the necklace and i really dig the magnifying glass effect, super cool and cute. booth of them love it(cant tell if the droggo loves or not)"
5.0,"Lovely, wonderful glasses for the price. Comes w drawstring bag, hard case, and microfiber cloth. The case has a weird smell to it but it's really not that big of a deal because these are great quality sunglasses at a fraction of the price."
5.0,These earring backs work great! Keep my earrings up straight and in place all day long.
5.0,It is a very nice dress.  It is a thicker type fabric and I like the feel of it.  It is snug but fits as expected.  I bought a size 6 and is very happy with how it fits and how it looks.  I really like the HOMEYEE brand.  This was my 4th dress in this brand and it will definitely not be the last.
5.0,Nice ring and great quality material.
5.0,Very cute I bought 2 sizes wasn‚Äôt sure which would fit.  The smaller size fit her.  She‚Äôs tall and thin the 8 fit her.  I may size down in this
5.0,"Love these, they fit great, are light weight and move. The only down side no back pockets other than that I‚Äôll be ordering another pair."
5.0,I'm going to buy more of these!
5.0,They are so cute on!! and the fur warm!
5.0,My favorite nighty. I like this material a lot. It feels good to the touch. I appreciate the design because it sort of cups under the breasts unlike so many other slip style nighties. That makes it look better in my book. But it isn't for very large busts. I'd like more styles and colors.
5.0,Good looking sunglasses. The nose pad got broken and they sent me a new ones after i posted my complain. Very please with the service and with my new glasses.
5.0,Does it light up ? No it doesn‚Äôt sadly. TBH smells like new car and the design do stand out. It‚Äôs nice to add to my Marvel collection
5.0,"Bottoms are see through, but I knew that from reviews. I bought it for the top. The top is great, perhaps a little big but the colors and pattern are just as pictured."
5.0,"I've had 3 pairs over the years and my favorite sunglasses. Be prepared for people asking questions and telling you your glasses are fogged up. The clarity is amazing. I wear mine when driving in daylight rain and it helps me see, i swear. Great for fishing also.  If i had one downside to say, it would be that they are a little heavy (especially the aviators). If you think that would be a problem for you i recommend the smaller lenses. I think they're called Colt, can't remember. Had those too and liked them as well."
5.0,Awesome very classy
5.0,"This hat is so cute, sparkly, and fun!  Love it!!  The sparkles stay on well and it holds its shape well."
5.0,"Cute bag, absolutely love it. It's a little stiff but hopefully with use it will easy up."
5.0,My wife loves the bag just perfect.
5.0,"I don't own much gold, but this piercing has a regal look with the purple stone."
5.0,"Ear muffs on kids are so cute and this pair by Halconia does not disappoint. Ever since giving them to her, my daughter wears these to the school bus stop every single day! She loves how soft and warm they are- the pink was a big selling point for her, too, of course. I think they fit nicely, not squeezing to hard and not too loose. My daughter is almost 6 and they look great on her and are super functional in keeping her ears cozy on the cold windy days here."
5.0,"The material is thick neoprene, nice and stretchy, with a bottom zipper.  I bought the wrong size for the 24"" hard sided luggage(that req. a L), but this medium fit a 24"" soft side perfectly. I love the pattern, it will be easy to spot on the carrosole.  Traveling overseas and wanting to ensure no one mistakes our luggage while waiting to pass through immigration, and protecting it during the trip."
5.0,"very nice and comfortable shoes, they are my daughters favorite shoes."
5.0,my wife loves it she wear a xl and this fit nicely. the length is nice and respectful as well.
5.0,"My daughter is a shoe lover but is only 7. Therefore, she outgrows them quickly. I am always torn between spending money on shoes that are built well and finding cheap shoes because she won't wear them for long. These are a great balance. They are made well and are super cute. They do run a little bit large but that just means she wears them for a little longer. Great shoes!"
5.0,Love this.  Work well.
5.0,Perfect! Very stylish and great fit!
5.0,A beautiful bracelet & for a great cause.
5.0,"Just tried these swim goggles in the bright sunshine at an outdoor pool. I have to say that these are the best goggles I have ever tried. The snap closure in the back is genius! They fit me perfect right out of the packaging. No need to adjust it for me, but there is plenty of room on the straps for making adjustments for a perfect fit. The bridge of the goggles at the nose does not adjust, however, I don't think that that would be a problem. I love that these are tinted and worked great outside in the sunlight. The water runs off these nicely and didn't fog up for me. No water leaked in so the suction worked great. These goggles also come with a swim cap but I don't think that I will ever use it. I actually used to wrap my goggles in for the trip to keep them from getting scratched. They do arrive with anit-scratch plastic film on each eye piece that came off easily before first use.<br /><br />These goggles seem really well made, but as I only used them once so far, I can't speak to how long or well they will hold up.<br /><br />I must provide a disclaimer that I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, fair, and unbiased review. This in no way influenced my rating or review of this product. I rely heavily on reviews when making my own purchasing decisions."
5.0,Lived them but wished they were identical pairs... So. Will order again.
5.0,I love that the hands and feet both fold over! My little is very comfortable in it and it's super cute!
5.0,"Love the slim fit, and the white trim definately makes the shirt more versatile to wear"
5.0,A very nice Christmas gift for on of my brothers.
5.0,Kid loved it lol
5.0,Beautiful top! Long enough to cover my Tushie with leggings on.  The fit is perfect for this American 5‚Äô9‚Äù 200 lb size XL woman. üòä
5.0,"I highly recommend shoeslocker brand shoes! We have several pairs and these slippers do not disappoint! My 9 year old wears them so much. She wears a size 4 shoe and these fit her great with room to grow in length! Oh, and easily wash clean in the washer!"
5.0,"I will never lose my house keys again, when I walk my dog it is around my neck."
5.0,My 3 yr old loves her Dory. I order a size 4 because my daughter is on the tall side and it fit her fine.
5.0,this worked perfect!  My daughter and her friends had a dress like your favorite character from Heathers day at school (they are doing the musical).  She is wearing this jacket (on the far right).  (P.S. Gotta love theatre kids!)
5.0,Great for an evening out when you don‚Äôt want to wear a sports band. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments and people are surprised that it‚Äôs an I watch I‚Äôm wearing.
5.0,My family is very happy with them.  Three of which are very large men working in the heat of this summer.<br />I wash them every night so they are ready for the next day.  Still look like new.
5.0,"Fine product.  I use to hang large, heavy pendants.  I bought two, one in black and one in brown."
5.0,"The product is made from real leather.Colour is the same like in the picture,a nice orange.The pattern is interesting.Price is very good for a real leather bracelet.It's a good bargain."
5.0,This is a nice piece. I really prefer internally threaded jewelry.
5.0,I love the feel of this top! It‚Äôs a little on the heavy side but still lovable.
5.0,"Great Design, fits great!"
5.0,They are great for cloudy days makes things clear
5.0,"This sweatshirt washes and drys so nicely, fits so comfortably and continues to be one of my husbands favorite.<br />We will purchase Russell athletic wear regularly."
5.0,"well made, warm and affordable"
5.0,Wife loves it and that‚Äôs all that matters!
5.0,"Love these riding tights -- unbeatable value for the price. The fabric is more of a summer lightweight, they fit pretty true to form -- maybe a smidge on the small side compared to brands like Horze. I am 5'8"" and weigh 140 lbs and purchased a large. The silicon grip is very tight and extremely grippy. Washed up well after one use. Wish they were available in more colors -- I would definitely buy more!"
5.0,"OK I know this looks like sleepwear for a convict, but it is one of the very very few robes I could find that has POCKETS and BUTTONS. Apparently that is not a common combo; who knew?  Anyway, it's very soft and I love it."
5.0,"As described, nice product."
5.0,I ordered these after I received the cosmic circle hematite clips from Body Candy which I loved. This design is very similar in that the crystal circle at the top is identical to the middle one hanging in the hematite pair. One thing I like better about this pair is that the thin chain like tassels dangle a bit better. They don't get twisted to the side like the little rods in the hematite pair.<br /><br />I would still highly recommend both designs though. These particular styles really do match so many types of outfits. They will make you feel like a total trend setter. Your pierced ear gal pals with the boring studs they wear day in day out will spy you wearing these beauties and the next thing you know the girls will be rocking some sexier earrings the next time you see them :) Count on it!
5.0,"Love this shirt!  I am 5'0, 130 lbs.  XL is a nice ioose fit for me  I was hoping it would cover my tush, but it is not bit short for that.  I wore it with black leggings anyway.  :)"
5.0,"This pendant is gorgeous. It is a large, blemish free, charcoal gray, perfectly round pearl. I do not believe this is a glass pearl at all. In fact, it matches beautifully with the dark gray pearl earrings that I bought this pendant to go with. It has very high luster and looks much more expensive than it is. For the price, you cannot go wrong."
5.0,"Absolutely love this ring. Have had it on non-stop since it arrived and have had no issues with it turning my skin colors (as some of the other reviews for similar rings said happened for them). All I know is this ring is the best deal I‚Äôve found on Amazon so far. Beautiful, perfect size and comfortable. Highly recommend."
5.0,Excellent product.  good fit
5.0,Very confortable shoes.  Bought it for myself.
5.0,"Love! Bought for a white-out Christmas party. Got my regular size, large. Love the fit and shape."
5.0,"These earrings are super light, which I didn't expect given their size. The felt backing is a comfortable bonus and the bright color really makes these pop! Great earrings!"
5.0,It fits as expected and it makes your body look so nice!
5.0,Love this sexy lingerie
5.0,"For the price, they are great."

5.0,"The earrings were light weight, beautiful. Have tons of sparkle when the light hit them. I got them for a wedding I was in. Got a lot of compliments on them. I have sensitive ears didn‚Äôt even break out with them. I highly suggest these earrings."
5.0,True to description. Sturdy and heavy buT what is needed for a main key chain!
5.0,"Took a few weeks to get to me but it got here before Xmas , it's super cute and I love it"
5.0,"These do not shape or hold you in,  but they are a very comfortable material & pretty"

5.0,"Love these things! solid, rugged, easy to use."

5.0,Very thin but shiney.
5.0,Nice dress very stylish design
5.0,"I work as an RN on a covid unit. This cap is very comfortable, and wears well throughout my whole shift. My favorite feature is the buttons on the side for my mask. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,These are so warm... but I can hardly hear anything while I am wearing them.. LOL
5.0,Beautiful pin! I love it
5.0,This top fits well and is super flattering!
5.0,I designed my costume for an Anime Convention that I attended. The feathers were absolutely beautiful in my locs. I definitely recommend.
5.0,This is as expected except the magnet gets loose with movement and when I‚Äôm working out. It also came with scratches on the latch of the watch band.

5.0,CUTE PRODUCT  JUST TOO LARGE FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER
5.0,Do I love this bag??  Well I have it in 3 different colors so - yes - I guess I do.  Perfect size and weight for an everyday bag.
5.0,Looked great but I chose another dress instead. Very beautiful dress.
5.0,So amazing. Brought it as a present for my husband and he LOVED IT!
5.0,"My son loves this costume.  While it is somewhat pricey, he saved up his own money and has been looking at it for months.  It is made of good quality materials and seems to fit well.  Overall a great costume!"
5.0,Great gift for the price you pay. Can't ask for a better price for quality of the ties. Shipping as stated-on time.
5.0,"These replacement bands are great. They fit well, and look very close to the original color of .the watch."
5.0,"Love this hat, fits great and is super comfortable. Wore it all day on day where temperatures were in the teens and was comfortable and warm all day in it!"
5.0,"Wife says it fits well, nice and warm."
5.0,So cute and a great value!
5.0,Arrived promptly.
5.0,This was a birthday present for one of my grandchildren
5.0,I love it fits perfectly.
5.0,I love this Kimono ..so soft and pretty as well. I ordered a second one to wear all summer long.
5.0,"This worked great for me. I am a security guard and the black no logo works for me. soft, warm and cozy."
5.0,super cute for our trip
5.0,My grandson loved it Sakely what I was hoping for
5.0,Looks great and fashionable
5.0,looks good (as pictured) but haven't worn them yet.
5.0,Beautiful i love it.
5.0,"Dress was an absolute hit at my class reunion! It was a Harlem Nights theme. As soon as I walked in, everyone was ooh-ing and ahh-ing. Would definitely recommend. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 174lbs. Bought a large."
5.0,Works better than others we tried.
5.0,Our 11 year old grandson loves it
5.0,"Such a cute dress, I bought it as a Christmas gift and wish I had one for myself! Great price too."
5.0,"Looks great, and good quality silicone. So far so good. I like that it's super light compared to my tungsten carbide ring (obviously, it's not metal) and that it stays in place. I've washed my hands and it still stays in place. I work with my hands working on machinery and these rings are more of a safety thing for me. Great quality."
5.0,Bought an XL and it fit perfect. Tons of compliments on this dress. I am 5'4 and 210lbs and the XL was perfect!
5.0,"You should've seen my granddaughter's eyes light up when she opened this present!  It isn't great quality, but in her eyes it is beautiful and she gets excited when she puts it on. Need I say more?"
5.0,"Love the earrings, and this seller offered the best price because I searched all over. The quality is very good. I debated on getting the 3mm width or the 4mm width. I ended up buying the 4mm width, but did want to let others know that they are a litter wider than I expected so the earrings stand out more. This is not a problem, but figured I would mention if anyone else was debating over the width. Love the size of the 50 mm rounds."
5.0,"It‚Äôs a professional diving watch, with a beautiful dial with good lume could take a page from luminox to make it perfect ü§© that being said it does scratch easily on bottom of bracelet my Rolex does too so I quess it‚Äôs ok. But all in all I love it ! My friends do too."
5.0,"I use this backpack for all my hiking adventures. It's very lightweight with multiple pockets. I usually put a bottle of water and camera equipment in it. The additional side pockets are great for small things like keys, change, etc. There is a hole you can cut out at the top to fit a hydration bladder tube through. Neat feature is that there is a rain cover attached to the bottom of the backpack. All you have to do is unzip it and pull the cover over the backpack. There's a built-in whistle on the sternum strap in case you need to call for help or whatnot."
5.0,"Cheetah is in right now! It fit my iwatch perfectly!  I have had it for a few months, very durable."
5.0,"I love owls, so these are perfect. Long enough and big enough too."
5.0,This coat is absolutely a great buy.  I am going to change the closure snaps to ones that match the coat.  They are silver and quite noticeable .  This coat is much nicer than it looks on the website.  The white color is actually like a winter white or ivory which makes it look very classy and much more expensive.
5.0,Perfect gift to a couple.
5.0,Christmas Gift...my grandson loved it

5.0,I got So many compliments with this dress!
5.0,Love it so much. Fits great and feels great! Cleans well.
5.0,"Very well matched stones.  Smooth, well polished, and deep in color. Will not catch or scratch.  Would consider this a perfect deep color of lapis. Impressed with the workmanship.  I give it an AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++."
5.0,"After reading the comments, I bought the dress a size smaller. It fits nicely. It is a cute little dress with a stylish asymetrical hemline."
5.0,So cute! Got these as a present for my boyfriend and he loved them. Wears them all the time.
5.0,I love this. Is so soft and comfortable to sleep in.
5.0,These were beautiful! Used them as my husbands wedding gift. They looked just like our pup and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with them. My husband loved them and got so many compliments on them. Great gift for bulldog lovers!
5.0,These socks are really well made.  The cushioned sole is nice and very comfortable.  I wear a size 15 6E shoe.  These socks fit my feet perfectly.  They hold their size when washed also.  No shrinkage.  I have two dozen pairs.  No problems!
5.0,Very nice belt. It enhanced my old Tissot watch. Thanks
5.0,just what I needed to be able to sing and speak without having to constantly adjust; breathing so much easier with this mask
5.0,These shoes are great!  Super comfortable and flexible and low profile enough to work with uniform or regular pants
5.0,Super comfortable. Im 5'4&#34; and 130lbs and the mediums fit great.
5.0,"I love this Tote it‚Äôs really pretty and it‚Äôs just the right size, not too big or too small."
5.0,"I like it it is one of my birthday gifts. I recomended for all people, it' like I expected. Than you so much"
5.0,I love it! Fits perfect and it looks nice not the cheap looking stuff lol
5.0,"I am 38 years old. For five years I've been buying socks only on Amazon and only from one company, but lately the quality degraded, the elastic after laundry became stretched out; so I decided to try the socks of KMET company and was pleasantly surprised. After the 5th laundry they were still elastic and looked like new. I will recommend them to all my friends."
5.0,I would buy it again in other colors.
5.0,"I am 5'9 and about 180 pounds (for the record folks think I'm more like 150, I carry it well, and I'm physically fit) and I ordered this to dress up some cute summer shorts and flip flops.  I hate when people say &#34;I love it&#34;, &#34;so cute&#34;, but then won't put what size they are or what size item they ordered...help a sista out and tell us so we'll know what size to order.  But I digress....I typically wear a large, sometimes extra large, because I am NOT petite...tall, and proud of it.  The large fits PERFECTLY on me.  I ordered both the pink and the black version, got the pink today and it is really cute.  This is cute but also kinda simple, in a good way.  Comfortable fabric, seems to be well made, NOT stretchy so keep that in mind, but a great top that you can dress up or down with some jewelry and cute pants or shorts.  It's basically what you see in the picture."
5.0,Cute. My Lion Guard fan loved it!
5.0,The fit and the good looks.
5.0,"I bought these as workout shoes, and when they arrived I was sceptical. After 2 workouts, im really loving the fit and support. They are a little bulky at first, but still comfortable. Most people like the light, freeform sneakers, but I prefer a supportive workout shoe. You should wear an athletic sock with these shoes because of the lining, otherwise you may slip around. I'm a huge fan of these now. They look awesome, and provide great support."
5.0,I wanted a flowy chiffon dress and this was perfect!! The inside dress is about 2 or 3 inches shorter than the chiffon that goes over it. I love it!
5.0,They‚Äôre  really nice and I like the color I got.
5.0,Simple and smart- no bead linkage to break and spill all over the floor; no weak clasps to snap apart- this is absolutlely the best eyeglass chain I have ever had. I am very glad I found it. The chain is strong and the end clasps are perfectly designed for connection and durability.
5.0,Great for the weather.  Look grate.<br />Fit perfect.
5.0,"These keep my feet slightly warm during the winter, and give me style in the summer. I love them and have received a lot of compliments on them. Just...don't wear them with shorts, or it looks really weird. Studs WILL not go in the leather without a fight, too."
5.0,"I am 5'6"" and 170 lbs (size 12), and the 1XL fit me just right.  Being in my early 50's, I have been around since pantyhose were ""de rigeur,"" so I've had a lot of experience in wearing them.  And I hate them.  The two biggest issues are that they bag at the ankles, or ride down in the crotch area.  Secondary issues are being too tight in the waist (making them uncomfortable and giving a funny muffin top), not being sheer enough, having noticeable lines running through them (cheap looking), feeling a little rough instead of silky, or just generally looking cheap.  Used to be, you could buy hose that looked good, but then have to constantly deal with baggy ankles, or buy utilitarian ones that were more durable--and looked it.  These hose are the best I've worn at being very sheer and silky, while still clinging tightly to my legs over time.  The waist is a little tight, but better than most.  (Tip:  make a 1/2"" cut at the waistline to make a tight waist a lot more comfortable.  Only recommended with ""control top"" pantyhose.)  These appear to be control top panty hose, since they are not sheer to the waist, but I would rate the ""control"" as minimal.  The plus side of that is that they are more comfortable and easy to pull up than typical control top hose.  I wore them for about 5-6 hours and had no bagging in the ankles.  At 5'6"", I had ample length in the legs to pull it up properly in the crotch area.  It did sag a bit over time, but much better than other hose.  I wavered between giving 4 or 5 stars, because their only drawback is that they do snag very easily, though it is a ""black line"" horizontal snag, and not the vertical ""run"" in hose that is a lot thicker and more obvious.  Over the course of wearing them, I got 3-4 snags.  All things considered, these are my favorite hose, and it's not a big deal at all having to wear them on the rare occasions that require them nowadays."
5.0,Every thing was ok except the size
5.0,"Bought for my mom as gift, she was really happy, still is with this, made me happy!"
5.0,"I bought this belly ring so I wouldn‚Äôt lose my piercing for an MRI, fit perfectly. Might even consider wearing beyond what I bought it for"
5.0,Value deal when compared to  crocs
5.0,It fits really well! I love that the straps are 4 little ties so you can wear them different ways or not wear them at all.
5.0,"I love this wallet...beautiful as well as functional. It holds everything that I need, but it stays slim."
5.0,very happy with
5.0,I love this! Maybe just cheap glass but very showy and just what I needed to make a statement!
5.0,"Very pretty, great price"
5.0,Very well made. My son loves them.
5.0,Very flattering dress! Super cute with leggings and boots!
5.0,"Love the material and fit! Washes well, too!"
5.0,My son loves it! He runs sprints outside and it‚Äôs perfect for what he needs in our cold weather.
5.0,"Love these! Fits perfectly, comfy!"
5.0,I got this for my mother as a gift and she seemed pleased with it. It's very pretty and keeps the eggs safe. She uses a bucket sometimes and I thought this might be a better solution so they don't clink together and possibly crack.
5.0,"I purchased these paw print earrings for a fellow vet tech. I knew they were on the smaller side when purchasing. She wears them in her second ear lobe piercing and she's thrilled to report they are a perfect fit, don't irritate her piercing and she can barley tell she's wearing them.  SHE LOVES THEM!!"
5.0,I love Koala Bears.I hope When my granddaughter gets she would like it
5.0,Beautiful color...blush light pink
5.0,Perfect fit! Moisture wicking material. I plan on ordering another pack and making these my go to panties!
5.0,"I Wasn't very optimistic about this But I was intrigued by the concept. Keeping your head and ears warm without having to worry about your earphones falling out and being lost every time you pull on or off your cap. But I was happily surprised. Despite having a sizable head, it was very comfortable, speakers were nicely placed to be heard well. I didn't expect sound isolation of course but sound leak was not profoundly identifiable by surrounding people. In regards to call handling, buttons are readily identifiable sound is clear to both ends but to the other end it sounds to them like your on speakerphone which is not a deal breaker considering the design. I cannot comment on Battery life yet-just started using it- but I will update if anything other than stated. Overall ... Cool product<br />Disclaimer... I received this product at a reduced price for my review and opinion."
5.0,Nice and thin and tight. Just as I hoped for.
5.0,"This dress makes me feel so sexy, It hugs all the right areas and feels amazing on!"
5.0,"I love this bracelet, I received lots of compliments."

5.0,I wear this just about everyday; it looks exactly like the picture; and is mad from good material

5.0,Nice and warm yet light weight allowing for play. Worked very well
5.0,Bought as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law. She loves them. They keep her feet warm!
5.0,"Thick and comfy, and in the most amazingly gorgeous shade of green _ I absolutely love wearing this sweater around the house, and I am sure I will love wearing it out once we are able to safely leave our houses again this year!"
5.0,"I ordered a size down (medium though I usually wear large) as other customers advise and I have to say, this top looks fantastic! Very flattering and got compliments on the blouse. Beautiful addition to my wardrobe. Very pleased!"
5.0,Its pretty gud and comfty.
5.0,Works great gets stains off easily!!
5.0,It‚Äôs one of two masks that fit my 5 year old.
5.0,The masks seem thin on first taking them out of package. I cut one and it is 4 layer so I feel pretty safe in them. They are comfortable and don't gap at the sides. I have problems with some masks coming up too high and in my eyes but these are great. My daughter and I both like them. Not sure how well they would fit a larger man size face but may be fine. The colors are pretty and I've had people comment on them and ask where I got them. I will buy again. If it matters-they are made in China.
5.0,This dress fits nicely and it's very comfortable.  I washed it immediately because it had a slight smell.  It washed up very nice and it actually looked better after I washed it.  I am thinking of buying it in a couple other colors.
5.0,"Really good organizer, it made really well. Very sturdy  helps to keep the shape of your bag(LV speedy 25) perfectly while holding everything in its place."
5.0,I was not expecting much because of the price but was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Also arrived quicker than expected.
5.0,Great hat; Great shape.  You soak it in water and it keeps you cool.  Awesome!
5.0,"Product is very nice material and looks great. A little big for my head, but I have a small one so it's always hard to find stuff that fits me well. It will probably be a little tight for people with heads with a total circumference larger than 22&#34;."
5.0,very pretty and nice and loose around the mid section area like I like it
5.0,I love these pajamas.  They fit so nicely and are very comfy.
5.0,Perfect distressed brown leather band. Zero complaints.
5.0,I this exact shirt and blue and I love how it fits! It is a soft all cotton and slightly tailored! It is wonderful! I would buy it again

5.0,good for Halloween
5.0,I have carpal tunnel and these have<br />helped put on my jewelry. Slides and clasps work perfectly
5.0,"I love this dress, it's fantastic for the summer and beach. And the pockets make it even better!! I wanted to buy more colors/patterns but they don't seem to really exist anymore. The ""Floral 02"" is my favorite. I also bought the black and ""Plaid"" -- but I returned the plaid. Just didn't look right in person. Hoping more options will be coming soon..."
5.0,"Bought them for my hubby, he loves them.."
5.0,Zipper on bottom was a plus!
5.0,"I am very happy with this bag.The only complaint I have, is that the seller forgot to include the 2nd shoulder strap it was supposed to come with, and I had to wait another 2 weeks after getting the purse for the seller to ship it .<br />But the leather quality is really good . Great look !"
5.0,Get them. I saw them on my step son and tried them on and was hooked. These rock when you want to look at little sassy. I can't tell you how many people have commented on these and I've only had them a  little over a week. A must addition to your sunglass collection.
5.0,"Beautiful, Well made.  I am a size 16, 5ft 9in. wt 220 waist 41, hip 48 and bust 40.  A true 18W.  I purchased a 5x because I was afraid it would be too small, however, I probably could have ordered a 4x.  I love this dress, I wore it with a Black Blazer and some ankle strap wedge heels.  You wont be disappointed in this purchase."
5.0,I absolutely love these house slippers. They have a hard and sturdy bottom which doesn't deflate as you walk. They fit true to size and are very comfortable and cozy. The light pink shade makes for the perfect girly addition to any lounge day. I recommend also fits great for wide feet.
5.0,"Very well made top.  Cute, comfortable and flattering.  Looks great with leggings."
5.0,"I am a costumer from Brazil and I needed a comfortable tennis shoes to take my kids to WDW in Dec,13. Found the perfect piece!"
5.0,Omgggg I LOVE IT!!!!
5.0,Perfect fit. Love this pair of shoes.
5.0,I love this hat. Great price as well.
5.0,"Durability is above par and worth the price.<br />These do need in soles, wearing these boots without them will murder your feet. I stay on my feet 10-12 hours a day and these in soles saved my feet."
5.0,pretty lacy and inexpensive<br />great with costumes or casual dress.
5.0,"As most everyone who buys clothes on line knows, it is hit and miss on sizing. I got my wife a medium, she is 5.4 about 145 and this fit her great but a hair snug. She loved it however and is working to slim down a little so it should be a great fit for a while. The dress took longer to arrive than expected but not enough to complain."
5.0,I love these socks.  Enough stretch to keep them in place.
5.0,"Ordered these on a Tuesday night for about 4.50$ total, came on a A few days later on a Saturday. They feel and look great. Best bang for buck."
5.0,Great fit and slimming
5.0,These are beautiful and fit great. I think I‚Äôm going to love the fun bright colors. They were definitely worth the buy. I plan on buying other colors. Came on time and in great shape.

5.0,Just started taking but works well and no upset stomach.
5.0,"I love everything about this sweater. The material is very soft and looks expensive. I got the white with gray and it is very pretty. I bought a small and it has a generous fit. I am 5'4"" and weigh 134. I get compliments every time I wear it. Would be a great gift!"

5.0,"Ordered for my BIL, who's a sneaker head, for his birthday. If you're looking for presentation rather than quantity, this is for you. It was actually exciting to watch him open it because it looked so cool. You don't get a lot of product inside but the tools are nice and the aesthetic is on point"
5.0,Instant hit at party and pretty sturdy
5.0,"Accentuates my curves nicely! I have large hips and an hourglass shape. This is loose fabric lingerie, so be aware that large breasts will hang, though it still made me look and feel sexy!"
5.0,"Love large and baggy, one of my favorite shirts."
5.0,This is a nice watch for the price.
5.0,I really like the everything about this watch band but it‚Äôs size. Had they offered a bigger size vs just a one size fits all I‚Äôd still have it attached to my watch. Kryptek if you make a bigger watch band I will buy that one as well.
5.0,Perfect- got the wallet also. It was a gift!
5.0,These are so soft and comfy. Feel very durable also. Would highly recommend them to anyone.

5.0,great design and the shirt has a nice weight to it and true to size.
5.0,"So cute and good quality for the price. It is a thinner width belt, which is exactly what I was looking for to pair with a maroon colored dress I purchased. I am a size small/medium and it fit perfectly around my natural waist. Definitely would recommend!"
5.0,Machine washable. Look good. No need to iron.
5.0,"Even though these pants are a little too long for me, I haven't hemmed them - I just enjoy wearing them as is.  They are well made."

5.0,"Love this hat, great price"
5.0,"Good quality. You don't just breathe into it like a whistle, you have to regulate your breathing to make it whistle, which is where the anxiety relief is. Thank you for a great product."
5.0,Very nice shoe. Great price
5.0,Beautiful..... Fits as expected
5.0,"Love it, looking fresh"
5.0,Nice dress that I can wear out to dinner or anywhere.  The fabric is soft with soft pleats and is a soft feminine pink color.  I will find many uses for it and the look can be changed with different acessories.
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend who is a die hard Seinfeld fan. He LOVES it!!
5.0,I got lots of compliments! Nicely made. Nice fabric. Use a medium iron!
5.0,Great price for the product.
5.0,As you all can see from the pictures.  This dress is just beautiful.  I usually wear large but I ordered Xtra large and it fix just right. I am 180 Ibs and 5.6. Dress is just as pictured
5.0,"Great summer piece.  If I could, I would wear it everyday.  Comfortable, yes, and very roomy, but with a nice cut to give it shape. This would also work in cooler weather, with a t shirt underneath."
5.0,I love this shirt. I bought all of the available colors. It washes well and needs little to no ironing. It is great for casual or kind of dressy occasions. I have had many compliments about this shirt. It is a great spring or summer shirt or a fall and winter shirt with a sweater.
5.0,AMAZING.....I LOVE this bag.... and I‚Äôm not easy! Worth every cent!
5.0,Received the package super fast. Bought it for my babies first birthday. It's going to be a Giraffe theme and all the guest will dress up as Safari. I was surprized on the quality of the material. Is is quite sturdy. Looks just like the picture. Ordered 2 packages of 12 and thinking of ordering a 3rd one.
5.0,Perfect... a really good quality and fits great!
5.0,Nice one and fit as discribe.<br />Thank you.
5.0,Bought for a friend!
5.0,"all pieces look great , however trying to match them with pieces is difficult because of the gold colors. for example this exact color matches my chain but not a different ring."
5.0,"These are great, elegant gloves for cold winter days.  I have a bad habit of losing my gloves, so I'm going to have to stock up on these!"
5.0,"It works great, I don't have any issues with fogging windows. My car is used all the time for outdoor activities and is only really driven on the weekend and for getting groceries. I defiantly need help removing all that extra moisture from inside the interior. I have a sunshade for the windshield which has a black side for the winter. I found that moister was getting trapped in between the glass and the sunshade which sucks in the winter having ice on the inside. This was because overnight is not enough time to remove excess moister from the car over night. If I were to leave the car for a week I have no issue so keep that in mind when using the product, that it will take time to work, don't expect it to work over night. Other then that I think every car should have this product just be careful using sunshades.<br />Another note is I have rubber floor mats and any water on them disappears overnight which has never happened before. If you have carpet floor mats I think it will help to dry them out but they will always be musty. I have to recharge the bag about once a month so it works pretty hard."
5.0,Great fit. Might wanna wear a pair of shorts under it for modesty. Otherwise great dress
5.0,This is the most excellent idea in the world I wish I would have known about this 10 years ago it makes any ring fit your finger snug and perfectly
5.0,Absolutely Beautiful üíúü•∞

5.0,"I bought one and loved it so much that I decided to buy not only one of each, but other items from the same store.<br />The cloth is one of the softest and most comfortable that I have ever had, and what I most love is how they fit! I can use them as both a dress and shirt (if I bunch it up around waist area).<br />Also, I was so pleasantly surprised at how their clothes don't have those horrendous tags that only itch your skin...<br />Couldn't be more pleased!!"
5.0,My favorite pajamas! Maternity friendly too.
5.0,My husband loves these shorts. They are comfortable. He mentioned that one of his favorite things is that although they are 5inch in seam shorts the pockets are still big.
5.0,"Walking a lot on vacation usually means blisters on the top of my toes from bare toes rubbing my shoe.  Not with these half/toesocks. Fit well.  Not too tight, not loose, no feeling having them on.  Easy to washout and set on hotel towel to dry.  Very happy with this purchase."

5.0,Great beanie.
5.0,The dress was perfect for my son's birthday party!
5.0,"So much better quality than I had expected. I will order more in different colors. The cup size is smaller than the band on the bra, so I'll have to have the band taken up, but this costume is sooooo pretty. I bought the purple and it POPS!!"
5.0,Beautiful and well crafted.  Great price. Fast shipping.
5.0,"Bought this for my 20 year old son, as he prefers to wear buffs to masks with the current COVID pandemic.  This is his favorites of the buffs I purchased, as it doesn't make him feel 'squeezed', but it comfortabley stays up over his nose and mouth while he works.  Would buy again."
5.0,Step daughter thought it was great
5.0,my favorite earrings currently
5.0,"I'm a high school teacher and bought this for graduation. It was perfect I'm about 5'9'' so it's not always easy find dresses that are long enough for work, but this hit me right at the knee. I will say the white of the skirt was slightly see through, just so I couldn't have worn bright underwear. But otherwise, it fits great, is good quality, good price, and is super cute!"
5.0,Amazing fit and quite stylish. A bit pricey but worth it when u want it so bad. Good buy
5.0,super cute and soft.  My 4 year old daughter loves them.  Order shipped immediately and received in less than a week.  Good quality
5.0,"I bought this to use on our 2 week European vacation. It‚Äôs beautiful and soft and I got a lot of use out of it. It works great as a scarf, shawl, or light blanket. It‚Äôs very sheer, but still provided warmth and comfort. The color looks just like the picture."
5.0,Beautiful! Exactly as pictured and described. Came in authentic and original packaging!
5.0,An easy way to remind others the proper way to wear a mask
5.0,Fits perfect! Really cute! Great material and comes clean easily!
5.0,My guy said he loved this blouse on me.<br />End of story
5.0,I bought it for my lil cousin & she loves it.. She wont take it off now..
5.0,My oldest daughter loves jewelry and trying my jewelry on so when I saw this necklace I knew she would love it. When it arrived I was surprised how beautiful it was and that it would be a great gift to welcome her home from sleep away camp. Since she's been back she hasn't taken it off except at night to sleep. She's received numerous compliments while we've been out and about. The necklace hits just right on her (she's 9) and the colors and little diamond are just the right touch for a young lady. She's only been wearing it a week so I'll update once she's worn it a while on the quality.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion. I only review items that I've tried and would recommend.
5.0,"I recently shaved my head, and I‚Äôve been wearing this beanie for months while my hair has been growing out. It‚Äôs super-comfortable and even though I wear it almost every day, it hasn‚Äôt gotten stretched out even though the material is very stretchy and thin(but not in a bad way!) I love every color I own, and I‚Äôve worn them comfortably in every type of weather."
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I got it today and wore it to work and was complimented
5.0,I love the fit and it's so soft!
5.0,OMG That's what I heard when I gave this bracelet to my grand daughter I thought it came with additional black rubber one but  thanks anyway I'm a number one Nana
5.0,Fits perfectly on my prescription glasses. Amber hue of the lenses makes things very crisp to see.
5.0,Very comfortable for everyday wear but a bit saggy for dress
5.0,These socks are absolutely adorable! They have the claws on top and the bottom has the paw print. The details are just too cute and the socks are very comfortable and soft!
5.0,Really nice shirt. Good quality and comfortable
5.0,"My wife love these, they fit her face very comfortably and they look great."
5.0,"I am a police officer and I wear this hat to work a lot of the time. I have a slightly larger than average head and it fits great, the wording was great and the material is holding up well!"
5.0,She loved how soft and comfortable they were.
5.0,This mannequin works great. Allows the jewelry to be the focal point and almost faded into the background verses the standard black mannequin. I will purchase again.
5.0,"Realmente estuvo perfecto, hermosa blusa"
5.0,"This is a great bracelet that reflects light well. The tungsten is nice because it won't scratch. My clasp got loose after about a year of regular wear (wore it maybe twice a week). Be sure to get it replaced when you first see signs of it slipping off, as it is very easy to undo while in motion. I finally lost mine after keeping up with it occasionally falling off for 6 months. Shame on me for being lazy. I'm happy to buy it again at $60 despite the clasp incident. I guess that serves as a testament to its overall positive impression. Add it to your shopping cart and enjoy."
5.0,The costume was everything I hoped it would be.
5.0,Perfect fit. Delivery was in time and as promised
5.0,Really works! Had been helpful when driving at twilight
5.0,Really cute -- my granddaughter loves them.
5.0,It's sized right and even after washing it didn't shrink. Very comfortable to wear. I am going to order more in different colors.
5.0,Dixie Dawgs teaming up with Amazon makes for good shopping.<br />Since one of the Grand Daughters went to UNCW I was happy to find their Logo decal and it now appears on my new vehicle along with the other schools.
5.0,Perfect for travel and I keep in the car for unexpected rain
5.0,This is a really expensive looking piece for the money.  The chain is really nice looking as well. Bought for a dog lover. She was very happy with it
5.0,Was what I was expecting.  Nice to carry specific items in your hand bag.
5.0,"I love these! Comes with several very useful and practical colors so there's always one that'll work. I have larger wrists and the band that came on my Galaxy Watch 4 was too tight to wear higher up on my arm while sleeping so it could monitor good, these are wonderful and stretchy, you don't even have to mess with the buckle just push the watch up. Awesome price for so many too!<br />I do wish the plastic parts were closer to the rose gold color on the watch but.....pink is pink :)"
5.0,"This is the perfect size and shape for my dresser that I purchased for my baby. This is exactly what I was looking for. This is a great buy, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,My wife loves it!  And she looks fantastic wearing it!
5.0,Looks adorable on baby girl!  Very different look than what you typically see in the store.
5.0,Love these boots!  I have numerous foot issues; always has been hard to find a comfortable boot.  These are super cute and fit great.  I have arthritis throughout my feet and I recently had surgery on the top of one foot.  These boots do not cause any irritation with plenty of room in the toe area.  Highly recommend!!
5.0,I love to wear thigh high hose and they fit very well.
5.0,Fast shipping and just as described.
5.0,Cold weather riding is around the corner and I'm ready. Beautiful workmanship.

5.0,I ordered for my mother and she loved them.
5.0,It was beautiful and fit my daughter's bracelet perfect just like it said.
5.0,As far as I know the person who received the item likes them. The socks happened to match the scrub outfit.
5.0,So cute. I smile each time I look at it. Bought this as a cute bag charm for my spring/summer bag.
5.0,Seem pretty durable.
5.0,The wearer loved it. Kinda ‚Äúdisposable/one and done‚Äù fabric and look- but for the price- well worth it
5.0,I love these earring. They are large in size but I like that detail. I have received several compliments on them. They were a couple of dollars and worth the price.
5.0,I ordered a size 16-18. It is well made. It fit way better than I thought it would. It could even button it up. The sleeves fit great they weren‚Äôt to short or long. The skeleton print was bright and printed on nice.
5.0,"Love the shape and style of the stress, comfortable, pretty, runs a little small, but it is stretchy, I went one size up"
5.0,"The material for this one is see through as pictured and very thin, to the point of feeling like you're not even wearing a shirt, so perfect for summer. I wore a black singlet underneath but I could see someone with a nicer body just wearing a pretty bra under. It is a pain to button cause there's so many, so I just leave it done up and pop my head through. It's a nice comfortable alternative to a dress when going out. If it wasn't for the material I could see someone thinking it looked ""Old Lady-ish"" but when styled with skinny jeans or a short skirt it has more of a cool alternative look.<br />Because of how delicate it is though I have been hand washing it, I don't trust my cheep washer and dryer not to ruin it."
5.0,Beautiful well made and great price!
5.0,These gloves worked great with my phone and kept my hands warm during my winter vacation.
5.0,very good valet
5.0,"Very fashionable, easy to adjust and definitely protects you from the sun"

5.0,This is a well made belt. I bought five. This looks amazing and fits great. Please get more items!
5.0,It was a gift and she loves it!!
5.0,Needed a bag to transport water aerobic weights to and from the gym.  The bag works perfectly and the meshing allows the weights to air dry.  Bags come in multiple sizes and colors and I plan to order some other sizes for segmenting items when packing for a trip.
5.0,Got way more than expected...they are beautiful
5.0,"This bikini is one of my favorites now! The fit is flattering, and it is cut very well. Great quality! I will definitely look to get another in a different color."
5.0,Love these sunglasses pink lens with hexagon frame shape. Are large enough for my face and great metal quality

5.0,"Wrinkle free, great value"
5.0,"Great price, great quality. Higher waistband is very comfortable. I have these in two colors!"
5.0,"This is actually a very flattering dress! I wore it for numerous competitions and it flowed nicely with the choreography. The neck is a little low cut, but otherwise it's a wonderful dress - comfortable yet sexy length, nice cinch and flare between waist and skirt, and POCKETS"
5.0,"I love this belt. I tend to shift in waist size from day to day and this belt is perfect for that. The best part is, if you really gotta go and you gotta go NOW, this thing won‚Äôt hold you up like a traditional belt. All you do is squeeze it and it pops open and down go the pants, perfect for the times you‚Äôre getting lucky too come to think of it. You also don‚Äôt have to adjust again when you put it back on either. Just click it together and it‚Äôs done and in the same place you had it. Genius idea and so simple."
5.0,"Bought for my Samsung active 2, love it"
5.0,Very nice clip!
5.0,"Simple, beautiful and well constructed. The black leather has a molded feeling which gives the bracelet form on the wrist. Perfect for every day use."
5.0,"I have purchased 5 pairs of these glasses for myself and family members and all raved about them.  The polarized lenses do a great job of cutting glare, especially when driving.  Because they are ""unisex"" the lenses are a bit large for women, I think.  But at least some styles come in pretty colors.  And the price is right!"
5.0,"I wear a 14, and have ordered items that are normally XL for my size. Your sizing chart really helped me get the correct fit."
5.0,My daughter competes Junior Olympics and her new gym requires underwear under the competition leo. These work perfect! They fit awesome.

5.0,Perfect for my son's doljabi (Korean 1st bday)

5.0,"Great dress! I am 5'6&#34; and weight 155 pounds and the Medium fits great! I am a 36DD and it's a button top, there is a very small amount of gaping. I am still giving it 5 stars because the buttons are in the correct spot, I just have big boobs. I would buy again!!"
5.0,I look great in these things!
5.0,"I got these earstuds  for everyday wear and love them!!! I get a lot of compliments and attention.<br />Great packaging and makes very good inexpensive gift ideas.<br /><br />I also bought a cute hoops and love them as well. Since the holidays coming up, I  got a pair for my mom and aunt.  These hoops makes a perfect gift for all ages.  In addition, I don‚Äôt have to worry about packaging it comes with a cute jewelry gift box."
5.0,"Love them!  They are high waisted, which is what I wanted. They do not roll on me at all. Love the non fleece have a slight texture to them."

5.0,Beautiful sweater and very good quality!
5.0,Nice and light - a little thin but summers coming - not sure how it will hold up to the wash
5.0,I love this blouse. Have received many compliments and it is so comfortable. I do wear a tank top under it for modesty but it‚Äôs great without as well!
5.0,Made my granddaughter so happy!  No Grandma needs a pair!
5.0,I really love this dress. I purchased an XL thinking it would be snug and its actually a little loose. I typically wear a 16. The fabric on this dress is super soft and has a decent amount of stretch. I would say it fits as it should but I do prefer this style of dress a little tighter through the waist.
5.0,"Took a trip to Alaska and needed a fleece jacket that I could wear lairs, because of the temp. Right on buy, it worked great."
5.0,"Great off shoulder too, beautiful print! Looks great on true to size fit not tight. Very flowy girly look!<br />Looks better than expected. Very pleased with my purchase!"
5.0,Beautiful!! Amazing quality for price. Will be ordering in more colors!

5.0,Great hat for protecting from the sun. Lightweight fabric and I really like the shade of grey.
5.0,"dress fits great, daughter loved it"
5.0,"I love these shoes, the color, the fabric, the glass heel. They are a little loose up the leg (I think this may be curable when wearing pants under) and can buckle at the ankles."
5.0,"Good, thick leather, a loop for your keys that is really secure. The person I gifted with it likes it very much. Keys really ARE easy to install."
5.0,Very very cute. The keychain is removable.
5.0,awesome fit loved it
5.0,"I already knew that these rings were not going to fit me according to the picture, so that is the reason why I can still rate these rings a 5. They do fit on other fingers however and I just adjusted accordingly. If you have big fingers and want the look in the picture then I suggest you go to the store and try rather then be disappointed."
5.0,This is a beautiful real stone that I think deserved a better quality of metal to be wrapped in. I usually won't buy plated items because of skin irritation & I was able to clear coat the wrap with clear nail polish so it wouldn't bother my skin.
5.0,"I wrote a negative review when I received my SoundBot Beanie Headset. I would like to rescind that review and update you on my experience. The beanie I received had a malfunctioning switch. It worked only intermittently. When I complained to Amazon, they immediately refunded my money, as they could not then ship a replacement. A few days later, I received the exact same item as a gift. I couldn't be more pleased. I wear it under my hardhat at work (Please don't tell OSHA) and it works amazingly well. I can listen to music when I am working alone and answer phone calls without having to remove my gloves or get crap all over my phone screen. The sound quality is quite good, and the volume is excellent."

5.0,"Best look, price, comfort available in my opinion"
5.0,"It is beautiful, it is very elaborate. The spheres are made of glass with very bright colors. It is easily adapted by means of an internal elastic band that joins the small spheres. I'm in love with Japa Mala."
5.0,These are the best headbands that I've found for absorbency and comfort.  Reasonably priced also.  I would buy them again when I need more headbands.  Very good product.
5.0,This hat work great and fits perfect. My husband loves it. It gives him enough shade and doesn‚Äôt get in the way of his golf game
5.0,"These are the best fitting, most comfortable leggings ever!  The fabric is beautiful - I‚Äôm now a loyal customer.  I congratulate NIRLON!"
5.0,"Purchased for my mother that mostly wears pajamas due to illness. She loved the purple color & says it makes her feel like a queen. Also says she‚Äôs never owned such a nice gown with color, style, pockets & overall comfort. With Prime, I was able to send to her quickly & she is enjoying the way it looks since has visitors. Would buy again."
5.0,Got these after Christmas and she loves them. She says the setting is really well made and that they are perfect.
5.0,Love üòç it

5.0,"Perfect stocking for my grand daughter, fits her personality perfectly! Excellent quality."
5.0,Looks great on and has not turned colors or turned my toe green

5.0,very good sweater. I bought it for my husband. good quality and cute.
5.0,Perfect little charm for a necklace
5.0,This is a very attractive watch at a great price.  I have had it a week and it keeps perfect time.  I like the two-tone case which adds class to the overall design.
5.0,I purchased this as a surprise present for my husband.  He loves it!  It seems so very thin but he has everything he needs in there and loves that he can actually sit down without the bulk of a regular wallet.
5.0,This little outfit was the perfect fit for my little man. The bowtie is the part that scared me because I've bought some that were a nightmare to put and keep on. The suspenders are very easy to use as well which I appreciate. The pants and shirt are a nice fit as well.
5.0,"Perfect size, perfectly adjustable, and NO velcro which is exactly the way I want it."
5.0,Strong and great for my 3 year old.
5.0,Great quality and color is versatile

5.0,I got this as a gift got a cat loving friend and was happy with the quality for the low price!

5.0,Loved this!!! Perfect for the summer dress it up or grab some sandles and head to the beach for a walk by the stars.
5.0,Good quality. Made my mom cry.
5.0,Excellent Merchandise
5.0,I use this for a VCH piercing and it is one of my favorites. Incredibly comfortable for everyday wear and looks really awesome. It has held up perfectly so far and has never caused me any irritation whatsoever. Planning to buy more of this particular style just because of the comfort and unique look over the traditional curved and straight barbells. Great buy!
5.0,He loved it it fit just perfect
5.0,Well made but the sizes are small and my cat is not so I wanted to get one big enough for both of us.
5.0,"Really cool and scary mask, we had fun scaring people."
5.0,This bag is great. Now most bags with this design are usually bigger. But I decided on this bag because of another customer review that said it was smaller than expected. Which is what I wanted. It's the perfect bag design but in purse size. You could probably fit a small tablet or iPad in it but no bigger than that. And there are more pockets than you see. 2 more zipper pockets and a small pocket on the end. With a loop on the other end which is good to hang your keys from.  Love this bag. Thanks.
5.0,Delivered when promised good quality. Wear it every day with jeans to work and it‚Äôs ‚Äúholding up‚Äù just fine . But it‚Äôs only been a few months
5.0,"I love these!  The sole is like walking on a cloud. My feet tend to get cold, but these keep them very toasty!  in fact, a couple of times I had to kick them off because my feet got hot, but it was pretty warm in our house at the time.  I wear a size 8 womens shoe...the 7/8 fits exactly perfect, meaning there is no more room.  So, if you fluctuate up to an 8.5, you should order the next size up."
5.0,These cufflinks are sufficient.
5.0,A friend gave me one of these mask and I loved it.  So I had to go online and buy a couple more.  They fit so well and don‚Äôt feel like they are sucking into your mouth when you breathe or talk.  The pearl neck chain was a real added plus. Makes it so easy to keep up with my mask at work. I thought the price was very reasonable and they shipped super fast. They are now my favorite masks!
5.0,I cannot say enough great things about the quality of this product! Best photo gift ever!
5.0,They were the perfect addition her dress.
5.0,Fits perfectly in the bag I got it for.
5.0,"Very comfortable cap, colors were exactly as I expected but most of all, durable,"
5.0,"I love Quay Sunglasses, stylish and well made. They are also the perfect price for nice sunglasses when one doesn't want to pay a fortune. My only complaint is that these didn't come with a case, as all my other pairs from Quay did.  What happened there?"
5.0,"Perfect and it isn't stiff and shiny, it has that worn look that is awesome.  This was a gift for my son to celebrate his new Harley and he loved it."
5.0,Love them the make my legs feel great during a 12 hour shift
5.0,"Love this cap! All the other scrub caps were really big on me, but this one fits me really well!"

5.0,I can now escape the daily life of a depressed human being and live my best life as a Pok√©mon.  This onesie fits perfect! I am approx 5 ft 5 in and around 200 lbs and have plenty of room in the onesie. I am now Piplup and ready for my first poke battle!
5.0,Cute cap

5.0,High quality. Colors are nice and saturated
5.0,"I usually wear 12us large but ordered xxl due to Asian size.  Top looks like the picture, sleeve might be a little long, very comfy. Hides my tummy too."
5.0,Came in quickly. They all appear to be new and unused. They are exactly as described white cardboard frames that when you look through them bend the light to make hearts. They work best on little lights such as fairy lights or Christmas lights as allowed to regular house lightbulbs. I‚Äôm using them as little goodie bag gifts.
5.0,"These gloves are a fantastic combination of functionality with touchscreens, warm fleece lining inside, and attractive design outside. They are very comfortable and fit well. Excellent gloves at great price with quick shipping!"

5.0,authentic-looking
5.0,"Warm, well made glove"
5.0,"I was pretty worried about purchasing this suit as there were no reviews. I had seen a very similar suit on amazon from another seller with great reviews and pictures but they didn‚Äôt have my size. I found this and decided to take a chance and am so happy I did! It fits great, holds everything in, and is just the right amount of sexy for a young mom! The material is sturdy and the suit is well made. I can‚Äôt believe I got such a great piece at such a great price! I highly recommend!!<br /><br />Ps I only purchased the adult suit, I cannot speak for the child suit"
5.0,"great fit, quality made and looks great."
5.0,"Love these!!! I am 14 weeks and not quite ready for full big panel pants. Pants that I can roll down are my best friend right now. These are super comfy and get the job down. I wear them around house, to run errands or to just whatever! I do recommend that you wash them a couple times before wearing. The fabric around my belly felt itchy but I don't know if that's my skin being pregnant itchy or the fabric.lol. and it only bothered me when I had the pants rolled up. I am 5'6. 118 before pregnancy, 0-2 Pants before pregnancy and I got a size small. And if this helps, even tho I'm thin I've got a decent size butt and hips! And a small fits perfectly! Photo on left is rolled up and photo on right is rolled down."
5.0,Nice Patio Umbrella. Item was as described. Works for me...
5.0,I ordered an XXL and it fit great. I am 5'6 measuring 40-32-40. Nice material and the dark color kept it from being see through.
5.0,Super cute. Well made.
5.0,"Perfect for my son in business, great fit!"
5.0,Makes one immediately more virile.
5.0,I dislike it because i never got it<br />I use it for nothing because I never got it<br />So sad uh
5.0,fit well. pouch is larger than expected...very surprised even my adult fat cats fit in this.
5.0,It's a little smaller than I expected but the colors are bright & I love it!
5.0,Not true silk but pretty and comfortable and exactly what I want. A little bit static in dry days but it is ok.
5.0,These socks are amazing. Just what I was looking for my kid. Though the non grip is not very effective. But I am not too bothered by it. Quality is good. Length is just what I wanted. Love it
5.0,I was going to buy a Sprush but decided to buy this instead. These rubber brushes get the job done and are very affordable (plus you get 3 in a pack!). I'm learning how to relax/texlax my hair by myself and this product is helpful.
5.0,Perfect for our servers
5.0,Si me agrado y me quedo a la medida
5.0,"This is a Casio classic. I wore these in high school 30 years ago. And the watch is still being made today. I bought this for my 12 year old son. I got in olive drab since we are a military family. He loves this watch. This will be the first of his road to watch collecting and will serve him for years to come. I still have my Casio watch's from high school and still wear them today. This is hands down the best watch for value, cost and long time wear. you will not go wrong with this watch. Only one warning its only 33 or 35 mills wide. So if you have a large wrist it will look small on your wrist. But great men of the past wore small watches so don't sweat it."
5.0,"Haven't used yet since it is a gift but it comes in a nice gift box and is beautiful, minimal and looks expensive.  Love that it's made in India and have had good communication with the company."
5.0,Excellent product for the price and quality
5.0,"Beautiful ring, I love it.  It was a ""Me"" gift.  Gotten numerous compliments."
5.0,"I love that you can have it personalized with any name and number of your favorite player.  I had mine made to show my support for Jim Kelly, Hall of Fame quarterback for the Buffalo Bills who is now battling cancer.  It is very well made and worth the price."
5.0,"Got a large in these, perfect fit! They have alot of stretch to them too. They are shorter shorts for girls with big butts like me so keep that in mind also!!"
5.0,"Great for carrying on bag. Great Gaylord, Sturdy and very convenient"
5.0,Works great for the gizmo gadget! We will be buying more for back ups. Thanks!
5.0,Love the fit and way this looks  Comfy and soft and washes great  perfect for layering or wearing on its own
5.0,"Lovely dress.  Got lots of compliments. I got the red as well. The red was a little loosed than this, which I like."
5.0,So soft. So beautiful!
5.0,not the size they claim run small
5.0,I bought these sunglasses to protect my toddler eyes from the extreme sun in Florida. He loved wearing them as well as playing with them. They made it safe through out the summer!! Totally recommending this product to a friend.
5.0,"Great length, perfect weight and style for any pendant.  Doesn't knot and fits right over your head.  Bought one for my mother and myself."
5.0,The style and fit are awesome
5.0,"Great vision with these, blue light blocking for light sensitive eyes."
5.0,"This is a super cute skirt.  The green is a lovely shade, very unique!  The skirt fits like a LLR and as soft.  I am tall and this comes to just above my knees.  It has pretty suble pleats that make it fun to twirl in.  Just started buying clothes on Amazon and if they are all like this I will be super happy"
5.0,This was a good purchase especially if you have a daughter that likes to borrow your earrings. They all came individually packaged nicely. The only thing I would change is for them to package equal amount of the different earring styles. I received way more of one style than the others. Pattern variety was okay.
5.0,Nice jeans fit as expected
5.0,"I had been buying Pact and Ecoland organic socks for my son (and mostly organic cotton socks are so hard to find), but he was outgrowing those and they didn't have larger sizes available, plus they're pricey. So in looking again, stumbled on these and got them in navy blue and ivory...they are PERFECT. The material, not too thin, no too thick, and very soft and stretchy. One thing I can't stand with socks is how they make the ankles really tight and they leave marks around the ankles...I don't believe you'll have to worry about that at all with these. They are very comfortable, breathable, and durable from what I've seen so far. Couldn't be happier and can't beat the quality for the price. Plus the company is great and ships out quickly."
5.0,Good quality. Fast delivery. True to pictured color!
5.0,"~ nice hat, i bought a gray one last year and this one i like also...."
5.0,Really like the look it gives both my diesel rollcages. Gives them a rugged tool watch appearance. Also looked great on my black seiko gmt kinetic.
5.0,"My 5 year old grand daughter‚Äôs favorite night gown. Long, comfy, warm but not too hot."
5.0,"Very comfortable, cool, and simple. I am also a thicker girl with a larger chest and this dress fit me beautifully. It also has a tie just above the waist so you can slim it up or down as you wish, and also has adjustable straps."
5.0,Wonderful soft material
5.0,"This is an extraordinary product. I used it as a centerpiece at a party and it was the center of attention. So many how did you do this questions and compliments. The party was in January and as you can see from the photo, they're still floating 2 months later. I added a drop of food coloring. I highly recommend this product and when these sink (if they ever do) I will reorder to use in my home as a conversation piece."
5.0,Had ordered in a medium was small so had too buy another
5.0,I LOVE THESE LEGGINGS. I wear them to the gym and also just out to run errands. They fit perfectly and don't slip down at all. The quality is so nice and buttery. I need these in every color!! Such a good deal for the price. I will definitely purchase again.
5.0,My Husband really likes this short sleeve shirt.  He wears it on his morning walks to keep warm.  It also makes him aware of proper form when walking.  It also dries quick and doesn't have the skunky smell of workout clothes.  I did go up on the size based on other reviews.
5.0,So beautifull and for the price omg just perfect for me
5.0,Love the colors and material is soft and flowing!! Great date night dress!!
5.0,gets tangled but cute
5.0,go you!
5.0,My 8 year old got great use out of these!
5.0,Very stylish knitted sweater with a sweet little bunny on the front.  Perfect style with a round neck and short sleeves.<br /><br />Comfy and casual. Perfect for skirts or pants. Really nice for those cooler days and great for Spring.<br /><br />Made of 100% Cotton and best to hand wash and dry flat.
5.0,Product was as described. It arrived on time. The size was accurate and the color is correct. I would buy again.
5.0,"Love the color and texture, not too thin. Ordered an xl and glad I did."
5.0,Loved this dress!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 150lbs - the Large fit me just right
5.0,Very Warm!!!
5.0,"These are the best socks that I have ever used for my ski boots. Wow! Warm, highly cushioned and excellent fit."
5.0,These waterglasses exceeded my expectations. Excellent quality for the price and they‚Äôre labeled as being polarized. I wear them when paddling and surfing on small days. Zero issues to date.
5.0,Great product for the price. It‚Äôs not see through (I got the black) and very smooth.
5.0,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase these, because, well - pajama jeans!  Very happy I decided to give them a try, because they are super comfortable!  They are a bit tough to get on at first or after you wash them.  I needed to kind of ‚Äúshimmy‚Äù them up and over my hips.  They do stretch out after wearing for a bit. I don‚Äôt get that gap thing in the back like on some other jeans I have either.  I don‚Äôt think anyone would be able to tell that they are not real jeans from a distance- maybe if someone was up close and inspecting you they could probably tell.  Shipping was fast. I wish that they were a bit less expensive only because I‚Äôm on a tight budget- but I‚Äôm sure I will wear them enough (and then some) to get my money‚Äôs worth!"
5.0,Nice material fit great
5.0,Nice style and great fit for older kids.
5.0,C√≥modo y los colores muy bonitos
5.0,"Love, love these. They are so soft and fit perfect. I would recommend them anyone with cold feet. Or just to wear around the house."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9590a431236d6197ab31b8a0b7c5949]] I absolutely love this item! It fits me like a glove!! Well aside from the bit that sags in the front, but it‚Äôs very unnoticeable my friends said they wouldn‚Äôt notice if I haven‚Äôt mentioned it. So my input is Don‚Äôt hesitate, buy  this item."
5.0,It‚Äôs old school so I love it I use to have as a kid and wanted one again
5.0,"Took my chances since this only had one review when purchased, but It's beautiful, perfect size-not a suitcase like so many of the new purses, lots of places to keep things organized, keeps its shape, and it's a beautiful blue."
5.0,"Love both. Seems to be made well. Time will tell, but really like both products"
5.0,"My Grandaughter who is a gymnast love it!  Great quality, greater price."
5.0,"They do what you expect, and protect your elbows, i would play on turf as a soccer goalkeeper with these. they also fit as good and do not slip. i would recomend this to anyone for a slim lightweight way to protect your elbows."
5.0,"I love candy skull ANYTHING. ‚ò∫Ô∏è<br /><br />This covers the mouth and nose, and I love the adjustable ear straps so I can share it with my daughter if she forgets to leave hers in the car.<br /><br />It's colorful and breathable. Washes nicely too."
5.0,"Warm, comfortable, and great looking. Well made product. Hat stretches easily to fit any size."
5.0,"I like the shorts. The length, color and spender materiel quality  are just right."
5.0,Anyone that is interested in Crusades or Knights Templar would really like this cross. It is on a nice long cord and hangs neatly and is solidly built.
5.0,This dress is GORGEOUS! So flattering and high quality!
5.0,Pants r super cute but really see through. My daughter begged me not to wear them to gym lol
5.0,BEAUTIFUL DRESS I LOVE IT VERY SEXY
5.0,"These shirts are amazing and work really well.  My child will only wear these shirts under her back brace and she‚Äôs never had an breakdown of her skin.  I do recommend being very gentle when washing them so that they last longer since they‚Äôre expensive.  I use woolite or other gentle on knitted goods and the cold, delicate cycle to wash them. I started out hand washing them but found that a front loader doesn‚Äôt add any additional damage."
5.0,I am loving my pulls! I lost the actual pull from the zipper on my bookbag. These pulls work very well and are cute to boot! They get pulled frequently during the day and have not fallen off.
5.0,Great. Just as expected.
5.0,My 12-year-old son absolutely loved it
5.0,Yes. Very durable!
5.0,These a nice but the clip part extends beyond the front of the earring so you can see the clip while you're wearing them.
5.0,I love this charm.  It looks just like the picture.  Fits my Pandora bracelet perfectly.
5.0,nice glassesÔΩû one for me and one for my boyfriendÔΩû
5.0,My new Spencos fit exactly right and make my feet comfortable all day long!
5.0,The fit is what you would expect from a basket ball like short. Nice for the price.
5.0,The magnets on these bands is amazing. They are strong & hold well. The only downfall is for someone like me who has tiny wrists the band double wraps in order to fit right.
5.0,I absolutely love my necklace. It is beautiful and quite sturdy; not flimsy at all; very well made. I am quite pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"I purchased this item for a photo shoot. It's not too shiny and is just the right size on my chest. I paired it with an elegant black strapless dress and it was the perfect statement accessory.<br /><br />The pieces itself is 4 pieces of metal that are connected by little circles of metal, so you could take it off and fold it on itself and put it away in your purse for travel.  The small metal loops for connecting the metal pieces can come off; in fact one circle fell off during my photo shoot.<br /><br />In conclusion, cheap jewelry, but good on a budget."
5.0,I love this and would like to get more in different colors.
5.0,"I bought this hat for my father. He love it, fits perfectly. Great quality."
5.0,seriously the best leggings I own. completely squat proof and super comfortable!!! I bought them in 5 colors
5.0,"Straight on of the package, I went to the gym and wore this for 2 classes back to back. After the first class someone told me it was inside out,  :) my own new style. Either way, it looked great. Fit great. Not too much compression so the fit was comfortable. I bought the red and the grey."
5.0,Very good product. My kid loved it.
5.0,Ordered this for my trip and it fit perfectly. Its just like a tie around skirt and will fit any size. Quality of the skirt of the skirt was great. Length was good as well. I'm 5'1 and it hit the ground like I wanted it to.
5.0,Gift for sister birthday
5.0,Very soft.  Bright colors.
5.0,"Great quality, just as expected"
5.0,I have been buying this for 20 years. One pair every 2 years . Same black. My always go to shoes whether it‚Äôs day or evening. Mostly for casual wear. Super comfortable even with my bunion.
5.0,Perfect. I wear it everyday.
5.0,"Boot fit as expected, I read the other reviews.  I normally wear a 9, I ordered the 10 because the 9 was out of stock.  It was big, but as to be expected.  I can now wear thicker socks, which is a plus."
5.0,Ran across this outfit looking for beachwear for my 2 year old granddaughter. She is hot natured so this was perfect for her in the tropical sun.üê¨
5.0,"I like it very much. When I were hat I got slot of complements,they said I am like a movie star üåü"
5.0,Looks great and sturdy enough for my husband's work.
5.0,"Classy dress, I like the material and the fit!"
5.0,"Comfortable, elegant, stylish, practical. Love it!"
5.0,My mom loves these! Expensive looking.
5.0,Kinda fun functional belt.  Actually works well.  Great design for people with soft middles where conventional buckles cut into your stomach.
5.0,"This bibs are so warm for winter that I had to buy it again. Medium size fits perfect for me (5'5'' ,170 lb); also the padding is great and very comfortable. I recommend this bibs."
5.0,Love the variety and streatch.
5.0,This storage box is perfect! The adjustable slots make it easy to customize. It was delivered on time and complete. So much better looking than a tackle box.
5.0,This was gift to me from me and I have had so many compliments.  Its a perfect bag for summertime.
5.0,I liked the colors and the fit.
5.0,I bought this last year to go with my Halloween costume and it was perfect. Love it!
5.0,My husband loved this looks great and expensive
5.0,It looks cute on
5.0,"Absolutely in love with this ring!! Size fits perfect, silver doesn't look cheap, moonstone has the perfect amount of rainbow to it!! Perfect quality for the price!!"
5.0,I find woven braided belts to be more comfortable than standard belts.  And this one is more affordable.  Goes well with jeans or skirt.
5.0,These lenses fit my Arnette Venkman's perfectly and are crisp and clear.  I would recommend them to anyone needing new lenses for their sunglasses.
5.0,"Bought these for my grandsons party which was a forte nite theme, all the kids loved them, and a perfect amount came in the package."
5.0,My son loves his slippers. The feel warm and he said it's comfortable
5.0,"I have been searching for a good (and economical) pair of polarized sunglasses for a while. I am outdoors very often, and I really care about protecting my eyes from the harmful UV rays. Most of the good polarized sunglasses are expensive, these are a surprisingly good find for me.<br /><br />They were packaged well, came with a pouch for storage to prevent scratches (yes, but unfortunately I think I scratch my lens more often when I was wearing them (or, better yet, dropping them.)  The shapes are flattering, and the quality is decent. Of course, they are genuinely polarized. When wearing them, I can look at window tints and other light reflections and see a different pattern.<br /><br />I love how they don't have any silly brand logos or names on it. I like my things that way.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend them to everyone. I would probably get another pair soon in different colors (or in the same color, just in case I loose or damage these)."
5.0,I bought these for my 11 year old daughter to wear to school each day.  She likes the mermaid designs and they fit her comfortably.
5.0,"This Paul Jones shirt fits true to size and is well constructed. The shirt isn't listed as a slim fitting shirt but is slightly tapered in at the mid section so that should be taken into account. The color, although I wouldn't have labeled it red, is very true to the images shown in the listing."
5.0,Love these earrings! I did had to buy magic backs to make them not drup on my ears but it could just be my ears. Very impressed with quality. I‚Äôd definitely buy them again.
5.0,These are BEAUTIFUL.  Will be used at our country wedding & we both love the quality and screw backs which will allow many uses.
5.0,This pendant is a nice size with good detail. I'm very pleased with it.
5.0,Great wallet for the price! Pleasantly surprised on how functional it is and it has lots of pockets to fit everything.
5.0,Ordered this for my Mom.  She was very pleased with it and would recommend it anyone.  You should try one.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:8e873385dd3b07f940f1f9e4e4a3ea6d]] LOVE my new shades. They are fabulous and in a nice pink color. The frames are great quality and sturdy. They are super comfortable to wear and I get lots of compliments!
5.0,"Small, sparkly and beautiful.  What's not to like?  These beauties made an instant hit with my wife among her earring collection."
5.0,"got this and wore it around Disney for layering but looked good even when top shirt off, supportive  and flattering. washed good durable and not see through"
5.0,I KNEW IT THE MOMENT I SAW IT THAT I HAD TO GET IT FOR MY GRANDCHILD.  SHE LOVES TURTLES AND I LOVE HER.  IT'S THE PRTFECT GIFT.
5.0,My son is collecting these nerd glasses. These were good quality for the price  and were well packaged. I would recommend
5.0,mAIL IS SUPER QUICK AND DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL
5.0,"I absolutely love this lightweight summer dress! It fits nicely, doesn‚Äôt need ironed, and is the iconic picnic plaid.  I leave the skirt unbuttoned and pair it with capri leggings for a carefree look that‚Äôs perfect for romping with the kiddos while still possessing a feminine flair!"
5.0,I actually purchased this for a friend but it was so well made! All the images came together on the front from both sides even though it was a button down!
5.0,I love high heels so this is the perfect alternative for casual wear
5.0,"I used the dress for a 40's themed event.  It was a great dress for the price.  It did smell when it came, but one wash took care of it.  I ordered a medium.  I am  about 5 ft 2.5 inches and 115 lbs and it fit  nicely.  I have no complaints.  The dress cost $15  so you can't expect it to be designer quality."
5.0,I tried a few silicone rings but these were by far the best fit and feel on my fingers. As a contractor and biker having a ring that doesn‚Äôt interfere with my grip is essential
5.0,It is very classic and nice watch
5.0,Perfect everyday purse.  Lovely purple (rich) color.  Very happy with purchase
5.0,My new favorite jersey! High quality stitched logos and nameplate. Be aware that these hockey jerseys run one size large. I wear a medium shirt but ordered a small and it fits perfectly. A+++
5.0,Love everything about it<br />Will be ordering one size up for my grandson when he grows out of this one
5.0,I love these bottoms!
5.0,Beautiful! True to color. Comfortable!  High quality!  Ordered more in every color. I am 28inches around the ribcage and 30 across the chest. The xs fits perfectly. I also have fibromyalgia and this bra doesn't hurt my ribs. It very thin and sexy but doesn't reveal when you are cold.
5.0,Love it fit just right
5.0,it‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been looking for looks very authentic
5.0,"Was looking for a button we could program with our own sayings. We attached it to my friends wheelchair (who has a speech impediment) and now when people are rude and step in front of her as she's rolling along she just hits this button and it says, in a good loud tone ... &#34;Move it or lose it&#34; .. :)<br /><br />thank you for this great product."
5.0,This dress is beautiful.! Very comfortable and photographed very well. I received a lot of compliments on it
5.0,Works extremely well. A great watch.
5.0,High quality product for a great price.
5.0,I love this vest.  I wear it on top of my dresses and it bring my outfit to another level.
5.0,Super cute purchased these for my friend's bday and she loves them!
5.0,"Great fit wears comfortably,only issue I've found maybe a better quality Velcro on the back pockets. There a great pair I intend on another purchase of these soon!"
5.0,I ordered 1 size up from her normal size 8 which was a 9/10 (140) I should have went to a size 150 for my daughter. I think that it fit her but it was squeezing her a little bit and she‚Äôs not used to the tightness of it. I would definitely recommend to size up unless the little person you‚Äôre buying this dress for has a lean skinny body. This dress was so beautiful I wanted to keep it. The silver had a blue tone to it and the embroidery is perfect. I hope to see this on sale again soon.
5.0,"I bought this for travel purposes, after seeing a great video review of it on Amazon.  It looked like the perfect purse for me. And, it is! I walk with 2 canes: shoulder bags won't stay on me, and I can't carry a purse. This light weight cross body purse carries everything I need to do my daily activities.  I like it that the money compartment zips shut.  My smartphone is too heavy (Galaxy Note 4) to fit in the front flapped compartment, but it fits in with the cash in the middle section, zipped securely inside.  The entire purse zips shut, as well, leaving only the front flapped area with not zipper, in case it is dropped. I can carry hand-sanitizer, all my cards, keys, check book, pens, lipstick, and a few odds and ends, like a little pill box. I love this purse."
5.0,Awesome product we just don't love this flavor
5.0,"Sized appropriately, good quality, Russell brand true to its name."
5.0,Fun and fashionable
5.0,"I love windchimes!  Over the years, no matter what you pay, they all deteriorate if left outside.  I bought these and other parts to repair, replace or make new ones.  I have tried using other things that I thought would work.  There I go thinking again!  These are very attractive, good weight and very reasonably priced compared to the larger box stores that sell Crafts."
5.0,Looks just like picture adorable
5.0,I love this a lot!
5.0,Very comfortable.  Washes great. Light enough to wear most of the year in Texas. Great pockets. Not too sheer. High enough at the neck. I'll probably order another in slightly different style.
5.0,This is super cute!  Thin material but very comfortable and fits as expected.
5.0,I love this dress. It is fragile and easy to tear.
5.0,Shocked that these are mader of a really good material. I use them everyday and absolutley love them. Not to fight on the head and really hold my hair my daughter had extremely thick hair and these work perfectly!!
5.0,"Ok, my texture-fussy archery kid loves this! Keeps hair instantly out of the way and doesn't slip! Kudos. I cant swear to sweat behaviour as archery isnt exactly aerobic..."
5.0,Very nice to wear when using the computer it takes the glare off from the lights
5.0,"Arrived just fine and on time but in a plastic envelope- no box if you are going to give as a gift.  Sometimes with imported shoes I need a 13 but with good shoes ($100+) like Drew I wear a 12.. I ordered the dark brown 11-12 and it was darker than  pictured. Given price and the fact anything in the price range looked like something my grandfather wore, I'm fine with that. I'm also 68 and hate looking like an old man...The ones with leather bows on the top are chewed off by the dog - a consideration indeed.  I also do not like open heels, So this requires an index finger in the heel when loading them. Barefoot they loaded just fine first time. I expect a slight stretch before trying them with socks let alone hunting socks I think would be too thick for my application.<br />1st test drive was to the coffee maker in the kitchen just before dawn,  then into my workshop where I started a fire in the wood stove. I did not feel the cement floor at all and outside temperature is 22F degrees. Back into the house for my coffee and write this review. Approved by the management at the Old Goat Ranch on the high banks of the Arkansas river.."
5.0,I love my necklace its perfect and the chain is very strong.  Thank you
5.0,"I ordered the size 2's and they're a little big on my 20 month old son, but I know he'll grow into them. My son loves to wear the gloves just like daddy when he rides along in the Thule Ride Along Mini mounted on my bike.  The Thule has a handlebar-like mount for him to hold onto.  The gloves obviously don't get much abuse under these circumstances but they've held up well through the first six weeks of use with 3-4 rides per week."
5.0,"This bracelet was bought for me about 3-4 years ago by someone near and dear to my heart. It is heavy without being overly heavy and sturdy and just gorgeous. I wear it everyday, as a matter of fact I never take it off. It is just as beautiful today as the day I put it on. I recommend it highly!!"
5.0,Love this dress! Fits perfectly and is so comfortable!
5.0,Great material and fit. Perfect for the long hot summer..comfortable and soft next to skin. I will order more
5.0,Beautiful watch.  Don‚Äôt think it would fit comfortably on larger wrists (I have very small wrists)
5.0,Exactly what we needed and well made
5.0,This was thin silk like material products fun small in size or at least for us it‚Äôs an okay value for the money but you get what you pay for
5.0,I cannot say enough good about this robe.  It's perfect. Arrived fast.
5.0,"These leggings are so soft and comfortable. Love the high waist. I have bought several pairs in different patterns. I wear them at home, also out and about with a nice tunic. Plus, the price is great. I highly recommend these leggings. They also come in Capri length which is good for warmer months."
5.0,"I'm so happy that I purchased this as a swimsuit cover-up. The quality is good and I didn't notice an defects, etc. I do wish it tied like a robe, but it worked out nicely for my beach trip."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4a95b9fc4789fb40771178f296c15cee]] For what this is, it is VERY nice.<br />No, it isn't supposed to look like a diamond pendant worth thousands, and if that is what you are looking for you will not be happy with this.<br /><br />It looks like what it is...a highly polished costume jewelry pendant with crystals.<br />And it is just lovely. It is well worth the money at under twenty dollars, but judge for yourself by the video.<br /><br />It is a golden heart inside of a silver one, and the silvertone has a double row of crystals. Not the super sparkly kind, but crystals none the less. In my opinion, it is a little nicer than my video could capture.<br />Mixing metal tones is not only very trendy, but also allows you to choose whatever metal color you like for your other jewelry you wear that day. It will go with your gold hoops or your silver huggies.<br /><br />Threaded through is a petite box chain. The heart doesn't slip around easily, which is a huge plus. How many times have you worn a pendant only to look in the mirror and the clasp is no longer at the back of your neck?<br />This one stays put.<br />The clasp is easy, it's the lobster claw type. Sometimes they are hard to open, but this one unlocks smoothly, although if you have absolutely no fingernails you'll have to master using the side of your thumb or finger. The extender has a tiny little fob at the end, a nice little touch.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting it for someone else as a gift, it comes on a card that is in a clear bag, and then inside of a velvet drawstring pouch.<br />The velvet isn't that awful scratchy kind that screams 'Cheap Stuff Inside!'. It is soft, and printed with the company name (Mondaynoon Jewelry) in gold.<br />Shipping was a lot quicker than I expected. It was nicely padded in bubble wrap for protection from careless postal equipment.<br /><br />Is it Tiffany? No, of course not. But if you've ever been in the costume jewelry department at Penneys or even Macy's, they sell similar things.<br /><br />For Christmas, as a holiday stocking stuffer, a birthday, or for Valentine's Day, or just because someone likes hearts, this is a sweet little gift."
5.0,My mom loves her bracelet
5.0,This is a full bodysuit and fits small 8 year old girl although torso part on the shorter side.  Not too skin tight .<br />My grandaughter loves it.
5.0,"Havent worn it out yet, but it lays just like the mannequin photos show. Very nice for a t shirt outfit or just an accessorizing bib statement necklace. Cant speak on the clasp quality like the other reviews here. One side of the necklace is kind of sparkly, but its not a loose glitter so it wont fall off. It seems to be engraved onto the metal. The other side is more matte. Its nice to wear both ways. Will update if the clasp breaks because that would definitely ruin the quality."
5.0,daughter likes it.
5.0,I know the slippers but I wear them with cute outfits outside and always get compliments
5.0,Just what i expected very nice..
5.0,"I like this cardigan because it's so loose and easy to put over whatever you're wearing. The material is just okay. What I don't like is the rouged sleeves that are held taut by bright white thread on the inside, but I wear this cardigan all the time regardless as it still looks good."
5.0,Great fit and fabulous look!
5.0,Great color and quality my son was super happy to receive it as a Christmas gift.
5.0,"I previously owned a pair of these sunglasses, which fit perfectly over my prescription glasses. Unfortunately, over the years, the frame broke and I lost one of the lenses. I couldn't wait to receive these! They are exactly what I needed."
5.0,"Finally found a tanktop that I can wear without my breast flashing their nipples and flying around with every move. So annoying and sometimes I had to wear two. Nice and comfortable material with just enough/ stretch so I can wear these without a bra. ( Being size D+) I just ordered me another set of 4. way better than investing in expensive bras that hurt my shoulder after an hour wear. I hike, walk daily so this is a lifesaver for me. Truly so happy I could scream it from the roof top!"
5.0,I purchased these rings for an Emoji themed week at my school.  The kids loved them.  We had no problem with them lighting up as some reviews stated.  All flashed including the Poop ones.  I do agree with some of the reviewers....they were a little difficult to turn on and off.  Once the kids figured them out though they had no problems.  Definitely purchase again if needed!!
5.0,Beautiful! Great quality !
5.0,Stunning<br />Look expensive!
5.0,I got a large/extra large even though I have a normal sized head and it fits okay. Everyone said that this medium was too small. I  wish it was adjustable.
5.0,"Very pretty, just like the picture. Got lots of compliments."
5.0,"I actually caught this product on sale, so if it didn‚Äôt work out I wouldn‚Äôt have been to bummed. But, it exceeded my expectations! Super cute and my girls both love it  üòä"

It's now been worn 3 times and it's gotten me a passel of compliments~~<br />Do pay attention to the sizing, so you can enjoy this right out of the bag and into the wash!<br />Very highly recommended!!"
5.0,"Soft, fits great, arrived quickly!"
5.0,Fit perfect. It was just the right length
5.0,"Very cute crop top! Nice length, not to cropped and not to long."
5.0,"I needed something to replace the zipper pull tab on my generic black crossbody bag.  I immediately thought of dog keychains since I love dogs.  I love how it turned out. The finish shows up nicely against the black bag.  I might have to change it to a smaller ring for easy use but for now I‚Äôm really liking how it looks.  I bought two of these keychains, the other one will be used as intended."
5.0,These are my new favorite jeans! Fit perfect in every way. Would buy again!
5.0,"Beautiful, excellent craftsmanship, and I love the pouches they come with"
5.0,"These were wonderfully effective!  I purchased two pairs, the red and lime green, for my two sons (2.5 years and 9 months) for an air show and miscellaneous use.  The fit was great on both boys with no issue popping them on and off as needed.  The boys were comfortable with them on and the jets did not bother them.  My 9 month old slept through both a Harrier and F-35 vertical landing demonstration and never flinched with these on.  I highly recommend them.  For the price and the quality, I am extremely pleased."
5.0,Great buy Thank Amazon you always make it Happen üíØ
5.0,I brought it for my husband.  I thought it will be too big but it was a perfect fit.
5.0,This hoodie fit very nice. I bought the black ombr√© and blue and both fit very well. They are very soft fabric and are a perfect gift or shirt to add to your closet.
5.0,Definitely definitely buying more
5.0,These are really form fitting and move when I move.
5.0,These worked out great for us on our cruise. Allowed us plenty of room to take items we needed and when used for the beach it was easy to clean and dried fast.

5.0,Had to order two sizes bigger but it fits great. Pajamas are comfy and I love them
5.0,"Super cute for beach vacation!! The tassels are removable if you want and I love that it has a wristlet attachment AND long crossover chain. Also, if you flip the bag around it is plain straw so it can be worn 2 ways. Very roomy for more than phone, makeup, wallet etc.  Seems well made."
5.0,"This is the cutest LOL Surprise t-shirt ever. Love the color, the design and the cute little feet. I don‚Äôt think the little feet will last as long as the shirt, but the top will still be adorable. Giving to LOL surprise loving Granddaughter for her 5th Birthday."
5.0,I was looking for a great postpartum Swimsuit and this one is great. It is a little cheeky which I like because other bottoms seem to cut into the bum leaving it looking bad. The straps can be taken off for a strapless look..overall it great for the price.
5.0,Perfect with strapless top. Moderate support so I use with tops/dresses that have a little elastic shelf.
5.0,I bought this set for my nephews birthday and he loves it!
5.0,Fits perfect its great... it ia not a long torso so if you looking 4 that not this one..... also runs a lil small I would recommend a size larger 4 each person as for me i wear  a large and got mines xl holds everything well...

5.0,"Love this so so much. Very soft and good material, Gildan t-shirt brand so the sizing is good."
5.0,Love this earring. I cannot sleep with it in but that's not a big deal for me. It does rotate but so do all other earrings. Very beautiful.

5.0,Super cute the quality is not as bad as I expected! Very happy with my order!
5.0,Love it. Very well done with superior finishes.
5.0,"I was hesitant to order it after reading some people said it was poor quality. I was expecting to get something like a pain dropcloth material. This is closer to a windbreaker but thin, so perfect for summer/spring rain storms. Probably need something thicker for winter rain storms for warmth. The sleeves are a little short but not like 3/4 or anything. There's a removable hood, removable waist tie and buttons on the sleeves with a band to cinch them if you want. I think it has a lot of good features and is a great deal for the price. Love the color too."
5.0,"Loveee, this mine came with two I don't know if it was supposed to but a very nice surprise. I gave one to my Mom."
5.0,"Bought this product in January of 2020.  Overall I don‚Äôt know how the seller can guarantee that the holder will never slip off the eyeglasses as I have experienced that several times. Though,  I must add that I put them through a fairly rigorous routine as I often leave my glasses dangling on my chest while I‚Äôm performing tasks. Otherwise, there wouldn‚Äôt be any issues. Have had several loops break on me but as mentioned, I expose my glasses to some physically stressful activities. If you‚Äôre mostly concerned about a durable eyeglass holder that won‚Äôt break during activities such as running, outside landscaping, mechanical work then this is the choice for you !!!"
5.0,Awesome<br />Quality wool mittens. I bought the 1-2 years and 2-4 and there was no size difference between the two but they both fit my 3 and 5 year old fine.
5.0,"Actloe Women Solid Self-tie Linen Mid Drawstring Elastic Waist Casual Pants with Pockets<br />Size Large - 29 inch inseam,  28 inch waist upstretched, pant leg 20 inches at hem,  44"" across hiney.<br />I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. I wear a small or medium. These definitely are too large for me, even if I like stuff loose!<br /><br />The pants are made of a nice linen like beige material that is very comfortable to wear. The waist band is adjustable by the functional drawstring. The color is very neutral. Legs are nice and wide! Perfect for the in-between seasons of winter to spring with a sweater and something much lighter in the summer! Nice crinkle fabric so it never looks wrinkled! Highly recommend! 5 Stars! Hope you  found this review and photos helpful!"
5.0,This bag is perfect for fans as well as employee's
5.0,Items arrived on and were as described in add.
5.0,"Really nice graphic design..,(and it keeps me toasty warm!)<br /><br />No complaints!üëç"
5.0,"Despite gaining quite a bit of weight this past year, it was surprisingly flattering on me. I can't wait for an opportunity to wear it out. Bonus: it's so comfortable, I wore it all day while I worked at home the day I tried it on."
5.0,"So far this is the best no show sock I have ever purchased. Who would have known that all you needed were anti slip gels at the heel for the socks to stay on. I'm completely GEL-ous that I didn't think of it first. They are cute, you can't see them with shoes on, and they stay on.<br />Also I've washed them twice in cold wash and they are perfectly fine as if they were new."
5.0,"Love this dress and the color is spot on, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 163 pounds and got a size large and it fits perfect. The dress hits right at my knees and love that it has pockets, overall a great quality dress. I would say if your looking for it to be a little more shapely to add a belt to the waist."
5.0,Ordered as a gift for a special friend. She was thrilled. Nicely crafted.
5.0,Love it! Received quick
5.0,"My husband bought this pair of Hestra gloves (via Campsaver, not Amazon) to replace his previous gloves. He will use them while skiing the Swiss Alps again in Jan/Feb 2017. Based on his experience with ski gloves, he believes these will be warmer and have better grip than his previous (not Hestra) gloves. Not being a skier, I can only take his word for their functional value, but I do trust his judgement implicitly on this matter.<br /><br />He bought the earth/black colours and they're much better looking in real life than in the photo. Very classy and handsome, the aesthetic aspect of the gloves adds to the five star of this review. The removable liner is made with wool terry cloth on inside of palm and wool pile on upper section. Husband says it would be best to put on the liner first, then the gloves, instead of both at the same time. That way, the putting-on would be easier and there would be no need for tugging.<br /><br />Note: Hestra, for anyone who doesn't know, is one of the most famous ski glove makers in Europe. A Swedish family-owned company, Hestra  has been producing gloves to the specific demand of Swedish and Norwegian ski teams for the last 80 years. The price might seem high for some people, but to quote Mike Douglas, the ‚ÄúGodfather of Freeskiing‚Äù, &quot;People need to realize the difference between really good gloves and the rest. Hestra gloves fit well from the first day you wear them and they last much longer than other gloves; it's an investment worth making.‚Äù<br /><br />This pair of gloves is in Hestra Alpine Pro series, which, according to the company's literature, &quot;are used by freeriders, professional mountain guides, ski instructors and others that place high demands on their equipment. They are highly functional gloves that can withstand much wear and tear.&quot;<br /><br />Aside from the measurement guide, Hestra also provides a printable template upon which one places one's palm to find one's exact size. This, as my husband's hands are between sizes, was a very helpful tool for us."
5.0,Beautiful belt . Excellent quality . The provider sent it timely and well wrapped
5.0,Medium fits comfortably. Good quality I would buy again.
5.0,"The hat is a very nice blue, goes with jeans, nice construction with quality material. I just wish the seller had not shipped it in a thin plastic bag. Should yours arrive creased everywhere, just take a blow dryer and heat the hat up with it and work out the creases while going back and forth across the material."
5.0,Super cute purchase! My girlfriend loved it!
5.0,great &#34;biker&#34; ring for guys and gals!
5.0,These glasses are everything that I expected. I will be wearing these for my Vegas Girls Trip for my birthday! Good product and these are a must have.
5.0,As a proud Beetle owner I had to own this little Beetle. It arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured. I love it.
5.0,Just like the original band that comes on the Fitbit! Fits great and is made well!
5.0,Loved loved. But trip got cancelled.
5.0,I like this product because it comes in a small giftable box and that you can change the charms and create what you like
5.0,They are pretty well made.  I've had some others for about the same price and were very flimsy and broke easily.  These are much better made pair of glasses that fit over my regular glasses.
5.0,"My dad passed away on April 16,2019. So I purchased this for his grieving wife. She loved it so much. She have a wide wrist and it fit her great."
5.0,It‚Äôs more of any orangish color but it‚Äôs still nice.
5.0,Love them. They allow your fingers to be free for phone or driving.  Also fits perfectly - my daughter has the tiniest hands and they fit her just as well as my hands.
5.0,"I purchased this watch for myself rather than for a child, as I needed an inexpensive watch to wear around the house. I love the bright colors, and opted for the neon green and black. I have a fairly large wrist [6.5‚Äù - 16.51 cm] and find the watch fits very comfortably without being too tight or binding. The band is smooth and slim, so it doesn't restrict my movements when working around the house. I don't wear it when showering, but feel safe when it gets wet while working in the kitchen or cleaning the house, even when watering and working with my plants. It was simple and intuitive to set the time and alarm [watch for the 'P' in the upper left corner if using AM/PM rather than military time], and I love the stopwatch function when exercising. So far it has worked perfectly, maintaining the time and alarm setting without problem. I also find the lighted screen helpful especially when I have to get up at night to assist my disabled husband, although I use it as little as possible in order to extend the battery life for the watch. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and find it a great value for the price!!"
5.0,"Very soft, fits great, looks awesome, quality shirt."
5.0,"My favorite socks ever, never have any blisters and I tried other socks but always go back to these."
5.0,Love the head bands! bandanas aren't material i thought they'd be but still great
5.0,"I will say that I love this item!  The purpose of this item was to wear only on my outerwear but I ended up wearing it every day on every blouse that I wore even in the house! The bottom line is this item is a great product that is well made and cute.  The another similar item sold online with the interchangeable faces does not compare in quality to this item.  I know because I purchased the set  which broke the first time that I used it rendering it unusable unless I glue it together.  Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this item.  In fact, I also ordered the Blue Bird that I wear on my denim jacket.  It is so cute that I am glad that I ordered it.  I will most likely be ordering more of these from Senfai"
5.0,The scary EL wire Halloween mask was the perfect addition to my costume! It was very bright! I am in a dark room here but you could see it lit up well even in the light. I received so many compliments on the mask.  It fit well. I was actually able to clip the battery pack to the mask so I didn't have wires everywhere. Loved it!
5.0,These are expandable and fit the kids great.  They love them!!
5.0,"my Daughter loves this dress and wears it as much as she can. As she says ""its flowy"" and fans as she spins and the material is light and airy."
5.0,"Wow ! What a great surprise with this little gem!  I ordered hoping that this formal beaded bag would be pretty and big enough to hold my phone. The beauty exceeded my expectations!  I bought 2, one in red and the other gray, just stunning . I carried both for 2 different black tie events . They are so pretty I just can't believe the price . The size is perfect for my large phone, makeup, and house keys. The quality is great, there is a handle to carry as well as a removable chain to carry on your shoulder if you desire. The fabric is satin , stitched flowers(tone on tone)  and some beading throughout. The clasp is also very pretty rhinestone and the gray one looks like a marcasite clasp. I'm very satisfied with these bags and love the fact that there are many color options ! Thank you!"
5.0,"Llegaron justo a tiempo, son de buena calidad incluso mejor que la originales, un poco mas rigidas."
5.0,I love everything about my new luggage!
5.0,"Great stuff for keeping my glasses from fogging up while wearing a mask to protect against Covid. Enough solution in the bottle to last a long time, clear instructions, and includes a cleaning cloth -highly recommended."
5.0,"Love them! Soft, breathable, adjustable ear loops. I love the bright colors!"
5.0,This is the perfect lightweight for warm-weather!
5.0,"Loved the dress. The material is pretty good and the dress looks great and it washes well too. M usually fits me well, I bought XL based on other reviews and it fit perfectly"
5.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; 165 usually wear a size 10 and 38D bra and I got the XXL based on the reviews (I typically wear a L in most things) and the bottoms fit comfortably (maybe even a litle big, i think the XL might have fit also) but the top is still a little too small but not un-wearable (definitely not much support). Overall it's very flattering and sexy, I feel confident wearing it! The quality isn't amazing but still looks great. I doubt it will last more than 2 seasons, but still great for the price. I highly recommend this if you are a D cup or smaller. Its really cute! Any bra size larger than that and the top will not work for you though... unless you want to purchase for the bottom alone."
5.0,"I bought these chains because I needed to replace the chain I spent $100 for that lost it‚Äôs shine. ü§®. I needed something quickly and found these on Amazon‚Ä¶ I could hardly believe that I was getting three chains for such a reasonable price.  They are just the right length, show off my pendant beautifully, and if I have to replace them it doesn‚Äôt break the bank‚Ä¶ Very pleased!"
5.0,"I originally purchased this item for my self.It wasn't cute enough for my tastes,but I'm certain a young student type of person would like this watch.It's looks like a Swiss-army type"
5.0,Not so &#34;yellow&#34; in person but I'm in love! These are amazing
5.0,Really nice jacket for the price! It was better than I expected. It is slightly too large for me so I'm exchanging it. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0,"LOVEEE these leggings!! They‚Äôre so soft and lightweight. Super comfy for lounging. I‚Äôm going to test them on my run tonight and update, but I put them on and they are perfect!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and about 140lbs and I got a medium. They are not very high waisted and they do slide down a bit, but for the price these are amazing! Plus no front seam. Definitely going to buy more üëå<br /><br />UPDATE: they did slide while running, but stayed up pretty well in weightlifting. Already bought a second pair ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,Love these and so does my son!
5.0,"I got this hoodie for my 12-year-old son. I went back and forth between a small and a medium and decided on the medium...it fits great. We currently live in Hawaii and have zero winter clothes. We're moving back to the mainland soon and I need some long sleeve winter wear for all of us and this hoodie is incredibly soft and comfortable for my son. Bonus is that once he grows out of it (which I imagine will be soon), then I can wear it!"
5.0,Wonderful product! The quality is great! I've purchased other bands for my Apple Watch and this one by far is the best looking and best quality! I have a Milanese Loop band from Apple and I seriously think this may be better quality than that one. Buy it! You will not be disappointed! And you can't beat the price. They also sent the tool and instructions to take the links out for sizing and it's very easy to use.
5.0,My son got this for Christmas.  He loves it.
5.0,Perfect fit on my 3 year old for gymnastics! Great quality. Seems like it will hold up. She loves it!
5.0,I was very impressed by the quality of this ring. My expectation were exceeded.
5.0,Very well made dress. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.

5.0,"Love it! Great buy for the money. Very soft, comfortable and fits as expected. Not see through."

5.0,they come in a nice box with a few gifts Nicely wrapped.<br />But most important i like the fit
5.0,"I am 5'0, 125lbs and my waist is 25&#34;. I ordered a small, thinking it would fit perfect, but I feel like its a little too big. It does not fit too loose, but I do feel a small gap and I constantly need to pull them up. Hopefully I can order a xs in the future. Great quality!<br /><br />Update 02/02/17:<br />Ordered the XS & it fit perfectly! I'm very happy with my order :)"

5.0,"I love it, my daughter was very happy and felt like a real princess!!!"

I got the khaki one, and color is same as shown in picture, I have been wearing it along with jeans and i am happy with the results.<br /><br />It came in with a lot of wrinkles, but it was expected. I hand-washed it as recommended and color did not wash off, and there were no lose strings."

I  had bought a set in size large in black for my husband , the compression helps with the circulation  and thus keep his feet warmer.

Oy.  I bought this scarf for him and he said he feels &#34;classy and stylish&#34; (and warm) when he wears it.  The plaid is a nice pattern and the material is soft and warm.  A great purchase for scarf lovers and non-scarf lovers alike!
5.0,Bought for hubby. He loves iit!
5.0,"Great deal and very effective headbands.  I do a lot of cycling and sweat like a pig* when I ride.  Without a headband sweat is always dripping in my eyes.  These fit nice and snug and don't stretch out when they get soaked.  And despite the fact that they get saturated with sweat, so far they have held it well enough that I've never had any dripping in my eyes.  Great buy.<br /><br />*Pigs actually don't sweat much.  They have a few sweat glands but mostly use pools of water or mud to cool off.  So I don't know where that saying came from.  Ha ha."

5.0,Wore to a comic con and got a lot of compliments and questions about where I got it.
5.0,"Got these glasses for my wife and she really liked them. They're sturdy, well made and the material feels stronger than many branded sunglasses.

5.0,This product was great for our team. We did the Crawl for Cancer In Denver.
5.0,"I love the idea of having the pocket inside but the pocket has a plastic material that is very uncomfortable/ scratched the skin. The sizing is small. the material is very soft. I may try to purchase a bigger size to see if they don't fit as snug the inner pocket may not hurt? Crossing my fingers<br />UPDATE: I received a bigger size and they do fit better and are more comfortable, the pocket is some what bothersome but not as much. I give them a 5 star for customer service and the soft comfortable material. recommend to size up"
5.0,I ordered a size up.  I wore this to Jamaica last winter.  It's very light weight.  I got so many compliments and some of the locals expressed how they liked the top.

5.0,"Beautiful design, sturdy necklaces. Makes a great gift"
5.0,"This 12 pack of non-slip socks has it all! I love that it‚Äôs a 12 pack and the colors are so bright, even the pastels! My daughter loves the little sticky grips on the bottom and I‚Äôm happy they make her more steady on her feet. Some of the socks in the pack are great for gender neutrality if you want to avoid blues or pinks. My daughter loves all of it! The material is very stretchy yet holds its shape. I‚Äôve washed several<br />pairs already and they still hold up like new. These are quality socks for a low price plus they‚Äôre cute by design!"
5.0,Gives me fall vibess

5.0,I bought these for my daughter they fit well and are cute for summer.
5.0,"I bought this a couple of years ago and have been taking them to travel with me. It does a great job organizing all the camera/game chargers and cords associated with it. I have been using it for 2 years now and I just leave everything on the grid when it's not in use, which I feared would stretch the bands, but it doesn't! Everything is still functioning properly and it's light weight. Great for odds and ends to prevent everything from sinking to the bottom of the bag. I have never had anything slip off the organizer and highly recommend it!"
5.0,Viajes
5.0,"This is a very nice dress/ cover up. The design is very beautiful and yet fashionable. I really love the unusual but an unique pattern. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I was a little hesitant about the boxy shape, but it is perfect. It's not too square, it still gives you the feminine and elegance. it did not see the slits in the side but with tights it was still very fashionable.The colors, the patterns and the type of fabric gives that Moroccan or Indian inspired look. I could actually wear as a dress or top. It fits just as expected. I world definitely recommend this product! I purchased at a free or discount. I gave my honest opinion is it unbiased and true."
5.0,I liked these glasses well enough to order two pair after loosing the first pair.
5.0,Perfect fit.  I'd like it even more if it came &#34;unfrayed&#34;.

5.0,"Warm socks for hiking.  A little snug on the calves but my calves are proportionately a little larger.  Comfortable and can wear with hiking shoes or boots easily.  Cute colors, too.  My husband (who loves fun socks) joked about stealing these."
5.0,"great cap, nice and airy"
5.0,"Customer service was superb and the quality of the visors they're selling now are definitely good, not to mention they also include documents substantiating claims of UV protection, etc...<br /><br />My story...<br /><br />I used to see people wearing visors that covered their face while driving or walking and would smile; couldn't understand why anyone would want to wear visors as big as these for walking, much less driving.<br /><br />Well, my spouse started walking regularly along trails near our house, ~4.5-5 miles daily, and wanted me to join her. I wear a broad brimmed hat and glasses that are photo-sensitive ( clear indoors, turn dark outdoors in sunlight ), yet I was still getting sunburned on parts of my face and glare was a bit strong.<br /><br />Wanting a bit more protection from the Sun and less glare in my eyes, I first started searching for a hat with a wider brim. Couldn't find anything that was wide enough to cast a shadow over complete face, so I reluctantly started searching for a visor. Couldn't find anything locally, sporting good stores, etc... Went on web and found visors by Sovis.<br /><br />I called Sovis explained my situation and let them know I needed a big visor because I'm not a petite individual and the only people I ever see wearing visors that covers one's face are women who were typically very small frame & petite.<br /><br />The lady I talked to at Sovis was very polite, courteous, patient and professional. She listened to all I had to say and recommeneded I get their extra large ( Oversized ) visor. She also made sure that the extra large visor was marked, packaged and shipped so there'd be no mistakes.<br /><br />It definitely protects face from the Sun and significantly reduces glare. I enjoy the visor so much that I don't walk without it, bright or not. Not only is it great protection from the Sun and reduces glare, but it looks futuristic ( as someone else mentioned ) and I like the privacy it provides. With my large brimmed hat and the visor pulled down, you cannot see my face while walking ( not that I'm ugly or trying to hide from anyone ), I just like anonymity it provides ( you can see the world, but the world cannot see you ). I get lots of stares and smiles. People are amused, especially young children. I can tell by looks and expressions, some men think it's unmanly. Couple of times while walking off trail and on regular street, car full of teenagers yelled out of their window some very profane things...<br /><br />So if you're a guy, expect for people to stare because you don't typically see men in USA wearing visors of this size anywhere, ever, unless they're welding something, grinding something or performing some other activity that requires eye or face protection.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this visor from Sovis. They're great group of people and this product is defintely worth every cent.<br /><br />I don't work for Sovis nor am I affliated with them in any way.<br /><br />Only item that would make product better is to put some sort of anti-reflective material on inside of visor. I wear glasses which prevents Visor from being pulled all the way down and close to my face. Because of the angle, inside of visor is like a mirror, reflecting everything around and behind me. While that's annoying, overall benefits and enjoyment outweigh the negative..."
5.0,Super sharp dress shirt
5.0,I‚Äôve been wearing this every single day for a little over a year. No wear and tear still in great condition I never take it off. I wish there were more just like it with a different design.

5.0,by far the best headband i have ever used.soaks up way more sweat than you can imagine.
5.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful wallet. The colors are vibrant and the feel of the leather is so soft and smooth. It came neatly wrapped in a little box and everything about it exceeded my expectations. It is really a great buy for the price. The only thing I would change is that the card slot with the window is smaller than my license so it only peeks out a little bit. It still fits, but isn't the window isn't the size of a full sized card. Not really a problem, though. Otherwise loved it."
5.0,Fits great. It's a medium and still a lil baggie too
5.0,Great fix for my favorite sunglasses.

5.0,Great compression socks!!! I've bought other compression socks from local pharmacy stores located &#34;on the corner of happy and healthy&#34; than they were sub-par to mediocre. My SB Sox were delivered this morning and I'm in love. Swelling has gone down in my ankles and legs but the true test will be my next day at work. Wearing them today I've noticed they breathe and don't feel too hot.  To be continued...

5.0,Came on time and allowed re to show a little patriotism. Love it (if you can ever love a face mask)

5.0,Got this for my Elsa costume for Halloween. Chain is kinda thick so I got a different one but it was perfect!
5.0,this is the fourth one I ordered - truely uniqe looking and come in many different designs.

They arrive folded and starched and individually packaged.  After a washing or two, they'll become the old friend you remember from the past.  These are the working tool and fashion accessory of the working class; from sun protection and breathing protection to clothing or hair accessory, these are what everyone wants to carry."
5.0,Extremely heavy and warm but comfy too
5.0,"I am 5'3, 135lbs, and a C cup. I wear size small for most shirts, but this shirt is so baggy I'm only going to use it for a PJ shirt. It is soft and looks cute, wish it were more form fitting."
5.0,"Love it, just ordered a pink one too. True to size."
5.0,"It's a little tight (I'm a 32C), which definitely ensures it's a high-intensity support. But if you want a bra more for hanging out or running errands over running, I'd size up. Also, fyi, I removed the cups easily if you are not interested in padding in a sports bra either."
5.0,A really cute simple ring.
5.0,Love these socks!!!  Best prices for great socks.  Just as nice as Smartwool or Darn Tough for a fraction of the price.
5.0,"Good product, and meets my expectations are very cute. 100% recommended. Would you purchase undoubtedly lenses this line. Very good"
5.0,"This is a way to have a wet bandana around your neck for a couple of hours at a time.  By cooling the neck, you are keeping your head cooler.  We soak them for a few minutes at the resort, then place them in ziplock bags until we get to the trail head.  Around the neck fully saturated, sometimes they are a bit drippy, but on a hot day, the shirt dries quickly.  Tried another brand once but the cooling effect did not last as long."
5.0,Arrived on time. Nice product. As advertised!
5.0,"Love the skirt. Fits well, soft."
5.0,"This was a gift for mom for Mother's Day.  She loved it!!  The gift wrapping was beautiful, and the purse was wrapped so carefully inside.  Just the right size too.  Very soft leather in a pretty gray shade."
5.0,"üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br /><br />Excellent and comfortable. Wore it for mardi gras with a bunch of smaller emoji plushes attached to it and to my beanie. I was the emoji hive mother.<br /><br />Just, fair warning: if you use it for mardi gras, you might randomly be told by a tourist that your costume is &#34;too easy&#34;. Just throw your drink at them and keep having fun.<br /><br />üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend who is my workout partner. He loves it. The dri fit is a good material especially when it comes to sweating cause we‚Äôre not scared of that. Good but
5.0,fits welll and has held up so far
5.0,I love the dress so much ordered the opposite color already.  It has a flattering shape that doesnt get captured by photo.. Fabric is like a very thin scuba material.

5.0,"I purchased this wallet for my Grandpa. He really liked the quality of the leather, how it can protect you from RFID theft and the amount of space in the wallet. He hasn't had a new wallet in over 20 years so I wanted to give him the best wallet I could find."
5.0,Beautiful  quality

5.0,This is a really comfy sweatshirt. Nice and warm. Love it!
5.0,Beautiful quality product. Get compliments everywhere I carry it!
5.0,This Ring Sizer Tool is simple to use and easy to understand. The instructions on the sizes are straight forward for what you need. The sizer is made up a strong smooth plastic while the metal ring holds everything together for durability and ease of use. I would recommend this tool for personal as well as professional use. Great product from a proven company.
5.0,This is the perfect size and it has the various pockets that I like to keep things more organized and easier to find.  It is a geniuine Coach bag so the quality is very good and the price was right too.
5.0,"Figured I would buy this as a Faithful fan for posterity. Love the design and owning a piece of history before they are gone forever, but as a snapback it does run smaller than I'm used to. Usually I have 4 or 5 dots clicked, but this hat I can only keep 2 dots clicked for the proper fit. Otherwise excellent New Era quality!"
5.0,"These were hard to find a year ago. Glad you have them, and they fit great. I'm typing with them on right now."
5.0,For my daughter. She loved the material and length as she is 6 feet tall and slender. Hit her knees without being tight.
5.0,I was worried that this dress would be scratchy. It is not. The dress is beautiful and soft to touch.
5.0,Love ‚Äòem!! I‚Äôd say pretty true to size.  A tad long on me (I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2) but these will be easy to hem. Thumbs up! Glad I bought.
5.0,"Really pretty! I am a big fan of bracelets, and this one is very simple and sweet. The beads have some great marbling and it was a great buy."

5.0,Feel good!  Does the job!!!
5.0,I am 5'8 typically wear a size large shirt and this fits perfectly.  I'm 165 and wear a 38 ddd.. I was worried that the dress would not be long enough and it hits the floor and covers my feet.  I definitely recommend this as a buy!!!

5.0,"Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve worn the ring that is the rings together EVERY day for over a year. This thing has been to the pool, fishing, camping, rain, shine‚Ä¶ and it has never turned my finger green. I‚Äôve had Kendra Scott jewelry in this time that I wrote less and turned me green. Never this. 1000/10, GET THIS"
5.0,These socks supported my spranged ankle! Sorry I had to hurt myself to find them! The compression support is wonderful and feels really good! They hold their support after washing too.  I'm active and glad to support both feet...
5.0,Cute dress! Will need ironed
5.0,My boyfriend said I looked like the sexiest woman on Earth when he saw me in this dress. That is definitely a win.<br />I generally wear a size 4 pant (27 waist) and a small or medium shirt (32DDD). I am broad shouldered but the small still fit perfectly; sleeves are a little long but still look great. The length was to the center of my knees (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù). A medium would definitely have been too big.
5.0,Well made. Classy. Glad I bought it.
5.0,Very nice quality for the price.  Fit for both the workplace setting as well as evenings out.
5.0,Love this dress. I love the color and the fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,The fit is spot on for me. I am 5‚Äô10 and weigh 150lbs and ordered a medium. If you have a lot of booty then I‚Äôd size up but it fit my non juicy self just fine.
5.0,Great fit and very soft! Initially bought one and ordered two more. I‚Äôm a 4‚Äô11‚Äù petite frame.  Thank you!
5.0,"It's not white like in the picture, but it is titanium and mire metal looking. It's like the picture and also it came with a bracelet that says the member's names, fanclub name, and the group name. I did not expect the bracelet but found it very nice to come with. The necklace is simple and perfect for any blackjack out there! ^_^"
5.0,"Of course, anything looks cute on my little munchkin.‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,Nice shirt. Comfortable and I've already got compliments on the emblem.
5.0,The detail in this charm is beautiful!  I loved giving this to my friend for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it!<br />I highly recommend this Charm to anyone special in your life! Even yourself!
5.0,Shorter than I expected but I actually wore this as the top of my wedding dress with a full skirt so the length wasn't an issue.  Really nice fabric and full coverage.  Comfortable and if it wasn't my wedding I could've wore it without a bra since it has the cups inserted.  Would definitely purchase again if I needed a simple top that is good quality.
5.0,"Awesome winter booties for toddlers. Perfectly sized, lightweight and seem very comfy for my child. Very easy to slip on and off. Will purchase another pair for my son."
5.0,These Shorts are very cute! Perfect fit!
5.0,"20 different designs, usually 4-6 of each, 100 total. All of them appropriate for children. It was a nice variety of different charms. Each one is about 3/4&#34;, and has the small metal ring attached, just like in the picture."
5.0,nice....comfy....pretty
5.0,Awesome Came early and it fit as i expected
5.0,Fit as expected color as expected. Good quality hoodie.
5.0,I love this top. The fabric is silky and its really long in the torso and sleeves which I love because I'm 5'11.
5.0,Perfect for showering at work.
5.0,"It‚Äôs a birthday gift for my daughter who .teaches music. I love the size of the pendant  she doesn‚Äôt wear a lot of jewelry so the smaller the better and this is perfect, as well as I love the chain length and how delicate it is."
5.0,Came as expected.  So far it seems you get your money's worth
5.0,"We were hesitant when ordering this beanie but, we were so pleased with it. Very well made and comfortable. Quick connect to Bluetooth, clear sound and a lasting charge!! Great value for a quality product!"
5.0,Very cute and affordable....
5.0,Very nice and I hope my dad likes it.
5.0,"All three are well made, well packed; I used red one to tight up my long sweater which doesn‚Äôt have any buttons, it holds the sweater very stable, very happy I don‚Äôt have to pin any more"
5.0,Color is great red
5.0,"Every septum clicker I've bought has given me one of two issues:<br />1. The section of ring that goes through the nose is too short, so it's very uncomfortable once ""clicked"".<br />2. Most clickers are a circular shape, which causes the stone/accessory to hang too low so it touches my upper lip.<br /><br />This little clicker is PERFECT! The oval shape of the ring makes the section that goes through the nose a bit longer, so it's comfortable once ""clicked"". And the stone sits much higher and away from my lips!<br /><br />I ordered a 16g(1.2mm) w/6mm diameter."
5.0,My daughter loved it...but she is tall and thin.
5.0,Good quality and fair price!
5.0,This seems super durable and a nice size for international travel.
5.0,My girlfriend loves her gift
5.0,I loved it!! The shorts don‚Äôt ride up and are def squat proof
5.0,"I love the dress!  The stitching on the sleeves is a bit itchy against the skin but I think that after a good first wash, it will soften it right out."
5.0,Beautiful earrings!! Greater than I expected! The shine and cut is remarkable!
5.0,Nicely made with neat stitching and excellent fit to the Nook HD. Openings for the buttons and ports are all in the right places and the auto sleep/wake functions as it should. Can't beat it for the price. I'm very happy with it.
5.0,"I love these earrings! They are so unique, and they are definitely attention grabbers of the room. They are great quality, not too heavy, but not cheapy light either. I also love all the different colors they have available (originals & flashers). I am IN LOVE with this product. :]"
5.0,fits as expected - body hugging tank top
5.0,If the design is what you like you‚Äôll be satisfied with this pin.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7e45b7af73926409e9a5e83ce44d0c89]] I totally love my boots, they fit perfectlyüëåüèª Was able to walk/dance at this event, we‚Äôre I wanted to match my outfit. Turquoise/gold. If I participate again next year I will order same boots different color."
5.0,Got this in and it fits perfect!  Great color and feels great looks as if I got it from a boutique!
5.0,They are solid and polarized! Get them
5.0,"Nice set and good quality for the price.  The clasps for the necklace and bracelet are very tiny and hard for my husband to manage but once on, looks great."
5.0,"perfect, fits great my favorite new suit"
5.0,"My bff goes by Kitten, she's a vocalist, and I bought 6,  not looking at the dimensions. They arrived and were 3 times as big as I thought. The bracelet I was making became a FLAWLESS chain belt and it ROCKED! I wish I would have bought 4 more for my nieces!"
5.0,these necklaces are just the right length for me.  Always get lots of compliments on them.  Look nice with any little bead that you put with them.
5.0,"beautiful, happy with it."
5.0,"My husband ordered this item for himself and says he's pleased with it, it's worth the price and it arrived quick enough. Although, we don't understand how to rate the ""warmth"" option in the review options"
5.0,"I am 5'4"", 120 lbs. I got the Navy Blue and Polka Dot in medium and it fits the way I wanted it to. Super billowy and breezy. No sheer issues that I know of as I got the dark blue, but the fabric is a lovely, lovely, smooth fabric with a beautiful weight to it. The dress moves so beautifully. The spaghetti straps are adjustable slide straps so if the neckline is too low for you, you can definitely adjust it.<br />I love, love, love this dress. Also...ready for this?..... IT HAS POCKETS!!! Thank you very much."
5.0,"They are a little smaller than I though they would be, but the size is actually perfect. They are colored on both sides which is nice because earrings like to flip around all day and there's no need to make sure they're ""facing front"". These are definitely my new favorite earrings!!"
5.0,"Just what I needed, this mask is perfect. It's 100% breathable, like if there's no mask at all, and  doesn't have any smell from material either. It looks good and it's hard to tell that it's completely sheer. Perfect, for me, I had not worn a mask for whole 2 years and I can not breathe in the,  neither want to harm my already bad respiratory health by wearing one - this mask should pacify any crazies that want to force them if I happen to end up in such place, hope I won't need it. I would not try this for boarding an airplane as they'll figure it out it's sheer, but good for everything else. I even ordered a 2nd one, in different color."
5.0,"I received my waist trainer quickly!  It fit perfectly and I wore it a few hours the first time I put it on, it was the first waist trainer I have ever worn.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  My waist size is a 42, I ordered a 4XL & it fits comfortably.  I give this product an All-star review!!!  ~Lynn"
5.0,Looks great but the shoe fits kind of tight.
5.0,My 8 year old grandson love's these boxers. What I dislike is that there are only 3 pair to a package. Really wish there were at least 6 pairs to a package. One for every day of the week that would give me time to get some washed. Just a suggestion.
5.0,"This is the best baiting suit!! I absolutely love the way the chest fits and it looks great on! Make sure you read the sizing chart, I am typically a Large in shirts and I got the XL in this and it fit perfect. I read some people on here said they didn't like the bottoms but I love the bottoms! The fit perfect and are super cute. I would get this if you are looking for a tankini that still makes you feel cute and sassy!!"
5.0,Feel of the fleece and washes well
5.0,Great rash guard. Good quality and very durable. Breathable too. It stays in place and doesn‚Äôt ride up or down.
5.0,Love this hat wear it all summer long.
5.0,Perfect size an compartments
5.0,My first concern was would this bracelet be big enough for my wrist. I have seen and bought several bracelets that are very pretty but did not fit but this one is different. I have a big wrist and this bracelet is not tight at all and I have the option to make it tighter. I LOVE it and I am going to buy a few more.
5.0,These are awesome and made great teacher gifts!
5.0,I am a BBW & sometimes it's hard to finding a beautiful and not old fashion dress..
5.0,"I am so happy I bought this dress. I put it on and my daughter said it makes my body look like an hourglass! It is very comfortable while also fitting in all of the right areas. I‚Äôm normally a size medium but Amazon suggested a large, which fits perfectly. Also, this is a very pretty blue. I will be buying more in other colors!"
5.0,So happy with my purchase! I am 5'10&#34; and a size 16. I ordered a 2xl and it fits perfectly. Too short to wear as a dress. Famric is soft and the colors are rich.
5.0,My nephew love them
5.0,I love these. They are comfortable and they do the job which fir me is protecting my thin skinned arms. I opted for these and a short sleeved shirt rather than a long sleeve rash guard. I‚Äôm glad I did.
5.0,I LOVE THIS PURSE! Well made. Beautiful color. I got the red. Now I need more colors!!!!
5.0,Was very good material and long enough
5.0,I've reordered this purse for the 3rd time.. Have used it exclusively for 4 yrs now... Great purse!!!
5.0,Used on Disney Cruise. They fit well and allowed me to let folks know I'm smiling.
5.0,"Nice size,  very feminine."
5.0,I can‚Äôt be any happier with this purchase. It‚Äôs not to heavy or bulky. I love the thin straps a d how it has small legs to stand on. Material looks expensive and the inside is so beautiful with cream colored leather.<br />I‚Äôm happy to find a bag you don‚Äôt have to spend a fortune on and still be able to look expensive.
5.0,Kiddo loves it. It is comfortable and fits perfectly.

5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, but I had to go down 2 sizes. I normally wear a large. I had to order a small to get the correct fit. Its very loose and comfy as well as chic and trendy. I bought 5 different colors. And It has POCKETS! Ladies, yall know how we feel about pockets lol."
5.0,Item was as described and case is exactly what I was looking to protect my glasses. Thank you.
5.0,I got lots of compliments on this necklace very soft pastel colors very feminine
5.0,This dress is awesome. I ordered it for my sisters wedding and it fit perfect and looked really great. I got all sorts of compliments on this dress.

5.0,Very well sewn
5.0,Perfect in size and it‚Äôs what my son wanted
5.0,Beautiful as im the photo thick material i love it
5.0,I like that this is the same pant l bought at Costco 2years ago.  They still fit me just right. 5‚Äô3‚Äù‚Äî115 poundsüòä
5.0,Awesome gym bag for my shoes and other things I bring.  I love it.  Reminds me of work from one of my favorite artists - Vincent van Gogh.  Thanks!
5.0,"Pins are very nice. When reading description, I was concerned that they might be too small. They are just right for lapels, vest, or chest.<br />We are a small social club of women. These pins discreetly represents our unity and style without being overbearing or drawing too much attention."
5.0,Buen material. Tama√±o justo.
5.0,You should go with this company.  They ask for measurements and the costume is made to perfection.  The dress and cape are totally lined.  Excellent job!
5.0,You‚Äôll look goofy as all get out but keeps the sun off your face.
5.0,"My daughter was so proud to wear this to practice!! She said it makes her a better gymnast ! It is a little short, not by much though I would probably recommend ordering 1 size up."

5.0,What a great price on these fabulous underwear.
5.0,It‚Äôs beautiful! Hope my friend likes it too!
5.0,"Just like if I were to buy it in store. Authentic FXR, good quality. I got the black and yellow one. I'd upload a photo but my boyfriend is out of state snowmobiling and took it with him. I'd buy again and again. In fact I think I may have ordered a different FXR hat from this seller before and I'm completely satisfied with that one too."

5.0,Sexy and nice push up.  Cute material for the price
5.0,"Everyone in our family has one of these, and I have given them as graduation gifts this year.  Very handy for keeping cords, chargers, pens, misc. items organized."

5.0,These pants fit like a glove and they aren't see through at all!
5.0,Great goggles at a great value!
5.0,"The sizes confused me, but since a friend had a pair, she advised me to get m/ l since I normally wear women's 7.5 or 8. Fits great! So spongy soft, supportive especially arch area. I wear many orthaheel sandals for the arch support(heel pain), and these work very well & for a lot less $. Highly recommend these."
5.0,"Belt is gorgeous!  While it is not something to be worn constantly, it will add a lot of sparkle to plain dresses!<br />  There are no belt holes, so it easily fits to size, but will probably wear out if worn a lot."
5.0,These work very well and can be a good option if you are pregnant and aren't quite ready to transition to maternity pants yet.
5.0,Good quality and the design and color is exactly as advertised. I‚Äôm very happy with it!
5.0,"I already owned this watch but the movement in it had stopped working. So I needed to replace it. I searched for it on Amazon to see if they had it as Swatch did not have it anymore. I, of course, found it and ordered it. It's just like the original. I would never know it was a different watch. I love it because I love the denim band which goes perfectly with my denim shirt. So happy with my purchase."
5.0,Love the color and it fits perfect.  The fit bit looks new again. And the price was great. Thanks!!
5.0,"I love the way Ralph Lauren clothes fit!  This is a beautiful, flattering halter swim top.  I always buy bigger swim wear than my real size.  I am a size 6, and I bought a size 8, and the fit is good."

THEY ARE TRULY VERSATILE.....BUY THEM, YES,<br />BUY THESE.NO WAIT ; THEY ARRIVED ON TIME. I,LL BE BUYING THEM AGAIN FOR SURE.  CL"
5.0,The material is soft and the dress fit as expected. I've washed it once or twice on delicate (hang dry) and it is holding up nicely. Would buy again.
5.0,"My husband and I are going to be going on a vacation where we have a few formal events and I have not had formal attire in years so I was looking for some reasonably priced items that would fit the bill.  I was offered the opportunity to review this dress for a reduced price for an honest opinion and jumped at the opportunity as I was already looking for a product  like this.  This dress is beautiful.  I love that the broach accent is removable or can be moved up or down the bodice for a slightly different look.  I typically wear a size 10 and have a bra size of 36C and I ordered the large which fit perfectly.  I determined the size based upon their sizing chart which I would thus say is accurate.  The chiffon material is light and airy and has a light underlining.  It is comfortable to wear.  I am 5,5&#34; and the dress by nature of being a &#34;party&#34; dress is longer but is perfect with my 2 1/2&#34; heals and would be fine with higher heals as well.  (I however would end up on crutches if I tried to wear something higher).  I really liked the fact that the dress was shorter in the front and longer in the back.  II am excited to break this out on my cruise and show it off!"
5.0,"Our daughter loves these, quality badges, metal and enamel. She pins them to her jackets and sweatshirts."
5.0,Great gloves...I had a pair that lasted me 6 years and finally the fur was going on it. These have really soft fur and a nice interior for warmth.
5.0,"Best thing I ever brought,  use it every,  im gonna buy another"
5.0,Bought for my daughter.  She loves it
5.0,nothing bad to say about them!
5.0,The fit is spot on and the padding helps on longer rides.
5.0,"These are mighty comfortable.  I love that they don't ride up too high, and the texture, fit and feel are excellent, as long as you remember to order up a size.  I'd generally prefer NO white, as it tends to get dingy, but I think the synthetic material will probably remain pretty sharp looking.  Not so sure I love having weekdays on my waistband, but it doesn't really detract."
5.0,I need this SCREENSHOTBRAND Men's Premium Denim Jacket - Skinny Fit Spandex Flower Emb....
5.0,I loved. It
5.0,Really nice and warm. My son bought it for a &#34;friend&#34; and she loved it. Directly indicated how warm his heart is for her...
5.0,"Perfect for my mother.  Delivered quickly, medium was a good fit."
5.0,Recomendado.
5.0,This is just what i needed for running errands! I really like the size as well as the amount of pockets it has & it's a more practical alternative to your typical men's sling or crossbody bag.
5.0,nice quality for cheap price. love it
5.0,"This is a lovely dress, may have lost a little weight because it feels a bit roomy but otherwise I love it."
5.0,"Very well made. Fits great, it's adjustable so you can adjust. Shipped fast!"
5.0,"If I did not know this watch band was not made by Apple, I do not think I would be able to tell. A caveat that I should mention is that I do not own the original and the only interaction I have had with it is in the Apple store itself. The magnet is very strong and even when I shook my arm vigorously it did not loosen or fall off. I have not had the band long, but even after wearing it for an extended period of time, it was still comfortable. Putting the watch on can be a bit difficult, but after a few attempts, it gets easier. I do love the fact that this band allows for endless adjustments down to the millimeter due to the magnetic closure. This Milanese Loop watch strap is also stainless steel, so there is some weight to it which I am quite keen on, but I will say that it is not overwhelming and much lighter than a traditional stainless steel watch band. I read somewhere that the Apple Watch OEM Milanese Loop is made from aluminum - whether or not that is true, I am not 100 percent sure.<br /><br />Both the original Apple Milanese band and this band share a feature that I really like: the little cutout on the side of the magnetic closure. This little cutout makes it much easier to pull up and adjust the magnetic clasp. A small but great detail that I think is a nice touch.<br /><br />The box/ packaging that it comes in is a very basic cardboard box and has a felted foam interior. Nothing too special and definitely not as snazzy as the box and packaging that comes with the real Milanese Loop sold by apple. However, the price of this band is not even close to what Apple charges. Apple charges $149 for the silver, and $199 for the space black, for both the 38 mm and 42 mm models.<br /><br />As for quality of the strap, we will just have to wait and see how this plays out in the long run. If I have any more thoughts in the future, I will come back to update the review. I did notice that after taking the band on and off to change it out for another band, the middle piece on the band connector that clicks in was already starting to show signs of wear, but it still works flawlessly. And again to mention the price, even if it broke I could still buy 10 for the price of one Milanese Loop at the Apple store. Overall I would definitely recommend it, both for value and quality. But for full disclosure, I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review."
5.0,Love these earrings! Pretty and simple. Several choices of color to go with just about anything.
5.0,This looks great!<br />I was wondering if I could get extra clear straps sent to me!
5.0,"I do not let my little boy watch the series but he is still obsessed with everything Cobra Kai. He proudly wore the shirt to school the day after we received it. Fit perfectly, true to size."
5.0,Great accessory to what I needed it for. Perfect size and fast shipping. Buy!!
5.0,Purchase for my grandmother as a gift and she loves it
5.0,"My only issue is the eyelet where it comes together was a bit small, so it took some time trying to get it closed, otherwise the fabric is a great weight! I live in upper Michigan and it‚Äôs freezing on Halloween, this will keep me nice and warm while we bring the kids out! Thank you!"
5.0,cool wallet - husband loves it. Fits just enough stuff and doesn't provide him the opportunity to have a George Costanza wallet. No rubber smell as others have described. This is well made and the edges will not wear out like on other vegan wallets.
5.0,"I was expecting the loin cloth to be more opaque,  but no complaints."
5.0,"These masks are perfect for the cold weather coming our way soon! Very comfortable, very well-made, and very good looking."
5.0,"Cozy, neutral, really cute(has teddy ears), keeps baby warm"
5.0,"Gorgeous dress, really love it"
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter. Loved the material with it's beautiful pattern, cute design. With the gathers, thought it could be a cute maternity outfit, beach cover up. She seemed to like it."
5.0,My granddaughter is is 6 I bought size 6/7. Its perfect not too big but some room to grow
5.0,This is my second pair because I love my Von Zipper glasses but also wanted polarized lenses. Easily pop in a work great.
5.0,"Great shopping tote. It‚Äôs very sturdy and roomy, and I love the pockets on the outside. It‚Äôs great as a reusable bag, but cute enough to carry as a tote!"
5.0,"Favorite mask, very comfortable"
5.0,The person I gifted this to was very happy. She thought it was very sweet
5.0,Absolutely love this wallet! I have a lot of cards and this wallet holds up well. The additional coin pocket is a plus as well
5.0,Wow. These are way nicer than I expected. Soft and easy to carry. Great value. Highly recommended by me.
5.0,This product is very nice but runs really small xl is so small still cannot fit not true to size
5.0,This is NOT a one size fits all American sized woman!! After a$25 alteration it fit and looked great!
5.0,Great value for the money.  Very comfortable and fits the Charge 2 perfectly.
5.0,These are so comfy!  Fit perfectly.  I could live in them!<br />This product was received in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,Perfect for what I bought it for.
5.0,"Lovely eagle, bought for a young man. I really like it."
5.0,Used one for a Halloween costume! The rest are for play. Great buy
5.0,"Great product, got here on time..."
5.0,"If you're looking for the perfect little black dress you've found it here! I love it because it's super versatile. You can wear it alone, throw on a belt or button up sweater, or even add a petticoat underneath for that true 50s look.<br />I have DDD breasts and although I did get it on it was a little tight up top. If you have anything smaller you should have no issues at all.<br />For photo reference I'm 5'11 abs wear a size 16. I ordered an XXL. It fits well but I think I would recommend more for someone that's around a 12/14. The material is super light so if you live somewhere hot and humid like I do this is a lifesaver. It's hard to be hot and look hot at the same time, lol. The length is great. Not too long and not showing too much. Overall I'm very pleased and can't wait to wear it out for a night in the town!<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"SO COOL!! I completely love this ring! It bends a bit and shapes to your hand for a nice fit. It‚Äôs unique and beautiful but not too over-the-top. Only downside is that it seems pretty fragile, but I‚Äôm hoping that it will last a long time if I‚Äôm careful!"
5.0,it came in as expected and it's a good product. Something I would definitely buy again
5.0,Super light weight like a nylon bl bag but it fits everything!
5.0,"i  ordered a couple different masks a upcoming Mascarade Ball for my friends and I, this was the most affordable of them-and the one I ""had to have"" my face is petite, I have problems finding glasses/sunglasses tha are not kids to fit my face. no huge gap on the side of my face.<br /><br />This one was perfect!!! No damage to te feathers or gems like someone else mentioned. I would recomend this product for use small framed gals."
5.0,Great shaver!  I was amazed at how well it cut the hairs with only a few passovers in each area.
5.0,I found the holy grail of headbands!  These are great!  They stay on my head. Super cute designs and well made.  A little pricey but worth it!
5.0,"Pretty, light shirt"
5.0,Beautiful shirt.  Soft and fits perfectly. Love it
5.0,These look great and I get compliments.
5.0,Very pleased with this shirt!! Great quality and a good price. I wear it a lot it washes very good too. So soft.
5.0,eye catching. good quality. as described.
5.0,This hot was perfect for All occasions in the month of October I wore it multiple times it's super comfortable to wear and fun to interact with.
5.0,Great product. Would order from seller again.
5.0,"I loved this hat - it was very very soft. The slouch is as shown, but just note that if you don't have a smaller sized head, then it won't slouch as shown in photo. My head is pretty small, and the slouch is just about as shown, maybe slightly less. The hat in the photo also looks as if it has a looser fit, but this hat seems to be a closer fit. Very soft, nice looking hat."
5.0,I love this purse. No complaints. I use it everyday. This is my second one. The last one lasted a really long time. Very sturdy zippers. I use the pocket in the back for my cellphone.<br />Only reason I had to buy another one is that the color started coming off the edges.
5.0,Great looking pair of tights for Halloween
5.0,I love these leggings! They are super flattering and fit as expected! I was debating between a medium or large pair but went with the medium. I am 5‚Äô6 and 158lbs with a booty for reference. They are super stretchy and do NOT fall down! They are also squat proof!! I have worn them to lift but not for cardio yet.
5.0,"Great, holds well and is of good quality. Would recommend."
5.0,Its exactly as pictured snd a 6 dollar ring it is for Halloween and I have been waring it has Not turned my finger green. Its a 6 dollar ring if you want great then buy a more expensive ring.
5.0,"Love love love, this dress."
5.0,Great find and love it. Good quality and size.
5.0,"New favorite glasses!!  Love the shape!!  I have a heart shaped face, so the frames really fit my face nicely.  The black/turtle color goes with everything."
5.0,I like the actual glass/lens. The slight tint is a bonus. I have other blue blockers and these are cool.
5.0,My Sister loved this!
5.0,"Earrings looked better than I expected.  The price was inexpensive, so I figured they would look cheap ... They look as good as earring 20 times their cost."
5.0,This is an excellent replacement for worn out parts of your airbrush.
5.0,"They look great! Seem like great quality! My son will be the first to use them. He‚Äôs going to camp this weekend and using a trunk, we will see how they hold up. üòâ"
5.0,I received these on time and they were just what I expected.  Good price.  Great fit.  I would buy these again and recommend to others.
5.0,"Ordered an XLarge and it fit really well, very glamerous and classic shape. Fabric is soft and comfortable, with a full skirt."
5.0,I absolutely love these compression socks. They keep my calves and feet from becoming sore after a 12 hour shift. They do not fall or roll down as some socks do. I purchased the 15-25 and have thick thighs and they fit great.  I will definitely buy more in the future.
5.0,These are super cute and not cheaply made my kids teachers loved them.
5.0,I love ear jackets. I think they're so unique and look super cute on.<br /><br />These are a rose gold color which I love. It's like a pretty good pink. I'm not a fan of just golf color jewelry.<br /><br />These come in a cute little gift box. Inside they're in a small drawstring pouch so you can also gift them that way if you don't want/like the gift box.<br /><br />I feel like they can be worn two different ways. With and without the jacket. It would look cute as a simple stud earring.<br /><br />You get one backing. I know some offer metal and rubber backings but these only come with the metal backings.<br /><br />Easy to put on and take off. I know some people might find them weird or might not like how to put them on because it's different than your typical earring but they look so cool on!<br /><br />They look expensive not cheap. Normally I discourage buying jewelry from places like Icing and Claire's because although they're super cute they're super poorly made and turn skin green.  These don't! I wouldn't wear them to a pool or in the shower but they don't or at least haven't turned my skin any color.<br /><br />I love them. They're cute and fun.<br /><br />Sample provided for my evaluation and honest review.
5.0,I'm obsessed! They are so beautiful. I love lily and Laura braclets but at $12 a piece they can be so expensive but they are simply beautiful and can go with so many outfits and people always ask me where I get the ones I wear at however This year for Christmas a lot of girls in my family made hints to my Lily and Laura bracket collection and well I couldn't afford to buy them all name brand so I went on a limb for the off brand here and just let me show you how silimar the two are! It's undeniable the sameness about the braclets.<br />All the colors I got I absolutely love and was thinking about the things I could wear with them. I did decide to keep a few for myself lol guilty but there's perfect colors in here for each the girls I'm giving them too. I don't mean to sound cheap or all for the knock off stuff but they will honestly never tell the difference and it looks like you spent $25 plus on them. I did get them other gifts but this is just the one other thing I really wanted to give out. I wish there's was 10 stars to give! I will be reordering a set for just myself.<br /><br />They are all individually wrapped which I really liked.<br />In the second photo you can see I am wearing a pink on and a black one can you even tell which is the Lilly and Laura? I tested my fianc√© who has bought the real braclets for me and he had no clue üôèüèª<br />The third photo is a reversible one you can roll it on pink or roll it on white or wear it mixed like I am.<br />The last 3 photos are of what I believe are the &#34;sets&#34; they sent me with matching blues and pinks and 3 random colored ones. I love the black and gold due to how professional it looks so I can wear it to work everyday!<br /><br />Okay enough reviewing but this is a must if your on a budget and want something stil of great quality and quantity
5.0,Looks as pictured. I will consider ordering another color.
5.0,Strands fall out!  Good length.
5.0,My sister in law loves this! Exactly as described
5.0,Love the bright colors and will be using them for either masks or hair coverings.
5.0,"I have to say these are the best underwear I have ever worn. No more compressed junk, no more adjusting. Feels lik e your not wearing anytjing, but better because they give support. I bought one pair at first now u have 5 and am going to get 2 more because these are the only underwear I want to wear the only problem is the price, but I will pay for this level of comfort."
5.0,Very soft...Very stretchy. Heavy weight. Not t-shirt material. Love it!
5.0,"Theres enough space to fit an iPhone, money and credit cards. So far there hasn't been a thing I didn't like about it. The quotes don't make any sense but thats whatever. Everything came intact, nothing has broken off. & I love the color...I'm glad with my purchase &#60;3"
5.0,Beautiful is the word. The material quality is great. The feel is complimentary to my husband‚Äôs body. The shirt looks exactly like on the amazon picture. This is going to be worn when we go to the islands as well.
5.0,A beautiful breath of springtime to carry you through the winter.<br /><br />Got it for someone who lives in the subzero north. They love it.<br /><br />I am going to get one for myself as it is so pretty.<br /><br />I love how it has real flowers frozen in time in a jewel-like crystal.<br /><br />The artwork in it is well done too.
5.0,"These fit my 3.5 year old (size of a 4 year old) perfectly. They are adjustable, comfortable for him, and he can take it off and put it on himself. They wash fine in the washer and can be put in the dryer too. We've purchased 2 sets of these to have extra and to keep in the car, each backpack, etc. I highly recommend these, and the pattern is cute."
5.0,The silicone all around the edge helps it to keep it on your foot
5.0,Love these. So comfortable and versatile. You can wear them with almost anything and go from day to night.
5.0,these are the perfect work socks at an affordable price
5.0,2nd pair! I love these jeans!
5.0,"I've worn these boots out in the slushy snow and winter salt for about 6 weeks, and I'm AMAZED!!! These keep my feet extremely warm and dry and I can't believe how comfortable they are too.  They look cute with leggings and skinny jeans too.  I think I will buy another pair for next winter just in case I can't find them again in 8 months, that's how much I love them!  I always wear a size 6 and these were true to size.  I didn't even have to break them in.  They're a perfect fit even if I decide to wear thicker or thinner socks, as long as I just lace them up accordingly.  (My feet stay so warm in these though, that thicker socks are not even needed.)"
5.0,Perfect description and size was spot on.
5.0,Great quality for the price! Just buy them!
5.0,"The dress fits perfectly and is very comfortable!  I bought it wear to a wedding and need the length to be below the knee.  Because I'm only 5'1', the length is a few inches below the knee.  The only think missing is that it would be nice if the dress had pockets on the side."
5.0,this was a purchase for a friend who is on her feet all day at work & she said they are wonderful!
5.0,Working in non-air conditioned buildings with 70 degree dewpoints.  This dress arrived and the colors are as bright and fun as presented.  Fabric is soft to the touch and it was very comfortable to wear and still have a little professionalism.
5.0,"The gloves are absolutely beautiful. So soft, so warm. They are simple but elegant and can be worn with just about anything. I may be ordering another color soon."
5.0,"Very nice basic Merino wool cardigan, perfect for layering even under another sweater. I'm very happy with the style, fit and price. I got one in gray as well as black. Happy camper!"
5.0,perfect classy purse.....recommend highly
5.0,"Cute, comfy & fits well. I was hoping the shirt would be longer. I will order a large next time."
5.0,Purchase in a smaller size than one normally wears.  Great blouse though.
5.0,A little big but works
5.0,I was told it fit perfectly and she liked it very much.
5.0,I love these earings! There perfect for a night out and super light to wear. I'm obsessed!
5.0,"This watch is awesome, especially at this price! Everyone noticed the first day I wore it to work. It looks very sleek, and is very simple and easy to use. I might buy another in a different color."
5.0,I wish it had two pockets. Material is a little thin but it works
5.0,Smaller than expected but very nice
5.0,Looks and works good. Very happy with it.
5.0,"Nice shirt and print but be sure to go a size up if you plan on drying it. I got to wear it once, then my wife scored a nice shirt after first wash!"
5.0,"Love them. I purchased a large pair for my mom for Christmas and she loved the fit, the material and the price was very good compared to gloves in department stores.  The quality was very good too.  I definitely recommend them."
5.0,"Looks great. Nice, inexpensive bling for an 11 year old who doesn‚Äôt know how to take care of jewelry yet."
5.0,"I received the shirt today that was a fast delivery. Tried it on. It fits great, feels great. Looks great the stickers are are awesome, just need to figure out what to do with them. All around a great product and I will do business with these guys again."
5.0,"These boots are very well made.  The neoprene is all the way down to the sole and covers the foot.  I expect that these will keep my son's feet warm and dry.  Best of all, they were half the price of the Bogs brand."
5.0,"I love that it was the perfect lengthy, smooth, cool and comfortable and I love that it has pockets!"
5.0,"He loves it! True to the size, really cool! I highly suggest that make some for adults, PLEASE!!!"
5.0,"VERY nice quality.  This scarf is most definitely warm.  In these cold Idaho Winters, this scarf performs perfectly.  So worth the money."
5.0,Bought this for my son's girlfriend and she loves it.
5.0,"I bought this dress from Amazon in a ""Small"" size.  It took only a week for it to arrive from the time I placed the order (with normal shipping).  I tried it on as soon as it arrived in the mail.  It fit perfectly!  Like I said, I bought it in size 'small.'  I am 5'1"" tall and I normally wear size 2-3-4 petite clothes.  With a 4 inch high heeled shoes, the train doesn't drag on the floor.  The top (corsett) is totally adjustable.  The skirt has an elasticized wide waist band.  The collar actually does stay up. When put together, it is absolutely elegant and sexy!!! Amazon should have shown a picture of how this looks from behind.  Now I just need to buy a pair of red satin gloves to go with it.  I'm so looking forward to wearing this to a Halloween party!"
5.0,"I love, love, love this dress so much that I came back to buy more patterns.  It is by far my favorite dress ever.  It is so lovely and feminine, and it swirls around you in a magical way.  You‚Äôll feel like a princess but it is not too dressy or poofy!  It‚Äôs simply perfect.  I will add, however, that I tried the one with the purple top and multi-colored skirt and had a different experience.  The purple top was made of a different material and was too big and baggy.  So stick to the styles that are one pattern all over the whole dress, and you‚Äôll love it. :)"
5.0,"I love these boots, very comfortable and there are real leather and soft..."
5.0,The recipient of this gift absolutely loves the fit and feel of this hoodie.
5.0,"Finally a pair of gloves that keep my hands warm in all weather!<br />I have had these gloves for 2 years now.<br />They are to hot to wear above 25 degrees.  I have always had cold hand when I driving the quad in the winter. Not anymore!  I was out plowing for over hour in 15 degrees plus wind chill and my hands stayed cozy warm the whole time.  They consistently keep my hands warm for long periods of time in the cold. They are bulky so I can't do fine motor work with them on ( like buckles on horse blankets) I had to have them off in 5 degrees while I put a hood on my horse, my hands got so cold I had to put them gloves back on before I was done. Unlike other gloves that stay cold when you put cold hands in them , I instantly felt warmth when I put my OZEROs back on. My hands were warm again in no time.<br />I wish they were a work glove hybrid, I use them for barn work and that has worn the ""grip stuff"" off but hey, got to keep warm.<br /> If you need your hands to stay warm in temps 25 and under, then get yourself a pair of OZEROs.<br />The coldest I have warm them in is -10 plus wind chill. No signs of them reaching their limit. Great gloves!"
5.0,This was  a gift for my Great grandson. so tiny loved them and they were a hit at the baby shower
5.0,Perfect for when you want something that looks real but you don‚Äôt have to worry about losing your expensive wedding band
5.0,Cuter in person!! My daughter and I love them!
5.0,My daughter loves them nonetheless
5.0,"The leg warmers seems to be a good quality but the true will be after washing it, so far I like and I am satisfied with the product."
5.0,"Wearing it now.  I love it. Love the print, the size fits me perfectly"
5.0,"Great size! I needed them for my candles, so I took off the loop part, but they worked out great!"
5.0,Got these for my husband and he wants more lol!! they are great quality and very authentic.
5.0,"Ordered my usual size, fit was good. Arrived on time and in good condition. Thank you!"
5.0,"I needed a cool patch to cover a hole in my $80 Under Armour golf pants. Some idiot burned them, long story.. ANYWAYS... All I had to do was iron it on. That's it! BUT, I'm kind of a perfectionist, so i bought an iron on patch from wal-mart and basically fused the two patches together by putting the store bought patch on the inside and the Imperial patch on the outside. Keep in mind I was covering a hole, so this won't be necessary otherwise. There is patch glue you can buy that might strengthen the bond when you are applying, but I doubt you truly need it. I'm very thankful there are companies like this providing awesome designs at such a high level of quality."
5.0,"This scarf is very big which is perfect, and very soft. Feels comfortable around the neck and isn't too bulky if you're going for a thinner look. It's great for the cold weather. The color is vibrant and clean."
5.0,"Normally wear a large, but these sweatshirts are cut very generously and show minimal shrinkage after washing and medium temp drying.<br />Bought size medium and it fits just right, not too tight.  They are quality sweatshirts."
5.0,I like this beret. It is lightweight and I was afraid I'd lose it in the terrible wind storm we had on the first day I wore it. The color is nice and so is the price. I'll probably be buying different colors of the same style.
5.0,Super cute! Looks great with leggings. Nice material.
5.0,Looks beautiful- nicer than the picture. My mom loved it.
5.0,Beautifully made and exactly what I was looking for!

5.0,"These are really nice sunglasses for kids, came packaged in bags and wrapping in a box. Would buy again."
5.0,"This dress is adorable. I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it. The fabric wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting, but it‚Äôs soft and stretchy. I would order a size up, though, since it does run small. I normally wear a small or x-small, but I got this in a medium which fits perfectly."
5.0,Very pleased ....sparkly n bold as expected.
5.0,I love this watch band. My skin is supper sensitive and I have not had any problems with it.
5.0,Easy to read and stays put.  Doesn't roll around the wrist.

5.0,They are very sweet and better than I imagined.
5.0,Great hat! Can't wait to wear it for Halloween next week!
5.0,"Purchased these shirts to start back to school. They are long & cover the back rear end nicely. Fit true to size, & wash well"
5.0,"very comfortable scrubs. Have not faded after a year of use, washing weekly, better than some of the other leading brands I purchased at the same time. Also, have not pilled at all. The sizing is standard, so you can purchase with confidence. (I have found only the walmart scrubs size up larger). The fit, however, is the most flattering compared to the other leading brands I purchased at the same time."
5.0,It was perfect for my needs. We will use them to perform a dance from Indians of Chile.
5.0,"I have these, same lace and design, and I wear them often daily.  But these are huge like costume ears mor than a headband."
5.0,VERY UNIQUE! I ordered these earrings for my hubby for father's day and I am confident that he will love these. They are approximately 5 ctw each but my hubby is a big/tall guy and I am sure they will look great on him. I ordered the black ON BLACK COLR BECAUSE my hubby has very expensive taste and these earrings look like they cost  more than $200!  I like these so much I almost want to keep them for myself
5.0,Very Beautiful set. Very stunning and well made
5.0,So far item is great.  I have less foot pain

5.0,Love these and they have a nice weight to them.
5.0,Just received today.  They are beautiful.  Can hardly wait for special occasion to wear.
5.0,"Great glasses, love the storage case and pouch.  Drive with the yellow lens on at dusk, and you will think it is middle of the afternoon (I wasn't expecting that, just a nice little bonus)  Takes a little practice getting used to changing the lens, but worth it."

5.0,"Very pretty, great quality, love the vintage look"
5.0,It took a while but it was worth the wait! These little elephants are so cute and if you do not like the neck chain you can switch it out!
5.0,This product came earlier than it was supposed to which is great! I loved it so much and i got tons of compliments at school. it is a very beautiful scarf and its very thin and lightweight. You don't even have to wear it as a scarf! It's a rectangular shape but you have to form it into a scarf. There are a lot of things you could wear it as.
5.0,They were so cute! Got a ton of compliments on the smaller earrings because of how different they are
5.0,"For those who don't need to spend hundreds or thousands for a watch....$10.50, and it works."
5.0,"Very pretty.  It took a while to figure out how to fasten the strap..It came in a nice tin box, as well."
5.0,Granddaughter was extremely happy üòÉ
5.0,"Beautiful fit, thick material that is not see through. Good construction. Fabric stretched nicely"
5.0,Well constructed but hard and high arch didn't work for my feet.  Returned with no problem.

5.0,I'm a adorable middle aged single Mom when I put these DG'S all the honies heads turn a 360 degree and stare at this superstar Mom walk by looking glamorous -!!
5.0,"This watch has an amazing upscale look for its price. It is very well-made, keeps perfect time, very nice mesh band, a second hand and date, and so affordable.<br /> I would have nothing negative to say if even it cost five times more."
5.0,Very pretty get compliments when I eear
5.0,"My 1 year old does not like shoes on his feet, but after purchasing these he keeps them on all day."
5.0,by far this one piece is very flattering... i have stretchmarks and hate showing my stomach..and this bathing suite kept it classy
5.0,awesome piece very fun and looks great! its a little hard to get a good fit due to the style but with a little assistance its possible!
5.0,This is a nice fancy keychain. It came in a jewelry string bag that you can place it in to give away as a gift. It‚Äôs not thin.
5.0,Prettier than the picture
5.0,"Very classy, it is an extra slim fit suit so you might need to size up if you want classic fit or in some cases a regular slim fit, for me sticking with my size was a perfect decision. Quality is very good and especially at this price, a three piece, definitely a steal."
5.0,This vest does exactly as advertised. I have been soaked with sweat every time I use it.  I've recommended it to others and they love it as well.
5.0,Love this sports bra! I have a 38d bust and do intense workouts and this bra keeps the girls settled. It's comfortable and very stylish!
5.0,These are ao cute!
5.0,My teenage son bought these and loves them.
5.0,A little bit but my brother loved it
5.0,Good comfy legging. Fits as expected.
5.0,Soo warm and comfortable!! I bought these leggings to go with a sweater dress and they fit perfectly and are super cute!
5.0,"I purchased this wristlet because I honestly hate purses and never carry one.  I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  I wasn't sure it would fit but was hoping.  Unfortunately, it didn't fit.  My recommendation is this is a lovely wristlet.  If you have a small phone then the S6 Active, it will fit.  Its very nice a looks great."
5.0,Got these for my wife before a trip and she LOVES them. Going to get more as now my daughter loves them. I am sure that she is going to want me to get some for myself also ... :)<br />Almost forgot ... I have had some small ones from ebags for years and went there first to get larger ones but the price of this bundle simply beat-out the competition.
5.0,Awesome product! Great quality!
5.0,The product was more bigger and beautifuler than I expected. I am very happy I found this and bought it :)
5.0,Bracelet  is very cute charms are cuteness everything  I love it !!!
5.0,I love the embroidery and it fits well. The sleeves are a little long but looks like a material you can trim without fraying.
5.0,"I keep small note pads in my cars for jotting down thoughts, shopping lists and other stuff as I think of them ... but never while driving!!  These pens fit those pads perfectly."
5.0,"Loved the way it fit, felt and looked."
5.0,"This is a decent set of pinnies, though maybe a little expensive.  They seem like they are made well and are good quality.  The stitching does not feel like it will come undone too soon like some other pinnies I've seen.  I would say the sizing is accurate.  I bought size large, which is recommended for ages 11+.  In the photo, my 10-year-old is wearing it with a green shirt and my 8-year-old is wearing it with an orange shirt, so it was big on them, as expected.  I was planning to use it for U12-U15.  The included mesh bag is nice to keep the pinnies organized and controlled.<br /><br />I will note that, while these pinnies are machine washable, the care tag says to line dry.  I'm not sure what would happen if you put them in the dryer, but line drying a bunch of these for multiple soccer teams would not be fun."
5.0,Just as shown. Thick felt. Bright colors. Just what I needed for all my readers! Good price.
5.0,"When it comes to one size fits all, I usually do not fit into it. With that being said, I decided to give this a try anyway. This pullover is so comfortable. I am about 5'2 and weigh around 160. This thing is pretty large, which means if you are a smaller person, you will probably be swimming in it. The material is soft and warm, also has a lot of stretch. I will probably be buying another one to give as a gift to someone else. I am very happy with this purchase. :)"
5.0,I absolutely love these boots. So light and comfortable. Only downside would be that the bottom catches the carpet if you tend to drag your feet
5.0,The shorts were good quality. Just too tight!
5.0,Fits perfect.  Material is durable.  Color same as picture.
5.0,"Extremely pleased with the quality. Im very picky with material & generally don't like to purchase clothing online but I needed to put together a Wenda costume for the office Waldo theme. This was the best quality AND price by far. I will actually wear this sweater again as a part of a normal outfit.<br /><br />Fit was perfect, true to size. I'm 5'6, 140lbs with a medium build and ordered a large as I don't like my sweaters to fit skin tight. The color is a deep red, just as it looks in the group pic I attached, as opposed to a bright red. It makes it more suitable for regular wear. The V-neck line and sleeve-cuffs are ribbed which also appeals to the quality of the sweater. It is thick enough to not be transparent but thin enough that it's not too hot to be in. It's comfortable, not itchy, didn't fall apart or lose color when washed, and didn't shrink. One of my co-workers in the pic also ordered this same item and loved it."
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, love it"
5.0,Love these dresses  I have  many and  plan on buying  more!
5.0,These were great for my classroom and they held up in the washer too!

5.0,"Runs small bought a 10-12 for my 6 year old granddaughter.  Who usually wears a 7-8 and it fit her well. Definitely purchase a size up for a comfortable fit. Cool ,bright colors fun  for kids. Didn't fade in the wash and surprisingly didn't shrink in the dryer. Glad I got one size bigger."
5.0,pricey but easy to add/remove keys.  Sturdy and well made - I'm not worried about keys slipping off.
5.0,"I LOVE how these earrings look, they have just enough length..good quality fir a reasonable price..i would order again from this seller.."

5.0,"Just as described this is a loose sweater Very warm and comfortable. Color same as picture. I wear a small and ordered a small, it is loose and is what I like. Washed in cold on gentle cycle, lay flat to dry - great!"
5.0,These are wonderful. My husband like them so good he asked me to buy 2 more pairs. He said the clasp was really good and they felt good next to his skin.

5.0,Super cute! Very soft material and accurate sizing.
5.0,"this little fan was a tremendous help during a recent trip through Europe this summer, during the worst heatwave in 30 years.<br /><br />Walking all day and finding a cool/shady spot was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. This fan is small enough I could throw in my purse or backpack and use as needed, which was pretty much all the time. I fully charged before it's first use and it lasts about 5 hours from a single charge."
5.0,"I ordered this in 3 different colors (1) white, (1) cardinal red, (1) black heather all in a Men's size medium. All three are very soft. The only difference I noticed when I tried them on before washing, is that the black heather is larger at the waist and chest area than the white and cardinal red. I say this because the white and cardinal red are tighter on me than the black heather. Not sure why this is so since I bought all three from the same seller.<br />This can be problematic should the white or cardinal red shrink during washing and then I will not be able to wear them."
5.0,Me encanto este producto
5.0,Love this dress and glad that it fit just right! Always wanted a polka dot dress! Great price too!
5.0,Used for a few years daily now and still working great

5.0,I purchased these for my granddaughter's first day of kindergarten. She loved them. They made her feel special.
5.0,I love these socks. The colors are pretty and plenty. They are low enough on my toe to actually be &#34;no shows&#34; as they should be. They don't slide down. Good socks!
5.0,"Excellent, very good quality"
5.0,My boy is 9.  Outfit is a little big since it's size 10-12.  He likes it and that's all that matters really!
5.0,These are lovely shoes~ well made.
5.0,Nice watchband. Color is exactly as described.<br />Easy to attach and comfortable on the wrist.

5.0,This band is every bit as good as the original! Would buy again if need be! I do not worry about it falling off or losing it. Great item! Would recommend!
5.0,"I got these for my 2 year old daughter and they fit really well. I liked how many come in the packs.  She didn't mind the different little animal prints on them.  I liked how well made they were.  Will definitely buy more as the ""sock grimlin"" eats a few pair üòÇ"
5.0,"A bit warm now, but super cute. Fits 6 year old well and can fit me also"
5.0,Great quality grand daughter 10 yrs old loves them

5.0,Belt was &#34;as advertised&#34; with very quick shipment.
5.0,perfect for our disney trip and for back to school
5.0,The length is so perfect for what I wanted. It lays right above cleavage. I wasn't wanting a longer necklace but with a little length from neck.
5.0,"Very large variety! Doesn't make me itch or breath the area out, etc so definitely good quality!"
5.0,"Fantastic watch, a bit of a throwback but I like the fact that it's small and unobtrusive (unlike most male watches that are enormous!) Not fit for the macho man, rather fit for the smart man ;)"
5.0,This is an awesome umbrella for the beach and it‚Äôs so cute!!!!
5.0,"I bought these as a confirmation gift for a friend‚Äôs daughter. I was pleased to find well made, tasteful earrings with a religious slant.  Perfect for the occasion!"
5.0,It exceeds expectation. Very nice broche
5.0,Very cute on! Great quality.
5.0,My sons loves the Under Armour slides with the cushioned soles. This pattern just made it better. Great price and great product.

5.0,Perfect loved it and got another
5.0,Fabric is so soft & comfortable. Feels like I‚Äôm wearing a pajama shirt. It fits beautifully. Plan on purchasing another.
5.0,"My son has been complaining alot of foot pain, and I had a feeling the cheap sneakers he was wearing weren't doing him any good. I got these to replace his current shoes. They run a big larger than the ones from target, but that works well for me. They are perfect for his wide feet, and he is very comfortable in them."
5.0,"OK ladies, so I just rcvd mine ,I am 130 pounds 5'4,i bought the 36c and they fit perfectly, they are comfy, and they don't have that overwhelming padding, it's just enough so the nips don't pop thorough. I will be buying them again and even if they don't last long they are still worth it, you get a lot for the price and they are not uncomfortable. I would say the sizing is like that of a Walmart or target bra."
5.0,"I love it, money well spent"
5.0,Workouts and running.
5.0,this shirt/hoodie is so comfortable and the fit was true to size.
5.0,They look great and are very comfortable

5.0,"Haven't put it on my daughter, but the quality is way better than I expected! I held it up to one of her 3-6mo onesies and it is the same size. It looks great and I can't wait to put her in it next month!"
5.0,"I needed some short shorts to beat the heat. My waist is typically 33 or 34 depending on the brand, and I selected these shorts in the 31-32 waist to keep them from being too baggy.<br /><br />I instantly liked them when they arrived, though the legs could be more snug for my liking. Or I could start working out again. Blame stay-at-home orders.<br /><br />The size listed in the shorts is XL, but no issue. After washing and drying them on low heat, they're slightly tighter in the waistband, but not enough to complain.<br /><br />Overall I love these shorts, and I bought two more in different colors. Will probably make a third purchase as well. After saying DGAF I've started wearing them outside in the neighborhood as well. 100¬∞ don't care."
5.0,Beautiful cozy sweater to keep the chill off you! Love the fit and especially around my neck. It was cozy and warm. Loved the c color choices and fits exactly as I had wanted!<br />Great sweater for casual or business casual days!!

5.0,Been looking for this product. It was to my expectations. Would love to order more in different colors.
5.0,These are some very nice oversized sunglasses or sun visor. At first glance even in pictures the visor looks way too big. As you put it on it feels just like you are wearing oakley sunglasses or sunglasses you wear during skiing. They fit perfect and are not heavy or uncomfortable at all. Very nice daily useful sunglasses.
5.0,XL fits taller girls!!
5.0,Exactly as described in pictures and looks great in person everything fits beautifully
5.0,"My daughters preschool teachers loved them! Some are now jealous! If you get one, you will probably have to get all of them one!"
5.0,Babbbbyyyyyy get you some these are the üí© Hot!!! my üçë looking yummy üòç and very flattering going to order more maybe a small for a tighter fit!
5.0,Love these shorts. Comfortable but very flattering.  Have these in two colors. Love this style. Highly recommend. Considering a another color. Quality is great.  I bought a size 4 as I like tighter fit but 6 could work. Just a little looser.
5.0,"You have to make sure you pull the back leg up, I did not do this on Gus and you can see his knee is showing, LOL! But he‚Äôs still cute!"
5.0,"these watch bands feel as good of quality as Apple‚Äôs and I love how they look, super comfortable"
5.0,Exactly what I needed.  Great price and fast shipping.
5.0,Outragly gorgeous. Washable with cold water on gentle cycle and dry on low setting for just a few minutes to still  slightly damp. Then hang to complete drying. Only slight touch up with low setting on iron. I bought 14 of the belle pocque dresses. Love them all.
5.0,"This dress is so beautiful!! Follow the size charts, it helps a lot."
5.0,I received it earlier than expected. I love the nose rings!
5.0,"These are great quality reading glasses. I like the style and how well they work. Clear lenses, no waviness like those from the dollar stores. Definitely a great choice for the money."
5.0,"I love the luxury look of these and the slight cat eye. The size is perfectly oversized and the mirrored lenses look high end, but the price is so great, I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about losing them (but I don‚Äôt want to lose them because I like them!)"
5.0,"I'm a shorter guy. 5'7 1/2, 260 lb weight lifter. Ordered the 50S that comes with a 45 pants. I wear a 44 so that was great. The jacket is exactly what I needed. Obviously needed the pants hemmed. Other than that, excellent suit for the price. Will buy more."
5.0,"My son loves these cleats. They do hurt his feet a bit, but I think that's because he plays for 2-3 hours at a time between practice and games. Cleats aren't generally comfortable shoes to begin with. He doesn't complain too much, and loves the way they look."
5.0,Love it. Fits perfectly. Size was exactly on it.
5.0,"ILike the outcome of the product, its great thanks"
5.0,"I like the bag, it just to small for my laptop, it does hold a good amount of notebooks and such"
5.0,Back chair fragile.  Need the end loops tightened.  This is a piece that will be talked about.
5.0,"Great set of watch bands that fit my Galaxy Watch 3. The price is fantastic, especially considering you get two bands for switching up your look. Quality seems to be great as well. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I bought a small because I wanted them to fit well with high waisted leggings. They‚Äôre prefect. If you want them to fit longer then size up.
5.0,"I am 5.5 and weight 115 lbs. I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly, the blouse is really short but i dont have big chest so it didnt matter. The fabric is not as the picture shown by the seller but it is fine, I mean for the price of this item is fair. Received lots of compliments for my outfit."
5.0,"I love this skirt. I'mean 5'8&#34; so it isn't long enough to wear to work, but it is long enough that I'm comfortable wearing it. I'be worn it about 5 or 6 times and machine washed and dried it in between and it is holding up well. The only suggestion I have is to make sure and check the measurements because it is a bit on the small side."
5.0,"so comfortable, super cute, so much fun!"
5.0,Soft and light. The leather/metal adjustable strap is much better than the cheap plastic clips most companies use.
5.0,"My new favorite top! Super cute. I have big arms and shoulders so I was a little concerned about it squeezing or tugging around the armpits, but it fits wonderfully. Highly recommended."
5.0,Looks great. Many details that make shirt look custom made on a woman‚Äôs body.
5.0,I love it and it's really warm
5.0,Love these pants! They are super comfortable and cute. I got a size M in green and it‚Äôs a nice loose fit that‚Äôs not too baggy. It‚Äôs high waisted and the elastic is really stretchy. I wish the other colors like brown and coffee will be back in stock because I would definitely buy these again!!
5.0,These scarves are really beautiful and nice. We were using them as props from a dance 16 woman were doing. Each of us kept our scarves saying they are too nice to leave.
5.0,"comfortable, removable padding. I'm 34A & this was a bit tight on me. Comfortable tight, not itchy or rough, but defiantly more for smaller chests."
5.0,Amazing quality for the price! I bought the navy and it looks very high-end. I always wear an XS and the fit of this was great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and the dress hit mid-thigh. I highly recommend this dress.
5.0,I had an old pair of sorels that I had replaced the liners with a different pair of felt liners. The felt liners I had in there would pull my socks right off my feet and then rub by leg raw. This liners are a lighter than the old liners but I think they are just as warm. They don't pull my socks off and they are not as itchy as the heavy wool felts. These breathed new life into my old sorels.
5.0,"These shoes look good on my feet -- not like the land-yacht shape I normally have to resort to. No pressure on bunions. Hard, supportive arch and good heal lift to ward off plantar and Achilles pain. Very soft and comforting to wear without socks. And they look good!!"
5.0,O am so happy with this product.  this is  a great product and at a reasonable price.  I have bought other products like this that are too heavy  and restrict blood flow.  These do not.  Love them
5.0,Great kit for Timberland boot care and maintenance. Travel size goes a long way.
5.0,"They are as pictured, Very pretty and light."
5.0,I love it. Fit perfect.
5.0,So cute and well made but 2 sizes too small.
5.0,This top is so soft and comfortable. Bright and cheery also. Might order more.
5.0,This scarf just arrived and it's super nice!  It's very lightweight and it's soooo pretty.  I can use it as a shawl around my shoulders for colder days here at the office when the air conditioning is too cold and makes a lovely scarf to wear with my winter jacket as well.
5.0,"This dress is very nice for the price. The material is cool and breathable, but heavy enough to withstand a bit of breeze. I paired it with a red belt and received a lot of compliments over the holidays. There is a side zipper, like some higher end dresses have to avoid stretching, but it is so discreet that I didn't notice it until after the dress was slipped on (not stretched). Length was good for my height... I'm 5'3&#34; and it went to my knees."
5.0,I love this graphic tank. Washed and worn several times and very little to minimal shrinkage. Would definitely recommend. Great price. Great fit. I am a 35C ‚Äì D and typically wear small to medium. I bought this in a medium and it‚Äôs perfect. I am a 35C ‚Äì D and typically wear small to medium. I bought this in a medium and it‚Äôs perfect.
5.0,I would order another pair! When needed.
5.0,And the Driver for $129 was perfect too!
5.0,"Beautiful pendant.  Love the fact that it is in the shape of a teardrop and not the typical circle.  There are leaves on the tree and the silver is shiny, not dull.  A good weight, and hangs nicely on the chain.<br />Very quick to receive and was nicely packaged.  I would buy from this seller again."
5.0,Received alot of compliments
5.0,"Todo perfecto de buena calidad , tal como la foto"
5.0,"Really easy to install. Original sticks were peeling. This have a different feel to them, maybe a bit more plastic feel with that rubber feel mixed in.<br /><br />I think they might be a tad smaller. I use Kontrol Freeks and the one on my left stick can spin pretty freely, though it could just be the Kontrol Freek, not being as tight as it should be."
5.0,Great materials and fit well
5.0,"I like these.  They look cool, the fit is perfect, the touchscreen finger works great, they dry quickly, and these gloves literally saved my hands last night when I took a fall while running and tripping on concrete.  They held up without any sign of damage, but if I had fallen on my bare hands, it would have been a real mess!  Can recommend!"
5.0,good light lens makes wearing protective sunglass lens easy for viewing in and out. quality stuff well made and durable
5.0,I love funky socks and owls! Imagine my delight when I spotted this adorable colorful crew. They fit a bit tight at the mouth on me and I have really narrow feet with super high arches. They are also pretty thin so you can wear them with tighter shoes without discomfort. That being said they are cute and colorful and I always get compliments on them!
5.0,Great dress! You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I purchased this dress to wear to my father‚Äôs funeral. It was beautiful and well made. I am 5‚Äô7/180lbs and I purchased a large. It was long and flowing. I added a satin sash for texture and I could not have been more pleased. It also came next day!
5.0,My husband loves how these are long enough to go over his knees rather than stopping a couple inches above his knees. He is 6‚Äô0‚Äù & wears a large at 180lbs. I would size up just Incase because he had mediums & they were way too tight around his waist. The quality is good for the price & we love the design/color. Would buy again.
5.0,Love these boots. Very comfortable and the color is perfect
5.0,"I love this hat. I know that the color isn't the right yellow but that's only because in the actual Anime they have to do colors like that to give everything a distinctive look. I loved this hat and with the other cosplay items i got, this hat goes really well."
5.0,"I ordered these to use at the grocery store instead of clogging our environment with more plastic bags.  The bags are exactly what I wanted.  The fabric is lightweight but strong.  The bags are nearly identical to the grocery store plastic bags in shape and a bit larger. Bottom of the bag is flat.  I didn't want bags too large since it then becomes difficult to carry the full bags into the house, and also I don't want the food I'm buying over packed and crushed.  Rolling and folding the bags after each use is not worth the trouble for me.  Instead, I used the little loop on each bag to attach them to a carabiner.  It keeps me from losing any bags, and when I get to the grocery store, I clip it to the cart.  The bonus hooks seem to be good quality and useful as well.  I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,As soon as it got here I pair it with an outfit got so many compliments
5.0,"Bought 3 these for gifts, Super cute! Unique and fun piece!"
5.0,"The watch is good looking, functions are easy to use and so far the watch has held up nicely! Came with instructions as well. Good product and would definitely recommend."
5.0,"I really like this dress. The fit is flattering, dress is long enough. I'm 5'3 and it comes right to my knees. The material is soft."
5.0,Very flattering style and not too constricting.
5.0,Love it for my graduation photos.. Great quality.. And very pretty in person.
5.0,"If you‚Äôre on the fence ‚Äî buy it. The wine color is deep and beautiful, the fabric is high quality, and the sizing is totally spot-on. I‚Äôm an Apple-shaped size 16-18 with a 44DD bust and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this flattering, gorgeous dress!!!"
5.0,These are great lenses
5.0,"Adjustable ear straps so the feeling of having your ear slowly ripped off, or made into open car door ears, isn't an issue with this mask. 5 Oorahrifics. Absolutely NOT approved by that Gunny that yells at you for your civilian attire at the PX."
5.0,You're a fool if you don't buy a Glycine right now at these prices.  This thing is stunning.
5.0,Very fast transaction time
5.0,"It floats! It shades me! It stays on in wind and is not hot! It's chic without being too flashy, too femme or too masculine. Very sturdy and I like that the company that made it works with women artisans to get products to market and gives them decent compensation.  i have another Tula hat, and if this one didn't suit so many needs, Iwould have more!"
5.0,"Love this bathing suit,  i am a small 4/5 in U.S. sizes, as i am 5ft 7in tall and 106 lbs. I ordered an extra large, because i always have to order larger on the top. And it fit perfectly on top. Bottoms fit well also,  i could have used botton a bit smaller, but these fit well and keep me covered even in and out of the water. So if your a size small with a large size bust this is the swim suite for you. Its very well made too. And just beautiful"
5.0,"Great purse....5 stars for color options, style, size, material,workmanship & price"
5.0,Well made gloves at a reasonable price. A great find!
5.0,These look great and are virtually no show.  The silicone in the heel keeps them from slipping.

5.0,My Daughter loves the movies.
5.0,The band is comfortable. I like how thin it is rather the the wider bands. Overall it‚Äôs a good band.
5.0,Good quality ties for the price!! Nice bright colors and fun designs. My husband is excited to wear these!
5.0,I LOVE MY NEW EARINGS!
5.0,I was happy with my assorted piercings and very good price. There long which i am happy bc they fit just right but I also got a few small which is still fine. But I only got two that where tongue rings and those I gave to my partner so it all worked out.
5.0,"Received yesterday; wore today and lost count of the number of compliments I received once it exceeded 20.  I am a teacher and my students, male and female co-workers etc all said it was a beautiful dress.  One co-worker made me send her the link right then.  Love the purple colors and soo comfy (I do recommend tights under it as it can kick up if there's much wind).  Definitely may need to get it in some of the other colors as well."
5.0,I LOVE this! I have it in 4 colors & still would like more!<br /><br />This is so soft. The material is thin so if you wear it as a dress without leggings I would suggest a slip. This is an absolutely perfect piece for fall & winter!
5.0,Brought this for my GF and she loves it !
5.0,"Finding a short sleeve mock turtleneck is not easy. I was reluctant to try this one, but I'm so glad I did. It is just what I needed. It is a little lighter than I anticipated, but it is warm and works well for layering when I don't want long sleeves, which is what I wanted. I will probably order another one."
5.0,"Very nice, much better than the rubber/plastic band that came with my iWatch."
5.0,I love this product and Bath n Body discontinued it. It works immediately on sunburns. I used it up last year. Getting ready for a cruise and knew I NEEDED to get a new one. Thanks.

5.0,Love the sunglasses!  Will be ordering more!
5.0,"Super cute. Thin, but not see through. Because of the thinness it already caught on something and has a tear after only 2 times wearing it. Im bummed cuz i like the design"
5.0,I want to buy more except the price went up on me.
5.0,"Great fit, good quality, very nice hard sided cases. Definitely recommend"

5.0,"Have used these for about 1 month. So far v good, does not fog and perfect fit for my face"
5.0,"This belt has been great! I have been using it for a little over 10 days and have dropped 5lbs. I can notice a difference in the amount I sweat when walking on the treadmill. It has also helped me to drink more water only because I know I'm losing a lot when working out while wearing the belt. I am on the bigger side and the belt fits great. I was worried with it being a one size fits all that it would be too small, so I was very excited when it worked! I think it adds a little extra to my workouts in the morning.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I was given this product at a free or reduced rate to give my honest opinion."
5.0,"Good quality for the price, works great for a dog park bag"

5.0,Variety of sizes and colors
5.0,I bought this for my friends birthday. She loved it.
5.0,This is so cute and cheery.  It's a little large on me but it's okay.  I still wear it and think it's cheerful.  Next time I'll buy a smaller size.  Usually clothes I buy online run a little small and was hoping that wasn't the case this time so it was refreshing to get one a little on the big size vs on the small size.  I've washed it a half a dozen times and haven't had any issues with it so far.  I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0,it's adorable
5.0,Beautiful! Worth the money!

5.0,"Great product, well made, I especially like the breathability of the fabric"
5.0,Beautiful evening bag used for my daughters wedding love the price
5.0,I LOVE this dress! Only downfall is how easily it wrinkles. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and wear a 12/14 usually and got an XL. It fits just right wth room to breathe. Great fabric- I got brick red which is perfect for fall. Now I need another pink one for spring ü§ó
5.0,"Love love love this!  It's super cute, but I won't be wearing it as a dress.  It's a bit too short for that.  But it will be perfect for the rodeo in Houston with leggings and my cowboy boots.  Great pattern, great styling.  It'll wrinkle, but I know how to iron.  :)"
5.0,Love these glasses so much that I‚Äôve bought several pairs to last me for some time and they do last for several months. I sweat a lot in the gym and put them after a workout or running around the park to impress the Ladies... Trust me they look awesome.

5.0,Used it to embroider a company logo. Worked great.
5.0,"Absolutely love this with the modal fabric in the black nighty! Please keep making it! It is so soft, light, comfortable- no scratchy seams in the back to itch my back. It is one of my favorites! Seams on the sides are soft, non-abrasive, and it hangs nicely. I wear it as a lounger around the house, also as a liner. I ordered a second one so I can cut off the sleeves and still enjoy it when the weather is a little milder."
5.0,The person I gave to as a gift really loved it.
5.0,"I love it, this completes me for my look while I'm out riding my Indian motorcycle!"
5.0,"I love this shirt, however: sizing is too big! I advise to buy a size smaller. I had to return my shirt, their customer service for returns was excellent"
5.0,"This is a very cute style blouse and extremely form fitting! I would order a size up for a bustier woman. It fits snug in the waist. The color is not that as shown, it is a little lighter. The sleeves are also very snug on the arms. I wore this with skinny jeans and boots and it made for a nice outfit. I will order another color or two, but again, I would go up in size."
5.0,Loved the dress. Sassy and looks great. You will like it. Add a pinch of red. Super sexy.

The simplicity, elegance from the gold layered necklace will bring you the shining, delicacy and appropriateness that you deserve to have. I highly recommended this beautiful, truly yours necklace."
5.0,fit as expected. sheer/thin material
5.0,"I used these for my wedding because I had to walk quite a distance outside. They worked wonderfully!  No sinking in the grass, no loss of balance. I ended up keeping them on for the reception too, just because I forgot they were there. Really great idea!"
5.0,I bought a set for each of our grandchildren. They love them and didn't want to take them off. They even went hunting Easter eggs in them.

5.0,"Soft, warm, cozy. Son loved."

5.0,I bought the Wanderlust socks for my husband who was experiencing swollen ankles.  The socks immediately worked  to reduce the swelling and the accompanying leg pain.  My husband was so pleased with the first pair of socks that he had me order two more pairs!

5.0,Nice quality stainless grip screws. Nice noticeable touch for the 1911 with the Torx head. Looks unique and fits perfect.
5.0,This is fun to wear.  The shirt graphics could be a better quality for the price charged so this why only 4 stars.  Seems like it will fade over several washings.  The first washing seemed to start the process.  Otherwise a good bit of fun.
5.0,I'm really enjoying them !
5.0,This butterfly is large and beautiful. The ab  crystals sparkle like diamonds. I wore mine on an 18 inch wire which really showcases it but on the long chain it came on would be pretty on a sweater. I am truly happy with this purchase. Sometimes the picture doesn't really show the size but this one surprised me.
5.0,Needed something for my hands in cold weather that I could shop without taking off.  These were perfect.

5.0,"Purchased the maroon dress and loved it! Fit perfect, which most<br />Things don‚Äôt for me. Was comfortable all night. I did have to cut the tag off though, that scratched my neck"
5.0,"I love these sandals! I must say that when I took them out of the box, I noticed that they were more rose gold than yellow gold and wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked them, but once I tried them on with my freshly tanned legs and a cute new outfit, I was in love! They are well made and so comfortable. I have received so many compliments on these sandals and told everyone where to order them. If you‚Äôre looking for a versatile sandal to go with everything this summer, this is the one!!!"
5.0,"A little flimsy but, great for a Christmas gift for a cat lover"

5.0,Great for holding package
5.0,I was looking for something cheap that would fit my petite face (I usually end up getting frames from the children's section). These were perfect and soooo cute. Love them. I can tell the eye strain from screen time has been mitigated.
5.0,"This skirt is awesome! So much fun! I found I while searching for a bird shirt inspired by my man winston ha-ha . It was a new style for me but I loved the pattern so went for it. I bought the xl and xxl based on reviews and the xxl fit perfect. Xxl is my normal size so glad it fit nicely. I paired it with this spandex shirt (GaryM Women's Plus Size Stretch Solid Color T-Shirt Stone https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y3I7R2O/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_SSybyb3FXR736 ) and a belt I purchased on Amazon like four years ago. Let me tell you I love this outfit! The best part.... you don't have to suck it in! My gut is completely hidden. What a relief ha-ha. I'm posting two pictures from the side, one sucking in, one not. Yay! The skirt is so fun to wear. I got a bunch of compliments at my friends wedding. It's also super comfy. I wore it for 8+hours and was sad to take it off!"

5.0,Very easy to use. I lime that it make it easy to slip shoes on.

5.0,"We spend a ton of money to get my husband a custom tux and all the whistles for our wedding, unfortunately, just days before the ceremony we realized we had misplaced his bow tie. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime! As a bride to be I was already beyond stressed out, and was so relieved to open the package. The bow was such high quality, I felt it was even better than the bow tie we had originally spent so much money on, and it was cheaper than the price it would have cost to even rent a replacement! My husband was also very pleased with it as apparently it was a more comfortable fit for him as well. Day of the wedding he did have some trouble getting the bow tie on, so I highly suggest you practice practice practice lol He wore it again to the ballet a few months later and he looked really dashing, it worked really well with his suit and no one was none the wiser. There are so many things you spend money on for a wedding, I wish we would have just grabbed this from Amazon in the first place."
5.0,Comfy underwear
5.0,Came as pictured.
5.0,It fight my 23lb daughter perfectly
5.0,"This is my Second S2SQUIRE Watch...!  I purchased the black face dial this time ...üëç My First one was the Blue one with the Black Band...<br />(  I guarantee you there is no place on the planet you can purchase a full automatic winding watch with a date dial, the day dial, and the day night phase dial  ....! ) Besides it having a  incredible smooth sweep to the secondhand ....!  The watch is absolutely gorgeous , it‚Äôs a beautiful chrome plated stainless steel band and watch case with a satin black face ...!  The automatic movement is smooth and looks fantastic through the open back glass ...  I absolutely do not know how they can sell this incredible multi function Auto wind watch for $10 ....!!!  I have the white one coming Monday exactly like my other two you can‚Äôt go wrong ....!  If you don‚Äôt like it you can send it back within 30 days ...!!!"
5.0,I purchase both the camo and leopard at the same time because I couldn‚Äôt decide which I liked better. I‚Äôm going to be honest I did not like the leopard print in the bag or out the bag but I loved it on. It‚Äôs very versatile. Can be dressed up or down. Worn with almost any type of shoe/boot. I included pics for both and with different shoes. It is so comfortable and fits true to size.
5.0,This is a good deal when I bought it.Not sure if it is still same price. But it was cheap. I wore it a lot and just handed it my sister as a gift from me. She knew I wore it and loved it. It still looks great and hasn't fell apart yet and most of these most times fall apart. Not this one. They make good products. Will buy again.
5.0,"These culettes are my 'fun' trousers! Hanging around the house or making a statement, for sure. Buy these trousers to add a fun element to your ensemble."
5.0,"Bought for the office. Super fluffy, and big. Only issue was on first wash, left red fuzz everywhere. But that just shows how super fuzzy this thing is. Dig it, ooooh yeeeeeaah! Snap into a slim Jim, Brutha!"
5.0,We use these socks when my son has his night splints on and they work fantastic. Less expensive compared to the specialty socks
5.0,"I have actually never made a better purchase For a thing that I thought of and wondered if they had. I‚Äôve always had trouble with waking up especially if I don‚Äôt subconsciously know I‚Äôm required to for ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù, and regularly sleep unset my alarms. This has unlocked new hours of the day for me that I didnt ever think I‚Äôd see. The only suggestion I have, is use a tiny pad lock through the holes on the wrist to prevent taking it off, and to the creators, I‚Äôd recommend removing snooze as a feature all together. That said this is the second generation, so this might have been improved upon. 100% recommend to stubborn sleepers. Also shock option is totally silent, so if you don‚Äôt mind the pinch it‚Äôs great for being less disruptive to your SO."
5.0,I watched several videos and reviews about this and mine finally arrived from Germany. Love it...great quality. Covers my gear and still have plenty of room.
5.0,Very pretty.  Good size for charm bracelet
5.0,Like the comfort and fit.  Like the style.  Not sure about durability yet!
5.0,"These were purchased at a reduced cost for an unbiased opinion.<br />I was very impressed with the speed of getting the product. The packaging for sunglasses was great... no need to worry about being broken.<br />The glasses are very impressive both looking and the feel. They come with a hard case, soft case and cleaning/buffing cloth.<br />We ordered extra to give as presents at Christmas and I am sure that the receivers are going to be equally impressed."
5.0,"These shoes are a great fit for your cold feet! I like how soft they are, and how supportive they are considering they are only slippers. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Beautiful dress that my daughter loved!
5.0,"As someone with a tummy to hide, I appreciate that these give good tummy control without looking too much like granny panties. They are comfortable and breathable, and seem to be quite good quality. I have had no issues with pulling, pilling or stretching. I will definitely be getting these again!"
5.0,I used to wear boxer briefs but I decided to give briefs a try and I'm glad i did these underwear are nice and soft I plan on buying some more I'm a briefs kind guy now

5.0,"Excellent pull on pants, soft, no seams that rub on you, Bought for post surgery and may buy another pair just to lounge in."
5.0,"These jeans fit great, with the ability to make the waist more looser/tighter. I've been using them as my ""work jeans"", and they've held up pretty well. However, after a few months of wearing them frequently in a food service environment, they have developed transparent holes in the knees. However, for work, they'll do!"
5.0,"I am a mens size 11.5. These socks fit perfectly with tennis shoes or sneakers. There are no uncomfortable seems at the toes.  Simple, comfortable. Great socks"
5.0,i ordered this as a gift for my son. I thought it was the size of a quarter. I was surprised when I opened the box to find that it is the size of a Silver dollar. The craftsmanship is very good.

5.0,My necessity love them. So many beautiful colors!!
5.0,My child is a little thick in the waist and thighs so jeans are hard to find that fit properly. I took a chance and purchased 3 different pairs of this brand. All 3 styles fit her perfectly! They actually conform to her body shape without being loose or tight in areas. She loves them. I will definitely be purchasing again.
5.0,Great quality!!!! Worked perfectly for my htv project
5.0,It is a small treasure and ever so useful! Wonderful invention!
5.0,Its beautiful and I get so compliments when I wear it.
5.0,"I was skeptical about packing cubes, in general, since I have been traveling for years without them. I bought a bunch of these for a long vacation overseas, where I was stopping at five different places, and was glad I did.<br /><br />The mesh and siding is pleasant to the touch, and doesn't look quite as bright neon as it does online (which I think is a good thing). Both the colored sides and mesh have some elasticity, which comes in handy if you need to overstuff them, and means they will stretch and not rip. Never had any problems with zippers catching on either clothes or the cube material. With minimal encouragement, the sides do pop up when packing, while the empty bag lies flat.<br /><br /> They don't really compress, so don't expect to pack away huge amounts of clothes in a tiny cube. The space savings are only as good as your folding skill. That said, if you take care to fold your items carefully, clothes stay relatively unwrinkled and compact.<br /><br />Retrieval of items is easy, too, if you put all items of one type in one cube (like, all pants in one, all short sleeved shirts in another, etc.). Also, if you like to unpack at your destination, you can just throw the cubes into the shelf, unzip, and pull sides down.<br /><br />Are they worth it? Depends if you can afford the cost. You'd get most out of them on trips where you stop over in more than one place (easy to pack/unpack), or are packing a lot and need some help with organization and quickly finding your clothes and keeping them in good order. Quality seems good so far, though I have only had them on one 2 week trip."
5.0,My Slytherin loves these
5.0,I love these boots SO much. I contacted the company (super nice people!) to see when they'd be in stock again so I could get another pair!! I have black and grey. I get compliments on them every time I wear them!!!
5.0,Little loose around the chest area : I am a 36C - 130 lbs
5.0,Great design! Great quality! Quality chain and workmanship.
5.0,"Amazing hat, great fit, looking beautiful! 4 more years please."
5.0,gorgeous pendant!
5.0,My son and I love them. They last all night long and more. My son feels very exited each time I'm going to put him one diaper on because he likes to choose between Chase and Marshall. And I can notice they are ver comfortable.
5.0,"I love the 1948 Vintage brand. I live on Cape Cod and our winters tend to be raw, windy and overcast. I bought a large which fits me a bit big but gives plenty of room for layering. The sleeves are a tad long for me but perfect to keep my gloves tucked in. I've been out in 30 degree weather with a turtleneck and this pullover and felt perfectly comfortable without the bulkiness of a coat. The lining is super soft...similar to a t-shirt. Sometimes I wear mine wo turtleneck on rainy days indoors. It's so cozy. I now own 3 and most likely buy more next yr."
5.0,"I bought it at the spirit halloween website, it is cheaper there. But for the price it is super cool"
5.0,My wife is very pleased with the 1.54 Ct Round 6mm Green Simulated Emeral 14K Yellow Stud Earrings and enjoys wearing them.
5.0,They do their job...........  Cannot go wrong for the  money
5.0,"So I read the reviews before I purchased and saw a lot of reviews saying it was see through, and cheap material. Yes it is very thin, but for the heat I think it's perfect and I paired it with a black tight dress so see through isn't a issue. I bought this specifically bigger for my growing belly (in picture I'm 26 weeks pregnant and 180 lbs 38DD chest, 5'4. And still a little big so I can wear throughout my pregnancy! I LOVE it. Just what I was looking for! The pockets are great, overall lose fitting and just ü•∞"
5.0,Wife loves the price and fit.
5.0,Cute dress!! Runs a bit large. I wish they offered it in extra small.
5.0,Used for walking during hunting season.
5.0,Great head wear for health care staff
5.0,"The vivid colors... the light and breezy fabric.... the deep pockets... the adjustable straps.... 100% perfection! Must have in every color, I don't wanna take this bundle of happiness off! I'm 145 lbs/5""5 tall and a small fits loose and flowy and hangs exceptionally well. Can jazz it up or keep it casual, adding a cardigan or a cropped leather jacket or even a jean jacket will make it transition into fall really well. The fabric is light but more on the opaque side, my man walked behind me and promised me he couldn't see my undies. I'll have to trust him on that. But overall, I really love this dress!"
5.0,"fourth purchase from this company, so far so good. Neck line is high with a dip. A good amout of modest clevage."
5.0,These fit great! Super comfy material and in style. Awesome Joggers
5.0,This watch band is beautiful.  The seller was more than helpful when I told them it was not the correct size. They immediately replaced it and it‚Äôs perfect.

5.0,Love It! Came on time fits well
5.0,Super soft stretchy material. Fits exactly right in all the right places and most of all AFFORDABLE! With so many color options to choose from I will be purchasing more. Oh and pockets. Need I say more?
5.0,"I ordered these because I wanted a mix between leggings and tights. I also was hoping these would be as long on me as the model in the picture. I am 5'8&#34; and 160lbs. I wear size 10 jeans. A large was perfect. The length was perfect too. The material was interesting. It has a pattern to it, but it is also thicker than normal tights. However, due to the fishnet looking pattern on the fabric, is it does not appear like I will get snags very easily. They are also stirrup tights/leggings. I wasn't expecting that, but I'm glad they are now that I have them. I can't wait to wear them during my show. I am wearing them for a lyra routine! (I would be shocked if the lyra damages them.)"
5.0,I‚Äôm stopped in this... folks wanna know we‚Äôre I got it!!! Order 2 and save time. The jacket is short
5.0,Bought this for first girl great grand child who we were told is going to be a girl. Were surprised to learn it will be another boy. So decided to keep it hoping for that girl someday. So cute and I am patient.
5.0,Justice the pic very cute dress
5.0,These are smaller size than you think..I wear a 9.5 in boots and these are 10.5 and are perfect for me.. unfortunately they were for my boy and they don't fit.. ü§£üòÜüòÜü§£
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, great quality."
5.0,My son loves MARIO so it‚Äôs perfect for him
5.0,I love my little purse! Wish I‚Äôd ordered it before Christmas!
5.0,I love how it goes with everything. Also has a side almost invisible zip. Just make sure to size down since it‚Äôs a tad loose fitting.
5.0,"My son is a couple weeks away from being 2. He‚Äôs a smal little guy. I ordered the 18-24 month size and the pants were so big in the waist, they could fit my 4 year old. We ended up just tieing them up in the back. The white button up fit perfect üëåüèº the black jacket fit good but the sleeves were a little long. Overall, the material of this is perfect for kids.  Very comfy."
5.0,100% waterproof! I wore this when I was washing my car and literally I got wet except my shoes! Definitely recommend to someone who has the most contact with water!
5.0,"Love the colors, it is beautiful."
5.0,This is very nicely made and holds all the cards needed. It was given to adult male and he likes it a lot.
5.0,I liked everything about thos item.  It fit right over luggage handle and held everything i needed in it.
5.0,ordered both the fleece lined and smooth thermal underwear and both are working well skiing in 20 degree weather.  The fleece lined ones are more comfortable and keep kids a little warmer.
5.0,Great tables.  Look fantastic on the porch!
5.0,Real and as described.  Son loves it.
5.0,Soft so soft.pockets are perfect and it fits exactly as I had hoped. Exactly right size chart<br />So many compliments wearing it.<br />Thanks!!!
5.0,Quality and functionality are great.  The added heft and wider girth are perfect.
5.0,"First off, I was very impressed with the packaging and how the hat came in a nice box.  It actually makes for a far nicer presentation than I expected (which was just to have a crumpled hat in an envelope).  The hat, itself is extremely lightweight, cool and comfortable.  The large size happened to fit my head almost perfectly, just slightly loose, which was unexpected since I have a fairly large melon.  I like the unstructured, foldable design which allows you to carry it in a day pack or pocket so you can always have head protection on you when you need it.  That's why I consider it an EDC hat because it's the only one I have that I can keep on me without having to wear it all day.  Seems well constructed and I like the cool feel of the Supplex nylon.  Finally, I like the fact that there aren't any strange adjustment straps to fool with, just a simple, fitted design.  I realize this may turn off some people, especially those with long hair who want to wear it in a ponytail but if you've got short hair or are bald, this is the one!"
5.0,I got this shirt and it‚Äôs really nice. Just runs a little big.
5.0,Very beautiful. Thank You.
5.0,"It was a gift, which was LOVED!!!"
5.0,Love these shoes for my kid. Daycare approved and stylish.

5.0,"I can‚Äôt vouch for how long it will hold up yet but it‚Äôs beautiful and she loves it,  thank you!"
5.0,"Socks arrived quickly, fit great and worked great on hardwood floors."
5.0,"I was not happy that the race series I do switched from medals to challenge coins since I hang my medals on a rack. I have nowhere to put a challenge coin display. I am so glad I found these. I put the challenge coin in, then put a ribbon on it, and then I can hang them with the rest of my medals. Problem solved!"
5.0,"Good material, holds its color (I got the slate blue, or gray blue) washed it several times and it has not pilled up. My fiance wears it a lot."
5.0,"Color is on point,  price and comfort."
5.0,Love it! It was my favorite summer dress! I want it in more colors!!
5.0,"This is my second order of these pouches; they're well-constructed and good quality.  I use them to keep dust off my watches when not being worn, and I put my cellphone in one when I put it in my pocket to keep it from getting scratched.<br />I recommend them."
5.0,Nice wallet for a women. It was a bit bulky and big to me personally.
5.0,I reached out to them about this ring as I purchased my first one almost 9 years ago and it sadly broke. I wore it everyday FAITHFULLY in those years. They were kind enough to find the things to recreate the ring I adored. I now wear it right where it should be and I can‚Äôt thank them enough!
5.0,"This poncho is very ample in size.  I would GUESS that it would comfortably be worn by persons of 450 lbs or even more.  Because it is a poncho, it does not look big on smaller people, as it just folds into a smaller size.<br />It is heavy duty, and certainly NOT something you can just put in your pocket.  I am 5'11"" and the length goes well below my knees.<br />So, not real portable, but good size and does the job."
5.0,Very sleek and nice. It came in a box as well as a bag including a cleansing cloth and a card to test the polarization. I am very pleased.
5.0,I was so happy when I found this beautiful turquoise color of Paua Shell earring so shaped like a cat. I have a Ragdoll cat who is only a year old and I'm loving everything cat related! These earrings are beautifully made and very attractive.
5.0,Very cute bracelet.  I had to fix a clasp but that wasn't a problem.
5.0,"Beautiful, quality. Perfect size"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:12a20cc3358d894b4cf482272dba91ff]] Product came in nice box and it looks jus like the picture!
5.0,"I was looking around for an inexpensive dress I could get my GF and when I saw this one, I know she would love it! She tried it on and it looked super good on her. I am so happy she likes it. She said that she really like the material and the strings on the shoulders. I also really liked the color green it was."
5.0,"I love this hat. Seller is recommended. Came a few days earlier than expected. Ordered the small/medium and it fits great, although please don't use that as a reference for your order, order your correct size."
5.0,great fit did ordered a size larger. üòä will order one in blue.
5.0,Great shirt! Wool but not too scratchy.
5.0,I really liked the material
5.0,"I love these capri/leggings so much! I just got my third pair and they are really a steal for what they cost. When I got my first pair, I was totally surprised by the quality, very comparable to high end leggings from other companies. Not see through at all (as long as you buy size appropriate so you don't over stretch the fabric) and I love the colors they come in. They wash well, I hang dry all my workout leggings/spandex, so I don't know if they pill from a cycle in the dryer. Primarily use them for yoga and rock climbing.<br /><br />Will definitely order more!"
5.0,I've had them for quit some time and I love them - still look great!!
5.0,"These are absolutely adorable. Very vibrant colors, very soft & warm."

5.0,Love my sunglasses!
5.0,Super comfy! Love them
5.0,Exactly what I was hoping for. The glasses fit comfortably and earplugs work great. Very good quality!
5.0,Great lightweight running jacket for cooler temperatures. Super comfortable and moves with me during daily runs. Bought a size large so I can layer underneath when temps go below freezing. A medium would fit perfectly.
5.0,I love this dress. I wear a size 12 and am 5‚Äô6 in height. I bought the XL.  The slip underneath the dress is a full length slip which is great! It is the perfect length and the dress did not drag on the floor. My only complaint is that the color of the flowers are not a pink like the picture but more of a light peach color. Other than that it is perfect!
5.0,"Perfect workout top.  It‚Äôs cute and stylish.  Much much like the athleisure brands but for a fraction of the price.  Will buy in multiple colors! Washing note:  put in delicates bag, wash gentle, hang to dry."
5.0,"The green Birthday Girl shirt is cute and soft. A nice women‚Äôs fit and true to size but a little long for me. I am only 5‚Äô2‚Äù though, and everything is long on me.  I hope it will shrink a tad when I wash it."
5.0,Fits just right!!! Love it!

5.0,"Great corset for those of us with a small bust, thin waist, and wide hips!!!"
5.0,"I love this bag. I think most important to me were the separate zippered sections. Keeping stuff I need,  but use less, in a different pocket.  The print is bright and pretty."
5.0,Best fit ever and colors bold fabric high quality looks so amazing Easy wash doesn‚Äôt shrink or fade .<br />Knit part ribbing perfect printed part beautiful fabric not cheap Colton . A must have hat so cool and exciting
5.0,So fancy for an Amazon sweater all my friends want it now !
5.0,"I LOVE this dress. Wear it with a belt and a slip(otherwise it's a little see thru) and it fits great. I'm 5'1, 125 lbs and ordered a small."
5.0,"I purchased multiple leggings from this seller. All the leggings were great, no problems. Great quality, fit as expected. Great customer service. Will purchase more."
5.0,5‚Äô3‚Äù 145lbs. I ordered size 12. Way too long so I‚Äôll need it altered but it is BEAUTIFUL and fits everywhere else perfectly.
5.0,My mom got me a different version and I really liked the thought. I need something that can last a long time between uses but be ready in times of need. Waterproof was also a must as kayaking camping trips are in my future!
5.0,Great product. My six-year-old daughter loves them.
5.0,It‚Äôs also a delicatessen and high quality item of ninaqueen!! I like it
5.0,Returned these for being too big!
5.0,Used these for handbell choir. They work perfectly.
5.0,"This is very shiny silver, and very cute. It's super fun and I've had quite a few compliments on it. Can't beat the price, either! I'd like them to do a pterodactyl one, with the wings spread. How cool would that be?"
5.0,"Product is same as mention By manufacturer . Soft, comfortable, stretchy and fit perfectly. Good value deal for 2."
5.0,My son Loves this shirt!
5.0,I love this dress. I wear it to work or wear as a casual dress depending on how I accessories. The material is soft and feels good.
5.0,These are very well made and are very comfortable. The look is stylish and they have held up well. Wished would of got a size larger but they are doable. Really like the look of these and can wear anywhere. Thinking of getting more in different colors. Recommend these cargo shorts.
5.0,I bought the reindeer masks. Five stars because of the design. They are super cute and made people smile when they saw them.  The masks fit nicely and are about the same as any mask we have to wear. I had a hard time with the filter in because the material is pretty thick already.
5.0,"Me encant√≥ es muy cubridor no se ve mi ropa interior cuando me agacho , es suave por dentro y muy c√≥modo ."
5.0,"Love this case.  It goes on easy, provides good protection, and it arrived several days early."
5.0,"I LOVE this dress!  The material is thick enough to not fly around easily in the wind, but not too thick to make it hot for summer, etc.  very stylish and perfect for summer."
5.0,"Love these pajamas for my kiddos! Soft and cozy, fit perfectly as I expected."
5.0,I love this shirt. It does stop short but it‚Äôs pretty. I love this shirt.
5.0,worked great on my scallop risotto will order again
5.0,"Having used Revant lenses for several other pair of my sunglasses, I was VERY happy to find out that they make lenses to fit my Batwolfs :) Easy swap, perfect fit, flawless replacement. Thanks so much guys, you've done it again!"
5.0,"A high quality, very sturdy and easy to set up and take down. I highly recommend this product. A great value!"
5.0,Just a great fit. Nothing else to say!
5.0,"First of all, this is a very nice top made from soft material. Very casual style, long length, and loose-fitting. It fits true to size. I am typically an XXL or 18 and it fits great.  I would call this a sleeveless t-shirt before I would call it a tank top, but I can't fault it at all. The material is thin, but that is great for summer. The only thing I don't like is the neck opening is a little restrictive for me. It is much like any generic t-shirt neck and fits right up against my throat, which is very irritating for me personally. If this type of neckline doesn't both you, then you would love this top. It is very cute. The material is lighter colored in person than in the picture, however, this really isn't a big deal to me."
5.0,"I bought these earrings as a statement of my faith but also enjoy wearing them for the compliments I get.  I've never failed to get comments each time I wear them.  Well made, well packaged..."
5.0,These pin locks work great to keep letter jacket pins in place.
5.0,"Opened the package and first felt how soft the socks are, like the arch support and the bright colors"
5.0,My daughters birthday
5.0,It was the perfect size.
5.0,"I love my backpack! I use it as my work bag. My lunch fits,so your basic Rubbermaid fits pretty good. I also carry my little bag with every girl‚Äôs essentials (even my big perfume üò≥). It also has a ton of pockets. Plus It‚Äôs super cute!!! I want more!"
5.0,Very easy to put on.  Gave them to my girls with newly pierced ears and they can get them on and off easily.
5.0,winter specials
5.0,"Received mine on the exact date i was expecting it. Love It! Nice size and looks very nice. I got the 100cm. Looks as the pictures and I blow dried mine for a lil more fluffiness. The only thing is that my lil package came with 1 clip and it shows more above but other than that , I have no complaints. Very Satisfied."
5.0,Great money clip with card slots for a reasonable price. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,Sooooo awesome!!!!
5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but this product (dress) earned my admiration!  I am over 60 years old, still work in a professional environment, and wanted to find something to wear that is age-appropriate for me, as well as durable and breathable for living in a tropical climate (above 80 degrees on most days with a humidity of 75 % or better on most days). I am 5'6"", I weigh 230lbs, and my job is mostly sedentary, but there are occasions where I have to bend, stoop, or reach.  This dress is THE MOST versatile and accommodating dress I have purchased in long time for what I need in the work environment.  I purchased a 2XL.  It fits perfectly, hangs nicely on a plump body, and does exactly what I need it to do.  It is a perfect length, it has the perfect appearance - I can dress it up with a jacket and look totally professional, or dress it down and have that casual but respectful look.  It is durable, washable material.  I do not have to worry about see-through thinness, and it is perfect for a hot, humid climate.  I bought one in every color.  Thanks, Hotouch!  In my opinion, you got it right!"
5.0,It's gorgeous. So beyond inlove with this case. It's very elegant and pretty. May by another one  soon because it's just to pretty
5.0,"First off..<br />COLOR NOT AS EXPECTED- We purchased the ""pink"" shade, which is actually more of a neon Coral. I'm not complaining, we love it, but there is that for your knowledge.<br /><br />This Girls 2-Piece Swimsuit Strap Lace Up Solid Beach Sport Bikini Set is absolutely adorable! My little girl, 10 years old, 4 ft 11 in, is usually a girls size 12 or 14 in children's sizing, sometimes a women's x-small as she is tall for her age. It's cute and fun and nothing is hanging out, great compromise between children's wear and what mom wants. This is a great quality piece! And what a deal!<br /><br />The straps do tie at the top and in this photo they are double knotted and still look good, they,are long enough. The bottoms cover good enough!<br /><br />Will update if thoughts change over time<br /><br />We highly recommend!"
5.0,"Pretty, delicate, really nice!"
5.0,arrived on time and as advertised
5.0,"Rarely have I found a clothing item that suits my needs so well.  I wear them, literally, everywhere: Tai Chi, Pilates, around home, running errands, to upscale restaurants & the theater.  They‚Äôre completely adaptable. Ive been wearing them for about a year‚Äîhave at least a dozen pair. They wash well.  I throw them in the dryer for five minutes or so to knock the wrinkles out, then hang them over a hanger to dry completely. The ankle length suits me perfectly as my legs are short.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù  110 lbs.  The size 2 fits well, but the size 4 is more comfortable in the waist/crotch. Highly recommend."
5.0,Not true to size...buy one size up

5.0,Fits my 8 year old great! Comes with filter also!
5.0,"Very happy this was for a 6'4 person and it draped just right with sneakers on at the ankle, so will run long for most, everything else was perfect. Material is solid but not heavy, attractive enough to wear out and about."
5.0,Husband said they were comfortable
5.0,"My grandson is in love with these shoe. They fit well, just hoping they hold up a few months."
5.0,"Great watch, needed a cheaper watch that I wouldn't mind getting beaten up work and this thing is perfect for that. Very comfortable and slim. Yes there are nicer watches out there, but if you need a watch and need to not sweat knocking it around, this is your watch."
5.0,Excellent sprayer
5.0,My favorite key chain but the hook broke ü•∫
5.0,Good sized bag. All the room you need to carry a reasonable amount of personal goods.

5.0,Just what I wanted!!! Perfect!
5.0,"Very nice ring at an even nicer price.  I love moonstone, but it's kind of soft, so the stone gets dull with use.  I think this ring was a good upgrade for me."
5.0,After many cycles through the washer and dryer- the pleats stay. Great quality. Hasn‚Äôt faded or shrunk. Pockets can hold a iPhone in one and a waitress pad in the other easily. Gained 5 lbs and it still fits perfectly. Highly recommend!

5.0,Runs bigger than expected
5.0,This is everything you would want in a see through bag.  Enough space to be useful. Very sturdy.
5.0,"I'm very happy with this dress. Pleasantly surprised that the top is tailored. In case you were wondering, the top portion is indeed navy and matches the skirt very well. Great winter dress. I would say the size chart is very accurate."
5.0,"This is super cute but check the size guide. I wear size 8 in pants and medium and shirts, 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 135lbs and got an XL to fit."

5.0,I love this belt. It has been the only belt like it that was wider than the average. Amazon is saying it may not be available again and I am disappointed because I wanted to order more of them. I really hope they bring this product back.
5.0,This is a very comfy and warm fleece. They run a little big but that is exactly what I wanted.
5.0,The quality of the leather is ok. I selected the gray color since in the photo it complimented the watch. The Comoros is way far from the watch it looks very weird. Did not like much. I wore it once only.
5.0,It has some static so get some static relasing spray and then enjoy the elegant design and soft lace on this dress. I felt like Jackie O in this dress. I ended up not wearing it to my daughters wedding and went with a short dress but I love this dress and for the price you won't find anything to even touch it. The fit is perfect. The length is perfect.

I also really love the look of them, they're stylish and interesting looking. The price was great and they don't feel cheap or poorly made.<br />There's not really anything I dislike about them. The straps even come off if you don't want to wear them.<br />Overall a very satisfied purchase!"

5.0,"Love this belt and have gotten many compliments on it. Very sturdy, well made."
5.0,"I like to accessorize with jewelry, but most of what I have is dressier for work.  I have been looking to expand my collection of casual pieces.  I came across this bracelet and really liked the look so I decided to order it.<br /><br />The bracelet is basically three bracelets that come together as one.  Two strands are a thinner braided leather, one has accent beads.  The middle strand is a thicker, flat leather with a feather charm laid flat and wrapped with string.  The bracelet is adjustable by sliding the back ends a part to open and then pulling the string to tighten.  My only minor complaint is that there are no stoppers for the beads so they tend to fall to the underside of the bracelet.  Overall I really like this bracelet and perfect for my more casual outfits.<br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

I am heart broken that Keen is discontinuing this style.

5.0,Nice short but nice
5.0,"I‚Äôm just glad I found these bc I actually own these, and the store doesn‚Äôt carry them anymore, but they are my favorite. Mine are getting shabby bc I‚Äôm too lazy to wear real bras anymore, so I needed a replacement set, and I found it- making me the happiest yoga class lady on the internet.<br />These do dress up well, if you‚Äôre fancy like that."
5.0,"Love this bag! I will be taking this bag to my newphew's wedding in August. It is perfect for your IPhone 6 Plus, keys and makeup. It's not too big for a wedding nor to small that you can't put things in. Love this bag."
5.0,I can only wear Birks so these are a nice alternative for cold weather.
5.0,Perfect when we leave town.
5.0,"Bought them to label a large quantity of items that had to have durable waterproof labels, makes it easier to track things when they‚Äôre labeled."
5.0,"This is so pretty, well made, and great price. I can't wear costume jewelry so I made this into a zipper pull and just love it."
5.0,"Loooooooved it! Great colors, if your arms are out of shape, it will be a little tight in the arm. Section so go a size up. I would say go a size up anyway lol. I'm 5'10 and the back covered my shorts but didn't reach my knees."
5.0,"Loose fitting, so comfy, so cute!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this shirt! It's so soft, fits wonderful, if you have larger upper arms, it's a goodie! It's cute, exactly as pictured is what you get, I will definitely buy another one!"
5.0,"Really clever, not that impressive however."
5.0,"Very comfortable, feels just like wearing regular sneakers."

5.0,My 9-year-old is absolutely in love with these shirts they fit her very well and she is very happy to have them she even tries to wear them all the time even to bed!
5.0,My work had got us a single mask and I used it so much the nose piece in it broke. I got these as a replacement and I love them. They‚Äôre fairly lightweight fabric but they do have a filter pocket and come with a filter already in them. I love that the ear pieces are adjustable and don‚Äôt have tons of leftover strings hanging by your ears. It has the nosepiece which is a necessity if you have to wear glasses. Great product!
5.0,"Very happy with my purchase, it only took two weeks, instead  three. It's a medium, but it fits loose, not too small. And it's crochet, so it stretches. I plan to buy more colors. It's well made and really cute."
5.0,"LOVE! I definitely recommend this item, super comfy and fits better then I expected. I want to buy every color once they come back in stock in my size."
5.0,"Adorable and made well so far. It cam in and I washed it first and it held up well to a warm cycle in a front loader with gentle detergent. No color bleeding, frayed material, or missing buttons/snaps anywhere. The next test was how it fit which was perfect for my almost 6 month old daughter. Keep in mind she is a bit long for average at 26 inches so I was pleasantly surprised the legs were the perfect length (just a little long so they didn't ride up) and the all around fit was perfect. The material is a soft velvety feel and the santa monogram is so very cute. Would recommend especially for the price."
5.0,This was a very special gift to my wife and she barely takes it off. She thinks its lovely and beautiful :)
5.0,My grandson loves these! No ride ups in the seat or legs and they are soft.
5.0,Super cute and well made! Great deal and true to size.
5.0,awesome i recommend to anyone who needs a medical id braclet
5.0,"I'm 5ft 105 lbs , 34-36B in bra size . Got size S , wish they had XS so it would fit perfectly . Size S is a bit too wide in the chest area . The shoulder straps are adjustable so is the length .<br />Love the fabric , the flow and pockets on the sides come handy for car keys etc ."
5.0,Arrived quickly. Stylish and comfortable.
5.0,Easy to use. Good labels.  App was simple. I haven't experimented with all the different types and fonts.  The case is absolutely necessary. It holds extra labels and instructions.  Good price and delivery was fast.
5.0,Cute & the colors are as vibrant as they are on the internet. I have yet to wear it but I am sure it will be a Fun-dancing dress!
5.0,I loved these shorts from the moment I put them on. They come up high and hold things in place. I love their length. I love that the fabric is tight on my legs but has stretch so that I can get into low squats comfortably. I‚Äôm a fitness instructor and love working out in these abs recommend them to others. I‚Äôve had mine for almost a year now and they still fit great and there is no pilling of fabric or anything!
5.0,I love these earrings. I‚Äôm usually not 100% satisfied with earrings I buy online however these check all the boxes. They‚Äôre light & well crafted and very detailed. They look more expensive than they are.
5.0,"These look very nice. The aqua colored ones were definitely on point since this is such a popular color currently. I liked the red, white and blue colors myself. We used them as a incentive/reward to the women who attended a ladies' meeting at our church, where the theme was a nautical one. We gave the bracelets at the first meeting of the year, and we have added a charm for each month's meeting."
5.0,"I love this! The colors are vibrant,  and the bag is big enough for my laptop and books!"
5.0,This has came in handy
5.0,Good product and would buy again. There are others out there though that are good and not as expensive. I have bought bodyglove before though and they last whereas the others have been relatively new purchases.
5.0,Listen to the advice about ordering larger. I wear an 8.5 but ordered this boot in a 10 and it is PERFECT! Super comfortable from day 1. The leather is soft. I‚Äôm buying another pair in black!
5.0,Fits good and cool
5.0,"Used to have a small diamond stud, but it started to hurt when I slept. This earring is great. I don‚Äôt feel it when I sleep.<br />Was surprised at how well it stayed in. Went snorkeling and scuba diving and it didn‚Äôt accidentally come out when I removed my mask (which is impressive).<br />Also, I love how tiny it is. Doesn‚Äôt catch on anything like a hairbrush or clothes."
5.0,Super cute pajamas only thing the sizing is not right. I ordered a xl but the pants fit more like a medium
5.0,very comfortabl4e and stay put
5.0,I love it!! Fabric feels soft
5.0,"NIce stone. It is a bit on the small side, but would make a great gift for a young girl or teenager. The vendor is cares about their customer and they follow-up on shipments quickly. Impressed with vendor and product."
5.0,"I have probably 10+ pairs of Fitflops. I love them. I have plantar fasciitis and these are the most comfortable and supportive shoes that are cute that I‚Äôve been able to find. They do run big. I wear an 8.5-9 in every other shoe I‚Äôve ever owned but wear and 8 in Fitflops. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs their boots, tennis shoes or sandals, they are all consistent in size. They run wide too so if you have a really narrow foot, they probably won‚Äôt work well for you. The standard flip flop style tends to be a little tighter but generally they are wide. I don‚Äôt have a wide foot; they‚Äôre pretty average and I don‚Äôt mind the wider shoe. I can‚Äôt tolerate tight shoes so these work great for me!"
5.0,Love the earrings.. well made and very pretty..
5.0,Everyone is jealous if the wallet I purchased for my husband!
5.0,"Love it, perfect to use as a wallet of a small purse to run and make a quick trip with. Lots of room and great material"
5.0,"I bought a medium and it fit well. I'm hourglass, 185, and dd. If you have bigger hips go up one size maybe. The zipper stops were the straps are but it's so comfortable, stretches, and looks great!"
5.0,love this  thank you will buy another
5.0,item came exactly how described. would like to see how they hold up.
5.0,fun to wear long with easy care
5.0,"I ordered this for my husband.  The quality is nice, but only wish there were more pockets for cards."
5.0,"Bought this for my son, fits great, he uses it for work as security."
5.0,Ordered these last week on Sunday and received them Wednesday. Fit nicely though had ordered blck/black and received blacl/grey. Company was quick to respond and shipped out the correct pair and let me keep the other pair sent by mistake.  The gloves overall fit nicely a little snug but that's fine. Completely happy with my order and will order these again when need be
5.0,So happy with this purchase. Ordered an xl for a comfy fit. It‚Äôs perfect!
5.0,They are just what my husband was looking for !!
5.0,"I‚Äôm very happy with these leggings. They‚Äôre not sweat wicking, but they‚Äôre opaque and very comfortable and I can bend over without giving people a peep show. Will definitely be buying these again."

5.0,"Granddaughter loved this as swimsuit coverup, then used as robe"
5.0,"My favorite shirt. Nice and lon . But it is very roomy, looks great and very slimming"
5.0,Nice product great price
5.0,Very good quality. Ears stand up very well. Definitely worth the money.good heavy fabric. Fits an average size woman's head in a size Lg.hat is lined. Glad I ordered this one rather than less expensive ones.
5.0,Great look and very good quality at a super price.
5.0,"It fits perfect, the material is perfect, their was two extra pads for protection. The colors are bright and beautiful."
5.0,"I wore the black dress today for the first time and loved it... it's not too hot, comfy with a bit of stretch, flattering. I'm around 240 lbs, 5'9"", and the XL was a good fit. Wish it came in more colors! This is the perfect work dress for a teacher!"
5.0,Very nice locket necklace. Dainty and perfect for a young girl.
5.0,I love the feel of the top. Was a little big but will probably shrink in the first wash before wearing. So glad it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap like most clothing bought online.
5.0,"I like the watch band, it‚Äôs very pretty.  It seems a little snug but also seems to have stretched a little bit since I‚Äôve been wearing it."
5.0,"These are great. Really beautiful. At first I thought they might be too blingy for everyday, but they're not. The stones are small enough that they don't look overpowering. Another great thing about them is that they have straight posts. Most stainless steel huggies have curved posts, which I think are harder to wear. These are so easy to put on and take off."
5.0,Perfect for mother‚Äôs day. She hasn‚Äôt taken it off her wrist since she got it!
5.0,Great xmas present for the kids
5.0,I love this top.  I also have the tan one.  They are so warm and soft.  Fit nice too. I love Legendary Whitetails.

5.0,Super value and so cute!
5.0,Very nice band. Just what I wanted.
5.0,Just what I was looking for to go in my beach house. Has that bygone Era appeal to it.  Matches my decor very well.
5.0,"Watch came in fast. Quality is amazing, good weight, and keeps time well. Perfect watch for any ocasion. Husband loves it."
5.0,This is one of the most comfortable and stylish shirts I've gotten on amazon. I always get compliments on it.
5.0,Comodos. Livianos. Sugerencia.  Pedir otro color diferente a negro... con el sol calienta mucho... sin desmerecer todo<br />.lo anterior
5.0,"I'm very happy with these earrings. They are what I expected from the description and they look nice. I do wish the post was just a little bit longer but other than that, they are perfect."
5.0,Sweet. Thanks
5.0,Before purchasing this I was alittle nervous reading all the reviews on here. I was surprised when I got the package and opened it to reveal an extremely stretchy dress. I am 5‚Äô2 and weigh 165 pounds and this fit me and there was more room in every portion of the dress. It is going to be perfect for my work Christmas party. The dress is cute and looked as it did in the picture
5.0,"The print is like a photo! So cool! I bough a large thinking these would run small because they are leggings and I didn't want people to see my underwear while I was playing roller derby. BUT turns out they are true to size and a large was too big. I have a pretty big butt for my size so I was a little suprised, usually I have to buy large or xl. I'm 5'2 and 135."
5.0,"As long as you are careful with the sizing chart, this is a nice shirt.  Looks good and feels good."
5.0,"I bought these for my daughters and they are beautiful! We really love them. Perfect for anniversary, birthday, Christmas, Valentine‚Äôs Day or just to say I love you in many languages. If you are thinking about getting one go on and order it. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,Cute shoes. Look like good quality for price. About 1/2 size smaller than my daughter‚Äôs true size.
5.0,Great product for a reasonible price !
5.0,"My daughter loves these!! They don‚Äôt pull her hair, and they are super cute. Other reviews said they weren‚Äôt adjustable so I was a little worried, but they actually can be easily adjusted! My daughter is a very petite 5 year old, and these fit great"
5.0,I get compliments all the time on this comfy blouse. Perfect fit. I have washed this many times and upholds beautifully.
5.0,"These are absolutely perfect. Although it doesn't show in the product picture, they are mirrored. I bought the rose gold pair and they arrived in a beaten-up box, but the glasses themselves were well-protected. For only a few dollars, these glasses are definitely worth it! I also let my friends try them on and they go with any face shape (mine is round)."
5.0,Perfect replacement item that works as good as original Samsung band.
5.0,"I wanted the pink one badly enough to order a large when the chart told me no. It is too big but I love the sweater so much I came back for an olive one in Medium. For reference, I am 5' 0"", weight unknown and I like it that way ;), size 12 jeans, 42 D on top so most sweaters make me feel like a cow. Not this one, I think because it is larger and drapey-er. It comes down to mid thigh which works for me since I only wear leggings with tall boots and long sweaters.  I think I would size down 1 size even if you want the slouchy, comfy look. I will update my review if something awful should happen to it in the wash or during normal wear."
5.0,i would purchase again !
5.0,It Fits perfect. Smooth fabric.

5.0,"Quality of this product was great, the hat was just over sized."
5.0,"The necklace arrived on time,  and then a battle ensued as to whether or not to wrap it up for a Christmas  Gift for a special client and friend.  It is absolutely beautiful and my decision to give  rather than keep it was obviously the right thing to do  as she also loves it"
5.0,Hold firmly washes very nice . Wear alone or under a shirt
5.0,"These socks seem very well made. They fit perfectly. And they're very comfortable. They take longer to dry than other socks made of cotton. Nevertheless, I got rid of all of my other socks and got more of these. Overall, I highly recommend them."
5.0,I like that they were light and the color is pretty
5.0,Exactly as described. Very good quality
5.0,The perfect size and length.  My new favorite necklace!
5.0,Great gift for the chef and Star Wars fan. Great for the grill or cooking in the kitchen.
5.0,A#
5.0,I love it! I got it for my mom for Christmas for sentimental reasons and I was hesitant because the price was so good that it'd be cheaply made or something but its honestly beautiful and I don't think it'll break off! Super happy about it! I think she'll love it too!
5.0,Nice ruffles bikini setsÔºÅI love the ruffles and tie front design.
5.0,I have Scleroderma and my fingers are curled and deformed. I cannot wear regular dish washing gloves but these are a God sent! I have looked everywhere for something like this and was so happy to find them here. I wish they would make the same glove without the scrubber so I could have both.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:96b0b1fff43aa4823bff2f6e550f01fb]] The PY BLING Hip Hop Men‚Äôs Cuban Link Chain Choker is the very best iced out 18K plated choker. The video shows the super strong choker on table.

5.0,The Luther's Seal cross from Enlightened Expressions is great! The pendant is a good size and the finish is good quality
5.0,"I love this and to our surprise it matches our daughters hair color perfectly!  I like that is it is not a full wig, therefore not hot."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:80715d49002d0048ca3b3a978264150]] Just shines so much and hasn‚Äôt irritated my neck at all. Wear it everyday still same as day I got it.
5.0,"This is a great pair of pants for lounging around in or even for an informal visit to the friends'.  My size is XXL, so these pants run a bit small for me, but it is still pretty comfortable.  I love the medley of fabrics."

5.0,This two pack of earrings are cute.  Very hip and bohemian. Fun to wear.
5.0,"Fits well, very comfy"
5.0,Super pretty in person. This romper has a lot of details and texture that don't translate into photos well. It is made of a dressy material and is very light and flowy. It is lovely
5.0,"A fun, dazzling item at a great price."
5.0,"Fits me like a glove. I‚Äôm 5ft , 110lbs. Usually wearing a size 2 or 4 in pants and a small on top. It‚Äôs tea length for me and I might have it shortened a bit. Also gonna add another layer of lining because it‚Äôs quite see through as others have mentioned. Amazing for the price !!!!"
5.0,I use them for my work pants to fasten my suspenders. Their the only thing I‚Äôv Got to stay put and do what they‚Äôre supposed to.
5.0,Couldn‚Äôt have been any better than I was hoping for!!

5.0,"I got this necklace as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, and she's very happy with it. The pendant itself is kinda small, but its very pretty. I particularly like the two-tone color scheme; the silver metal with the black zirconia crystals complement each other nicely. It makes a great gift, and its relatively inexpensive."

They will also be perfect for there Gym bags to have there clothes in and stuff.  I will be buying these bags again!
5.0,Bands are exact replacements. The watch looks great back on my wrist. Use an' exacto' knife or a razor blade to cut the old bands off the screws. Penetrating oil and small pliers are needed to extract the little shoulder bolts/screws out of the watch body.  Use the pliers to install the screws and your done. Easy peazey!
5.0,"nice looking, well made! Happy with purchase."
5.0,"Purchased this as a gift for my husband who is always whining that he is cold, even inside when the heat is set to 70.  Was elated to find heated apparel as a hoodie as opposed to a jacket so he could wear it all the time.  Havent heard him whine since Christmas and my gas bill has been given a reprieve.  It was a gift for both of us."
5.0,My little sister absolutely loved this
5.0,Excellent scarf! Color was accurate
5.0,Next time i'll size up but i love it!

5.0,fits very well. my husband works outside and he loves it
5.0,Put it on my delfonics pouch love it !!!
5.0,I love my skirt set and the small fits very well!
5.0,"I ordered these too large for my son, and he wound up insisting on wearing them for well over two years now.  He is obsessed with them, and they have withstood the occasional toddler tantrum that occurs upon return to the great indoors when the little one wanted to remain outside.  I suspect these are getting too small for my growing child now, but he insists that they are not and has continued to wear them.  Despite years of abuse, there are no tears nor unusual wear issues.  The decorative buckles have been plucked off in tantrums over the years, but the amount of use these have gotten is truly insane.  He also gets so many compliments on these, and I‚Äôll be ordering another pair a couple, two, three sizes up for spring.  My child insistEd on wearing these in the snow sometimes, and it‚Äôs good to have extra room to layer socks since these are not insulated.  That should not be a dealbreaker though because these are just really, insanely, very good boots!"
5.0,I loved these glasses! I wore them until they were so scratched I couldn't see. Super cute and I always got compliments on them!
5.0,This is a nice replica if the Olympic rings.  It is bight shiny silver and a nice weight.  The adjustable chain allows for lengthening or shortening as needed.
5.0,"While purchasing I was skeptical, but when received, I was just amazed by the quality it has for such a lower price.<br />It fits perfectly and I really liked the length of the dress which comes to the knee.<br />I would recommend to have it."
5.0,I really loved this color.
5.0,"ove these pants. They fit and are so, so comfortable. I wore them on a recent flight and had no complaints. Can I get them in black and navy?"
5.0,This dress fitted exactly üíØ as expected.  I partied 4 hours straight very comfortably.  I felt like the Belle of the Ball and received compliments all night long.
5.0,They are soft yet warm. I love the stripes and I am going to buy another pair with different stripe colors.
5.0,"when you purchase this beautiful outfit, be sure to review the description before you add to cart<br />medium descripton is 33 1/2&quot; inseam - therefore if you are 5'6 or under this pant will be too long for you.<br /><br />i believe this outfit is strictly true to size, and really gives no room to stray"

5.0,I like the flight bag.  It easily carriesall of my important flight gear
5.0,Exactly as described.  Quick shipping.  Buy with confidence!
5.0,"This is a GREAT shirt. I got the xs size for my 3.5 year old. She's 41-42in tall, and about 37-38 pounds, and this is big but not HUGE, and long but not TOO long. My daughter has a long torso, so I actually like the longer cut! Going to buy a few more!"
5.0,"Although it is made in japan, it still fits a little larger on my head than I'd like. However, some of that is due to not being worthy to helm the Kinnikuman legacy. I mean, let's face it-- I'm not going to winning the Chojin Olympics anytime soon..."
5.0,Love the thickness & soft jean material....can be dressed up or down! Great buy!
5.0,I would buy them again!!
5.0,Love it! It fits perfect & looks great! The only issue is that my kitty turns around so I'll figure out a way to fix that but I love it!
5.0,My wife loved it.  Great prise
5.0,Beautiful. Inside has zipper pocket on one side and pocket pouch on the other.
5.0,I love this pants they look wonderful
5.0,Nice looking hat. Fits perfectly.
5.0,The gloves began to unravel. However my had were still warm
5.0,I always get so many compliments whenever I wear this jumpsuit!
5.0,I really like the way this top fits it looks great with jeans or leggings perfect length nights fit on the shoulders  Great fabric to I would definitely recommend this
5.0,"I purchased these for my daughter's 6th birthday. She loved them, however they were a little big. I would recommend these for the 8 years or older for size.<br />The quality is very nice. Better than expected for the low price.<br />Assembly is easy.<br />You get a good amount for the price.<br />I would purchase these again and from the company if needed."
5.0,"Cuteee, i love them. You look soo classy with them."
5.0,Love this sweater! Professional yet sexy/flattering. Just love PattyBoutik's stuff.
5.0,"Super pretty dress; great for Easter! Fits as shown, stretchy fabric and of good quality."
5.0,This item worked perfectly as part of my daughters halloween costume. She was very happy with it.
5.0,"I got this for my aunt last year because she was starting to workout and well, she loves it! She even purchased more in her own separate account now haha"
5.0,"Comfortable, durable, and about as good looking as flip flops can be."
5.0,Wonderful bag
5.0,"Love this sweater! It‚Äôs pretty lightweight but I like it like that, love the yellow color, too! 10/10 would buy again"
5.0,"These are amazing especially for the price! Definitely worth it. Great for working out and more. No extra fabric like other leggings often have, very sleek and form fitting."
5.0,"I am a curvy girl, and usually buy an XL in Women's.  I sized down after reading the reviews to L.  The shirt does not just hang on me like the girl in the picture, if it did, I don't think I would like it as much, it would look dumpy.  Watch the video this seller has posted...my shirt fits like the girl in the video.  It is fitted (but not tight) through my hips but loose in waist, and chest.  The arms are the best!  The neck line is loose and casual.  This shirt is so cute, I wore it to work with capri pants and had so many compliments.  I bought two more shirts in different colors.  I wore one with a maxi skirt, and another with shorts.  It can be dressed up or worn casual.  My friend tried my shirt on and she loved it, she ordered one, as well."
5.0,Way smaller that I thought I was going to get and I'm glad. I didn't want another large satchel. This is so cute and the color is a light pink with golden hardware. The handles move freely so if you are using the crossbody strap it doesn't look silly. Inside it has one zippered compartment and one pocket w/o a zipper. The outside also has a slip pocket. The leather is so soft!
5.0,"Nice, light, easy to carry, must not abuse since it is a material that is light weight so it might not be very sturdy"
5.0,Quede muy contento. Voy a comprar mas.<br /><br />Lo recomiendo.
5.0,"I was very surprised at how nicely this jumpsuit fit around the body and the shoulders.  I'm about 160lbs and stand at 5'4. Ordered Large and it fit really well (and quite flattering to one's figure too).  However, the length is quite long for me so I''ll have to get it hemmed, which is not a big deal."
5.0,"A real hit. An attention getter at the party. The color was spot on I and was able to put on without using the zipper. My size is 14, I got a L and was perfect."
5.0,My brother loves the watch. Thanks.
5.0,I prefer these over my adidas striped leggings! These make me feel so free and are definitely squat proof. They don‚Äôt dig in my sides yet stay up at all times unlike my other workout leggings. I also bought a pair of gym shark leggings and find myself wearing these more although they are both great. No regrets. :) also look good as new after washing a few times. Will be buying more colors.
5.0,Love it!! Just what I wanted!!
5.0,"Fits great, not too wide or short!! :)"
5.0,I like the quality of these leggings a lot. They fit true to size and I like how high waisted they are. I definitely want the matching top to have the whole set!
5.0,"Exactly as described, blouse is darling, I love it. If you are on the fence about purchasing, place in your cart!"
5.0,"Being an analog audio guy, this design was perfect for me.  The mask fits well and stays on my nose.  Other masks I've tried tend to slide down.  The material is thick and I have to pinch it just right to breathe easily."
5.0,"This is soft, comfortable and hardly wrinkled  right out of the bag. Colors are not like the photo when I ordered but in the same family and crisp. Took a while to arrive but it made it.  Will be one of my favorite tops."
5.0,"Bought these for a Key West vacation, they were awesome.  Fit well, lots of pockets for carrying the needed items when heading out for the entire day.<br />They look sharp, had a number of compliments on them from the group.<br />Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"I just couldn't decide if I should choose this or something a little more subtle that was archery based, but my husband got it for me for Christmas, and it was beautiful, and classy, and and it wasn't big and gawdy. It's just the right size."
5.0,Very pretty. Bought them for my mom and if she asks and they are available in other colors i will buy them for her.
5.0,"I ordered a medium, fits nicely."
5.0,My daughter enjoys this pullover. However it's not very thick.
5.0,"For my daughter perfect, looked very nice."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:42059fb728a1485c9b8ab1221d81f49e]] I am loving this hard glasses case. I broke the plastic one I had. I probably stepped on or dropped it. More likely dropped it and then stepped on it.<br />This one is definitely a hard case. It has that slams shut feature. Make sure your glasses fit before you close itü§£.  These are my driving glasses so I don't wear them all the time. I needed a bright color I could see because I get very frustrated when I need to be someplace and I can't find my glasses. This has been perfect for me. Strongly recommend especially if you are as clumsy as I can be.
5.0,Beautiful finish and well constructed!
5.0,"Very nice, good quality earrings!"
5.0,Love these glasses. Purchased a pair for my sister. She loved them. Great gift idea and you don't have to know anyone's size
5.0,"Thought these for fun and retro, I purchased a matching polka dot iphone case! Fun and fashionable at the same time :)"
5.0,"Bought two, one grey and one black. They are beautiful, very dressy and comfortable."
5.0,"Looks expensive , nice for the price"
5.0,Liked style and color of the hat
5.0,Worked well for my son who is age 10 but in the 90th percentile for weight and height for his age.
5.0,I like the product. Keeps me warm on cold weather
5.0,Beautiful extremely pleased<br />A++
5.0,"Absolutely darling little purse, and it will be so much fun when I carry it around.  It's big enough to put plenty in it, yet it is still light weight and that's what I was looking for."
5.0,Since I‚Äôve had this bracelet I‚Äôm so energized
5.0,Fits my 10 year old just right.
5.0,I needed sleeveless shirts for the office that look professional and this does! I laundered it normally and it looked great afterwards. I ordered my normal size and it fits exactly as I like. It‚Äôs soft and not thick material so it‚Äôs not too warm on an 80 degree day. I wear this with a cardigan since I‚Äôd never wear sleeveless shirts and I really like the look of it. It‚Äôa perfect for office casual. It seems well made and the brightness of the shirt isn‚Äôt reduced from laundering.
5.0,Adds fun to my sweater!
5.0,I ordered a number of bracelets for myself and as gifts. They are very pretty and the price was great.
5.0,Fast delivery. These were a gift and very good quality. Would buy again.
5.0,"I got both the white and the grey.  I probably could've made them better myself, but they are cheap and effective.  I don't know what anyone expects from a $2.00 hand tube.  I like them for what they're worth.  I ordered them about two weeks ago and they were due on the 25th considering they were coming from overseas but I got them on the 15th which is pretty good.  I'll update t.his review in a couple months to tell how they hold up after awhile."
5.0,These are GREAT! Super soft. They are<br />Thinner but fit well and I wear them all the darn time!
5.0,exactly what he wanted.
5.0,It prettier than I expected.
5.0,Exactly what I expected and it's a great starter watch.
5.0,Muy buena para sudar con mis ejercicios y para traer mi celular sercas muy buena
5.0,"I got these for a friend and they are just the coolest thing. Just as described, and good quality. I think they're a great way to say &#34;I'm a Harry Potter Fan.&#34; My friend did say that some of her friends asked her, &#34;is that the symbol for the Illuminati?&#34; but I think those were just ignorant non-potterheads."
5.0,Easy to set up and now I have all my purses organized and easy tonsee
5.0,"I want 10 of these, so cute and compact but classy and great for gifts"
5.0,Great buy!  Perfect to wear in hot or cold weather.  Will definitely purchase more.
5.0,"I just received these sunglasses yesterday and boy oh boy do these make a statement. These are unique sunglasses that make me look like I take the extra step into my attire. I don't feel basic at all. And within one hour of wearing these, I got so many compliments. I feel like a million bucks wearing these shades. Now, back to quality. These are lightweight and very comfortable to wear. It is so comfortable to the point it feels like I'm wearing air. As far as the look, it is like wear a mirror, very super reflective. Which is what I love! I want to get another pair in blue. People may say &#34;OH THEY ARE FRAGILE&#34; yada yada blah blah, but sunglasses are not meant to be sat on or thrown around. Take care of them, they will take care of you. Period."
5.0,Great product. Just as described. Fast shipment!!! I just did not like they way they fit me.
5.0,These are a ton of fun for kids to mix & match. They‚Äôre a great party favor!!
5.0,I love love love it very much. It is perfect.
5.0,These are beautiful ! There just the right size .
5.0,Dress was very cute and fit great- nice comfortable summer dress
5.0,No problems. Works well.
5.0,"I love it! just fit perfect beacuse I first checked the comments, love the fabric and the style, same as picture."
5.0,"This blanket scarf is very large and soft. It will be perfect for different styles... you could even use it as a small blanket if you were out and got cold. I have to say, the color is a bit lighter than I expected, but it still looks nice."
5.0,They were cute for my granddaughter for Halloween.
5.0,"I love this dress. So flattering and stretchy. Enough covering in the boobs, but gives some cleavage also. Makes the butt look great. I'm about 5'5. Maybe 160? But athletic build with a lot of my weight in my hips, thighs, and butt. Size large"
5.0,"These really do control foot odor, especially in leather shoes."
5.0,"I love these!! Nice colors, and they have more than one size in the package, so you have options. I have sensitive ears and these did not irritate them at all. Will purchase again"
5.0,Love love love these sunglasses got about 4 pair in different colors
5.0,my wife love loves it thank u
5.0,These glasses are perfect for driving at night and driving in the rain. They reduce the glare of headlights and clear the view in heavy rain and even fog. I do not know if they fit over other glasses because I wear them by themselves. They are large so I would think they would fit over other glasses.  A friend with cataracts just purchased a pair and she said they helped so much she rarely takes them off.  I would (and will) purchase them again.
5.0,I love the ease of slip on and off versus the original buckle attachment on my charge2. It is perfect for exercise with the breathable material. My skin is sensitive and the salty perspiration from intense aerobics was causing a rash and the problem was solved with the breathable stretchy solo loop. I highly recommend it.
5.0,"I purchased these to wear as pajamas and could not be happier with them. They are incredibly soft and are a perfect length ( I am 5'8 and often find that bottoms like these tend to ride up). I normally wear a large but purchased the XL to have them fit a tad looser, the length of the top hits below the waist. I would suggest sizing up unless you truly plan to wear them underneath clothing. All in all a great buy!"
5.0,It his is my first Dooney and Borke purse. I absolutely love this purse. It is small and compact just like I wanted. The leather is soft. It is a true cross body bag. Love!
5.0,These are so comfy and soft!
5.0,"Cute, washable- I take it to the cleaners for starching."
5.0,"I love this tsHirt dress. It is so soft and comfy. I had previously bought it in green and bought another in burgundy. Great value! Great quality! I bought a size 4x bigger than my usual, but I wanted it extra roomy as I am bedbound."
5.0,Very nice well made. Great price.
5.0,"I love this cardigan! The quality is nice, not super thick sweater material but not the thin, cheap stuff. It‚Äôs comfortable, warm and the milky color is super cute!"
5.0,Our five year old went to Cinderella‚Äôs castle in Disney. This dress was perfect for her for the event. She was the cutest there and we have a special picture of her in her dress with Cinderella. Dress fit well and was well made
5.0,"Love this dress, fit is perfect and the fabric is so soft. This dress really flatters your figure! No complaints"
5.0,loved the romper but the bow had no use ... didn't have the clip for clip it on hair nor was it a head band
5.0,It‚Äôs a little long if you‚Äôre 5‚Äô 4‚Äù without shoes. But was perfect for a barefoot beach wedding!
5.0,Perfect fit and high-quality! Great price!
5.0,The size is just right..they show up without taking over...go with every thing-day or night...plus being a quality earring they are light weight. I wear them often- like a go to earring.
5.0,"I bought the lace to replace the old one. These laces are just what I need, nice quality, great color options. Recommend!"
5.0,Great quality was a gift for my daughter.
5.0,"My first time using lower compression socks, and love them!"
5.0,"Used them all summer so far so good. Relatively easy to assemble by myself.  I keep it closed when not in use just in case, used 2x50 lbs sand to hold it down, no issues so far it survived a couple of very windy storms. The color faded a bit but I had expected that.  My suggestion/recommendation is to put wheels on them if you plan/want to move them around to change the area to be shaded (as I had to do)"
5.0,Ears stand up well. It's comfy and looks super cute with my Louise outfit. They are a lighter pink that is shown in the photo but they are awesome.
5.0,"As others have said, large! But also a good weight. I've been wearing them all day and my gamer friends love them.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant, and the simple design both gets the point across and perfectly shows someone jumping through a portal. NOW, whether they're jumping through your head, or AROUND it, is up to you... :D"
5.0,Very cute! Fast shipping too.
5.0,"Got this for my son's girlfriend for homecoming. Its so pretty, & something she can keep forever. Great quality and price!"
5.0,"These briefs were very well-packaged, each pair comes in a separate, high-quality presentation pack.  The legs do not ride up your thighs during the day, like many other boxer briefs do.  The material is quite comfortable and does not retain moisture like cotton briefs.  I like the fly opening on the top, it does not gape open like some fly openings on the side tend to.  I'm happy with this purchase, A++"
5.0,"Great product, well made!!!!!!"
5.0,Love the way the pants feel and fit! Highly recommended!
5.0,Needed something a little smaller than the other wallet I ordered was way to big ...
5.0,"I gave these pencil socks to my 11-year-old granddaughter, and she absolutely loves them.  She put them on immediately, wore them all evening, and then to school next day.  They are a great concept and a perfect fit, at least for an average-sized 11-year-old."
5.0,Fits perfectly. Couldn't be happier.
5.0,Got it for 3 dollars and worth for the money. Only thing it's not fit tightly to the head or to my head.<br />It will look stylish and thin.
5.0,Quality product and prompt shipping.
5.0,Really Pretty! I like this one a lot! Worth the money!
5.0,Very durable. I have super tiny wrists and it fits me fine. It was very easy to put on my watch as well.
5.0,I wear a seven and I bought a 6 1/2 because they didn't have the color I wanted in my size.  The 6 1/2 was fine.  Not too small.
5.0,my sister love it. nice shoes.
5.0,I really like that it feels soft and not itchy.
5.0,"I bought this for my teenage daughter for her birthday. She wore it to her party and she looked so adorable! At one point she thought it would be funny to make me wear it. Her mistake, because I didn‚Äôt want to take it off! Pushing the ‚Äúears‚Äù button is oddly addictive.  Silly for an adult, but it apparently answered some deep longing inside me. Lol. Buy it for yourself or for someone else as a gift. You‚Äôll be glad you did!"
5.0,"Absolutely love this!! Not confident how the color will wash, but, I love this sweatshirt..."
5.0,Love this shirt.  Fits great!
5.0,"Great sound Looks Good Battery life stays charged , I used through a 12 hr shift without having to plug it in."
5.0,It is the best brand for ballet clothes!
5.0,I too have plantar fasciitis and love the good arch support of these cute sandals. These are my 3rd pair of Vionic and  I slip them on as soon as I get out of bed.  The price is also a great deal as they usually run about double. I usually wear an 8W and these fit great.  I do find over time the strap stretches and I might get away with an 8M but with my high arches/instep I order the 8W.
5.0,"My husband was so happy with this, is really good quality and fits perfectly."
5.0,"I love these glasses, very classy.  Nice price as well.  No issues so far."
5.0,"I love that it's not metal, that means it's going to last me forever I love it it's so pretty when you buy it is going to make u as happy as it did me"
5.0,Travelled to England in April my son was 11 months. I put these on him right before take off and before decent to and from Ameeica and they dis what they were supposed to do. He didnt mind them as long as it was short periods of time he had them on.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS TOP! the day I got it I wore it :) it is fresh, the colors are perfect and the size is exact as it says on the chart. I weight 118 and 5'2 and order size S and as you can tell on the pictures it fits great and looks great. I ordered the black one but I want to get the other colors too."
5.0,Love this bathing suit!!! Great fit and coverage!!! I wear a US 6/8 got their XXL. I had been looking for a bathing suit like this for a very long time....especially with a high back. Its perfect!<br />I did get this product at a discounted rate for my honest opinion.
5.0,I love the design (ala Omega chronograph) that is a solid and a very well make watch.
5.0,Really cute bathing suit!
5.0,Really lovely product. Can't wait to wear them.
5.0,This top is so comfy and fit well. I normally wear a 2x but opted to size up just in case and it fit perfect. The sleeves are a bit long but I have shorter arms. Just roll the cuffs up and it works great.
5.0,I love both! Love the color! Came fast!!! Cute!!!
5.0,"This dress is a perfect fit! I am 5 feet 5inches 145 pounds, and I bought a size"
5.0,"Great value and beautiful dress. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments, and will definitely buy more. :) I wore this to the beach - fit right in. Wore this to work (albeit from home) - fit right in. I‚Äôd totally wear this any wear."
5.0,This watch is beautiful. Looks better in person. I wanted this watch because of the step counter but the mobile app doesn‚Äôt sync up with my health app in my phone. Kinda of a bummer but takes nothing away from this quality product.
5.0,It has an elastic band waist which does stretch to fit me and that‚Äôs why even though it was a little smaller than expected it fit fine.  I was most impressed with the quality for the price.  I‚Äôm thinking about buying another one in a different color.
5.0,Very cute and soft. My 7 year old granddaughter loved it.
5.0,Ordered this chocker for my maternity shoot and I loveddddd it!!!! Shipping was fast and item was great
5.0,The lady friend loves them ü§£
5.0,"Fits like it says it does, and nice colors!"
5.0,"I bought these to give as party gifts for my daughter's sixth birthday. It was a tea party and we handed them out as her guest arrived. They all had matching headbands which made for really cute pictures, and the parents appreciated not getting more candy to take home. Good quality, nice colors and great value."
5.0,I'm a size 14-16 and I bought the XL.  This was the right size for me.  These yoga pants are nice and thick spandex. No see through. They are long enough to reach my ankles. They seem quite comfortable. There is a little pocket on the left side in the waistband.  Handy little feature. I'm please with this product and I would purchase them again.  They arrived quickly and we're just as described.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was offered this product either free or at a reduced cost in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. The opinions expressed are my own. I have no connection with the seller other than being an Amazon buyer. If you find this review beneficial to you please like my review.  Happy shopping!
5.0,"This product is inexpensive, looks good and can be used efficiently."
5.0,These are the best leggings I‚Äôve bought in a long time. The fit is so perfect!!!! I need every color. I bought mine in a XL.
5.0,"So far, I love this handbag. It has a lot of room and I have gotten several complements.  The large pocket holds all of my stuff that i frequently access, while the two slimmer pockets on the sides contain my lip gloss, hair ties and other smaller items."
5.0,"This is a great dress. It fits well on a curvy person. I got a medium and it is snug but fits well. I‚Äôm 34DD in the bust and fill the dress out about right, so a smaller bust may not work in this dress"
5.0,This scarf is soft to the touch and lightweight but still large enough to add warmth. The tassels add some texture and fun.  I'd consider buying another in a different color/pattern because this is a good size and weight for all seasons.
5.0,"This fits me perfectly. I am 36B, 5'6&#34;, 135lbs. I bought size Medium in emerald. The coulor suits me because I am medium skin tone and olive. It is a bit cheeky at the butt than my other swimsuits. But I am keeping it because the material is nice and the lace at the front gives a little something to the suit."
5.0,Good quality leather. Secure packaging. Comfortable and stylish.
5.0,"liked the band pins excellent idea, perfect works great"
5.0,Perfect fit. I normaly wear a us womens m/Asian XXL(jackets). I love so much i bought it in the white. I have not washed it yet.
5.0,"They do fit a bit snug, but you can't get tummy control without snug. Look great! Fabric has some weight to it. They shouldn't wear thin anytime soon!"
5.0,"Perfect, exactly what I wanted"
5.0,Super cute!! Im 5'11 and 180lbs..I bought a XXL..I'm a 36D..fits great..a little loose but that's what I wanted because I wear a cami underneath..
5.0,"I ordered this dog tag for my grandson and he, being the MOST impatient kid in the world, drove me crazy every day ""is it here yet?"" and I would reply, ""no, they said it would be here Saturday"".  Lo and behold, it's Saturday and here it was.  Really good value for the money, reliable company, impressive packing (box inside a jewelry bag).  I would not hesitate to order again from them."
5.0,Awesome boots! My sister definetely rocked it in one of the concerts that she attended and it came back in perfect condition! Really durable and would recommend it!
5.0,"This band is so comfortable that I don't take it off to workout. It's thin and though the pink clashes a bit with the rose gold bevel plating on my watch, it still looks pretty. I like to match my bands to my outfits so I change them out quite often. This one is super easy to switch up. Definitely going to get more colors."
5.0,"Very comfortable, exactly what I wanted.  Was unsure since it said one size fits all and I am short.  The stretch is wonderful.  I can see how it would fit short and tall alike."
5.0,"Super versatile - I throw this on over cute sleeveless dresses, jeans and a t-shirt, as a warm up layer for before/after yoga. I did laundry today just to wear this, so I think I'm justified in buying another one. Not super plush, it's definitely a thinner sweater material, but I think that's what makes it so generally useful. Highly recommend!"
5.0,I have worn big Apple hats for years paying $50.00 a piece this a great value and I am  very pleased with the price and the excellent quality Amazon really delivered this time.
5.0,I needed a dress last minute for a wedding and this was perfect! Flattering and comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and the dress hit in all the right spots. I ordered both the green and cyan to try on and the colors are gorgeous! Great buy.
5.0,"Perfect fit for my sausage fingers. Thickness is good, feels like, will hold up very well. Add to it that the design is cute and maybe cleaning the commode won‚Äôt be such a chore! Ok let‚Äôs not be crazy it‚Äôs still going to be a chore but I‚Äôll look sort of cute doing it!"
5.0,"Very well made and comfortable pants. If you look bootcut, you'll love these."
5.0,Nice littel purse when a big one is to much.
5.0,I truly love it. Will be ordering another soon as a gift
5.0,fit perfect it's St. Patty's once a week.
5.0,"I received the pasties in a very nice well-sealed box and each set was packed individually. Each shape is well cut and the material, black an nude, is very soft to the touch, sober and elegant with a slight shine and no sheer that resembles the materials used in underwear. The pasty stays in position  without problem and conceals the nipple. Overall the product is satisfactory. The only warning I would like to add is to be aware of the measures of the pasty before purchase specially for people with wide areola as it might not cover it completely."
5.0,"I received the black jacket in size 4 & to my surprise, it was similar to my Lululemon Define jacket! It is so flattering on and I love pairing it with my workout fit to the gym. I also wear it when I'm at the hospital when my Lulu's one is washing. So happy with this one! The only thing is it runs small and I would suggest sizing up though because it is a bit of a snug if I wanted to zip up."
5.0,Very satisfied wth the robe
5.0,"I really enjoy this for yoga. I tend to like to spend as mush time adjusting my clothes as breathing when practicing, and so a leotard limits my need to do that. I found this one comfortable and light. It‚Äôs fairly thin, and may not be your top choice for full coverage, but it has great stretch and is wearing well."
5.0,so very comfortable!  I get so many compliments on these shoes. I wore them all day in vegas and I didn't even hurt afterwards
5.0,They do the job! Decent sturdiness for cardboard glasses. Lenses can stop be used once the cardboard is torn.
5.0,"The size fit perfectly, they are soft inside and the kids love them!"
5.0,muy recomendable. Buena calidad
5.0,So cute! Perfect for any Spider-Man kid lover. Hood is adorable and even cones down as a 1/2 mask.
5.0,"Comfy top, good sleeve length! I am 5'10 so this matters!  Looking forward to wearing this fall. There's no stretch (IMO) but overall, I still really like it. Comfy, flattering fit. Will be nice to walk outside in! :)"
5.0,ordered for a gift - they loved it
5.0,"Beautiful set of two wheels of Nail Charms and a set of tweezers for placement. These are metal, and will need to be secured with either glue, topcoat, or gel to the nail. They are not adhesive on their own.<br /><br />They look most effective with just one or two nails with a charm, and they are nice, sizable, noticeable, and very festive. They are large, and feature plenty of rhinestones, so they really catch the light. It‚Äôs an easy way to have festive nails for the Holidays.<br /><br />I‚Äôve lost many nail charms, due to not enough adhesion, so take care with. Particularly if you‚Äôre only using regular topcoat to secure them. Glue or gel would be best.<br /><br />Beautiful quality and value, would definitely get these again"
5.0,Grandson has wanted Guy Harvey for some time.  excellent Christmas gift.
5.0,"Really like these, would buy again. Stitching it very high quality, patterned fabric is great. Already jumped in the river with them and they keep my glasses afloat. Got a pair for my wife too. I recommend."
5.0,"The handbag comes nicely wrapped in its own sack bag and covered in a plastic wrap.  Inside the bag, each of the compartments are separated by air packs to ensure safety between the pockets.<br /><br />The bag is made of synthetic leather. However, the feel of the leather is smooth and sturdy. The leather is thick but the weight of the bag is not heavy by any means. The bag also has shoulder straps to be placed on shoulder. The bag has a small lock without a key. The lock is used to enable the lock to secure the zipper pull piece. This is important in order to deter a pick pocketer to maneuver into the bag by opening the zipper. The lock being there causes this opening process to be a two-step process where the lock will need to be pulled down to take the lock out. There is no key but I don‚Äôt think it was intended to be lockable since it takes too much time to open a lock to get to what is needed in the pocket. There is also a middle layer where you can place keys or anything else. This pocket is also zippable. There is also another pocket on the inside attached to the leather part of the bag.  My wife has been getting lots of compliments at work as some see it as a high end bag. The size of the bag is as expected and is not too large or too small. The zippers are operating smoothly. The life of the bag remains to be seen but appears that it will last a long time.<br /><br />Overall, this purse was for my wife and she was happy and liked the quality of the purse as well as the compartments. The price is also in line with what some department stores retail similar lower priced bags. However, to me this bag appears to be a bargain than some of the department stores as it provides great quality for the price.<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or product. I write reviews based on previous experience with similar products. I hope you find this review helpful."
5.0,I love the romper it fitted. Got a lot of compliments on it I gonna order other colors
5.0,Love this case for my bujo/study supplies!! Really big! Maybe not 100 pens fit in it but it still fits a lot of stuff!!
5.0,"Ordered these 14K earrings Expedited for Christmas Eve gift...great service!  Gift receiver loved them!  Wish I could have seen what size though.  Were about 1/2 inch but very pretty.  Would do business again, thanks!"
5.0,Very comfortable and fit like a dream!
5.0,Really beautiful and elegant size
5.0,I love them!  I have already purchased another set of luggage tags in another pattern.  Love them!
5.0,Well made...Love them...
5.0,Looks good and who doesn't need a beer bottle opener belt buckle?  I bought it big so that I could cut it off just to be sure it fit.
5.0,Very soft with a wool lining. They do have a drawstring but it is for looks only. Stretchy waistline and comfortable
5.0,"Pleasant soft material, fits well in a loose style; the side vents give a nice appearance when worn untucked on its own. Sleeves are a little long, the trend these days, so just pull them up.<br /><br />Just note that it is not quite heavyweight as described, I'd call it medium-heavy, but that is fine with me. Definitely not a cheap, thin shirt.<br /><br />I ordered three more."
5.0,I like the four layers in this mask and feel better protected in this than in other masks. It is very adjustable and stays in place once it is adjusted. I have dealt with this company in the past and the customer service is the best I have ever experienced!!
5.0,it was suppose to be a gift but i loved it too much to give away hahaha
5.0,Nice warm pants.  They are think and very soft!!
5.0,"I always thought ‚Äúwhy would you order athletic wear from Amazon?‚Äù If it wasn‚Äôt Lululemon, it wasn‚Äôt good. I recently watched a YouTube video about some of these little-known brands & decided that I was sick of paying $100+ for leggings and half of that for a tank top. So, I ordered a bunch of random things, including these leggings. They‚Äôre actually really great! They have a flattering fit, are nice and high waisted, and seem to be of pretty good quality.<br /><br />For reference, I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù, 138 lbs. I do have to get them hemmed, but honestly when do I NOT have to get something hemmed? They‚Äôre tight enough at the ankles that they don‚Äôt look ridiculous tucked under. They are definitely warm, though, but the fit is just toooooo great so that‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. I may come back in a week and tell you they‚Äôre falling apart, but I really think the quality is going to surprise me and hold up well!"
5.0,"Amazing yoga pants, fits as expected. Mesh design not available anymore, such a bummer."
5.0,"Omg, I love these.  They fit amazing and they look great on me. Will definitely buy another pair."

5.0,"I am 5'3, 175lbs, 36DD, I wear a size 10/12 (decent size ass and thighs. I'm not a small girl!) I ordered an XL based on other reviews. It definitely fits! I do feel like I could have ordered a large and it would have fit a little tighter, but I'm not sure it would have fit my boobs. Overall, a good addition to my lingerie rotation!"
5.0,I'm 5'9&#34; weigh 175lbs and XL fits good.
5.0,Love the boho vibe of this bottom swim cover. Super cute on and the material is super soft. Great price and got some compliments.

5.0,I love this polo shirt it fits great ! And looks good !
5.0,This ring is DAINTY! Exactly what I was looking for. It is cute and delicate but the band has taken some time getting used to because it is not flat. I am VERY happy with it!
5.0,"This dress is fabulous.  I ordered a small.  It fits perfect.  I usually wear a women's size small, or 2-4.  Soft flowy rayon cotton material.  I am ordering another!"

5.0,I cut it to fit Egyptian-style and sewed on loops to fit my ears.  Sewed the sheep ears down to be floppy. I love it. It‚Äôs so cute!
5.0,"My husband and I bought these PJ‚Äôs for a Christmas party. They‚Äôre soft, comfortable, fit true to size, and warm. Not too long either! I also love that they fit high waisted on me to wear with a tank. Been wearing these nonstop!"
5.0,Just what my daughter wanted! She even used in her senior pictures! She was very happy with them
5.0,"They are exactly how they look in the pictures! I have received many compliments already. I purchased these to wear to work and they are perfect! The back clasp (the thing that holds the earring on) is tight, so I am not worried they will fall out while I am changing scrubs at work!! I highly recommend, and with the price, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG!!!!"
5.0,"Cute print, the material feels thin but feels durable and keeps you cool while exercising. I normally wear a small or medium and the small was a bit snug, so a medium prob would have been best. If you are between sizes, size up. Love the high waist and phone pocket."
5.0,"I am not a thin gal...about a 16. I was pleasantly surprised that this fit so well and looked so good on. Very sexy, which is what I was hoping for."
5.0,Great fit. I leave one in the car and on my motorcycle so I don't forget to have one. Thanks.

5.0,"My sister loved it, this was a birthday gift and all though I checked off as gift and it was giftwrapped they sent the invoice with the price I paid for it. So that was not good. All in all she loved it."
5.0,"Runs a little big, but it's also a very flowy, loose fit. I am usually between sizes and I'm glad I went with the smaller of the two. Looks super cute with leggings."

5.0,very comfortable and good quailty
5.0,It was a Christmas gift.
5.0,"Very happy with this hat, it survived vacation travel looking brand new.  Great value."
5.0,I am very pleased with my purchase.  I ordered 9.5 Wide.  This shoe is comfortable the minute you put it on.  My second pair of Vionics.  And the bottom platform/sole of the shoe is actually wide instead of the manufacturer adding longer straps for wide feet (thank you)!  I've had three toes operated on and so glad my foot is not squished into a shoe.  Will be purchasing more in the future!
5.0,"daughter loves that they feel like yoga pants but with full sticky seat. good color, doesn't look cheap, hopefully lasts a while! nice weight for summer and fall riding would buy again in more colors if they make it through a few washings"
5.0,Nice.  My son loves it.  Zipper is good.  Fabric is soft and wearable.  Stitching is good on this.  Won't come apart too soon.  Very washable.  Nice. Comfortable. My son is 6'4.. And it is long enough for him.  Just below waist which he likes.  arms are long enough also.
5.0,very breathable soft and stay wher they need to
5.0,I love this skirt!<br />Only downside is I am six feet tall and wish it was longer!
5.0,"Exactly as advertised, excellent fit and quality. Will definitely purchase again and would highly recommend."

5.0,Great fitting socks. I'm buying another pack!

5.0,"Gorgeous.  Absolutely.  Heavy,  nicely made."
5.0,"I think this pair of shades look good on my bf. He got it bc of the XL frame and doesnt seem to pinch him on the side of his head, so it's a plus. I would recommend it to those who have a bigger head diameter. It comes in a secure package and looks as described on the site. It also comes with the bag to place the sunglasses. Its more round on the edges of the shades than square."
5.0,great costume glasses for my 10 year old!
5.0,Great value and well made. They fit as expected and are thick enough to not be see through. Love the leopard print too!

5.0,Wonderful watch. Eye catching style.
5.0,My husband really likes this wallet. The latch on it is so much better than the other aluminum wallets he has used.
5.0,"These earrings may be costume jewelry, but they are gorgeous. They are meant to be worn with any drop dead gorgeous fancy dress up outfit. These can be worn for any formal event. Even for a bride. They are nice sized so they will get noticed, unless you put your hair over your ears and it completely covers two inches below your ears. You will most likely want an updo with these."
5.0,This is one of my fav tops
5.0,Muy bonitos zapatos para mi hija h despues de 2 a√±os funcionan perfectamente
5.0,These are really nice and fun to wear.

5.0,Slimmed down my wallet with this
5.0,"I received the watch very promptly.  I was impressed with its appearance and it's size is just right.  The titanium case is so lightweight that I can hardly feel the watch on my arm.  The watch is very accurate for a mechanical movement(the accuracy seems best when I wind it in the morning and evening, but it only takes a few seconds to wind it) .  I am quite sure that the movement is Russian.  I highly recommend this watch."
5.0,my 5 year old son loves this watch.  It's great to help learn the time
5.0,Cute and stylish perfect for wearing as is or embellishing
5.0,"I have some wading shoes that I bought from Cabela's in the past. For whatever reason, they seem to be hard to wear. When I was looking for waders on Amazon, I ran into this pair of wading shoes. Given the fact that they are made with rubber sole rather than felt sole, I wanted to try it. I received the shoes before the Christmas. They were well packed with Amazon box. After trying the shoes on, I realized that they are more comfortable than the felt sole ones that I bought from Cabela's. I am not sure if the rubber sole is going to work better for the sandy river bottom than the felt sole. At least in theory, the felt sole is designed for rocks and the rubber sole is used for the sand. I am going to use this pair of shoes next year to see how it works. But at least from what I can see, this is made with solid material, and the shoes fit my feet very well."
5.0,More like regular sweatpants but I still want to keep them.
5.0,Great condition and easy to walk in! Very comfortable great buy
5.0,Comfortable on hardwood floor and only makes as much noise as barefoot
5.0,Ordered these for my daughter everyone at the high school loved them.
5.0,Beautiful and glamourous.  Its big!
5.0,Husband loves his new wallet. He loves that he can carry it in his front pocket. Good buy!
5.0,"Fits good, light weight and pretty"
5.0,Fits as expected. I coated the ring in clear nail polish to protect my finger and the ring itself so the stones don't fall out. I take it off before washing my hands. Worn about 2 weeks with no problems. It's very dainty and beautiful.
5.0,I love the swingy skirt. And the pockets. It was a little shorter on me than i normally like. But it fits so well I'll just wear a pair of like shorts underneath.
5.0,"Love it, and so does everyone else who sees it and wants it.  Great color for the season.  Classy and sharp.  Roomy.  Just had a weird smell when I opened the packaging.  That took about 4 days to clear up."
5.0,this came today and I LOVE IT!! SO CUTE
5.0,Very cute. I purchase it for my sister in law as a gift and she loved it.
5.0,Perfect summer dress if you like something that feminine and flowy.
5.0,"I purchased the bright blue dress in this cocktail swing dress style because it reminded me of a cute little sailor dress and my dad was in the Navy.  When opening dress my I could not believe how cute the blue is‚Ä¶just as bright as pictured online and it was very eye appealing before I even put it on. It was just as cute in person and I couldn't wait to try it on, it looked kind of small so I was nervous. The fabric was heavier than I expected but still airy. I love the way the dress comes in above the waist and then flared out as it gets to the skirt because it hid my tiny bit of belly fat. It is very flattering for the curves! The halter tie style is always a good choice, I like some support more than a sleeveless dress and it is usually positions in a way that just enough to cover up the any areas of concern, like the little bit of fat we all hate in the armpit fat we all hate.<br /><br />The sewing on the dress seems decently done...I could not be more pleased with the white sailor buttons and the bow on the side of one of the ties.  The back is made stretchy so it is not as small as it looks. My husband loved this dress.  I need to find one of the white navy hats like my dad wore back in the day. It could easily go as a dressier attire, like for a wedding, or just a really cute summer dress at a BBQ.  Disclaimer: I did receive this dress at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review of the product. I feel I have given an honest review from my stand point and will include pictures of the dress on below and the side zipper. I am going to wash and wear it a few times but if it hold up to that I will certainly be purchasing the red version of this dress as well in the sailor style.  I had a hard time choosing between the two.  I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest review, which I feel I have given to the best of my ability."
5.0,This dress is gorgeous! I got so many compliments the two times I have worn it. I love it. It's flattering and can be made to look more formal or dressed down with flip flops.
5.0,"It looks fab on my gay friend, so I bought a pair and wear it as well."
5.0,"My daughter loved the robe, she often wears it to bed."

5.0,I had a great experience with this seller and the shirt is awesome!
5.0,"I bought these in M, they fit perfectly! The fabric is soft, comfy and look great with any bottoms."
5.0,So its a basic dress. The back and front have the same cut so your bra may hang out but if ypu have good boobs you could pull it off just right. But let me tell you this dress is PERFECT!!!! It looks exactly like it is pictureed and its very flattering. It's like...... Fleece lined? But its elastic and oh my god its so comfy. Seriously the cutest and best dress ever.
5.0,"I love these rings. Got them today, took a little less than 3 weeks to get here and i am very happy with my purchase. They are made for smaller fingers, im a 6 ring size and the fit perfectly. My only complaint is that it was missing a ring. But that wasnt enough to make me give it less than 5 stars because i paid so little for them and quality is great"
5.0,just the look i was going for
5.0,"Very high quality, looks and feels great. I just wish the brim was a bit larger for sun protection on the golf course."
5.0,"Luxe green, snappy but subtle weave, perfect for the holidays and beyond. Someone else mentioned ‚Äúpurchase was for a Grandpa‚Äù but my man looks very dashing in this."
5.0,"These are fantastic!  I wear them every day.  They are perfect for going to work, they keep your ears warm in a stylish way and don't ruin you hair style.  I highly recommend them."
5.0,Wife had allergic reaction to band so . Good fit over all.

The graphics are great and they have already been washed numerous times with no fading or fabric deterioration.  I look forward to getting another pair!
5.0,"Was amazed when I received! Packaging, gift wrap, great sterling silver chain/necklace, sentiment card & polishing cloth in all! Nice gift for my BBF!!"
5.0,As expected and I have gotten many compliments. Just would have preferred the sweat band to be more like towel material.
5.0,I purchased this watch as a just because I love you gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it and I absolutely love the love that she has given in return. Nice quality time piece.

5.0,OMG I love this dress!  I ordered it to wear to church for Easter and it was perfect.  You can easily dress it up with a nice necklace. I love the A line cut and the circle skirt. It looks so retro. It is made out of a comfortable stretchy cotton material and is not at all see-through. And you can breastfeed in it!!! I bought this dress when I was 5 months post partum and I loved that I could breastfeed in it and it wasn't a maternity dress. I got so many compliments from people too. I'm currently wearing a size 12 or 14 and the size XL dress was perfect.
5.0,my daughter absolutely loves this and it's adorable on her
5.0,Fits my big head just fine.  Plenty of slouch.  Nice green color.  Dual layer of fabric helps trap air to keep your head warm while still breathing so you won't sweat.

5.0,they look sick love them
5.0,Bought this as a surprise for my granddaughter. She loves it.
5.0,First found this brand in a Marshall‚Äôs and loved them. It was always hit or miss when I‚Äôd go back for different styles or another pair. So I was so stoked when I found them on amazon and for around the same price. I live in these. I work out in them lazy day in them and also mix it up with the ‚Äúathleisure‚Äù style.
5.0,Very good product for the$
5.0,"This jacket is very light, keeps me warm and it is travel-friendly,Exactly what I was looking for and needed.  I was more than satisfied with my buy."

5.0,"Great dress! The material is very comfortable and the elastic waistband adds shape. I got the orange and I love it! Such a fun summer/ spring dress. I am 5'5&#34; 125lbs, I ordered a small and the dress almost touches the floor. I think XS would also fit well since the elastic is so forgiving."
5.0,"Using these as a cheaper alternative to obiage. Nice colors, lightweight with some give to them."
5.0,"I would have paid much more for this dress at a department store!  Very flattering material and shape!  I love the ties on the arms!

I had to pin tje bottom closed so that I could wear it to church, but other than that I love it!!"

5.0,"Gloves are made nice, and comfortable,with the coating on the fingers to hold onto fabric. Perfect gloves for quilting, and at a much better price than other brands!!"
5.0,"Size matters. If you get the right size, this will be beautiful on you. Get the wrong size and you will either look dreadfully overweight or woefully undersized.<br /><br />Thankfully, I happened to get the right size. I presented it as a gift to someone who wears it well. Crucial is the overall style of the person wearing it. In my place it turned out well. The model who is pictured while I am writing this does not do it justice. The woman wearing the one I gave to her is well-matched with it.<br /><br />Look at her eyes, the color and the shape. Consider her smile: not just the curve but the warmth. Do you see her hair? Does it distract or add as she wears this? Look at her, all of her. The fit has is much more than the size. Match that and you've made a good choice.<br /><br />--Brockeim"
5.0,Great product! Great price! Loads of compliments!
5.0,"I was surprised to find it folded.  It opened beautifully and there are no creases.  The cord can be tucked in the top if you want it to look more classy, but I got it to work in the yard so having the chin ties are great so it doesn't fall off when bending over.  I really like it.  I looked at dozens of hats and chose this one.  I'm glad I did."
5.0,"It‚Äôs a good quality, well made items. The colors are bright."
5.0,Ordered these for my 10yr Olds Xmas. Arrived on time.  Fits as expected. Excellent quality and craftsmanship.
5.0,"Soft, stretchy material, so they're very comfortable. And I love the cute colors!"
5.0,Came with some difficulty
5.0,"Beautiful skirt made of soft flannel.  It runs very small, the XL is the same as a US 8/10.  I ordered the XL because of the reviews.  This is skirt is perfect for boots and is quite nice."
5.0,"I love this top! I have gotten so many compliments every time I wear it! Not stretchy but still comfortable. Glad I got XL. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 148LBs, and B cup- pear shaped. Washes well. No shrinking. Well made."
5.0,Very nice gold chain just as it is pictured!
5.0,"To my surprise, and believe me, I tried many girdle panties, this is by far the best one yet. The price is great, the fit is wonderful as long as you check your measurements correctly. I had to buy another one. In fact, I wanted to buy several but the color and size I wanted, were all sold out. I had to settle for a color I wasn't crazy over but its worth it."
5.0,Ordered the pink with grey dots....love it..long and wide and very flowey.Shipping was very fast.
5.0,I was skeptical! After reading other reviews I really thought this stuff wouldn't work.  But I was so tired of my glasses fogging I took a chance and I'm so glad I did. I no longer have glasses that fog over. One note..you must follow directions completely.
5.0,"The scarves are beautiful! I love the fabric. I really didn't have high expectations. Given what I paid for them, I was really just keeping my fingers crossed that I'd be able to wear them in public. They arrived within the expected time frame and they are just beautiful. Can't wait to wear them!"
5.0,Our Granddaughter loved it.

5.0,"I loooove this top and really hope they return in a variety of colors. The top is comfortable and so, so cute. But, beware it is SHORT! I'm 5ft1in and wear this with high-waisted pants. When I raise my arms above my head, you can see a strip of skin. Does not wrinkle easily."
5.0,This shirt is great fits perfectly to size.
5.0,Delivered on time...in excellent condition..my husband took it an is using it while he plays basketball....he can see the lbs dropping off. Great product.
5.0,"Bought this as a Christmas Gift for my brother. He loved it and wears it sometimes to work or conferences. He is a professor and a Star Wars fan, so it is a great conversation piece. :)"
5.0,My daughter has wanted a pair of ladybug earrings ever since the miraculous ladybug show came out. I got her first pair and for some reason her ears kept getting infected even though they were surgical stainless steel.  They were much too heavy. These earrings are very lightweight and much easier on the ears
5.0,My husband is going to love this!
5.0,"I'm overall very happy with the purchase, the patterned colors work well for the outfits I am required to wear at work and they do not slide down. However, some of the socks are a bit tight and require me to tug at them for a bit, perhaps I'm just not used to crew socks anymore but other than that I have 0 issue with circulation being cut off or them digging into my skin or them rolling down."
5.0,delivered faster than I was expected.
5.0,The purse is beautiful! It is a quality product.
5.0,Favorite dress.  So comfy and cute
5.0,Cute and go with everything
5.0,Love this dress. I‚Äôd does run a bit small. My daughter is 4 and I ordered a 6 and it‚Äôs short on her so go a size up. It‚Äôs super cute though.
5.0,This looks so elegant. The photos don't do it justice. It changes color as the crystal has a light blue with 18k gold layeted and signed Baccarat on the back.  It makes the middle of the heart shine a beautiful gold with clear blue around the edges of the heart. I am so happy with this purchase !
5.0,Like everything about this cardigan.. the shape..the color..the the softness..will definitely buy in different colors.
5.0,Super cute and dainty!  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,It arrived on time our 13yr old daughter loves it and they are easy to wash will not shrink.

5.0,"Love this shirt but a little snug, go one size up"
5.0,It matches my crib perfectly and I love that it‚Äôs real wood and great quality! It fit the 32‚Äù changing pad perfectly! Can‚Äôt wait for baby to arrive next week so I can finally use it!
5.0,Very pretty....wearing now.
5.0,"I love these skirts!  I live in them.  I wear skirts daily, while running a private daycare.  They are wearing very well.  The colors are great, and I love the fit.  I am plus size 16/18 and ordered 2X and they fit exactly as I needed.  I love them so much, I have ordered three separate sets, and the quality and sizing has remained the same.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,I got a size up from my regular size as other reviews suggested and I love the way it fits.  For me the chest is sort of fitted and then it is flowy everywhere else.  The alternating stripes are flattering and the length of the top is perfect for leggings or skinny jeans.
5.0,super fast delivery and excellent product!!
5.0,The product fit as expected and stayed put all day. I‚Äôm a D cup and it supported me just fine. Packaging was minimal which I liked. Will work great with backless or strapless outfits.

5.0,"Great Product, very comfortable to wear"
5.0,I absolutely love this dress fits perfect it is Madewell and I love the print

5.0,Totally in love with with bag.. Great quality
5.0,My teenagers love the different shape belly rings. The rings are sturdy and easy to put on.
5.0,"These are really comfortable for hiking/ outdoor adventures that you are wearing boots for.  The socks are thick but not so thick that your feet are sweating and sliding around your boots/shoes.  I wear a womens 9W and have these in the XL they are a little long but not enough to bunch up or hurt my feet.  Overall, they wash well and have held up to some serious isolation wandering around."
5.0,Heavy duty worth the money
5.0,You can never go wrong with Diff Eyewear. I'm a huge fan and was happy to find these glasses here after they sold out on the Diff website.

5.0,Omg......I love this coat...  Light in weight but very warm
5.0,I actually got these because my favorite idol wears them. They are so cute and stylish. But I feel as though $10 may be a little expensive for fake glasses??
5.0,"nice soft material, nice fit. I needed a simple conservative skirt and this fills the bill."
5.0,Very nice. Even better than the pic.
5.0,"Adorable dress, just what we wanted. Very vivid colors and nice material and did well in it's first wash. Fits just right using the size chart image from the company. I also love it because you could easily put a long sleeve shirt and leggings under it like a jumper so you can use for multiple seasons. I plan to get more of these dresses in other patterns."
5.0,This Bag is GREAT!!! It arrived quickly‚Äîand a nice size for the price!!  I can‚Äôt wait to use it for the Beach‚Äîthis upcoming 4 th of July!!!
5.0,"I purchased these for vacation to the beach so incase I dropped them in the ocean, thankfully I did not.

I love them & very happy with my purchase!  :)"
5.0,the best kobe bryant shoes are original I am very happy with this purchase

5.0,"this little silver necklace was exactly what I needed. Good quality, good value, nice silver. I would recommend this company and this product."

5.0,Was skeptical about these but they were actually really nice. Great fit.
5.0,"These are awesome! I collect enamel pins both novelty and fashion, I‚Äôm always afraid of losing them especially the more valuable ones like brooches. These are the most secure backs I‚Äôve ever used; at first it was a little tricky but after a few times very easy! Definitely recommend to pin collectors."
5.0,"Love this top!  Material is perfect and not sheer at all.  The tube top offers some support for the girls.  I have this in three colors. Can pair it with jeans or shorts during the day, and with a mini skirt to go out at night. Get lots of compliments!"
5.0,I chose this product regarding reviews and overall simplicity of design.
5.0,"Super comfy, well fitting pants - durable for heavy work and when they are clean they are fine to wear to a low-key night out at the bar.  I've used a machine dryer to dry these and they held up well."
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and like 160, I purchased a large and am very happy with it. I got so many compliments the first time I wore it. The quality is great and it‚Äôs beautiful"

5.0,I bought them for my sweetheart but I like to steal then a they are so comfortable
5.0,This was my first time ordering a dress on line. I usually have to try everything on so I was a bit nervous that it wasn‚Äôt going to fit or be good quality. The dress is so comfortable and fit perfectly. Definitely recommend!
5.0,I like it. Looks good. And decent price.
5.0,Great price I have two
5.0,The picture accurately reflects what the bracelet looks like. It‚Äôs elegant and dainty and will be the perfect addition to my wedding outfit. I cannot wait to wear it!

5.0,Super soft  I get so many compliments on it
5.0,These earrings are REALLY well priced and I bought 2 sets.  Very light weight and wear them all the time.
5.0,"I wanted to have this shirt since the very first time I saw it. This Jimi Hendrix art is stunning and the quality of the print is great,after many washes keeps looking the same with it vibrant colors. Since its a junior fit I went 2 sizes up and fits great,not too tigh,not to baggy!"
5.0,Just as expected.  Very beautiful!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:f6d003ee0cbefe2cf72c867806b5f473]] Its very pretty but hard to put on. The charms are sold separately but look great. My and daughter and I purchased one each so we can buy charms for each other
5.0,exactly what i needed at a great price.
5.0,Love love love! I was expecting this shirt to be a bit small but it fits perfectly. Definitely my new favorite top!

5.0,"Good quality shirt that hasn't shrunk in the wash. QC seems good, as I ordered two and both were the same size."
5.0,These are so beautiful.  Love them.
5.0,Easy to adjust. I could fit it on myself as well as sizing it down to fit my 6 year old. Material is easy to breath in and I love the filter slot.
5.0,"Absolutely adorable dress. It is a very comfortable fabric. I was thinking that the stripes on top would make me look top heavy, but it didn't at all. The flow of the skirt is fun. The dress as a whole is very feminine and playful. I generally don't enjoy wearing sleeves because I have muscular biceps/triceps, but these sleeves were comfortable and rest nicely on my arms."
5.0,Very comfortable. The snap closure in the back makes it easy to put on.
5.0,"I loved the boot but it was not a true 81/2 so I had to send it back for credit, because I could not re-order it in a size 9."
5.0,"Its exactly as pictured, but the colors are a little more saturated!"
5.0,Bought these for my daughter. She use them for her charm bracelet she makes. Very beautiful
5.0,I decided to up the size because I wanted more of a roomy free-flowing shirt. If you don't need the extra room or don't want it to flowy I would suggest you order the original size you would wear because they are true to size. The shirt is not see through at all it has two different layers that are very thin. Shirt is very lightweight does not discolor at all after washing or does it shrink.
5.0,An old bandaid style that is perfect for the new reality.
5.0,"Comfortable, elegant, and classy look."
5.0,Great quality and super soft! Better than I expected! Highly recommend

5.0,Hubby loved so I bought two more! Love these tops. Plus size gals: Covers booty so perfect for leggings but has style so you don‚Äôt just feel like you are wearing a moo moo. Can be dressed up or down. Material Is not super thick but I am hot all the time and WFH so I have not had an issue with that. They are super soft.
5.0,"Cute way to escape the rain. Good quality, exactly as described."
5.0,Perfect fit and covers your ears!
5.0,Oversized and so cute!
5.0,"I work outside and have to wear safety colors. This sweatshirt is perfect! So soft, warm, and bright."
5.0,"I love this necklace. It's very dainty and that's exactly what my friend prefers.  I can't wait for her to see it. If you're not looking for a very dainty chain with small stones then you may not like this,  but I think it's very pretty."
5.0,Sunglasses were stylish and blocked UV rays. Money well spent.
5.0,"I like material, somewhat to big now that I'm losing weight. Very good quality of material."
5.0,I thought they was very nice

5.0,Very nice quality. Wish they had more colors just like these
5.0,"It is lovely, delicate and fits in with my bracelet on which every charm has a meaning. This on is in memory of a friend's son who passed away at a young age."
5.0,I ordered both the black and white floral boots and I‚Äôm in loveee with them!! I haven‚Äôt worn the white ones as of yet..but the black ones were great to walk in for hours before my feet began to ache a bit...I‚Äôm a Cape Robbin fan and love their shoes..fit is spot on and packages delivered earlier than arrival date
5.0,"Fits snug to my nose, I like it."
5.0,Easy installation. Well made.
5.0,The small was a little big but you can bend it into place.
5.0,This was a gift and they‚Äôre happy with it and like it!
5.0,This was just what I wanted
5.0,"Looks great. It's a gift so I didn't fully open the package so I can't really speak on the durability but looks great. Stamped nice and clean and clear. Came with a card, envelope and gift bag. Definitely recommend."
5.0,"Very delicate and pretty. A little smaller than I expected, but that was not a problem."
5.0,What I really like is the ability to add or remove key rings!
5.0,These shoes make you superman.
5.0,Beautiful!! Just hope it doesn't change colors quick.
5.0,Great fit and the material is very soft. Perfect for everyday wear.
5.0,"Bought the wallet for my husband. He really likes this wallet, it is his second one. These wallets are very durable and last a long time."
5.0,"Exactly what I expected it to be, a much more durable band for my gear and it now looks more like a normal watch and doesn't pop off at random. The tool they include to remove the link pins is awesome and I'll keep it to use with other watches, you just have to be careful to remove the pins in the direction of the arrows and if it feels like there's resistance, you're doing it wrong and will likely break the metal piece of the tool, which isn't a huge deal because it comes with 2 replacements."
5.0,Recipient dug. Life time Broncos fan yet had never been given Denver shirt? A jersey is next!!
5.0,Really no opinion I was a gift requested by a granddaughter.
5.0,Great for the value. My daughter loved it.

5.0,‚ù§Ô∏è these long sleeve. Great value for the money. Highly recommended. I just read the reviews so i got my exact size. I weigh 133lbs & 5‚Äô4 in height and i ordered large & fits well üòä
5.0,"Flowy, sassy fit"
5.0,"Bag is great, perfect size for my needs. It came without a strap so I emailed the seller that day, an hour later they sent me shipping confirmation for my strap. Assuming that arrives as promised I would gladly recommend the bag as well as the seller. They were immediately on top of the strap shipment."
5.0,works as intended. Very nice
5.0,Great product and very stylish
5.0,Peeeeerrrrrffffeeeect! I love these shorts!!!! They are so comfortable and allow air to flow to the family jewels! Super stretchy but still classy!

5.0,Just what I was looking for-a larger bandana
5.0,Love it!!! Kids love it amazing!!!
5.0,Great shirt. Fit well. Arm holes are a little large if your petite.
5.0,"Beautifully designed. These pants have an understated elegance that is versatile.<br /><br />I play cello, and I bought these pants as an alternative to the long flowy dresses I usually wear for concerts. These pants are youthful, without giving up class. The material is heavy enough for winter layering, but workable for spring. I would not wear them in Florida humidity, but they could work most seasons where there are ""seasons"".<br /><br />I am considering other colors for travel wear, as the wrinkles seem to fall out quickly after hanging them up.<br /><br />I am 5'7"" with a 32 inch inseam- so my legs are long.<br /><br />Finding long pants are a challenge, because my height and leg length is not the average proportion. Most pants fall short on me.<br /><br />For those with shorter legs, this is a pant I would invest in taking to a tailor to get the perfect length.<br /><br />Tip: Pay attention to the length and know your current measurements. These fit as the measurement chart described."
5.0,Momma loved it
5.0,knit cap has warm lighting and both fit very well
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, nice quality and light weight. Have ordered three pairs"
5.0,"I sue these on the Harley, they let me see both the road AND my instruments too!"

5.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money going to Apple, identical to the band that came with my ultra watch"
5.0,Using as dog tags for transport dogs. Works great
5.0,wife loves it.  Looks great and holds all of her earrings.  Easy assembly.
5.0,these are comfy and fit like I expected....if anything they are a little more roomy than expected. love the pocket for my phone.
5.0,Great fabric and brite colors. Really like this shirt!
5.0,my grandaughter loved them for christmas
5.0,"Light weight, sturdy, but VERY EASY to push/pull.  Did a lot of walking in New York City pulling the luggage along, and it stood up to the test.  It's s good product for the price.  It's also very roomy."
5.0,"Perfect items to pass out to friends, families, customers, etc. in order to grow awareness of breast cancer awareness. Great items!!"
5.0,It such a cute dress and it fits as expected
5.0,"I have a hard time finding t-shirts that fit me well since i'm a heavier woman.  (5'3&#34;, 185lbs).  I usually get extra large, but decided to play it safe and went with a 2x.  I probably could have gotten the 1x, but i'm fine with the 2x.  Material is nice & light which I love.  Design is great."
5.0,"Great every-day bag.  Spacious.  Love having my tablet, phone, wallett, change purse, and medicine case all in the same bag."
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, my wife loved them!!!"
5.0,Probably one of my favorite work dresses. So comfy but easily passes for office attire. Loved it so much I bought it in two colors üòÇ
5.0,Exactly what I needed so I can wear earrings again.
5.0,What can you say...  it's Carter's...
5.0,I recommend this.
5.0,Fits as expected-very nice Christmas outfit
5.0,Nice dress but did not fit as it was too short and had to return.
5.0,Gorgeous huge earrings that are not at all heavy. You can look pretty all day without wanting to take them out
5.0,beautiful and stays on your head
5.0,"Very pretty, my daughter love it, and the package was beautiful."
5.0,"This peacock bracelet looks great . I have small wrists and usually have problems with fit,but this  fit well. It arrived intact and in timely manner. Packaged well"
5.0,Loose and comfortable. Ended up buying two more pairs because I loved them so much.
5.0,It is well made and great sparkle. Revived complements in how pretty it is!  If we must wear mask let them have bling!!
5.0,I bought this for a card party.  We has so munch fun taking turns shuffling!  thank you seller.
5.0,"I love the feel of this. It has a perfect fit, and is easy to get on as well as off. Fast shipping as well."
5.0,"Seriously the cutest, thick and warm enough for a day in the 40-35* range. No complaints, just very adorable. Waterproof too!"
5.0,"I have ordered a replacement kit from another seller before, but had to return it as it did not fit AT ALL. I have an older model Oakley Half Jacket XLJ and this kit fit PERFECTLY! Getting the rubber pieces on was interesting, but I won that fight! :) I highly recommend this kit. You will not regret this purchase!"
5.0,"This was perfect for my needs on a trip out of the country. It's small, but held the most important items I needed when venturing out. My brother and dad also both really liked it, and said it'd make for a good man bag - so it's unisex. Cross body strap is great with inner and outer pockets. Great value for the price."
5.0,Perfect for Christmas. It is a little short so if you feel uncomfortable wearing too short dresses is not for you. Fabric is ok . Does not look cheap at all.  The Fabric is elastic.
5.0,"I was lucky enough to be asked to try and review this wonderful Feather Antique Gold Brass Earrings from Spunky Soul and so glad I did.<br />1st let me tell you this seller is awesome we had great communications and answered any question I had.<br />I love to wear sweaters in the fall and winter and along with a necklace I love to wear dangling earrings (as I have long hair so you can seem them if they dangle)  these gorgeous earrings will be the perfect compliment to my wardrobe.<br />The silver metal earrings that I got are Gold Brass but you can also get Silver (which I do plan on getting also).<br />The feather itself measures 1.5&#34; long is on a hook earring. It does come with the little rubber stopper to put on the back.<br />One of the things I really love about these earrings is they are light weight. A lot of times when I wear metal earrings like this they are too heavy for my ear, I did not feel this at all with these.<br />The night I went out wearing them i got so many compliments.<br />You can tell that this was made very well and with lots of love..<br />One thing that is important to point out is it is lead & nickel free and is in compliance with all U.S., State requirements & the CPSIA.<br />I would highly recommend you add the Bohemia Long Mixed Metal Feather Pendant Necklace so that you have a very nice matching set!<br />I have included the link....<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZH7IG8E?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_21<br /><br />**I received this product for free/reduced amount for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review***"
5.0,"Overall like this band a lot, it‚Äôs worlds better than the standard fit bit band.<br /><br />Pros: much narrower than the standard fit bit so it doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as bulky (would say more so it now feels as slim as it looks). Also allows for better adjustment so it‚Äôs tight enough but not too tight. Band also has some give to it so even when it‚Äôs tight it‚Äôs not overbearing.<br /><br />Cons: it‚Äôs already starting to fray a bit, I had the Amazon halo band and it‚Äôs strap was identical but better made and didn‚Äôt fray. However for the cheap price this band hasn‚Äôt given out on me after a month of wearing and the fraying isn‚Äôt getting out of hand.  Will update this post if I‚Äôm annoyed by it in another few months"
5.0,"Product looked great and felt great----sharp, bright colors.  Haven't worn yet, but intend to soon.  Excellent product."
5.0,"This is a really nice swim parka.  The inner lining is towel material, so no need to bring a separate towel with you.  It‚Äôs warm and insulated - so great for swim meets or winter walks outdoors to get to the pool."
5.0,I ADORE these!!! I've carried heavy groceries in them and they've been able to handle anything I've put in them
5.0,"This bag has become my favorite daily bag. It has many compartments so I can put many items inside. I like the side pockets which I use for carrying my coffee mug and water bottle. Although I put a lot of things in the bag, I don't feel the bag is too heavy because the should strap is quite supportive wide enough to manage the weight."
5.0,Love this dress. fits awesome
5.0,I love these.  Subtle and flashy at the same time.
5.0,I had to look for a short torso trainer because the full one that I had did not fit correctly and hurt to wear it. This one fits perfectly and I can wear it all day and workout in it. Love it!
5.0,"I basically live in yoga pants and these are BY FAR the most awesome, best fitting and comfortable ones I have found. They don't move around too much in class and the material feels like high quality- definitely not see through. I originally purchased a pair at Marshalls and then found them on Amazon. I will continue to by this brand from now on. So glad I found them!"
5.0,"Beautiful dress. My granddaughter had ""princess"" day at school and loves unicorns. This was the perfect dress and workmanship was good"
5.0,"just received today and I love my dress. it's fit perfectly, light and a lil stretchy so it's not so clingy."
5.0,Skirt is soft and fits well. Has a stretch to it. Nice.
5.0,This is a fantastic recreation of the famous Jersey.  Great quality.  Since its an actual Jersey its sized for all the hockey gear.  The waist is a bit smaller than the chest.  The detail and quality is top notch.  Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Love these<br />I wear it every day.<br />No issues and I use my hands all day.
5.0,"Love the color and thinking of another one/different color. Wish there was size option as my wrist is small, but not a big deal. Love the look!"
5.0,I bought these ear rings for my Bride to wear at our Wedding on July 9th.<br />They are beautiful !!
5.0,very pretty color. As pictured.
5.0,It's nice but not long enough for what i want to use it for.
5.0,"I've always been stuck on my magnetic bands, but these showed up and are super comfy, adjustable, and the color variety is nice for outfit changes.  I love the white, it got dirty pretty easily due to gym sessions and life.. but was super easy to clean and looks good as new!"
5.0,My boyfriend works construction and he loved it!
5.0,Great quality. Gave it as a gift to a new driver and she loved it!
5.0,"These sunglasses are nice - lightweight and block the sun without being too dark. They are a tad too big for my face, but I have a small face and they look good anyway."
5.0,"Very pretty piece. Ordered this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. When I see her wear it, it doesn't stick out a lot and isn't some bulky odd looking thing, its a simple pretty piece of jewelry that looks like its worth $150+. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple pretty gift."
5.0,"My son just got glasses, and I was appalled at how flimsy the case from the optometrist was. He broke it in two days. I went online and found this case. It's durable and easy to use. He is pleased with the color, and now his glasses are safe. I definitely recommend this case for children."
5.0,"This is the second magazine soc I've purchased. So far I'm happy with both, they look good, increase your grip on the magazine, and using different designs allow for fast identification of multiple caliber magazines."
5.0,I'm addicted to these socks.  No slipping at all:)
5.0,I love the brand. Only watch bands I will buy. I wish this one for Fitbit come was available again in silver size m.
5.0,I wore it with brown heels and a long necklace.  It was simple and really cute.
5.0,Exactly as expected. Seems like a quality product.
5.0,Bought this for my Maid of Honor to try on and we both loved it. Now I will get the other bridesmaids to order it too. Great dress and great price.
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Way too long pant legs though. Many pockets. Love the style.
5.0,Happy with my birthday
5.0,Great sweatshirts for my husband. Russell makes a quality sweatshirt. I had zippered Russell sweatshirts that lasted over 20 years.
5.0,These earrings are even more beautiful in person! I‚Äôm thrilled!
5.0,"Another fantastic product from Leggings Depot! Beautiful design, super soft and comfy! I've ordered several of these in different designs."
5.0,I love it really cute
5.0,A nice piece to wear on special occasions.
5.0,Loved it as described
5.0,First polo that is tight on my abs.
5.0,Great leg warmers.
5.0,"Very impressed with how well this top covers color. I wore a black sports bra under it and it didn‚Äôt look ridiculous. Great to wear under scrubs, I‚Äôll be trying mine under a scrub vest! I ordered a size medium. I wear a 34 DD and size 4-6 pants"
5.0,Fit perfect. Very soft material.
5.0,My three year old lives them and they are holding up well!
5.0,Love these rings!! The various sizes fit all different fingers. They look delicate and so pretty!
5.0,Took a while to get to me but worth it.  Very warm and comfortable.  I wear under my trousers when riding motorcycle in the wintertime to keep my legs warm.  Works like a charm!
5.0,My father in law loved
5.0,Love this fits great. Washes well. Lace is soft not scratchy
5.0,My favorite mask.  Very comfortable.  I get more compliments on this mask than any other mask I have
5.0,Great dress but runs small...had to.return it
5.0,"Gift for my WOW crazy husband, he wears it every day!"
5.0,"Super soft material, galaxy print is just like in the picture. Pockets on the sides are big enough to fit my phone. There is also a pocket in the waist band, which also fits my phone, but it feels awkward for me. Probably best for cash or cards so you don‚Äôt have a bulge. But if you don‚Äôt care about that, a phone will fit great in that pocket too."
5.0,We needed extra garage openers.  These program great and work great.  Would order again if need be.
5.0,Was the look and feel of this band...<br /><br />The only issue that I have with it is the fact that its kinda hard to get the pins out once you attach it to the watch.
5.0,"These gloves are awesome! I got them for my husband, who normally HATES gloves. They‚Äôre either too bulky and he can‚Äôt do anything while wearing them, or too thin and don‚Äôt do any good! These seem to hit the sweet spot: nice and warm and comfy, but flexible and mobile. They also work perfectly with the iPhone 8 touch screen, so no need to keep pulling off the gloves to take photos of kiddos in the snow!"
5.0,"Mi marca favorita! Cuando las v√≠ en Amazon no dud√© en comprarlas! Son muy resistentes,duraderas,sobre todo no le entra el agua muy f√°cilmente,son muy c√≥modas. Y adem√°s la entrega fu√© r√°pida no tuve que esperar muchos d√≠as c√≥mo otras compras."
5.0,"Love this dress!! Bought it in 2 colors already, going to buy more. The cut is low so i do wear a half tank underneath but i am also big chested, 38f, so i always have that problem. Size 12 jean. Bought in large and fit perfect"
5.0,"Nice pullover, true to size, and colors are pretty"
5.0,"Thin as expected but shocked it fit me! I am 5'9&#34; and normally wear a US size 10.  wouldn't wear it as a swimsuit as it is pretty see through, but i think it is going to work perfect as a halloween costume."
5.0,Very nice selection and everyone enjoyed their earrings as Christmas presents.
5.0,"Beautiful, very surprised how nice"
5.0,Good quality for the money.  Inexpensive fun for teen granddaughter who received many compliments while wearing them
5.0,"I got a ton of compliments today!  They're bigger than I expected and so sparkley.  I wish they would have come with a larger backing since the earrings themselves are so big, but otherwise they're exactly what I was looking for.  Super cute!!"
5.0,"These earrings are worth every penny. They are elegant and beautiful. The only thing was that I needed to add plastic backings because sometimes the earrings would come out when I would look down or when changing shirts. Other than that, totally love them."
5.0,I love the necklaces! I ordered them for our 7/8 yr old. basketball team!
5.0,Actually ordered for my daughter to wear to and from volleyball. Easy on/off and she says they are really comfortable. She wears them all the time around the house too.
5.0,"I ordered both a small and medium in this suit as I just didn't know from the reviews.  I ended up keeping the small.  I usually wear a small top and a medium bottom in suits, but I felt like the medium had extra fabric in the back.  I love the neon green as it is a vibrant color and not a yellow green.  For sizing reference I am about 130lbs (I haven't weighed myself in awhile so can't be sure), 5'5'', 32D, and I wear a XS/S or 0/2 in most clothing."
5.0,Thank you for the fast delivery and such a beautiful item.
5.0,I usually where medium to large but I ordered 1x and it fits nicely.
5.0,These are well made and good looking spats for a costume party.  Easy to put on and secure.
5.0,Great fit and looks exactly like the picture shown.
5.0,"I won this from Amazon giveaways, it's the coolest thing ever, I should've bought one for myself last year! Jus to say, Bluetooth works great an it fits me good!! Thanks Amazon! :)"
5.0,I love this dress! So flattering!
5.0,"My boyfriend loved it, immediately put it on his keychain. Great quality!"
5.0,"I love this dress! I am typically a size small, but it was a big snug and I didn't like how little I was able to move in it. I ordered a medium and it fits perfect.  I am taller (5'9&#34;) and it is a dress that hits right above my knees, which can be difficult to find."
5.0,Great fit and quality leather
5.0,Great quality for the price. Its very plush and velvety. Nice collar!
5.0,Warning this is a extremely smooth and lightweight wallet. Once you slide this into your pocket you'll barely even notice that it's there and the rfid blocking capability is a great bonus as well. The only dislike I have about this wallet so far is having to take out a entire stack of cash regardless of how much I actually want to take out at a time. Maybe this won't be so much of a issue if the wallet breaks in more later.
5.0,"After trying and returning a few brands of Amazon leggings I was told about these and figured I‚Äôd give the Amazon legging craze one last try. These exceeded my expectations! Fit is TTS- I wear a size 26 in jeans, the size small is perfect. Great thickness without bulk, lighter colors hardly show sweat, pocket is convenient, length is great. Will probably be replacing more of my other leggings with this brand! Compression without squishing me to death and the waist stays up well without any annoying elastic digging in. I work out at home so I don‚Äôt really care if they‚Äôre squat proof but it appears they are!"
5.0,I liked everything thing about it.
5.0,Loved it. Exactly what I  expected.
5.0,I've gotten so many  compliments on these! They're gorgeous!
5.0,"I haven't experienced any tearing, and the color & fit are perfect."
5.0,It perfect
5.0,"I love these gloves. I used a pair years ago for fishing in the Gulf and recently found this pair for a Grand Canyon raft trip. I wore them every day, mostly to protect from the sun but also to help a little with hanging onto ropes. They are very lightweight so you aren't really conscious of wearing them once you have them on. They dry fairly fast. They are highly recommended."
5.0,Love this dress - I have it in several colors.  I'm 5'6 145 I bought the large.
5.0,"Ok, I have had this watch now for about a month. It is way better then I expected for the price. As long as I give it a few winds before bed it doesn't stop on me. It keeps great time at least so far. I would definitely recommend this item."
5.0,"Bought a 3T.  It's a tad bit on large side (across the shoulders and arm length), but what a gorgeous outfit!  Super soft, nice weight/thickness.  High quality and perfect for Valentine's Day and Spring/Easter.  I put a full/fluffy slip underneath so the skirt would stand out - a la Shirley Temple, but it's not necessary, as the skirt folds/hangs beautifully."
5.0,These are lightweight and functional. Durable and dependable.
5.0,"Perfect for under skirts, a little thin to wear alone."
5.0,"Lovely being being earrings, not too big. Sometimes less is more. Lovely colors.  Would love to find some that dangle next."
5.0,I do have thin ankles though and shoe size 7 (8 for boots)
5.0,The concept of the bag is great. Definitely secure. Better than what I was expecting actually and plenty big. I agree there is a hole the size of a medicine bottle at the top but what are people going to take? Loose change? There is an extra zipper inside to secure small stuff. There is no way someone would be able to pull a Gopro in a waterproof housing out so the hole doesn't matter much. I wouldn't let this bag out of my sight if I can help it because it could be stolen with proper tools but the average public thief is looking for a quick grab and not something he/she has to work for in plain view.
5.0,Bought for my 12 year old and it‚Äôs awesome. She feels very comfortable in it and it covers well and looks great!
5.0,"Fit very nicely, made me look amazing."
5.0,I gave this to my daughter for Valentine‚Äôs Day and she loved it.
5.0,"I have a three year old who doesn‚Äôt like to wear masks around her ears. This is perfect for that and since it‚Äôs winter, they act as a scarf as well."
5.0,very nice looking for an inexpensive pair of earrings.  my daughter really likes them and they are a nice size that is not too large for a young girl.
5.0,Perfect. As described. Nicely made. Hubby loves them. Great price and fast shipping. I recommend
5.0,Very comfortable bought another set
5.0,So handy!!!
5.0,Great pair of shoes. My son even loves them!
5.0,"First I‚Äôd like to thank all those who submitted reviews and especially the ones with pictures. You totally influenced my size in this purchase. This top fits perfectly. I‚Äôm 66 years old, 5‚Äô4‚Äù tall and weigh 150 lbs. I purchased the XL. The length is perfect. The bust is perfect. The armhole openings are perfect. It‚Äôs comfortable and covers my ample rear end appropriately. The fabric is soft and has nice movement. I would feel very comfortable at my age wearing this out with leggings. I may be older, but I dont have to dress older. Would I puchase this again?  You bet and based on the reviews I felt very comfortable ordering a couple more when I ordered this one. Size right. Color as pictured and speed of light delivery. I love it."
5.0,"Great fabric. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 155 pounds, large is perfect.  Green is dark, almost gray - wish it was more of a hunter green for holidays."
5.0,Very comfortable shoe with a nice style to them and the correct amount of support.  I was able to wear them all day without any discomfort and I tend to be difficult when it comes to the fit of a shoe.  Appears very well constructed and has a nice tread pattern for hiking.  I didn't get into too much water but they do seem to be water resistant as advertised.
5.0,So soft and the size was spot on. I ended up ordering this in 4 different colors.
5.0,"THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE AND THE SIZE IS PERFECT. IF THEY ARE NOT AUTHENTIC, THEY LOOK AUTHENTIC.  I LOVE THEM!"
5.0,"Well made and well fitting.  I‚Äôm generally a S/M and ordered the 46, which fits slightly oversized with room to layer (if in doubt size up, you wouldn‚Äôt want this tight).  It‚Äôs warm without being too warm.  For very cold temps it might be a little on the light side.  Probably not the best for very wet weather, but great for a not sub-zero climate with snow or occasional rain+ umbrella.  Stitching, zipper, and other details are nice quality.  There‚Äôs a funny little round anchor logo/rubber patch on the left sleeve (copying Canada Goose styling?). I could do without that but it‚Äôs pretty subtle.  Bear in mind it‚Äôs not down-filled, despite the title language."
5.0,Perfect for my friend
5.0,"Beautiful earrings! Just as described, I love them!"
5.0,Nursing staff really loved these
5.0,"These are so good that I purchased my second pair after having worn the first out after several years.  I swim a lot, so I needed a great pair of goggles at a reasonable price, and these are perfect!"
5.0,"Loved the  necklace, came just as expected. Gave it as a gift to a fellow Dr. Who fan and she absolutely loved it!"
5.0,Love this dress! Comfortable and beautiful.
5.0,Excelente sujeci√≥n
5.0,Really love them.  Great fit and very breathable.  I just ordered another set.<br />Fashionable and great for workouts in the cool weather.
5.0,"I absolutely adore this dress! It's a little clingy being polyester, but with a slip it's just fine. This hits me right at the knee, and I'm wearing a medium. For reference I'm 5'9, 150lbs, 34DD, and I usually purchase a medium because I don't like things tight at my bust.<br />I usually wear a size 4 pant, a 6-8 dress, and 8 blazer.<br />If you're looking for something lightweight, and perfect for spring (meaning still enough coverage to keep you warm on chilly spring days), this is a great option. I'd definitely recommend it."
5.0,So far it‚Äôs been pretty durable and vibrant
5.0,My mom exactly a braselete like this one but hers is much larger so I was searching for an identical one.<br />I found it!!!<br />Thank you!
5.0,My son loves these. Fits as expected.
5.0,Great fit and so adorable
5.0,I love these straps its goes so well with my handbag and thickness is great
5.0,Love them sugar skulls are my favorite got to have anything with skulls
5.0,"Love! Flattering, fits well without showing every lump and bump. Beautiful color. Size small, 5'1"", 123 lbs."
5.0,"I bought this cord for my girlfriend---she was looking for a necklace cord that didn't get caught in long hair. It doesn't get caught, and is otherwise comfy and versatile. She wears it every day with no trouble."
5.0,"This functional bag zips out around the sides and bottom for expansion meaning that you really have two bags depending on the gear you are packing. I use it daily in the city, carrying ear buds in a case, sunglasses in a case, and sometimes a kindle or gloves.  I have used it on international trips to carry my passport, kindle, small toothbrush, and other items.  I own 4 or 5 such bags and find I use this one more often."
5.0,I love them!! I can't wait for it to get cold so I can try them out!!
5.0,"Very nice, one consecutive string, can be worn around neck, wrist, and such. The color is very nice, true to picture."
5.0,Very pretty soft and fuzzy but too big. I wear a 7. This pair is an extra large. Always check the size with the colors that are available. Some sizes may not have the color you want. I know better. But they are for the house so I'm good.
5.0,These are great. Seem pretty well-built and fun. The mirrored lenses add extra fun.<br />Dark so for bright sunshine. Had to buy lighter ones too add to my collection.
5.0,"I loved this set, the only issue I had was that the pants were a little baggy.  But no biggie...I sew. So issue resolved."
5.0,"I own tons of shoes and this are by faaaaar the most comfortable shoes I have ever had in my life. I order then for my trip to New York and they are amazing in was on my feet for 9 hours walking all around the city and my feet never got tired or cold, and they look great too."
5.0,This is currently my favorite dress in my closet. Fits great and long enough to sneak leggings under if it's cold. I can tell I'll get a lot of use out of it.
5.0,These hoops are super cute and aren‚Äôt too big or too small ! They‚Äôre medium sized and look great with black or beige tops !
5.0,Love the fabric. Fit very well and comfortable.
5.0,I bought this as my own personal robe. Love the above knee length and blue color.
5.0,"very pretty colors, nice length"
5.0,"Fits as advertised.  Arms and wast length is spot on.  I've washed it in cold water 4 times now, dried it in the dryer and there hasn't been any stretching or shrinking.  It's a medium weight shirt good for every season but summer."
5.0,"Exactly what it was advertised to be! Love it, and its the perfect size."
5.0,"Got this for my granddaughter and she loves it! It's sooo cute and the name is lettered in perfectly. Your kid will love it! It's better for a girl , than boy."
5.0,"I live in the country. Work in my yard alot, this is comfortable,  warm but not too heavy to be hot. Perfect feel, soft."
5.0,lightweight and practical
5.0,The straps fall off my daughter‚Äôs shoulders but luckily they‚Äôre long enough to crisscross and tie them that way so they stay up. Perfect dress for spring.
5.0,C√°liz
5.0,"Material was thicker than I thought, but I was very happy for that because I wore it for Easter and it was a bit chilly. Fit was perfect I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 145lbs and I ordered Medium. Got many many compliments on this dress. Everyone loved the bottom cut outs"
5.0,"Always remember order a size up when it comes to compression shirts. I'm a medium so I ordered Large. Good thing to, yes it was tight and with the right tightness. It hugged my muscles and moved with me. the material doesn't feel like under armour it feels like something else not sure what it is but really good quality."
5.0,"Fabulous material, great length and pockets are deep. Will definitely get another pair!"
5.0,"These tank tops are thick and are of real good quality. They do fit snug and that's the purpose. I wear mine for casual wear from working out to lounging around the house. I have many of those Papi square tanks and they are made very thin and they all are nearly stretched out after some wear and tear. MY ONLY WISH is that they offer more of a variety color pack. I would love to see a 2 pack which included 1 red and 1 black tank or a 3 pack with black, red and turquoise."
5.0,"Very comfortable,<br />Really fits well, read the size chart ,not just the size you normally wear!"
5.0,"Pretty happy with the tubular mask. It seemed a little small at first but the material is stretchy. It stretches to fit over my head, then goes back to normal once around my neck. It stays up over my nose and mouth easily enough, but is loose enough around my neck to almost forget it's there when not using it.<br /><br />The skull design is great, and is inked into the fabric, not printed on top with the stuff that always cracks and flakes off. Should last longer this way.<br /><br />Was disappointed at first because I thought I was getting two tubular masks, when it's actually one tube and one bandana. But I guess I just read the description wrong."
5.0,It's a bit thick and nice design.
5.0,This was a terrific find. The dress is beautiful and fit well.
5.0,"this is a beautiful, lightweight, feminine watch , I wear mine everyday .  Great price & great Bulova"
5.0,feels warm.
5.0,We have received this item but we have not actually used it yet.  It is going to be a Christmas gift but this item does appear to be good quality.
5.0,Totally cute and came right on time
5.0,Fits perfect and it‚Äôs beautiful
5.0,We ordered several kimono gowns and this was the smallest---a perfect size to bring him home from the hospital.  His name was monogrammed down the front.  Adorable!
5.0,The only thing I don't like it don't have Michael Kors on the band.
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. This is a great easy piece."
5.0,This jacket fits great.  Love the draping open front and scrunched sleeves.  Perfect for business meeting or dinner with friends.
5.0,I am so in love with this purse. It is way better than the picture showed it be. It has plenty of room for all of my stuff and the handles are big enough for me to carry it on my shoulder.
5.0,Great material used very flexible and breathable
5.0,They look good and are good eye coverage for the price. I guess I am not used to polarized lenses so they did take some getting used to.
5.0,I love everything about this bonnet. It's big enough to go over my curlers. Very comfy and stays in place. Highly recommend
5.0,Excellent product. Be aware that the pin is small as advertised.
5.0,My daughter used this for her Demon Slayer cosplay at last week's Anime Los Angeles expo.  She was able to walk the whole day with no discomfort.  Great fit and great price.
5.0,The dress is EVERYTHING!!!
5.0,It's light weight and comfortable. I thought the color would be a tad darker. But I still like it.
5.0,Its perfect for my bracelet!
5.0,"Love this, but wish I‚Äôd sized down!  I wear an 8 in clothes and bought the L and I could easily have gotten the small."
5.0,This was a great buy looked exactly like the image and great quality
5.0,"I was initially a bit irritated by the seller because they sent this requiring a signature which was mildly annoying HOWEVER, this ring and others I purchased from same manufacturer were awesome. This one in particular is just lovely, so much so that I'm buying another one for a different finger so I can wear it with different combinations of rings. Very pleased with the quality and fit."
5.0,For the price they are great. They fit pretty well and look more expensive than they are. You could pop a lens out pretty easy with a little pressure so you might not want to store them in your pocket but they hold up to daily wear okay.
5.0,Perfect fit. Can beat the price.
5.0,"Five stars for the price. If it was more expensive I'd probably knock it down to 4. I was quite impressed to get a bathing suit this cute for this price. I did hear a few threads ripping though as I put it on (not from being too tight), so I'm not sure how it'll hold up. I can't wait to wear it on vacation."
5.0,My son loves them. They look cute on his face. My husband now wants a pair. Came in a plastic case.
5.0,Good for kids at school when they need their id and a couple of bucks to carry around.  Good quality and easy on the eyes. Love it!
5.0,Loved it...so good
5.0,Love this. It was a little too big ( 5'4 140lb) but I just tied as tight as I could and in the back because the size I needed was sold out. That worked fine!
5.0,The Gramicci Men's Rockin Sport Pants fit as per expectations (and as usual). Look good for all occasions.
5.0,"The first coat that came in had some issues like the zipper being on the wrong side, and the pockets not being deep enough... I contacted them and they were back in touch with me the next day trying to fix the issue.  They replace the coat with another one with deeper pockets and with the zipper on the right side.  They work quickly and pleasantly.  They were terrific to work with.  I sent back the first coat and that was it.  I give these folks 5-Starts to work with and do recommend their products which are really well made.  I have seen coats/jackets just like the one I have selling in outlet stores in Park City, and other areas around Salt Lake City for close to $1,000, or in some cases even more.<br /><br />I was not sure if the coat was waterproofed, so I did look for the best waterproofing materials.  I decided on Nikwax Nubuck & Suede Spray-On Waterproofer.  I purchased two (2) bottles, but needed an additional two (2) bottle to complete the job properly.  Nubuck allows the leather to breath, and the water just runs off.<br /><br />Great Product."
5.0,Bought it for my grandson. Holding up pretty good.
5.0,Beautiful colors in the mermaid scales case! Sturdy case that is sleek and seems like it will be fairly protective!
5.0,really cute!  Great service
5.0,Beautiful and my grandson likes it very much
5.0,I got this pair of night glasses two days ago. They turned out better then expected. I was amazed at the quality of the frames. I was expecting a light fragile frame. They were far from it. The lenses slipped out easily and the new ones went in flawless. They are just perfect for the price. I would highly recommend these glasses for anyone who is active and wants make best out of his/her budget.
5.0,"Fits perfect, very comfy"
5.0,this hat is so AWESOME !!! I've gotten so many compliments on it !!! thank you !!!
5.0,I purchased this infinity scarf and am delighted with its beauty. It matches a blouse I have and it looks very elegant with it. The scarf is delicate and has sort of a scallop type edging . It came in a number of colors. I ordered it last week and it came very promptly.
5.0,Very fashionable. Looks great on.
5.0,These are great eyewear retainers. They fit my glasses well and are easy to put on. The quick adjustment is nice as well. Fast shipping and follow up service is awesome!
5.0,This shirt fit me really well!! I got a large because I do have DD and i wanted them to fit in the shirt and it fits all around perfectly. I really love this shirt. The material is nice and it does not look cheap as I thought it would because of the price I paid.
5.0,The black ring with the blue inset looked almost exactly like my husband‚Äôs wedding ring.
5.0,Got this for a gift and she loved it! They are so pretty.
5.0,I purchased these to wear under a white/gold jacket to am event.I  wore both camis with the white cami on top and received several compliments.  They were soft and comfortable.
5.0,Just what I expected. Soft and warm. Delivered right on time
5.0,Beautiful they look just like the pictures. And I'm overall happy with the quality of the rings
5.0,"Very expensive looking, great quality I have received lots of compliments"
5.0,"Cute , fresh looking  , but alittle thinner than I prefer ."
5.0,This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She absolutely loved it.
5.0,I have had trouble purchasing boots online. They are usually way to large in the calf area. I have small calves.  These boots are a perfect fit on me.  They do run large. I usually wear a 7 but ordered 6.5 and they are perfect and comfortable. I can tuck my jeans in with no problems and are roomy in the foot area.
5.0,"I got this belt to wear with my black jumper.  Such a great choice.  Wore the jumper on a cruise.  I had over a dozen potential different looks, many with this belt."
5.0,This toe ring is adorable and very well made.  Extremely comfortable and flattering.  My daughter keeps trying to take it from me so I don't ever take it off!  Absolutely love it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
5.0,"I like these for my daily riding socks. It‚Äôs fun that they come with an ‚Äúextra‚Äù sock, so I suggest buying 2 pair, so then it‚Äôs actually 3 pair. Thick bit not bulky. I couldn‚Äôt wear thin in my show boots, would definitely be too tight. Arrived quickly"
5.0,I loved it. Very pretty - I wore it on a cashmere sweater to a holiday party.  I would buy again for a friend.
5.0,Very tiny! The size isn't just referring to the stone...The post & back are extremely small too. I can barely use this for my 4th lobe holes.
5.0,nice comfortable band
5.0,Very warm. I use these to commute for over an hour on my motorcycle on cold mornings and nights. They are much warmer than my Harley Davidson winter gloves. My fingers have yet to experience bitter cold even in 40¬∞ weather. They‚Äôre bulky and I‚Äôve not been able to successfully use the touch screen fingers but I use these for motorcycling and not updating Facebag so that‚Äôs not a problem for me. They do what they‚Äôre supposed to do at a very reasonable price.
5.0,LOVE this ring!  Soooo cute!  I would buy it again and again!  (And I probably will since family owns doxies.)
5.0,Surgery
5.0,great for the money!!!!1
5.0,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them so much. She has received many compliments and everyone wants to know were she got them. They fit perfectly and are quite comfortable. They didn't shrink or fall apart after I washed them. I received them right on time and they were packaged perfectly. I'm glad I bought these and my daughter is very satisfied.
5.0,Was happy with the bracelet looks very elegant
5.0,"This is super cute, comes on a long chain, and looks like a blue turkey! It goes with almost anything, and is perfect for the holidays. It's definitely a talking piece among co-workers and friends. I love it, it has made a few of my friends laugh. If you are looking for something that is cute but silly, this is going to be so you!"
5.0,"Great quality. Good construction,but not heavy. Very comfortable. Would buy them again."
5.0,I love this! Super cute.<br />Thick fabric.
5.0,"So cute and perfect lenght. Clean termination, does not have any pinchy ends or anything similar"
5.0,Makes apple watch look nice when I don‚Äôt want to be so sporty.  Great band.

5.0,"Very comfortable, unusual shoes."
5.0,I love Aaliyah so I threw.my fiance a 90's theme party and my daughter wanted to dress alike n so I got her one too.. We Love them n they fit comfortably. I went up a size so it would fit loose n went down a size for her XL
5.0,These earrings are subtlely elegant . Unfortunately I didn't pay attention to the size so will have to return them as they are smaller than I wanted . They would be perfect for a young girl as was clearly stated in the information . Thank you for your prompt delivery . I won't hesitate to to buy from you in the future . This is the second review I have written . Apparently the first wasn't published .
5.0,I love  fit well and I love the color

5.0,got it for my boyfriend. fits great

5.0,Bought these to give every one on my pool team a Christmas present. Everyone loved them
5.0,"Size up! I am usually a L and ordered XL. They are PERFECT! They are SO comfortable, and amazing, I haven't taken them off since I got them! They're VERY flattering (much more so than you'd think) and they don't drag even without hemming for us short people. TBH I will probably be purchasing more of these pants for lazy days and yoga, and I will probably buy them as gifts as well! THEY ARE THAT AMAZING!"
5.0,I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...
5.0,Very easy to assemble. Allows plenty of ventilation and light... Great price too
5.0,"This little book bag was perfect for my niece who is a dinosaur lover. Looks exactly like the picture but is a great size to put snacks, toys, and tablets!"
5.0,"These worked great for my seven year old son. Super easy to pull on and off. And, so far (about 4 months) they are holding up very well against a 7 yr old boy during summer. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,Fits a little bigger than I expected but still works!
5.0,Matches a leather jacket I have and it looks great on
5.0,Shirt was a perfect fit. I am between XL & XXL which makes finding a well fitting shirt next to impossible. This shirt was an absolute perfect & is one of the best album/album covers around.
5.0,I got the black rose belly button ring for my best friend as a birthday present and she absolutely loves it.
5.0,Love them even though the dye bleed a little when we cleaned them with alchol
5.0,This is so beautiful so comfortable! I didn't want to spend a lot of money and saw this on sale never thought the quality would be so nice. I will be ordering more of this brand. Really a pleasure to wear !
5.0,"Very nice fibers, not too thin. Looks exactly like the photo. I want one in every color now!"
5.0,Just like the picture. It is nice and light. A stylish lanyard.
5.0,Great price for Great Reading Sunglasses

5.0,"This was great for the end of summer/fall weather in the desert. Very comfortable and the size, fits just right."
5.0,Loved the fit. Very comfortable. Good material
5.0,Keeps my jewelry looking brand new. Used it today to clean silver drop earrings. Beautiful shine.
5.0,I was very impressed with the the design.  The earrings are well made and look very beautiful when worn. The stones remind you of another crystal we know and love.
5.0,Works great. I wear them all day inside. Helps with the bright light.
5.0,It is very cute and well worth the cost.
5.0,"Fits nice, and quite comfortable."
5.0,"LOVIN' this top, it's EVERYTHING. So perfect it will go with a few things giving a few styles, shorts, black skinny's, and jeans :) The material is light weight and breathable, it's not see through which is great. I found the sizing to run true to size, I ordered a Small and it fit just as I hoped, I'm, 32 DD, 100lbs and 5'3&quot;. The back sits a little longer, the front is long enough to be tucked in. The elastic around the sleeves are awesome, not the cheap kind your sleeves will be staying in place.  I'm usually not a fan of the off the shoulder style I find to be uncomfortable but this is very comfy and even with lifting arms and moving around this shirt stays in place. All the smocking was done clean cut, and even. I can't believe I only paid $8 for this shirt."
5.0,"lounging, running around town--maybe yoga if in the mood"
5.0,"Watch strap came on time, had great packaging, and even better customer service.  The owner actually takes the time to write a personalized note at the bottom of the invoice/receipt to show appreciation for the customer.  Many times, these types of notes are obviously prewritten or copied and pasted with a signature (still a good gesture), but not this company - he definitely takes it the extra mile.  To most people, everything in the packaging is erroneous of the contents but I am a believer in taking care of the customer.  I will continue purchasing from this company in the future as well as referring others to do the same.<br /><br />Back to the topic at hand, the straps are really great quality canvas/cotton with a nice leather backing on the inside so that your sweat and oils etc won't damage the band from within as quickly as with others.  The choice of buckles used is a neat design as well, giving an even more sturdy and masculine appearance.  The strap I bought (tan digital camo) came with a spring bar tool as well as two quick-release spring bars so that the band can be changed quickly.  Being that they are great quality straps, I will most deifinitely be needing the quick-change option as I will be purchasing other styles as well to diversify my collection. I would equate the quality of these straps closely with Shinola's Filson Mackinaw Chronograph straps or even some Breitling factory military style straps.<br /><br />The only feedback that I have is the fact that the length is a tiny bit short (not short enough to warrant return) but this is only a pet peeve of mine because I like to have the buckle somewhat loose so that I can position my watch further back on my wrist, so it would be nice if there were options for different lengths and not just widths.<br /><br />I have had the strap less than a week and I'm already contemplating which one to buy next.  I can see these ending up surviving long enough for when I pass my watches on later in life.<br /><br />Watches are different for everyone and more than not people tend to"
5.0,Bright Vibrant colors! Soft material
5.0,"I love this backpack!!!! It's super cute, the color is great! It's not too big or too small I think it's a perfect size!"

5.0,i‚Äôve had this in for a few months now and it hasn‚Äôt turned color or irritated my skin at all! I have super sensitive skin when it comes to jewelry so i‚Äôm very impressed. It also doesn‚Äôt poke or hurt you on the edges anywhere!
5.0,The photos do not do justice to it. It is so beautiful and detailed. So glad that I got it
5.0,"This ""Lcherry Good Luck Elephant Charm Bracelet Evil Eye Handmade Red Cord Ajustable Bracelet Friendship Gifts for Women"" works very well as a gift! I got this as a gift for a friend and she loves it. She is a huge fan of elephants, so this fits her very well. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Very happy with item, thank you!"
5.0,"I was looking for a wide headband that would not be too tight so I could wear it the entire day.  I love the fabric these are made of.  They are very comfortable and stay in place.  I did not use them to workout so I'm not sure about how well they absorb, but my impression would be that they work very well."
5.0,Oh I like the quality of the earrings.
5.0,My husband really loved this bag. He uses it when he goes to the gym

5.0,"Love it ! Same style and fit I was looking for ,  but much less than the boutique brands or options.  Buttons non Functional . I‚Äôm 5ft 2 . Large fit great"
5.0,"I have no complaints. Its super simple, literally dummy proof, it a perfect addition to poker nights with the guys. And it looks and feels well made"
5.0,"I am very pleased with this pair of readers! The case alone is worth the price...They are a little more subtle in colortone than I expected with most of the splotchy detailing being evident on the arm pieces rather than on the front of the frame. However, there is just enough so that they do not look solid brown but have almost a dark plum undertone.I am pleased with the quality overall and happy to add them to my collection of readers!"
5.0,My uncle love it the sleeve a little long
5.0,"First time ordering from this company. I purchased a bathing suit and 2 dresses. I will definitely be ordering from them again. Great quality, fit perfect!"
5.0,"Excellent wallet!  Items usually kept in the wallet--cards, ids, etc fit in easily and are easy to find because the wallet opens completely and has so many storage spots."
5.0,"This fits our long, skinny guy perfectly. I love that it has fold-over mittens AND footies. Super soft material that has held up well with washing."
5.0,this works great for my watch.
5.0,"Very cute, easy to put in & take off!"
5.0,Gorgeous! Gorgeous! And I like that the chain is long! I hate when chains are too short and feel like a choker. This one is perfect!

5.0,Bought this for my daughter as she has long hair and she loves it!!!!
5.0,its so cute omg i love it so much its a bit small but still so cute love love love

5.0,I really like the material and how breathable it is.
5.0,Much later than I expected it to be I thought it might be some sort of scratchy stiff lace but it's very silky feeling and much more attractive in person
5.0,"I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 32A cup.  This cover fits very well!"
5.0,"Excelente calidad y precio, le dio nueva vida a mi reloj, muy recomendables los extencibles de este vendedor."
5.0,OMG I LOVE IT!! Love it! Love it! Love it!!<br />It feels amazing!! It has a soft inside so it doesn‚Äôt get sweaty with my scarf. It is a comfortable fit as I am petite but have a wide short neck.<br />It‚Äôs resilient but def not made for rough play.<br /><br />I have a seven month old baby that loves to pull  on it. VERY strongly. He did that everyday twice a day for two months. The links did  start to separate just a bit (insert broken heart and crying emoji).  BUT! I just press down on the links with a tool  and they went right back together.<br />Hubby loves it! Even my mom loves it LMAO.<br /><br />I would definitely buy again and again and again.

5.0,"Very nice blouse,<br />Love the lace sleeves."
5.0,"This product fits just as I expected. I ordered a medium. I'm 5""1 with a 36D bust and the medium was perfect for me. The sweater is loose fitting and it goes just to my waist. It's very flattering and I find that the style of the sweater elongates my legs. The material is also very soft and cozy. It's a very comfortable sweater."

5.0,I love SOJO Vision sunglasses!!!!!!!!!! They are the best!!!!

5.0,"Some of the most comfortable underwear I've ever bought.  They have just enough spandex to give them an excellent, movable fit yet have enough support to contain the one-eyed monster very nicely.  They are holding up well in the washer too."
5.0,Bought this for rolling and transporting lead apron at work in hospital - wanted a lightweight alternative to $100+ bags that lack compression straps like this has. Tested it at home and it looks like it will work well - so far its exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"Works for my glasses, check the dimensions.  Got a less dark pair for driving on cloudy days.  Came as promised."

5.0,"Beautiful, delicate necklace. I gave it to a friend as a retirement gift and she loved it."
5.0,"Absolutely love these! Cheap but stylish. I have a young daughter so expensive sunglasses wont happen for awhile. These do the job and are something you can thrash around, Or keep nice! I like that the &#34;stone&#34; designs aren't really stones! Cant lose them if they aren't there."
5.0,Esta s√∫per linda
5.0,Great for youth.
5.0,Fits as expected but more for slip size person
5.0,It's very lovely - and price was right!
5.0,"Very comfortable! Good quality for the price, would recommend."
5.0,Most HP patches are way too large. This pin is the right size for a baseball cap or even a jacket.
5.0,"This is an absolutely great watch for the price with simple functionality. Currently also my second Perfect Date watch after the Yacht Racer, also from TImex. Build quality is also good, solid watch with a large enough face to read all the sub-text.<br /><br />Setting the Perfect Date function is also quite simple and unfortunately, it's receiving low star rating here just due to the problem persons face trying to set it.<br /><br />To VIEW the Perfect Date: Press the crown in and release it. The red hand will then progress to the date along with the subdial moving to the day then return to their original positions. Date is shown on the outer bezel appx half of the watch face.<br />***It should be noted that the Perfect Date function would only work if the top left chronograph subdial is pointing at ""TIME"" and not at one of the numbers. To get this pointer to ""TIME"", press the left button until the pointer is at TIME***<br /><br />SETTINGS<br />To set the regular time, pull the crown out and set as with any normal watch.<br />To SET the Perfect Date: Set the time back/forward accordingly. Eg. If when you press for the date and it shows one day ahead, turn BACK the time 12hrs going past what would be midnight and back to the current time. Conversely do the same if it's showing a day behind.<br />Then just press the crown (perfect date) button again to confirm it now shows the right date.<br />The date is usually just a day off and if setting the date in the afternoon that usually fixes the issue.<br /><br />Top left subdial shows chronograph functions and can be cycled through by pressing the button on the left side of the watch. Start/Stop for the chronograph would be the top right button.<br /><br />Overall it's a unique watch and one of the more ""simple"" complications from Timex once you get used to it."
5.0,Its beautiful but I'm hoping that it won't rip it's just like a sports bra but it has a cute design in the back. The passing is a little pointy on your breast love it..

5.0,"I‚Äôm rating it 5 despite having returned it. I just loved the material and style. Just that the size I chose was big for me and the remaining options I saw, I couldn‚Äôt figure out which one would be the right one for me. It‚Äôs still on my wishlist and I may go ahead and order another size. It was way better than my expectations"

5.0,"Boy these gloves are cool.  Over are the days of dirt under my nails.  They pack some major digging power while keeping my hands clean!  So easy! The plastic fingers are really thick and sturdy.  As my husband suggested, they might even be handy for intruders, if you could put it on fast enough; though, I think I will stick with just using them in my vegetable garden."

Definitely going to order other designs, great product for the price!!"

5.0,this is my favorite item out of all my twilight items.
5.0,"Purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  Was somewhat apprehensive as several of the reviews were negative.  This product fit perfectly and is exactly as shown in photo. My daughter loves a Nightmare before Christmas.  Finding memorabilia that is different and not something she already has was difficult. When I saw this on Amazon I had to get it.  She wears it all the time and loves it.  The material is soft and comfy.  It holds up well when washed.  She look so cute in it. The package came on time, new, not used good quality material."

5.0,great for man size 13 foot
5.0,"Really love it! I'm 190cm high and 105 kg weight and ordered 3xl because i thought that high temperature in dry heater would shrink it. On my surprise after drying not a single cm was shrunk. 2xl would be perfect size for me, but in this size (3xl) I feel really comfortable, and is very pleasant on skin. If I or somebody else ever needed this underwear 10/10 will recommend!! Thank you! Bojan"

5.0,"I‚Äôve got a lot of Chet, and most of it is just great. But nothing beats this one. The group is outstanding, the recording quality is excellent, and Chet is at his best. His trumpet playing was never better, and although his voice has taken a beating for sure, the musicality of his singing is still just amazing."
5.0,"My wife loved the boots.  They are very good quality, and I am very happy with my order."
5.0,Bought these for my sons party and kids loved them. Not only did the kids wear them though but the adults did too. We had fun. They are very sturdy and do not break.

5.0,"quite lovely, a gift given and much apreciated"
5.0,"D1.  Easily took 2 seconds off his 40 time, increased his vertical by 7‚Äù, and immediately added 27lbs of pure muscle.  If you want your kid to dominate - get this jersey."
5.0,"I love the way this top looks with anything high waisted. I ended up pairing it with shorts and overalls. It was the cutest outfit even my husband thought I looked good!! Really boosted my self-confidence. Heads up, its a thinner material so don't even think about wearing a bra under it. I slapped on some pasties and called it good!"
5.0,roll a bit
5.0,"Arrived fast without any damage, looks great placed in a small card box. Purchased as a gift, most likely they will love it, I know I do."

5.0,"I already had a pair of these shorts, so I knew what to expect.  They are simple and comfortable.<br /><br />My only issue is I am too pale to wear the pink color!"
5.0,I used it for work.it works perfect for where I work!
5.0,"No one will know if you haven't shaved your pits in weeks, yet taking off your bra in this is easy. If you get cold, people will know--it's thin but not too thin where it's uncomfortably revealing. Not transparent. I am ordering more!!!"
5.0,"This dress is so so cute! I am a US 8/10, 5‚Äô7‚Äù and the medium is perfect but with plenty of room to be very comfortable. Hits about mid thigh. Definitely needs a good steam before wearing, especially the sleeves. It may not hold up for all I know but if I get one good wear out of it for a Christmas themed engagement party coming up I‚Äôll be happy!"
5.0,Bought for my granddaughters 7th birthday!! She loved it very soft and comfortable!!!
5.0,"So far, my daughter is extremely happy with her new hat. She lost her last one that was almost identical to this one. She commented that this one was much more snug and fit her better...at a great price too!! Would purchase this product again!"
5.0,I LOOOOOVE these!! They fit great and are super comfortable.
5.0,"The belt is a beautiful addition to my wardrobe! Pair it with a basic back dress for an edgy look. I selected a small and it's perfect-- my dress size is 4-6. I'd assume this would work for a size 7-8 as well since it is a corset belt and adjusts nicely. PROS: quality for the price is good, shows off curves, feminine, and sexy"
5.0,The color is the perfect mustard yellow and the fit was just as expected
5.0,"Very comfy, not too tight, full coverage. Love the detail on the back. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"super vcute good quality, exactly what i expected"
5.0,Great accent product!
5.0,I order the Y-PAIR and the are absolutely awesome. I work in an enviorment where I sometimes have to run and had no issues with them coming off (which can be pretty painful).  They are made very well and do not slip as the day progresses. Can't beat the quality or the price. Great product!
5.0,Fits as expected. Very soft & comfy. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"Very nice leather belt. This is not one of those cheap belts you get on-line where the top layer comes off after a couple of wears. This is a nicely made, nicely tooled leather belt. It has a good-looking light color, and a good solid buckle that is well-secured to the leather.  This is a size 36 and is true to the size. Good buy."
5.0,"Haven‚Äôt had a chance to wear this yet, but I‚Äôm super impressed by the quality of material used. Can‚Äôt wait for fall/winter!"
5.0,Justo lo que pedi

5.0,I'm 5'2 and 130 lbs it fits perfect
5.0,"I love this bag! It‚Äôs perfect. Easy to clean, spacious, and the over the shoulder strap is long enough to use that Tik Tok backpack trick. It has a tiny pocket separate from the rest of the back that holds a back up charger pack with a cord that connects to it so you can charge your phone."
5.0,I love this bra. I need a larger band size and smaller cup size. Not that easy to find. But this brand fits the bill. And it's very pretty. Will be ordering some more colors.
5.0,"Love the dress. Bought a small, but a bit boobie and shorter than expected. Very nice dress loved it for the beach"

5.0,Swift wick makes the best socks!
5.0,Beautiful product. Fast shipping.
5.0,"Great quality! I I ordered the largest size and it fits everywhere but but the breast area, barely.<br />So if you're over a 34C I don't recommended getting thsi shirt or else you'll have a boob gap"

5.0,"The Reef Draftsman has great arch support, much more than other flip flops I have had in the past, even including other Reef models.  Color was as shown in the picture.  Seem to be well constructed and good material.  No complaints so far."

5.0,they seem good  to me only wore them twice
5.0,"Beautiful, fit perfect and the price was great!!! If I purchased this dress in a store it would have cost 6 times the price!!!"
5.0,"Watch performs fantastic, however the original band broke off.  Replaced it with a black metal bracelet band and it's better than new. Five stars after this modification."
5.0,Love that my daughter can use the zipper easily. Love that they work with her AFO brace.
5.0,I could have gone with a smaller size the L i chose the xl but i wear size 10
5.0,Adds just the right sparkle
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this vest! I use it while out riding and it's super comfy, easy to move in, and not heavy to wear. It also has lots of pockets which is nice when you're out riding and don't have as much space for things like lip gloss or your phone lol. (It also looks super hot üòâ)"
5.0,I bought these for my husband.  He said the warmest pants he ever had.  Not very flattering but very cozy and warm.
5.0,"Fits great, doesn't slip and doesn't rub! Very comfortable for the active person."
5.0,Great find!  Fits perfectly..  it is shiney so it‚Äôs a bit formal.
5.0,"I love this dress. It's super stretchy. I'm 5'1&#34; and have a big bust so I was worried it wouldn't look good on me. But it is not see through when it stretches and it is so cute! I wish the bottom had a stitch on it because I worry over time it will fray but so far has held up great. Super pretty and bright, and also very comfortable!"
5.0,"These socks are thick and warm, with soft edges that do not tighten your ankles. And, of course, no sliding"
5.0,"After finding a pair of 90 Degree By Reflex Leggings at T.J. Maxx and LOVING them, I was thrilled to see that they so many styles available on Amazon too (for almost the same price as T.J.Maxx). I went ahead and bought 4 different styles at the same time to compare.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Here is a list of the 4 styles I purchased:<br />-Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small<br />-Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small<br />-Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S<br />-High Waist Power Flex Legging ‚Äì Tummy Control - Black Small<br />-----------------------------------------<br />BODY TYPE: I am 5'4 135 pounds, very pear shaped.<br />I want my leggings to be multi-functional, meaning I want to be able to wear them around the house, around town, to work out, to hike, and under my ski clothes.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S:<br />These are the same ones I bought from T.J. Maxx, and they are the perfect capri length for me. I would say the waist is mid-rise too, which is very flattering for most women. Have good compression, but are still very comfortable! I love these in the summer too, since they are capris they look really cute with sandals.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small:<br />These are the only pair from the 4 I purchased that I am returning, and also the most inexpensive. While the material is very soft and comfortable, it is mostly cotton, with not nearly enough &#34;give&#34; for my taste. They are also EXTREMELY long. If you are very tall and thin, go for these. I personally thought they were to snug around my calves, and way too long to look normal on me.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />High Waist Power Flex Legging ‚Äì Tummy Control - Black Small:<br />These are AWESOME! Highly recommend! The length is a tad long, but the minor bunching at my ankles doesn't bother me one bit. The high waist is comforting on those days when you want a little extra help keeping everything in. Very comfortable and good compression, and stay tight all day. Absolutely buying another pair of these.<br />-----------------------------------------<br />-Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small:<br />These are also great versatile leggings! I would say the waist is mid-rise, which is very flattering for me and most women.Length is the same on the high waisted, just a small bit of bunching at the bottom for me, but I don't mind it at all. Good compression, and stay tight all day. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Haven't broken them yet so that's good.
5.0,I love this!  It‚Äôs beautiful!  I love that there are 4 different settings and so quiet.<br />I recommend!!
5.0,I love this shirt and what it means to me. I bought it for me so as a female it fits great
5.0,"Fit great, legs feel better after 12 hour shift!!"
5.0,"It's a little bit loose about the head, but it has a button, so it works out pretty well.  Daughter loves this thing.  It is really cute and she says it is warm too.  :)"
5.0,Works great to keep keys organized. One design for each bike.
5.0,great fabric. washes well. a few hanging threads but made well. slightly see through when wet.
5.0,"Got this oil for casual wear boots for work boots I use redwing naturseal and mink oil. This oil has a nice neutral scent, it applies easy and absorbs pretty quick. Not for suede leathers. It will darken your leather but after drying it lightens up a bit. It makes leather soft, it leaves a nice shine not overly shinny. It can be applied more often than mink oil. This oil is not for waterproofing is for protecting and conditioning the leather. It‚Äôs a natural blend it won‚Äôt harm your leather. I apply it every 3-4 weeks on my daily casuals; a little oil goes a long way don‚Äôt over saturate the leather or it won‚Äôt be able to breathe. Red wings, Irish setters and even some of my western boots get treated with this oil."
5.0,"Use for Apple Watch fits perfectly, looks good and inexpensive"
5.0,stylish but allowed at football games and concerts. great size - fits lots of stuff!
5.0,Super cute with all clothes
5.0,"This was a gift for a friend, I have one from another brand and this is way better quality than the one I have. Came in a bag and fluffed right up to be soft and plush."
5.0,"What do you get the man who has everything? What do you get a man when you have no clue what else to get him? Birthday, Christmas, Father's Day . . . Get him a tie or two and you're safe. Get him this set and you're extra safe, as these are two nice ties, but as an extra bonus they come in a lovely little package. I like the colors of these ties. I rarely wear ties and sometimes have to do so for sad occasions. For happier ones, the light colors here are nice to have around. I expect to have these for many years to come."
5.0,"this dress is great and fits perfect except.... its too short. i am 5'6"" and the dress hits at about my ankles. i would love for it to hit just above the floor or at least to my feet. i think i am going to hem it to just below my knee. i am giving this 5 stars still though because it is really nice thick fabric, comfortable, and well made, which is VERY hard to find on Amazon. Most of the clothes in this price range are so flimsy, see through and cheap."
5.0,I love it<br />I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it so much but it‚Äôs beyond beautiful
5.0,This is the second pair I have purchased. They are amazingly soft and comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them. True sizing compared to other like clothing. Enjoy
5.0,I got this bracelet for my 15 year old son and he said it was cool. I liked it very much.
5.0,Super comfy and the closest to the aligns at lululemon. Love the price and will honestly never buy lulus again.
5.0,"I am new to biking and these are my first biking shorts. I am pleased with how they fit, their comfort while riding, and the colors. Not only do you need the right pair of shorts, you will also need a comfortable bike seat. I endured the factory bike seat for 2 months before finally replacing it with a nicer, much more comfortable saddle. If you buy these shorts and still feel discomfort, give a few weeks. The sensitive tissue and sit bones need to build up their own endurance. If after a few weeks you are still uncomfortable, you might need to spend some money on a nicer seat. All in all, I am thrilled with this purchase and look forward to buying more as I become an avid bike rider."
5.0,Right thickness.  I like cause all I need to do is keep it clean.
5.0,These sunglasses sleeves were just what I was looking for.

5.0,"My daughter is 15 months old, and this dress fit perfectly with a lot of room to grow. It‚Äôs prettier than the picture. Soft and good fabric."
5.0,"I bought the ‚Äúmulticolor-red‚Äù dress and it is FABULOUS! I (nervously) followed the suggestions in some other reviews and ordered a size down and I couldn‚Äôt be happier that I did! I normally comfortably fit a size large (~160lbs, ~30‚Äù waist, ~36‚Äù bust) but I would have definitely been swimming in it and the medium fit perfectly. Am planning on purchasing another one of these dresses just in a different pattern!"
5.0,"Size up by one. Other than that, these are VERY comfortable!"
5.0,"It‚Äôs a good size for what my wife was looking for. Strap was adjustable which is a bonus. Can use Wristlet Clasp or use as a Clutch. Nice Red color is as pictured when it arrived, which is what she wanted! It is made of really good quality!<br />I put some leather conditioner on it for her since it is an envelope style purse and was a bit too stiff when we received it but with use she said it will relax a bit as well.<br />This was a perfect size to replace her Kate Spade Crossbody/Wristlet that was just a bit too small. She said it‚Äôs perfect and I am happy about that!!<br /><br />Wife also noted that the weight of this purse is better so it doesn‚Äôt fall off her shoulder as easily (crossbody style is a bonus) since she does not have to carry a lot with her anymore and our kids are now teenagers!"
5.0,Love this beautiful dress. Got many compliments about the color and fit. Wore dress to Church. Length is just right under the knee and fits very neatly.
5.0,This was perfect for a summer wedding
5.0,Cute as can be!  Arrived in excellent shape.

5.0,"I‚Äôve owned nearly 15 pairs of plastic-frame sunglasses that are identical to these and they all  would brake in the same areas.  This time around I spent the extra money to get metal frames and I can instantly tell the difference in quality.<br /><br />Also, the hard case for these sunglasses is a nice touch. Again, high quality for the price!"
5.0,took a little long to get but it looks great

5.0,Nice heavy watch. Looks great.
5.0,"I was surprised to see this hat is warmer and more flexible than the others I've been buying... I have so many but this is now my fav. It's thinner than some beanies, but it retains the heat better since the fluff inside is furry and not flat!"

5.0,Very grateful and happy with my order.
5.0,"The watch was already dated and timed; everything else was exactly what I was expected; it is the best Casio watch I have experienced and I have many Casio watches that have been on my wrist...!!!<br /><br />BUT, OLDER PERSONS Need ""LOUDER REMINDERS"", and MOST CLOCKS and/or WATCHES WILL NOT WORK - PLEASE, MAKE THEM LOUDER...!!!<br /><br />""Therm*Pro"" uses very good, louder ""REMINDERS""...!!!"

This chiffon casual blouse is just that.  Love the flowy feel without making you look like you're wearing a tent.  Specially liked the sleeves.  I've worn this with a pair of jeans as shown in the picture, but also dressed it up with a belt, high heals some long necklaces and a smile.  KILLER PRODUCT !"

5.0,The mask was so bright loves it was a hit
5.0,Very nice quality and for $11 who can complain. Fits really well
5.0,This band is much better than the rubber ones-you don't have to worry about it coming apart like those do. And adjusting the length by removing a link or 2 is really very easy.
5.0,I absolutely loved this shirt!  I should have purchased more than one.  Easy to put on even on the day of surgery!  Great find.
5.0,"Beautiful necklace. It is as expected. I would say that it is almost too shiny, but that's what makes me like it more. It is also of a good size."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my teen daughter. She's 5'3"" with a medium frame and the Small fits her as we expected. It's pretty and exactly the same colors as the pictures. It was snowy here when she received it, and she felt it kept her warm inside the house as well as outside with her winter coat. She likes the style that lands a little under her waistband on her jeans. Overall, pleased with the style, the fit, the quality, and the price."
5.0,Works great and I love it!  Fast delivery.
5.0,"This little bag is exactly what I was looking for.  It holds 2 pairs of glasses/cases, my wallet, keys and phone.  It's perfect."
5.0,good product and delivery is fast!
5.0,This bib is a life saver.  I don't have to worry about cleaning him up after he has eaten.  All the food goes in the bib catcher and not on his clothing or the floor.
5.0,Might need to wear something under with extra support.
5.0,"Being new to scrub caps, but suddenly required to wear them since April, I have tried many types. Hospital issued disposable ones, homemade ones, donated ones and others I bought online.<br />I had 2 favorites, the others were never quite right. I ordered this scrub cap recently as we are dealing with the second covid surge and my original ones are shredded.  Since the spring I've become somewhat of a scrub cap expert out of necessity.<br />This is honestly the best scrub cap I've worn! Highly recommend this!<br />I was wearing a headband under my caps, but this has one BUILT IN! Perfect!!!<br />It also has 2 buttons for mask straps, which none of my other caps have.<br />The fit is perfect, not too big or small. The ties are long enough as well.<br />It's well sewn, and looks durable.<br />I ordered another but I'm definitely ordering more!!<br />To top it off, there's a lovely note thanking me for purchasing from a small business."
5.0,Super comfortable and looks nice!
5.0,The day I got them I used them on a crochet project and they were amazing.  It really helps to mark the spot when you need it.
5.0,Very nice quality. Soft and durable.
5.0,Order up and perfect for travel
5.0,Fits perfectly on an iPhone 6s. It's so cute and retro. It feels sturdy too
5.0,Love it Love it Love it I'm a size 12/XL .I.ordered a women's 2X
5.0,Head wrap was perfect
5.0,"The product is as advertised it's a wonderful product .I would buy again. I would recommend it seems strong, sturdy, and a great design. Go for it."

5.0,Very conform.
5.0,Seems to be great quality. Definitely great coloring. Looks fancy and real.
5.0,Cute dress fits as expected
5.0,Did the job can't complain.
5.0,"I initially got these socks for my daughter but once I got them I realized that I could use them as well. I did receive these at a discount but I will be paying the full price, which by the way is pretty inexpensive for the amount that you get, and that way we have extras. They are cute with the designs that they have and I know my daughter loves them and they help her when she wears her shoes where wearing socks would look funny. These help her heel which has had blisters from the back and I am sure all girls can relate to that. So these protect her heel while also being cute so for her it was a plus and she was only willing to give me two pairs because she did like them so much. So it looks like I am going to have to purchase my own here very soon if I ever want more of these. Like I said before, they are inexpensive and they fit nice. They are not too tight that it hurts after many hours of wearing them the way that others might but they also are not too loose that they slip right off and end up at the bottom of the shoe. I like them and they fit both myself a size eight and a half and my daughter a size thirteen."
5.0,My 10 year old niece loves them!
5.0,Perfect for cleaning all my jewelry
5.0,My rook earring fell out and I had been putting hypo jewelry in it and my ear did not like that at all so I wen to wally world and bought some stainless steel jewelry from them. Only problem... it was like my piercing hole shrunk. I did not realize that the piece I was putting in was externally threaded but I just put the taper pin through the hole to stretch it a bit before inserting the earring. Worked like a charm.
5.0,"Gave 5 stars because this is good quality material and fit as expected.  It‚Äôs my fault for not thinking about the color contrast of the shirt I purchased.  If you want the words to stand out, would order any of the other choices besides the black lettering on purple.  Words are a bit hard to see unless up close."
5.0,"1st. So I ordered these socks & they said it wouldn't b here for alittle while & low & behold I got them 1 week later !!! Yayy !  2nd. There was a small chemical or new smell to them but out of there packaging for a couple min & they were fine!  3rd. I tried them on my lil guy & they seemed to fit nicely .( I did attach 3 pics ) 4th. They went directly below his knee & didn't seem to fall down when I let him move around for awhile . 5th.They were not to tight at all . He is 16 months 24 lbs & wears a 4 1/2 -5 toddler shoe , although he does have fat  feet lol  6th. After he moved around ali ttle wearing the sock I did notice as the 1 pic shows it got loose & slightly bunched around the heel , which means their ever so slightly big which to me is perfect because they should for him threw the winter . 7th. The colors r very nice & I can feel the wool in the sock  but not itchy their very nice . I would recommend them & I would buy them again !"
5.0,I really like that the bottom/ base of tote is not flimsy; and that there are multiple small compartments inside!
5.0,"I bought this for my niece who is a huge fan of Spirited Away. She was delighted to get this - there are not many things with No Face on them! Plus, it is a practical bag."
5.0,"These earrings are unique and versatile, with a feeling of Bali-style jewelry. I found a coordinating (not matching) pendant of black agate and oxidized silver at another website, and together they are a great combo. (I think black onyx and black agate are more or less the same stone; they certainly go well together. These earrings would coordinate with other Bali silver items I have seen, and have a bit of boho-chic quality to them. Very pleased: delivery fast and items just as pictured."
5.0,"I got these for my girls. They are very secure when they are on, and very easy to put on and take off. Haven't caused any allergic reactions so far either."
5.0,"Prettier in person. Very fast shipping. It feels like it will hold up well, and if it does, I would purchase from this company again."
5.0,Beautiful and believable!! These are my everyday earrings! You can dress them up or just wear a pair of jeans and sweat shirt! Love the shape and size! Great deal for the price!!
5.0,Very good swim equipment!<br />It is cheap but its quality is so good.<br />I like it so much!
5.0,Was very nice and cute bought for a gift person very happy with it.Also brought the whole bracelet and attached a couple of charms to it.
5.0,This arrived and looked exactly like the picture.  Super cute and well made.
5.0,"The material on this dress is so flowy, soft and comfortable.  It was very cool for the hot summer months.  I absolutely love it!"
5.0,Controls the bounce better than any other bra!
5.0,I Looooooooove these leggings!!! very comfy and the material feels great on my skin. I brought them to go under my tutu for a themed b day party and they were a hit.
5.0,Just as described. Fast shipping!!
5.0,exclent product
5.0,So comfy and super cute. Fit as expected.
5.0,This sweater is very comfortable!!
5.0,"First of all, I hardly ever write a review unless I am terribly disappointed.  But,,,,,,, these sandals are above my expectations, so I felt that I should let anyone that has heel pain, that need good arch support, and that has bunions on the big toes, these sandals are awesome.  They feel like I‚Äôm walking on a cloud, really really, they are the best I‚Äôve ever had (and I‚Äôve tried many, some horribly expensive).  If I had to complain, the top strap is a little loose, but not enough to dislike the sandal.  As a matter of fact, I will order another pair.  If you have very skinny feet, the straps may be too loose for you.  I ordered a size smaller than my normal and they fit perfect."
5.0,"Sweet  cross bag in vibrant Caribbean colors, soft leather with clever twist deign in front. Maybe. Wish it had more zippers, but it‚Äôs pretty cute."
5.0,"I bought this for a masquerade ball. It looks great. It doesn't squish my nose like many other masks do. My husband loves how it looks on me. It does kind of smell chemically right out of the package, but I have plenty of time to let it air out. Good purchase. Thank you."
5.0,I liked the designs of the rings. They were a nice bright and shiny gold. You can put them on different fingers and mix them up.
5.0,"Although this dress runs small, the seller has been great to work with as far as getting the correct size.  Very easy to work with, quick to respond to my return inquiry and willing to make the order right.<br />Would recommend this seller."
5.0,"It is beautiful, gave it as a Birthday gift"
5.0,"The original antenna dome was cracked and the whip fell onto the DC beltway.  I still have the original radio with AM, FM, CD, and sat. This antenna supports the AM and FM only and seems to pull in the radio stations. Even the weak AM stations are working.  As stated in the description it arrives with no instructions but installs easily."
5.0,I like the size of the face of the watch...not too small or too large.  The strap fits ANY wrist.  Great gift!!
5.0,"I loved this dress. It‚Äôs perfect for the summer. Great fit just above the knee, no need for tailoring it."
5.0,This is a cute color & pattern. One of my favorite Coach wristlets I own. That says a lot since I own quite a few.
5.0,"This case worked great for storing my autographed hat in it. Looks great on the shelf. Also, don't have to worry about the hat getting covered in dust or anything else. Definitely would buy again!!"
5.0,Very well made....  the ones I've had for awhile still look new.
5.0,"Not much to write about chain, looks good, good clasp, good quality, very well made. Very happy!"
5.0,This Kimono was even more gorgeous in person! I love the vibrant colors and the feel of the fabric. I've worn it out once already and I have received more compliments on this than anything I've worn.
5.0,"Great watch....not too big....I have a smaller wrist and it looks great on...I have tried on other chronograph watches, and they all looked huge on my wrist."
5.0,I have a great appreciation for quality and comfort and this top hits both marks!  The feel of the material is soft and comfortable.  The fit is tight but not constrictive.  It does not flip up when inverted which is very important to me personally.  :)  High quality.  Excellent value.  BUY FROM THESE FABULOUS PEOPLE!  They are doing good in this world and we need more of that.
5.0,"Quite difficult to put on, but wonderful support..It's summer and my legs didn't get itchy. They'll be wonderful on my upcoming trip : driving long distances, flying with layover, different climate,altitude, humidity - As well as on a boat and a ferry, all on the same long tiring day!  I know they'll help with my difficult circulation problem. They'll do the job as advertised, I'm certain!"
5.0,"This is a lovely bracelet, just what I expected and wanted."
5.0,LOVE this top! I love this top on my &#34;I feel skinny&#34; days and my &#34;I feel fat days&#34;
5.0,Just the size I've been looking for. Shines just right (not over the top). So light in the ear I forget I have them on.<br />The only con i have about them is the stems are super weak. they tend to bend at the slightest touch. Other than that I have not complaints... Will definitely recommend to others about this product.
5.0,"I‚Äôm a traveling Sales Rep and this is perfect for taking the bare necessities such as drivers license, bank card and corporate card. Holds money and fits in front pocket without feeling bulky"
5.0,"Great quality, delivered in time and packaged well.<br />Thank you! Will purchase more"
5.0,Just as expected at half the price!
5.0,"I have been looking for the perfect pair of sunglasses to cut the glare out especially when lounging by the lake. I found these oversized shades and love them! They are oversized and have a slightly vintage look which I love. I have received so many complements on these glasses.  They are great for driving, outdoor activities or just lounging outside."
5.0,"Big booty friendly.  fit but was snug.  pretty colors for summer.  Polyester, polyester, polyester."
5.0,At first it looks like they are too small but when you actually try it on it fits just right and does not shrink after you wash. Very comfortable and have that tailored look so it's not all baggy.
5.0,Perfect for my Michael myers costume
5.0,Protection was the main reason I purchased...and they delivered on the protection promise..<br />Lightweight and good coverage. Yhey do get hot but that is a small price to pay for great protection
5.0,my son was as happy as a clown when he received this coin
5.0,Super comfortable and fit beautifully
5.0,"The set is absolutely stunning and the shine! Looks pricey, but great value! I‚Äôve received so many compliments!"
5.0,Received them today and loved them. Fit perfectly
5.0,"I love these sandals! I wear them for as long as I can every summer. They only last a few months anyway before they are worn down, but aren't too expensive to buy new ones every year."
5.0,"Really cute. Not as big as I expected, but it was my fault for not looking at the actual size. Either way, I still like them."
5.0,Had a few alterations other than that it was perfect beautiful very comfortable

5.0,"I loved the colors and that they were very strong, holds more than I thought they would.....folds back up nicely and easy to clean"
5.0,"Fantastic socks-provided hours of relief and compression on my flight! Not too tight, just right!"
5.0,"These supports are exactly what I needed.  Heretofore, my sungglasses kept slipping off my face.  Now, no problem.  Even better, I received a second pair for free, which was totally unexpected.  An extra pair means that I have something for my other pair of sunglasses.  Thank you!"
5.0,Great fit. I will be ordering other colors.
5.0,Lovely! Just what I was looking for. Looks like oxidized silver - perfect heavy metal ;)
5.0,Perfect size. Exactly as pictured 14k white gold.
5.0,Love this product<br />I like very much<br />It't confor<br />Is beautiful<br />I recommend to My friends<br />This product is good
5.0,Great quality glasses. Appear to be more expensive that they actually are. Seem very sturdy. I would recommend and purchase again.
5.0,"I love them,they are so beautiful , a dream!<br />They are  fantasy good quality earrings."
5.0,"I was having a hard time keeping the budget down for glass markers when hosting a large crowd. These worked great, most are reusable for another party & it was a great conversation starter with guests I have not met before!"
5.0,I received it today & it's very lovely!<br />It will make a great gift for the girls in my life.:  )
5.0,Love these. Got quite a few compliments. Not as heavy as I expected. Doesn‚Äôt bother my ears after long wear.

5.0,I love the intense sensation!
5.0,"My granddaughter has a head full of hair, so any and I mean any headband looks great on her!!!! Like these I only like quality headbands and as usual she wore them well!!!!! (Screams)"
5.0,"They're awesome chokers. I wear the flower one and the circle-looking one just about every day. The thick black one broke easily, but I just took the ying-yang off the other one and it's just fine. They also come in a cute felt bag. Despite the one that broke, I have and definitely would recommend these to a friend. Especially considering that buying one of these from a store would cost how much all of these cost just for one."
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Disappointed it didn't fit.
5.0,I love these socks. I pair them with rompers in the cold months and they look so adorable.
5.0,Works great and looks good. Exactly what I wanted for part of my Father's day gift.
5.0,"Get it!!! If you are on the fence, just do it. The color is gorgeous, fit is great. You can absolutely size down in this the boxy fit allows for lots of wiggle room. Super cute and comfy!"
5.0,"After having 2 kids, I needed something that covered my loose belly skin. I received this product for free in exchange for a product review. They gave me a size 12 and I almost returned it before even opening the package. I‚Äôm 150lbs and 5‚Äô4‚Äù. I‚Äôm usually a size medium on top (36B) and a medium-large on bottom (women‚Äôs size 8 in jeans). A size 12 is normally way too large for me. I‚Äôm usually more along the lines of a size 8-10. So idk where they get their sizing labels from. It actually fit pretty well the top was a little loose fitting around but the adjustable straps are nice and the style is flattering. The bottoms were flattering on my belly but not so much on my bottom. I have a pear shaped body so that could be my fault, not the sellers. The material is thick and looks like it will last a long time. It was put together very well and seems like a high quality material.<br />I would say it‚Äôs actually listed a bit cheaper than it should be. Colors are vibrant. I actually really like this suit and I didn‚Äôt think I would."
5.0,Freakin love these gloves. I used them for a Savage Race and they worked great!
5.0,"Normally when I buy a bundle of things, I at least don't like one of them, but with these earrings I loved everyone of them. I get so many compliments and they are so cheap compared to a boutique but just as good if not better quality."
5.0,It fits like it was made for my glasses
5.0,These are great. Would correct that they're not silk but are really cute. I use them as headbands and these are a subtle artsy touch to every outfit.
5.0,Very pretty. They seems sturdy and work great!
5.0,This is a great belt buckle and it isn't the same one that Booth wore on Bones. His was a painted on logo. This logo is raised pewter and looks a lot nicer.<br /><br />Its well made and looks like the metal belt ring in the back will last. I will update this review if it breaks but so far I haven't had any issues and I wear almost every day!
5.0,"Yes I ordered the same day and it arrive as promised. I needed the shirt for my nephew's birthday considering it being Captain America theme. Since they didn't have this in women's plus size, I just went on a got a men's 2xl hense I wear this size shirt a work. So far it's very comfortable and Heather material is what I prefer anyaway"
5.0,"So comfortable and cute! I'm 5'6, 128 and 34D and the small fit great. It's made of a stretchy bathing suit material. I wear full coverage bras and mine does not show at all in this dress."
5.0,Cute dainty bracelet. Been wearing it for a month now and so far the color hasn't changed yet. Wish the beads were a bit bigger but not bad for the price. Cuter when paired with other bracelets.
5.0,"Love the gloves, especially the rabbit fur!  Fast delivery."
5.0,Shiny enough to attract everyone's attention ü§£
5.0,I ordered the really small ones.  They're great for my second hole but they would probably be nice for little kids too.  Nice stone color.
5.0,Dress hugs every curve and does not ride was able to wear all night and feel comfortable. I am 5'4 180lbs and a medium fit the dress has some great stretch to it.
5.0,Graduate loved it
5.0,I love it! It's very flexible and easy to adjust it was a little big on me since I usually wear 8m instead of 10 so I pushed it a bit down.
5.0,Great socks for the price and beat out darn tough socks easy.
5.0,"This fit my daughter perfect, size was as expected."
5.0,Product quality is good and upto my expectation
5.0,It is even prettier than I imagined.  It is a gift for my daughter's birthday and I'm sure she will love it.
5.0,"Dress fit great. Nice and fitted. Great shade of red. Wife is on the shorter side and dress is long, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. Quite a sexy outfit, that fit as expected."
5.0,It was the best
5.0,perfect for wearing under short dresses
5.0,"My earrings were gorgeous shined and looked like authentic diamond‚Äôs, highly recommended ‚ùóÔ∏è"
5.0,Wow this casual boot keeps your feet warm they look good but most of all they are comfortable
5.0,For one it‚Äôs warm asf excuse my language but other than that wear it it any weather I love my new puma jacket had it for couple months now
5.0,I love this sweater! Super soft and fit is great!
5.0,I love this sweater it is so comfortable and soft! I love my sweaters baggy so I sized up
5.0,Fit as expected! Very soft material!
5.0,"Nice man watch, just that simple."
5.0,A great looking and comfortable set of suspenders!
5.0,I purchased this non slip headband because it was adjustable. Others would just slip off my head during exercise. The Victory Band did not slip at all! I took it on vacation and it was awesome on the ski boat and kept my hair from blowing all over.  Would defiantly recommend purchasing this headband!
5.0,Nice. I would buy a bigger size next time because it shrinks in washing
5.0,Very comfortable & hi viz
5.0,They are awesome fit perfect nice material.
5.0,"So light weight, and u cant even feel it on. I never take mine off.. I love it!"
5.0,It‚Äôs best quality shirt I have ever had .
5.0,Fit my 7 y/o great and he said it was comfortable but found out after purchase he cnt wear to school so we will use it when we go to other public places.
5.0,Silky soft and nice and roomy. Perfect for these chilly nights. Will definitely be back for more.
5.0,take a walk with my baby and on a daily basis
5.0,Was great quality!!!
5.0,quality and fast delivery
5.0,Looks and feels very premium!
5.0,"They are really pretty ,kind of big compared to what I thought they were going to be, but I love them"
5.0,"There is only a small logo on the front.  I prefer to be known for my own conduct; not by some city, team, university, famous person or cute and nasty statement.  The ""R"" shows I have good taste.  Anything else you want to know requires more effort."
5.0,They fit real well. Only thing I wish they still had the brown ones as they were out of them so I had to get the black but they don‚Äôt look bad.
5.0,"I have worn Jess N Jane before.  I took a chance and ordered extra large because in the past I have purchased XL from other stores and once I washed them in warm water they fit me.  The shoulders are about one inch to large after washing but I can live with that.  I am very pleased with the three Jess N Jane shirts that I have ordered from Amazon, therefore I gave them a five star rating."
5.0,Liked it‚Äôs look
5.0,These are fun.  A slight Bohemian touch and comfort/adjustable.
5.0,My flutish daughter loved this
5.0,This was a very cute outfit. I ordered a size up and it fit great.
5.0,Stance socks are AMAZING
5.0,I make jewerly and I love these cages.  They are perfect for adding a lava bead for essential oils.  They make great gifts
5.0,"First I ordered a medium because of the reviews of woman‚Äôs height and weight. I received the dress and it was a little snug I couldn‚Äôt wear the bra I want to wear with it so I ordered a large. I received it today and it fits perfect the waist line is where it needs to sit on my waist and I love the pockets, and it‚Äôs stretchy the material is very soft. I‚Äôm going to have to have the length shortened just a little I don‚Äôt want to trip on it. This is for my son‚Äôs beach wedding and it looks elegant and not to dressy for the beach. Order the size you usually were in a dress I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6 about 140."
5.0,"This dress is a nice one for summer wear. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. The torso is a bit long, but you can adjust the fabric to get the waist in the right place. As an added bonus, there are pockets. I found the fit to be a bit small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,All üëçüëçüëç.
5.0,First pair of jeans I have bought online so I didn't expect much satisfaction but they fit perfect like if I would've bought them at a store. The only downside is that it has no zipper since it's all button down (full disclosure on the description of product btw) but I love the way they look and feel that it doesn't really bother me anymore.
5.0,They came in earlier than expected and they are very pretty.
5.0,"Quality was very good, it was just the size was not a true match.."
5.0,"Trendy,my son loves these"
5.0,"This is a very fine, delicate double necklace composed of two chains, one paperclip and one fine chain.  the two chains are not separable, and permanently attached together at the clasp, which includes a generous extension chain.  This allows the necklace to sit high as a choker or a bit lower over the collar bones.  I think you could add a pendant or charm so long as it has a clip slide or enhancer clip with which to attach it.  It will appear very nicely over a higher neck top--it's disappearing against my old lady neck.  This necklace is very suitable for any occasion, work to evening.  I received it as a part of the Amazon Vine program."
5.0,This has been my favorite amazon purchase so far. It fits better than any outfit I've bought here! I ordered a XL. It's loose enough but fitted! So very comfortable.<br />You don't have to order a size up for this one!
5.0,"I bought this dress to take on vacation. Usually I don‚Äôt like to purchase clothing online because sometimes it‚Äôs hard to figure out what size would fit best so I was pleasantly surprised to slip this dress on and have it be a perfect fit. The material is soft, lightweight and super comfortable and it hugs my body like a glove. The straps and the chest area sit beautifully on and the cutouts on the side show the right amount of skin making it super sexy. I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Fits like a hat
5.0,I ordered this crown for my birthday and believe me I do not regret it.  Altho it arrive a little too late for my special day I think its gorgeous.  It isn't flimsy and comes with beautiful gold hair pins.  I'd definitely recommend you buy it.
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase.  They fit perfectly over my glasses and are very comfortable.  I wear them even if I'm not wearing my glasses!
5.0,"These are so soft, they are adjustable to where you can wear them thick or thinner and they serve the purpose of a mask requirement.  I really like them and may order more"
5.0,"it arrived before the day it was suppose to , its light weight  and fabric is wonderful defiantly worth it"
5.0,"Cute, fit great, lil short for my taste"
5.0,Very flattering and the quality was nicer than expected for the price.
5.0,I bought this for my son and he loves it. It does everything he wants.
5.0,"Beautiful watch, I also ordered this in rose gold along with the silver, both are beautiful.  While the face is just a little large to my liking, I do like the watch and the way it is designed inside makes it very beautiful.  and I love the rhinestones along the watch band, it looks like a very elegant watch."
5.0,as described very satisfied.
5.0,"This is a not a pair of shoes. It is a checkbook cover. I impulse-bought it because the checkbook cover I had was made out of some horrible fake leather stuff that was shedding all over the inside of my bag. This is a nice checkbook cover made of cloth, with some stiffening cardboard. It does not shed and it's pretty."
5.0,"This dress is so comfortable! Simple but beautiful, with a nice flare to the skirt. I'm thinking about ordering one or two more in different colors."
5.0,Works great... Just what I wanted.
5.0,"I had major doubts about buying leggings off the internet just randomly like this and for the cheap price. I really thought it would be low quality and something you would only wear around the house and not be caught out in public in. WOW, was I wrong. I got gone late last night and tore into the package and as soon as I pulled them on fell in love with them. I love a good quality compression type legging that‚Äôs going to hold everything together and not jiggle. They are thin enough not to feel like ur in a biscuit container and thick and SOFT enough to be perfect. And the price?! I‚Äôve been paying double and sometimes triple just for ONE pair at other places!! Will be buying these leggings from now on!!"
5.0,"gave this bracelet to a special teacher, and she loved it, and  it is great quality."

5.0,"I updated to 5 stars cuz if you throw the coat in the dryer for 10 minutes it‚Äôs odds up beautifully and looks so much nicer!!<br /><br />The coat is beautiful and looks great on, runs a drop big so got a smaller size.<br />I took one star off since it isn't very puffy.<br />I sure hope it keeps the kids warm to the temperature advertised. Otherwise I love the coat and the fur actually looks beautiful."

5.0,It's beautiful!  This makes for a great and unique gift for the person that has everything.

5.0,Really nice look. Perfect match with my blue/black Tuxedo.
5.0,"Comfortable and cuts the noise, needs a minute or two after wearing to envelop your year completely."
5.0,"It's awesome, my girl loves it"
5.0,"Love these. cute and comfy. I need them when switching between reading documents and looking at the computer. Great size, I can look right over the top instead of taking them off all the time."

5.0,My ‚Äúgo too‚Äùcrossbody since I bought it last Nov! Stylish and easy to wear! I like the blue color and I hardly ever buy any bags that aren‚Äôt leather but this nylon is classy and clean looking! It‚Äôs similar to Radley brand. Which is another of my fav‚Äôs.

5.0,Bought these for my 6+ year old daughter for Christmas...she loved them and they seem very well made.
5.0,one of my favorite shirts to wear in summer... slightly thing material but great for summer... very long

5.0,Great value.  Prompt delivery<br />Thank you
5.0,Fits snug but with a stretch.  Wife enjoys these as much for yoga as she does for lounging. Recommended.
5.0,Mejorar calidad de tela
5.0,"This is a beautiful piece. It is heavy, not cheap and light weight. The crystals are real and glow in the sunshine. I love getting great deals like this."
5.0,"I'm 5'4 and weight 130lbs . I ordered a size small. The material is very comfortable. This outfit was a perfect fit except for the length was too long and covered my heels. So, I decided to cut them into gaucho capris and hemmed them with some peel and stick tape. Here are my before and after results."
5.0,My 5 year old looks great in them
5.0,"Throw away your plastic collar stays, don't get gouged by the menswear stores selling brass stays (more prone to bending), and buy these. You will not be sorry. They do not rust, even after going through the washer."
5.0,Perfect. Hold full size readers and sunglasses. Only had about 3 weeks but holding up to opening a closing a few times a day.
5.0,"I loveüíï my pj. I will be purchasing more hands down. Thank you for understanding a true plus side curvy ""5 11"" 323lbs. bbw. Note: the eye mask could be a little bigger though it was too small."
5.0,The fabric is nice and bright.  Great product!
5.0,"Very comfortable to wear, and doesn't make your feet or legs sweat. Very pleased with the item"
5.0,Awesome coat. Got this for my son who works in a cold warehouse. He says it keeps him nice and warm throughout the day. It's a nice stylish coat that can be worn anywhere. Highly recommend.
5.0,I got this tunic dress because I needed something a bit dressier to wear during the cold seasons but I hate traditional dresses. I love how this fits-it's loose but not completely shapeless and I can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings depending on the situation. It's also quite warm. I'm one of those people who are always cold so I wore it with a base layer shirt underneath and was comfortable all day. It's also very easy to move around in which was a must for me because I work in a lab. I can easily role up the sleeves and not have them fall back down moments later. The color (at least the rust one I got) is true to what you see online.
5.0,Quick delivery !! Happy with items. I wish I would have done little bit more research on T-shirt size. I ordered Men-Medium and Women-Small. Medium fits as a small. Double check your sizes before you place an order.<br />Overall 5 Star.
5.0,No real complaints. I needed a mask and that's exactly what I got. Nothing fell apart and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Nice wallet. I would buy it again.
5.0,"I ordered two of these, one for me and one for my friend and they are perfect. Just the right size to wear with anything and the lock works great on mine!! LOVE ITTT"
5.0,love it...so comfortable...
5.0,"My son loved the shirts - I liked that I got two shirts for $25 - he can wear them individually or layered to create the &#34;third&#34; look.  Also, got free shipping with the $25 so that was a bonus for me.  Arrived very timely.  Very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,Exactly what was needed to replace a brushed-finish buckle.  Matches stainless steel Apple Watch perfectly. Easy to install. Quite solidly built.
5.0,"Bought as a Halloween costume for my husband. Grinch costume worked for him because he wears 36x32 blue jeans. The jacket is long in the arms and fairly large in the chest but the belt helps with that.  The green hair gets every where so BEWARE. The mask has a heavy plastic smell so let it air out for several days before you wear it. My opinion, if you are over 6 feet tall, this costume will not work unless you wear boots to make up the difference in the length of pants.  Again, for $45, it was worth it to us."
5.0,Great safety glasses no fog no scratch great price.
5.0,Watch is waterproof  and lookd very elegant matches any occasion
5.0,Very good item works very well.

5.0,Son como las esperaba y de muy buena calidad
5.0,"I love these earrings.  They are so pretty.  The crystal is so sparkly.  It is big enough to be pretty and flashy, but not too big to feel overdressed."
5.0,Bought this for daughter and she loves it has not had any issues at all
5.0,"Holds ice all day, doesn‚Äôt leak. Great product. Great price compared to HD!!"
5.0,"The material is heavier than I thought and I was worried that I would not like it, but I decided to try it on anyway. I absolutely LOVED it! This is a must have for your closet! It hits above the knee and its loose. I had tons of compliments and I have already purchased it in other colors. For the price it is perfect additional to any closet."
5.0,enough for everyone!!
5.0,"Bought 2 shirts for 2 sensory kiddos, who had completely different experiences. Just when I start to feel like I‚Äôve got their sensory issues figured out‚Ä¶<br /><br />First up: sensory-seeking 5yo on the tiny end of the scale (below 10th percentile for height & weight). He spends every day bumping and crashing, spinning and turning upside down. I hoped a compression garment would help satisfy some of his seeking behavior. Based on chest circumference, his recommended size was Small, and he picked out the big superhero design (so cute!). The material is very thick, and even getting it over his head the first time was a challenge. From the sternum up, the shirt was so loose it didn‚Äôt touch his skin in places. Over the belly, it was tight as a drum. He said, ‚Äúit gives me a tummy ache,‚Äù and ‚Äúit turns off my brain, so I have no ideas.‚Äù This was a disappointing fail for him; we returned after trying it for one hour.<br /><br />Next up: sensory defensive 8yo, size Large (she‚Äôs 95th percentile for size). She finds touch painful, and has been known to swing at unexpected touch. For her, hugs can be painful and even holding hands is uncomfortable. As soon as this shirt was on, she said ‚Äúthis feels just like the hugs I like, not-squeezy hugs‚Äù and ‚ÄúI feel happy!‚Äù She did a few jumping jacks and said, ‚ÄúI feel light as a feather!‚Äù This was an unexpected win for her! Now the hard part will be deciding which part of her day to apply the shirt to, as her OT recommends compression garments only be worn for 2 hours max."
5.0,I can't believe I survived before these. They are lifesavers. We no longer have to constantly adjust glasses that slide down or noses.  Great simple product!!!
5.0,Cardigan was just as described. Love wearing with dress during the cool days.
5.0,Great set. Fits perfect
5.0,Still using this after a year plus and love it.<br />Great quality for price and accurate description.
5.0,"This dress is so pretty!! I am totally surprised. I had twins 2 months ago and I didn't want it to be tight while I am loosing the baby weight; Right now I am a size 12 and the L fit perfect!  It does have slits up the side that you can't see in the picture,  if i put my hands down by my side, the slit touches my finger tips. The material is light weight and would work well for a beach cover up but I am going to wear it as a dress. My mom and sister have both ordered one. This dress does not look cheap at all!"
5.0,It's prettier than pictured online. Love it.
5.0,"Fit well, looked good"
5.0,It was a pretty good buy for how cheep it was. I bought it in a rush because I needed it for a cruise. They didn't have the 3x in stock I just sized up and got the 4x and it was a little big. It works because all the straps are ties so it can be adjusted. It wasn't as supportive as I would have liked but its adjustable so it works
5.0,"I gave these ones to my wife and she is so happy with them, she says they are so comfortable that feels she isn't wearing any.  I think my sister wants to get a pair of those too."
5.0,"I'm 6'3&#34; 185 and I got the large because the reviews said the sizes ran big.  Thank you for that, because the large fits perfectly.  It is a very comfortable sweatshirt - though a little on the light side at 8oz.  Perfect for tooling around the house in the winter."
5.0,"16g was perfect for all of my piercings, I wear these hoops all day everyday and no damage noted. I won't worry about them popping off or irritating my skin bc they are so durable and made of steel. They dont bug me when I sleep either. Overall really great product for the price."
5.0,Worth the price forsure
5.0,Comfortable and colors are awsome in a black light.
5.0,Wish it stayed charged longer! My husband loves this hat! Easy to use and has a great sound!
5.0,"just got my wrist cuff today and happy, happy it fits I have a 6 inch wrist and it is a perfect fit it is soft and doesn't chaff it dosent look big and clunky either in fact it looks like it was made just for me will order from the company again"

5.0,I love the band. It‚Äôs a little loose but I love the colors
5.0,I am very pleased. I made this purchase for my brother's wedding in September. The quality and fit is perfect. I'm in the process of finding my daughter a similar one from seller. Thanks
5.0,Fantastic glasses!  I‚Äôm always impressed with the glasses I receive from this company. My new favorite brand! This is my second pair and I plan on buying many more üòç

5.0,Algo justas en comparaci√≥n con otros zapatos de la misma talla
5.0,"Great quality, fine fit."
5.0,Best quality superhero patch I've ever seen!  Excellent detail.  Much larger than expected too.  Arrived earlier than expected.  I highly recommend this product!
5.0,Perfect size. Great quality
5.0,"I love Betsy Johnson and this is a great purse, great price, and quick delivery"
5.0,"I bought these three ties for the middle one, and though it's a little too shiny for my taste, it's exactly what you'd expect of a polyester fake Burberry tie."
5.0,Beautiful! Love the pattern and the lanyard is very durable. A perfect replacement for my old Vera lanyard and wallet!
5.0,Beautiful leather. High quality.
5.0,These are great socks that stay in place during yoga practice.  So many others slip off my small toes when in standing poses.  These socks stay on and have wonderful traction on the mat making warrior poses more stable.  Thank you.
5.0,The anklets were just adorable.  They fit good no matter the size of your ankles because you are able to make bigger or smaller.  I wore them all through the summer with all my outfits.  I received complements every time I wore them.
5.0,I Absolutely Love these!!! Nice fit/look!! Not your typical Bulky boot.
5.0,"Super cute for the price. I wore high-waisted jeans and my stomach did not really show. It was a tiny bit see through because I had a cream bra, but did not look bad. I definitely would buy again."
5.0,"Flirty dress and a lot of bang for your buck.  I didn't initially have high expectations because of the cheap price.  Pleasantly surprised that the quality was quite decent for the money.  Highlights your legs! Legs for days! I normally don't wear short skirts/dresses but this one hits perfectly. I'd say its a BUY! Fits great for 5'8"" 138lbs. I purchased a SMALL."
5.0,"I absolutely love these. The different sizes. Even the goblin ears work. But, with the Goblin ears you do have to use foundation to make them look a touch more realistic. Very satisfied."
5.0,"Love this dress!  To start, I rarely wear dresses, but really liked this one (plus, POCKETS!).  It fits wonderfully, and hides my flaws.  Today is my first day wearing it, and have had several people asking about it.  For reference, I'm 5'6, 180 and a large fits perfectly.  It's a bit long on me, so a shoe with a heel might be in order."
5.0,Cute look for both adult and child. Both sizes fit well. I wear mine more than my daughter does hers. Great find.
5.0,Used this brand in the military it runs kind of small so always order a size up
5.0,Para mi hijo y le encanto
5.0,I was a little hesitant to buy it because i figured no way could something this cheap be made well but its a great product! Made well for an awesome price especially considering i bought one just like it for $50.
5.0,Super soft and great fit! I do recommend.
5.0,Its good item.
5.0,Well made. I receive a lot of compliments on this hat.
5.0,Love red hood and love this shirt just as much!
5.0,Any man (or woman) worth his salt should have some saddle soap around! It really is vital to keeping leather looking and feeling great. I use this as a first step when shining shoes. It helps condition the leather and leaves it supple and ready for polish. It's also great on a new pair of shoes that you are breaking in. I've used it to condition some belts and it did a great job.
5.0,"It's perfect, thank you."
5.0,"My husband is very pleased with how these fit, look, and the ease with which he can put them on quickly in the car!"
5.0,Ordered an XS for my son who wears a 5T/6. Fits great and will continue to fit for quite some time. It‚Äôs obviously a knock off but you can‚Äôt beat the price and the quality of the fabric is decent. Love the throw back look. It‚Äôs comfortable and soft to the touch. Launder on cold and hand dry to help the labels/numbers/etc from peeling as fast. Would order again. My son is stoked!
5.0,At first glance they seem kind of odd with a rectangular shape but their quite wonderful keep your feet comfortable.
5.0,This product is very comfortable can be used for workout or normal day to day casual wear
5.0,My 2 daughters love them.
5.0,Love and great value for money
5.0,"Watch fits snug on my wrist, but not tight enough to cause any pain or swelling. Stays in place while moving my arm around and doesn't catch on my skin or hairs when removing it. Very pleased with purchase."
5.0,It arrived late. But amazon assisted me. The shirt itself is WONDERFUL! Immediately a fave! Its so soft!
5.0,Looks just like the picture. It's so pretty and has a good stretch to it

5.0,Work well for me and very comfortable
5.0,Super cool sticker
5.0,"Really love this dress.  It's actually more peach than pink, with the black & gray flowers"
5.0,everyone gives me compliments in these!
5.0,Yes this dress was everything. I ordered a S. I'm 5'7 135pounds. I thought it wouldn't fit right because the models on here's has big everything. I ordered it because I needed it for a trip. I tried it on when I got it and the fit was good. Going on vacation I decided to wear it and man oh man did I look hot that night. This is good for a night out in town or if you are going out with your man. Trust me when I say he will love it because mine loved it via social media. If you don't want to wear a bra buy the spray on Adhevise glue. It will keep your boobs up and sitting pretty.
5.0,I had purchased one of these belts before I liked it so much that I purchased another one
5.0,"I was looking for a pair of handmade earrings made in the US. I found this company and loved their jewelry! Very well made, gorgeous, and will make a perfect gift for my daughter. Fast delivery and awesome company to do business with. Highly recommend."

5.0,Love it! Silk material as expected.
5.0,"Bought these as a gift for my hubby who has suffered from plantar fasciitis for over a year.  He always complains how his feet hurt and its been difficult finding an adequate pair of sneakers for him.  This pair has come to the rescue and he loves the quality and color.  They look perfect with jeans and slacks too.  He has been wearing them all week long, even to church on Easter, boom!<br />The arch support, comfortable insert, thick sole and breathability are the best.  Throw in the great price and you have one very happy man!  I am an avid Saucony user and so glad I got him to try this brand as all those other popular brands had very poor results for his picky feet! Thank you Saucony and Amazon for an awesome product and immediate delivery!"
5.0,recieved on time as promised and the chain looks nice. well made and heavy duty enough to last.
5.0,This robe feels GREAT
5.0,"My brother-in-law is a huge golfer himself, as well as coach for the boys' and girls' teams at the high school where he teaches. He needed a good visor that would survive being thrown in his golf bag and it had to be black to go with the school colors."
5.0,"These are so cute! I love that there are different colors. There are so many styles to decide from, They all came in good condition, exactly how they look in the picture. None of them were too tight on my nose. The only issue I have is how quickly they start to discolor once you've worn it, but that is to be expected, I still gave them 5 stars!"
5.0,Very cute in design! Works for all finger types!
5.0,"This was worth every penny. Just wore this shirt for the better part of three weeks straight in July. I washed it after the first week while taking a field shower using bodywash.<br /><br />After sweating while running, rucking, and crawling through dirt; this shirt still smelled like it was brand new. It was extremely comfortable while wearing armor and a 120 lbs ruck. No hotspots, chaffing or signs of wear. Very durable and comfortable. The shirt feels like silk, if I were to give you an idea as to how comfortable it is.<br /><br />I was also surprised how the color was nearly identical to the ""499 tan"" issued undershirts. This can turn your packing list from 10 tan shirts to about 2-3, for about a months time in the field."
5.0,"These glasses have so many pros - they are so cute, comfortable, and lightweight.  The lenses are great.  Yesterday when I was driving directly towards the sun, I could see where I was going.  I‚Äôm a wider face girl and they are flexible and don‚Äôt squeeze my head.  Today I got a compliment on how cute the red color is.  I‚Äôm ordering another color!"
5.0,Great quality and as pictured!
5.0,Excellent quality. Nice tight stitching. The Emperor and Darth Vader would be proud. It would be nice if they sold a velcro version of it so it can be easily attached and removed from jackets with velcro patch areas. I stuck velcro on mine so I can swap it on various jackets.
5.0,Great buy for the price and so darn cute!
5.0,BEST scrub brand!
5.0,Perfect prop to make fun of your friends with expensive watches that do the exact same thing as this $10 watch.

5.0,Look exactly like picture
5.0,"This dress was perfect! I am normally really wearing of buying dresses online and I needed a formal dress for my school dance. I didn't want to spend a lot of money so this seemed like the perfect option and it was. I am 5'6 and 150lbs and I ordered size medium and it hugged my body in a good way. The material is stretchy and good quality as well. It just got the floor barefoot so with around 3-4 inch heels it works nicely. I wore this dress all night (dinner, dancing, etc.) No problems. Would highly recommend. You cannot wear a bra with this dress so other alternative options are needed to conceal. Other than that amazing!"
5.0,Very nice for business attire
5.0,Item was returned and account was credited
5.0,I am 5'5 and currently 6 months pregnant and the shirt fit so beautifully. I ordered a medium and not only was it super comfortable but stylish too. I will definitely be buying other colors.
5.0,"I ordered like 3 pair of shorts to make sure I found the perfect pair. When I tried these on I instantly fell in love! They fit like a glove!!!! Stretch is amazing, they stayed in place and the color pops just like the picture! For the women that are concerned about them riding up and being uncomfortable‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt move at all!! I didn‚Äôt have to adjust them at all. Would highly recommend."
5.0,I'm 5'7 and 120lbs and a small fit perfectly. It is a beautiful dress and comfortable dress to wear.
5.0,Perfect! Will buy more.

5.0,High cut that makes anyone look good!
5.0,"These are so comfortable and fit like a charm. They are working cute. Definitely would order again. I ordered off the sizing chart which said xl would fit me and they did..pay attention to that when ordering and you'll be fine. Also, the material is so nice. I would highly recommend these pants to everyone."
5.0,Ordered for my grandson they are soft and a good fit
5.0,So cute! I don‚Äôt use the bow ties. Not a big fan of the patterns. But I love the suspenders on my little guy! He looks so handsom in them! I love that he will be able to use them for a while since they are adjustable. Bought them originally for his 1 year photo shoot.
5.0,This shoe is cute and sturdy. My daughter has been wearing them about two months at least 4 days a week and they are holding up. They don't rub her for anywhere and she can do PE and recess with no pain.
5.0,I love this dress. I get so many compliments and it‚Äôs very comfortable. Looks great with boots.
5.0,"Good  fit, good quality. Just what I have been searching for"

5.0,Excellente!!!

5.0,Very affordable stylish pair of sunglasses. Complimented all the time.
5.0,"I was looking for a plain warm hat that does not make me look like somebody is sponsoring me to get out of the house.<br />This  is perfect both in form and function. It is a good size (my head is not so small), It provides very good protection against cold and wind (it is not one of those thin stretchy hats that in picture look exactly like this one but when you get them you realize you wasted your money), it can go with everything. Without the thinsulate label it would have been even better for my taste."
5.0,"This pair was featured in Southern Luving and I loved them so I ordered them!  Not disappointed at all! Very cute, good quality, great packaging, and made in USA!!"
5.0,"I bought one for myself and one for my sister- large and medium, they‚Äôre flattering on both of us and so comfortable!"
5.0,Very soft.  Perfect
5.0,"I was soooo impressed with this dress!! It‚Äôs super stretchy and very soft! Because of the texture, it is very forgiving to any bumps or lumps you might have due to a few extra lbs! And you cant see any pantylines which I loved! Perfect knee length for me which I‚Äôm always having a hard time finding. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and weigh 158lbs. In the picture, I‚Äôm wearing this dress backwards because I wanted a lower cut... I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,super soft and looks great on
5.0,fit was really good even after a wash. I liked the first one enough that I bought a second one.
5.0,"I‚Äôve ordered a few dresses online before now, but this has got to be the best one I‚Äôve received. This dress fit like a glove! It‚Äôs beautiful, hugs my waist just right, flatters the chest, and is a nice length that‚Äôs not too long or too short (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 120 lbs). I love LOVE it, and will likely be buying a few more dresses from this seller because this one was absolutely gorgeous. I only wish the fabric was a little thicker, but it‚Äôs not see-through, so I will live. Anyways, it‚Äôs amazing. I definitely recommend it!"
5.0,"Great compression sock.  loose aroung the toes, no diggin in anywhere, especially on the calf where others dig in at the top.<br />They stayed up all day."
5.0,"I love this dress. I love the soft material and how it flowed when I walked. I am 5 ft tall and with my 2 in heels, it was the perfect length."
5.0,Always have reading glasses handy with you.  Great buy & gift.
5.0,Perfect size. Loved this hat for my trip to the Middle East desert. It covered me up well and didn‚Äôt blow off when traveling in the back of a pickup truck. Thankful a larger sized hat was available (used largest size setting ). I‚Äôm a female but I have a huge head and all other hats don‚Äôt really fit - even coolibar.
5.0,"These goggles are great. I love the connector in the back for easy removal. They have ear plugs attached to the head strap, which is really great too! The goggle strap is soft and comfortable, and the goggles don't fog in the water. I highly recommend these!"
5.0,"They are perfect, long enough and a definite statement piece."
5.0,Came as expected and shipping was fast
5.0,The fit is perfect and the lenses are great! Awesome shade protection but everything you see is bright and almost HD. Wish I'd ordered more!

5.0,Son absolutely loves this. He's 5 years old. Good quality.
5.0,"I absolutely love this white button shirt! The fit is perfect and accentuates my skirts, slacks, jean and blazers. I highly recommend this product. Ladies, we all need this essential item in our wardrobes."
5.0,"I am 5'3,  170lbs and the medium worked well. It is a little thin, will need a slip underneath. Very cute and casual"
5.0,"Great fit, super cute! First dress ordered on Amazon and it is perfect."
5.0,Good quality and sharp looking shirt!
5.0,"A lovely, simple tie bar that stands out just enough to add class through the details of an ensemble. My husband wore it on our wedding day and it was perfect!"
5.0,I was surprised for how gorgeous this dress was. I usually wear a size medium and I ordered a size up like everyone else recommended and the dress fit perfectly! I ordered this dress for my birthday trip to Vegas and it will be perfect! The hubby loves it too.
5.0,My son loves this shirt. It is his favorite. Perfectly fitted.
5.0,"My sister and I had these inexpensive, thin beaded belts found in a gift shop in northern Michigan in the 70's.  I tried to find it now and came across this belt.  Not exactly the same, but a nod to it.  We love them."
5.0,Cute socks are THE fashion statement on the nursing home circuit! Make your loved one the talk of the dining room with these!
5.0,Love this shirt. Came just as described.
5.0,"I bought these with the hope that they would be as comfortable as the $100 pillows I bought for my couch. These ARE BETTER! They are so soft, everyone chooses these over the expensive ones. Also, the shipping was super fast. Outstanding product!"
5.0,Is nice I like
5.0,These have become my daughter's favorite.
5.0,"Fantastic, beautiful, and gigantic."
5.0,The sweater fit perfect. The product arrived as expected.
5.0,La tela de buena calidad! El color igual a la foto. Lo compre Md y peso 135 y altura 5‚Äô5‚Äù Llego un dia antes de lo previsto! Gracias.
5.0,I absolutely love them. They are a nice and sturdy pair of sunglasses. Great quality. If I had to say what‚Äôs the least thing I like is it took longer to get them than I would have liked but all in all it is totally worth the wait and am going to buy more.
5.0,O love this product
5.0,"This was perfect with a few exceptions. I love this dress. It is made very well. Here are the cons: it was a bit bit snug for a large, the sleeves had no give and were tight. The pros: the price, the workmanship, the weight and flow of the dress and the speed of delivery! I truly felt royal in it."
5.0,Love my new frames they fit my face perfectly and go so well with my skin tone and to top it off they are so stylish... Happy with my new purchase.
5.0,Bought this to replace a cheap nylon purse strap. It's good quality and looks expensive.
5.0,"Came faster than promised, very nice Tie clip"
5.0,"Big and bright. The flowers really stand out, nice length also!"
5.0,"My husband loves this belt!  This belt is well-made it is genuine leather. It is a thicker belt and is wider. If you were looking for a thinner, lighter belt then this may not be what you‚Äôre looking for. My husband is really rough in valves and I think this is one that will hold up. It looks really sharp and he is really happy with it."
5.0,"I can‚Äôt review about how durable this product is, as I‚Äôve only had it for a week or two, but I do love it so far. The material is soft, I like the color, it holds a checkbook, cash and a lot of cards quite easily. I had one I had purchased elsewhere, but once you filled it with cards it became so bulky I couldn‚Äôt fit it into my purse. This one is the perfect size!"
5.0,They are great quality for a very good price. I may order another pair.
5.0,I had the YOUKEX nylon band but it was way too short so I returned it for this one instead and I'm glad. The elastic design is great
5.0,What could go wrong on $11.00 purchase
5.0,"I don't take time to change out my ear rings often, saving the dangling ones for special occasions. I bought some studs a while back and put them in just to keep the holes open. They were uncomfortable to sleep in poking my neck and then I lost one of the backs. These are wonderful in that the backs are flat - no poking the neck. The fronts screw on so there is little chance of the back slipping off. The shafts are piercing thick. And they are wonderful colors and designs. I love every aspect."
5.0,"As shown in the pictures, the tan hat is moderately defective. Bumpy under rim and uneven sewing on both sides around inside band. The other ones color was somewhat uneven, but not too noticeable.  Overall, there seems to be a quality control issue with these hats.<br /><br />On the other hand, they seem durable, breathable, fit well, are cheap, and made from good quality materials. The defects aren't terrible, but bad enough to need it replaced in my opinion. Will contact the company, and update this review as needed.<br /><br />(edit) I was refunded promptly, so I'm changing this review from two to five stars. Seems like an excellent hat for the price! Also, forgot to mention I got this hat in two other colors, of which were defect free."
5.0,Will definitely buy it again
5.0,I ordered this for a Mardi Gras party and it was perfect.  Very comfortable and stays in place.
5.0,I love the print on this skirt! And the asymmetrical patter of the skirt. It‚Äôs super cute!!
5.0,"I brought this dress and really didn‚Äôt think I was going to like it but let me tell you ladies this dress is wonderful, the material stretches. I brought the red one and soon as l walked out the door s couple of ladies asked me where did I get it I told them and they didn‚Äôt believe the price ... you can wear this dress anywhere... get one you won‚Äôt be sorry I‚Äôm 5 1 145 lbs and ordered an xl"
5.0,My mom loves it..
5.0,Pretty costume jewelry!
5.0,"This is my base layer, love them I ordered XS"
5.0,"Great work out pants! Stay up while doing HIIT workouts, does not show sweat (although I sweat a lot). They are also thick enough so they don't show all of my flaws and they are not see through at all. Cannot beat the price of these!"
5.0,"Received my glasses and was impressed with how they were constructed.  Got to wear them for 2 days and then found out they were not indestructible when my 2 year old Lab decided to try them out as a chew toy.  Needless to say he won the battle and they were destroyed.  I really did like them, so I ended up ordering a new pair!  These will be staying in the car and away from the dog."
5.0,Great material. Don‚Äôt have any complains. I ran my shirts a size larger then regular.
5.0,"Great product, speedy service."
5.0,These earrings are so beautiful. Might be buying another pair as my mother loved them as well.
5.0,Added a lot of fun to the party!
5.0,Perfect little &#34;favor&#34; for granddaughters!
5.0,"It‚Äôs a key ring, nothing major about it. Pretty strong though, so it‚Äôs good. Holds my keys."
5.0,I have worn these a couple time so far.  I only ordered one pair so I could compare whether or not I thought they make a difference.  They absolutely do make a difference in how my feet and legs feel throughout and at the conclusion of a 12 hour shift.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,I bout this bracket for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely LOVED IT. I 100% recommend it.
5.0,I love this piece of jewelry!!  It matches everything!  I have gotten so many compliments on the lanyard.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for Secret Santa at work. My coworker loves western style jewelry with anything that has turquoise! I think she will be pleased.
5.0,My daughter wore this to her first homecoming she is about 130 lbs 5'2 and order a size 6. Only complaint is that the back straps were too loose. We pinned it to make it tighter. Other than that it's a beautiful dress and great for the price!
5.0,Stylish and fits well!
5.0,"When i first got these gloves, i was amazed how well they are made. It also fit perfectly on my hands. I wear Large on regular moto gloves but for this gloves i got the Medium and fits perfectly. So i say this a size bigger than your normal moto gloves. Tho i did have some problems with the other glove, the right hand glove, it stopped working and also was burning my wrist when i tighten the wrist strap. I emailed the company, dino responded fairly quickly. They‚Äôre sending me a replacement. 10 thumbs up for customer service. I can‚Äôt say anything bad about the gloves. Feels very nice. The inside has fleece so even when you don‚Äôt turn on the heat, it‚Äôll still warm up your hand nicely. Used it at below 40deg temp while riding and held up pretty good. I mainly use this for riding. Its also windproof. Overtime your hands will get cold but not brutal like you‚Äôll get a frostbite. The pricking needle sensation. No not like that. Adjustable visual temps so you can adjust the temp of the heating to your liking. The battery last about 3-4 hours in my experience. Overall im pretty happy with this purchAse. Totally worth it! Hope this review helps you find the right gloves for you. This is my honest and unbiased review of this product."
5.0,"Bought to add to another necklace.  It's the perfect size, around the size of a finger nail.  I've worn it every day since it arrived, shower and to bed too, and it still looks great."
5.0,"I‚Äôm obsessed with this dress! Perfect soft fabric, high quality and not see through. Super comfortable and highly recommended. I‚Äôm ordering it in other colors!"
5.0,Very nice. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. Good quality
5.0,"I really love this top. It‚Äôs a nice material, stretchy, thicker but not too thick to be hot. It fits nicely. I ordered a 3X so it wasn‚Äôt too formfitting. I like my shirts a little loose. This top feels like it was made well. This is my second Auslook brand top that I absolutely love!"
5.0,Got these pants and matching shirt for my 3 1/2 year old grandson. He wears 4T so this fit him perfectly. They also have the elastic cinch up waistband. He‚Äôs wearing them for his Halloween costume as well as on the motorcycle. They washed up nicely.  I let them air dry. He‚Äôs adorable in them!
5.0,Quick delivery. Brand new. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Love them great price and nice. Would buy again
5.0,This item arrived on time.  I was impressed by the detail and colors of the different eggs.  I took all the little eggs and put them on a bracelet and used the big eggs and figure charms for earrings.  There are so many things I can do with these charms.  I will order my holiday charms from this company.
5.0,"Very comfortable, good length"
5.0,"Wonderful bracelet for my Mum. She has two types of chronic leukemia and is a diabetic...so, as you can see, an indestructible bracelet is important to me.  This fits the bill! I would highly recommend this!"
5.0,Can't beat the quality for the price!!! My daughter has sensitive ears and will only tolerate gold. These earrings are not only adorable but they aren't flimsy. I had no problem with the screw back feature. The legs of the deer sorta dangle from her lobes so she loves that!
5.0,"This is like a tank top with style! Cute cut that both curves in at the waist and flares out for comfort. Nice and light for summer. I like to buy a size up, as I don't like tops tight, and this one is roomy and flows nicely. Plus, the arm holes are not too low as some end up when I buy them oversized. Love the rich color as well."
5.0,Love this hat! Light weight and covers good!
5.0,"I got the 3 pack and really like the colors as they match with anything I want to wear for casual clothing. Love three fleece lining of the leggings. Soft but strong material, feels like butter! Not see through at all. Great fit!"
5.0,"Very nice watch box! Looks just like in the pictures and works perfectly. Very silent, however you probably don't want to put it next to your bed when you sleep."
5.0,Going to do the job two thumbs up
5.0,only came in size 5 hope they fit
5.0,"Bought this for my sister in law, she loves it"
5.0,I have always ordered size large shirts when getting PattyBoutik tops.  This is first time top was a little snug.  Beautiful top though and good quality.  Wasn't offered in x-large :(  Or I would of ordered another one.
5.0,Excellent material and it feels good while working out/exercising
5.0,Delivered on Time. I had tried this  style before and no luck. But this time I tried to be sure the size was large enough. Perfect !<br />The black mesh adds to the sexy.
5.0,Good quality for the price.  Not easy to find black dress shoes for the boys in the summer.  I ordered 2 pair and they shipped 2 dy with Prime.  Just in time for our event.  Size was true to fit.
5.0,Sweet and delicate and exactly as pictured. I ordered it to wear to a Christmas party and received many compliments.
5.0,Husband loves his new pajamas!!!
5.0,"Perfect shoes, my son was so excited to receive these and be the only child ad school with them. Great fit, great shoe. Overall great purchase. I would highly recommend"
5.0,This year my 5 year old daughter wants to be a vampire fairy on Halloween. I found this dress on amazon and even though there were no comments I took the risk since they accepted devolution.  The truth is I was very surprised with the result.  The dress looks exactly like the picture and the fabric is of good quality.  It can be used for various outfits according to your imagination. In our case she is going to wear black wings. The price is quite reasonable.  I definitely recommend it.  I bought size 6
5.0,It is a great set for my young daughter. Everything is great and has held up nicely. The water bottle is made of some cheap plastic from CHINA and I would recommend just throwing it out and not using it.
5.0,"IKON LENSES are an excellent replacement when you have damaged or lost lenses.  They offer a wide variety of sizes, colors, and options that make what would otherwise be a throw-away/recycle of an expensive pair of sunglasses into something you can keep. In my book, it's a great value and a perfect fit.<br /><br />As a reminder, you will need to replace both lense as you want them to match as lenses do fade and have different types of coating. If you only replace one, you will have doubt, however, by replacing them both as instructions you cannot go wrong with the color options, the size options,  and depth of product offerings.<br /><br />If I could give them 6 stars, I would!<br /><br />My suggestion to IKON LENSES is to expand to nose pieces and guards as those are lost often and need better replacement offerings, too!<br /><br />Again, IKON LENSES saved the day and helped the environment by not having to recycle a pair of sunglasses that would have otherwise ended up in the recycling bin/dump. I have to believe that based on saving the plastic of the frames, they are doing a good for the environment by not making a product otherwise be part of a dump."
5.0,I bought the XL and it looks BEAUTIFUL on me.  It did hit a bit below the knee for me but it looks so fantastic.  The underlining is silk and feels fantastic.  Loved this dress!
5.0,So impressed. So comfortable. True to size lined and great support. So happy with my purchase am going to but another in another Print or color.

5.0,It's a bit smaller than expected- but no less beautiful. It came with a couple different posts so you can wear it in different piercing styles.
5.0,"I liked this so much that I ordered more in other colors. I am a size 14 (curvy in hips) and the XL fits fine, but since I like roomy sweaters, I went up a size on subsequent orders."
5.0,Got as a present for my son he loves it
5.0,Headband was a perfect fit and kept my face dry.

5.0,One of the best clothing purchases on Amazon i got 2 sets the kids love them they are super soft very pretty and comfortable definitely worth the $$
5.0,Fut fine comfortable perfect color for my outfit
5.0,Great color and very flattering
5.0,Love!! Great color and perfect fit with room for forgiveness! Although the material is super silky yet wrinkly at the same time.
5.0,Spouse had lost a glove.  These were a perfect replacement
5.0,"This band was exactly what I was looking for.  It is advertised for the Garmin Forerunner 45 (not 45s), and I was hoping that it would fit the Garmin Swim 2 that I recently bought.  The Garmin Swim 2 looks just like the Forerunner 45 and is the exact same size.  The band fits perfectly and looks great.  I am going to order several more colors.  They are a great price and quality material.  So... if you bought the new Garmin Swim 2 (just came out in October 2019) and want some fun colored bands, these will work for you. :)"
5.0,matches my dress perfectly
5.0,"This bags holds so much inside. For my recent trip to Cuba, I was able to fit a weeks worth of clothing and still have enough room to bring goodies home for the family."
5.0,Great fit very well made
5.0,"I love this blouse with leggings. I don't wear jeans very much, but I bet they're super cute with dark jeans too. I look really good in this, lol. Sorry, but wearing this blouse makes me feel super fashionable and cute! It fits just right and it's even good in hot weather. The material is light, but not thin. Just the right length, the right amount of buttons, and the right fabric."
5.0,Polarized...... Flexible stems
5.0,I like that they come with cloth to clean them and screw driver and case and cloth bag u really did good with this product
5.0,C√≥modo fino
5.0,This dress had me feeling myself times ten! It was comfortable and I received so many compliments the night I wore it. I want the one in red now.
5.0,"Love this top. Fits great. Armholes are perfect, no bra showing. Material is a nice weight.......very happy."
5.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful dress. The quality of the material is excellent and the fit is great. Too bad the blue one sold out in my size, I would have definitely ordered it."
5.0,"I like wearing these socks in my walking shoes.  They are not high cut athletic shows.  It's hard to find socks that don't show for these lower cut shoes.  These are a little heavier than some.  They are mesh which keep my feet cooler. They have seams over the toe. The heel has a rubberized spot on the inside to hold them in place.  There's also a band of elastic around the top of the heel.  They stay put!  I hate when my socks slide down into my shoes.  These do not!  These come with tan, black, white, and grey.  Two pairs in each color.  They are 80% cotton and 15% acrylic and 5% spandex.  I wash mine in the washing machine.  I lay them out to dry because they do shrink if you put them in the dryer.  They dry very quickly."
5.0,"The good is these boots are lightweight and comfortable as winter boots go,I felt they ran small across the top of my foot(I am a normal width)so if you wear thick socks or wear inserts  you might want to go a half size up,I had to return mine.Other nice features were the heel ridge that helps keep snowshoes,crampons,and ice spike straps secure and the ""D"" ring at the lower laces for gatiers.<br /><br />The bad(possibly) as a past owner of North Face Boltero 400 boots that self destructed in my closet by the rubber sides separating from the leather uppers(I care for my equipment very well) and I see some reviews here of the same thing happening to this model.I gave North Face the benefit of doubt and purchased the Chilkat boots,if these boots suffer the same fate I will being updating this review."
5.0,"Adorable socks.  Somewhat smaller than expected but that's ok, the baby is only 6 mos old."
5.0,"Very cute necklace, will turn your neck green if you wear for an extended period of time, like, 2 or more days."

5.0,An EXACT dupe for the Gymshark Seamless. Comfy and holds everything in. Going to get every color.<br /><br />(These really aren‚Äôt made for ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù so can‚Äôt judge that.)
5.0,"Update since I feel bad, I got a new band and it works so much better I‚Äôve had it for a couple days and it didn‚Äôt fall. The other band was probably defective. I do recommend this one!<br /><br />Well to start it looks pretty nice. Until for whatever reason the pin that connects the band to the watch popped out for no reason. It‚Äôs not like the other pins connecting the links together. I tried to put it back in it stayed for a couple days but today when I was out it came off and my Apple watch almost fell off. I have no idea what‚Äôs wrong with my band and why the pin came out and won‚Äôt stay it but yeah don‚Äôt recommend not even for the price."
5.0,If you love the band you should love this key chain. It feels and looks nice. And it's the perfect size.
5.0,Gave to my niece and she loved it.
5.0,Perfect wallet for my iPhone X plus and my cards!
5.0,"I choose this pack for two reasons. Front pockets and the full length zipper. It‚Äôs very convenient to keep my phone and snacks in the front pockets. The pack holds my camelbak reservoir without issues. The pack adjust fit well. It doesn‚Äôt ventilate well, my only complaint."
5.0,Good product for keeping things separated down there. Just a bit too tight though.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, beautiful"
5.0,Didn't shrink. Very warm but not too warm. He loves them.great for a Diabetic.
5.0,"I saw this necklace and I knew I had to get it for my daughter!  It's so nice........and what a great gift to give someone - words of inspiration.<br /><br />I do like the fact it is stainless steel.  It is durable and easy to keep polished and shiny.  The chain is no ordinary chair either.  It  looks like it cost more than it does.  I am so pleased with the necklace and I am sure my daughter will love it.  Having done a little research on why stainless steel is a great alternative to gold and silver, this is what I found:<br /><br />Stainless steel requires little or no maintenance to keep it looking new.  It will retain its luster with an occasional cleaning with a mild detergent.<br />You will find that stainless steel jewelry will not will not tarnish or rust. It is durable and scratch resistant.  Stainless steel jewelry is for anyone who works with their hands.  However welders should remove their jewelry when at work.<br />Stainless steel is hypo-allergenic making it a great choice for someone whose skin is sensitive to metal. Also, it will not turn your skin green or any other color.<br />Stainless steel jewelry is a great value when compared to jewelry made out of precious metals such as sterling silver.  You can purchase a great looking stainless ring for every finger on your hand for the price of one ring made of silver.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest review.  Honestly I am so pleased with the quality and the look of the necklace.  Great inspiration quote that will make anyone's day.  I would have paid full price for this necklace.  It's very nice."

5.0,"I was unsure at first about this item but for the cost and number of lanyards for glasses I figured it was worth the cost and try em out. I am glad I did. They are Well made and the 2 types of attachments as well as the extra items that were part of the package, you can't go wrong. I do recommend the product."

5.0,very good and versatile product.<br />suite all seasons.
5.0,It is absolutely amazing!!!
5.0,"I couldn't be happier. Being a bit on the larger end of cup sizes, it's sometimes difficult to find a good bra...other than Victoria's Secret. These bras are just right. The colors are great and there's not too much of a push up which is nice since I don't need much in a D cup already. Just the right amount of cover up with a little reveal if you're looking for a certain look with a low cut shirt (if that's your thing.) Overall, cute, comfortable and good price."
5.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 120 lbs.  This fit perfect.  Great length.  Lays nicely."
5.0,"These slippers are so cute and comfortable for a great price. I've had them for at least a month now, they are extremely soft and comfortable. Great for around the house and running errands! I can wear it inside and and outside.<br /><br />Usually I wear a 6.5 in shoes. Based on other reviews, I purchased size 6.5-7.5. They fit great! I‚Äôll pick up a couple pairs for Christmas gifts as well. Love the colors they come in. SUPER BRIGHT!!!<br /><br />Definitely grab these if you can!"
5.0,"These underwear are very well made. The fabric is thick. The waistband is thick and not too tight. The pockets are on both sides and they have these tiny metal zippers that zip in either direction. The pockets are deep and wide and will easily fit large phones or a passport. I have a lot of clothes without pockets, especially dresses. I can keep my phone in the pocket and feed earbuds up under the garment. It's very discreet. Of course it's difficult to sit with a phone in the pocket, but I can live with that. I love these."
5.0,"Good size, don't get lost. Just right. Love them!"
5.0,"I just had a baby and wanted something easy to lounge in at home, where if someone showed up at my doorstep to visit, I would still feel put together. I love it!"

5.0,It‚Äôs very soft and warm!
5.0,I like the textile its stretchy but it runs really small guys. You need to have a nice body for this one because it really hugs the mid section. Over all i love it and I got a lot of good feed back .
5.0,The fabric is wonderful-so soft on the skin. The style is not flattering at all.
5.0,My granddaughter is very happy with the shirt she loves it thank u for your great services well done

5.0,"The appearance of this trendy bag reminds me of the old Indian era.<br />The color can be worn with any of your outfits and you will be complimented and envied by everyone.<br />Love the idea of the matching earrings which saves me time from looking for matching accessories.<br />Great feature: my super large cell phone fits perfectly, amongst other things.<br />I feel very special when sporting this trendy beautiful bag"
5.0,These are quite expensive compared to other shoe stretchers but are extremely well made from real hardwood and stainless steel. Why on earth would you buy plastic stretchers when you know you'll be stretching them to the limit and placing all that stress on them. I have had great success with these. I used the liquid to saturate the leather and then proceeded to stretch them both horizontally and vertically. I stretched them ever so slowly over several days and got amazing results. I highly recommend this product.
5.0,I've received many complements on this shirt and I like that you can use cuff links or buttons!
5.0,I really like this style of gown!
5.0,Worked perfect. Easy to install.
5.0,"Bought this as a back up dress for a family members wedding, Very much in love with this dress and won't be keeping it as a back up!  After opening the package I inspected the dress for holes or weak places in the seams and found none. It fits me like a glove. Material feels very nice and not cheap. It's very form fitting so expect to wear the proper foundation garments such as Spanx and maybe some double sided tape to keep the top part in place. I'm 5 feet tall, 130lbs 32DD and I ordered a small."
5.0,I am wearing this to the Christmas party for work next week. It fit perfectly when i put it on and I love it so much.  It  fit  beyond as expected as I had to return another dress from another company  that did not fit. The color is as shown and is going  to be so pretty once i<br /> accessorize.
5.0,"Even the neighbor lady commented that she liked my hat.<br />Have been wearing sun screen and now doing both, sun screen<br />and hat  as I have basal cell carcinoma‚Ä¶pay back time for all those<br />years of basking in the sun.  This hat really helps keep the<br />sun off my face and neck.  It is comfortable and stays on<br />my head with the wind and constant bending over to pull<br />weeds and planting the garden‚Ä¶Really happy it WASN&#34;T<br />MADE IN CHINA or any other third world country!!!!!"
5.0,"Wow! I bought another necklace along with this that was a little more expensive, but I bought this because it was cool on the pictures,  and cheap. I was very surprised at the quality! It can be used for both costumes and actual clothes. I'm very pleased and happy, it looks beautiful with my black Victorian shirts :D"
5.0,very comfy to wear. Thank you. I would recommend.
5.0,Made my little sister look even more beautiful. Didn't fiddle with them or anything!
5.0,Awesome fit and not too see-through. Really good price for this business casual top. Highly recommend!
5.0,Very fun bracelet!
5.0,I was a little worried this little guy couldn't handle the ice or frozen food but it is perfect! I work in a law office and am doing shakes twice a day and this portable blender is awesome! Super easy to clean and I love that it is glass and has bottom and a top with a handle to make it easily tote-able. It would probably be better to use crushed ice but I don't have access at my office so maybe I'll get a tray for mini cubes.
5.0,"This is my go to accessory, but try to be careful with it! I have had to buy one once a year since my life puts it through quite a lot of damage and stress."
5.0,The top is beautiful but does not look good on me and fits large.
5.0,"I found this hat a couple years ago for our 7 month old  - absolutely love it!  It's light weight, durable, breathable, washable, ok to get wet as it'll dry quickly, has a good brim, safe strap and a great pop of color!  Our daughter was bummed when it no longer fit her - I feel lucky to have found it available still and in a larger toddler size.  We use both hats now for our 9 month and 2 yr old and keep them in the car at all times."
5.0,"Loved it so much, I bought another one."
5.0,Super cute.  Great for work. Wear a cami underneath it.

5.0,Looks great to dress up or accent an outfit.
5.0,"Good summer set to run errands, attend a BBQ, or lounge around the house in. The material is breathable and has a stretch to it. I recommend washing in cold water and drying on low. This is a size large"
5.0,I ordered this for one of my daughters and it is even more beautiful than the photo.  We received the ring very quickly and it came in an adorable little gift box.
5.0,"Comfy, warm, cute and durable!"
5.0,"These by far are some of the best fitting caps for me. I‚Äôm an RDH and have been wearing caps since the new updated guidelines came out. I have a collection and ordered this one because I needed a black cap. I was so surprised at the quality of this cap and how well made it is. Fits well with my double mask, loupes, and face shield. I purchased 2 more since ordering this one and I hope the print with the teeth comes back into stock soon! Thank you for making a great product!"
5.0,"Love this bag.  It's light weight. Pockets are functional , zippers great.  No problems.<br />I just might order a 2nd one , different color.<br />I tried a back pack....this is Much better !"
5.0,The head wraps are very soft and great quality. The price is remarkable for two scarfs. I definitely will order again.
5.0,"Got these for working out, yard work or relaxing around the house. These were perfect!!"
5.0,This dress is so flattering! I love the neck line and the sheer fabric around the neck/chest. The pink color was also really lovely. It fit as expected!
5.0,"This is a men's large and it fits me perfectly! I'm 5ft 5, 165lbs. It's comfortable. Although the picture is kind of fuzzy, it seems appropriate given it's modeled after an 80s type school picture.  I quickly see it becoming my favorite shirt!"
5.0,Very light and nice to wear
5.0,"I knew it was going to be small when I got it but it was so dang pretty. It's way too small for every day stuff, but I keep it for when I know I only need a few things, phone, wallet, ect."
5.0,Quality product and arrived quickly.  As was advertised.  Recommend this product.
5.0,Working in a food plant this is by far the most comfortable / cool face mask I have found. I move from a cooler area to a normal temp area frequently all day and my glasses were constantly fogging up.  This issue has gotten much better and would recommend these to any essential working dealing with similar circumstances
5.0,Love these and great for night sweats. The material is thinner and doesn't make me overheat at night. Menopause causing night sweats but these help a lot!
5.0,"These fit, feel and look great. I‚Äôm shocked by their quality at this price. Love the invisible utility pockets, which are the ideal size. For comfy yoga leggings, buy your normal size. For a slimming look when you‚Äôre not working out, buy a size down. I bought my normal size and they‚Äôre super comfortable, but I‚Äôd prefer them a little more snug. All in all, a great value."
5.0,"Nice and sturdy, also nice looking."
5.0,"My boyfriend likes fun patterns and being from Maryland, we love crabs so naturally I had to buy them! He's gotten lots of compliments on them and they're really well made."
5.0,I ordered larger and like this with leggings. Nice fabric and cool and comfortable. Not a perfect fit for U.S. figures. Tight in the sleeves.
5.0,I love this and I would wear it everyday if I could.  I have told all my friends to buy one(every girl should have one)
5.0,This was a big hit with my 13 yo niece who is a ballerina. I gave it to her for xmas and she didn't take it off for the rest of their 4 day trip. It hung just the right length and was good quality for the price.
5.0,they are easier to get on and off than my other compression socks!
5.0,"Exactly what I needed for cold morning runs!  On mornings when a fleece headband just isn't warm enough, this hat is perfect.  I wear my hair in a pony-tail for runs and weather I'm wearing a high or a mid level pony tail, there is a spot to pull it through.  This hat is very warm and super-comfy!  Love the fleece liner around my ears.  Stays on well, but not so tight that my earphones hurt!"
5.0,My great granddaughter look cute as a button in the outfit
5.0,Product is used to sleep in.Very comfortable& soft
5.0,"i absolutely love this ring, and the color iz awesome!!"

5.0,"Went skiing and the whole family and we all had one of these hats , we we‚Äôre all able to listen to our own music , and if we got a phone call , all we had to do was push a button on the hat to answer the call , no need to pull the phone out of your jacket. Nothing better then skiing what Music in your ears"
5.0,This is a great cozy coat. It runs a little large so I ordered a size down. Good value for the money.
5.0,Love these. Look great. Great price and nice case.
5.0,this was a gift for our daughter  she was so surprised and sooo happy to get it I couldn't believe the price and how quick we received it in the mail i will definitively order again
5.0,My son loves his fox tail and ears. He likes to wear it to store. I wish the string was something else stringer like a buckle. It's hard to get it right enough but we make due. The ears clip in hair. Very cute. Fox tail can bend and shape. Tail is bigger then I imagined but we'll made.
5.0,Did not like the quality of the item.  It looked a little cheap.
5.0,"I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. Sure, I read the reviews and they were very positive (all 5 stars on each of the 7 reviews), but we've all heard whispers of ""paid reviews"" and ""friend reviews"" and other shady things to boost a new product's ratings to entice potential customers. Sometimes you can spot the fake reviews because they sound canned, too perfect or just the opposite -- misspellings, grammatical errors, whatever. As I said, I ordered it anyways.<br /><br />Wow! Okay...WOW!! I am incredibly impressed with the color, the material quality, the beautiful design, the stitching, everything. This strap looks and feels like a men's silk tie, but with the strength and flexibility of my truck's seatbelt.<br /><br />As soon as I slid my custom laser-etched strap silder onto it, then attached it to my Nikon F5 35mm film SLR camera, I could feel my smile spread across my face and I knew, without a doubt, that I had made the right decision. **See the attached photograph of my SLR camera.<br /><br />I'm going to order a second strap from Cheliz with a different design for my Nikon D810. I'm sure it will look just as remarkable and brilliant. In fact, I am so impressed that I am considering ordering a couple more as gifts for some photographer friends of mine.<br /><br />I have one more thing to say, ""If you are on the fence about ordering this strap, just do it. You will not regret your decision.""<br /><br />Oh, and if you're wondering where I found someone to custom laser-etch my logo onto a slider as in my photo, I found them at [w w w . f o t o s t r a p . c o m]."
5.0,Los recomiendo mucho . Excelente inversi√≥n
5.0,Es muy buen reloj

5.0,These com[pression socks really help keep my legs from swelling up during the day when I do a lot of siting.
5.0,This compact case doesn't add a lot of unnecessary bulk. It has several choices of attachment. It is just as advertised and looks to be just what we wanted for one pair of glasses.
5.0,"Kevin loves his new hat!!  Well made, quick delivery!"
5.0,This is honestly the best polishing cloths I have ever used! Will buy again!!
5.0,"This dress is SO cute. The material is nice. It fits wonderfully, and flares out just the right amount in the skirt. The belt is super cute. This was a great buy and I'm so glad I picked the dress. I was nervous that it would be &quot;cheap&quot; but it was terrific."
5.0,Great fit. Love for whatever casual occasion.
5.0,Very well made. We really like this product. Will keep buying them.
5.0,"Lots of functional pockets!  This pack will work with a water bladder, that was a must! Most backpacks have straps that are narrow across the neck . These straps don't squeeze your neck.  It's comfortable to wear."
5.0,I got so MANY compliments on this dress.  Love it!
5.0,"Great little wallet! Started trying to always have cash on me and wanted something sleek.<br /><br />Great minimalist design. Money clip isn't super strong but it does the job.<br /><br />Cool slot that you can pop your main credit card out of with the little read draw strap. Fun feature.<br /><br />Wish it had a magnetic close, but once it's in your pocket it's fine.<br /><br />Wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
5.0,Got a medium and I usually wear a size 10 or 12. Medium fits well. Pretty dress and color. Very flattering.
5.0,another slim backpack for minimalistics purposes
5.0,Bought for my 12 y o granddaughter‚Äôs birthstone Christmas gift. She loves them and I like the size. I was afraid they‚Äôd be too tiny but they‚Äôre perfect size for her as a tall youngling with long hair who looks more like 15!

It is easy to put on and off. It stays closed nicely.<br /><br />It is flattering and looks attractive. It seems durable and well made. The fit is fine. It is a good thickness, and has nice coverage. It is great on a cool night. It would make a nice gift.  I would recommend it."

5.0,Good quality strap easy to adjust and change combination
5.0,"This is a little bigger than I expected - for some reason I pictured it as a wristlet, but it's too big for that. It's a nice sized bag that can fit a shaver or other small cosmetic/toiletry items. Or it can make a great camera bag. It certainly has its uses. The leather feels tough and durable. Great for traveling with or just for keeping your items neatly categorized."

5.0,LOVE this necklace!  Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Super cute swim trunks! Fits true to size.
5.0,"Cute shoes for church, perfect for a tween (traditional black flat with sparkle)."
5.0,"I received a discount for my honest review of this dress.<br />the dress material is of good quality, I would say a medium thickness. the pattern was similar to the picture.  There were a few wrinkles when the dress was taken out of the bag, but they ironed out very nicely. The fit is good, but I will wear the dress a few more times before I decide if I need to take it to a tailor for a few minor alterations to the hem and bust.  I am very please with the overall quality of the dress."
5.0,So dope!!
5.0,Love the feel of the shirts and the length was great.
5.0,"Comfortable, soft, like the colors"
5.0,"A Valentine gift for my life partner, best friend, and best Internal Medicine doctor in all 50 states, he loved it and therefore, I loved it too!  He is not one to wear such a beautiful object..... but he was showing it off to everyone for days and days after Valentine's Day.  He did me proud!"
5.0,This necklace looks the real thing. FYI - it takes weeks to get it but<br />it's worth the wait. Recommend.
5.0,A good product just what you want on your luggage to make it easy to find on the carousel

5.0,My daughter is obsessed with FNAF and begged for face masks to wear out. I relented and she is thrilled with them. She hopes whenever we go back to school to wear them and scare her friends.
5.0,"very comfortable, especially in hot weather."
5.0,It's cotton and my GF loves it!
5.0,"I really liked these and they have some really good patterns,  I actually ordered a few<br />Of them.<br />Thanks"
5.0,"A little smaller than I anticipated, but can't blame seller for that. Exactly as pictured. Delivery was a tad slow."
5.0,"I do not use this as a diaper bag, although I'm sure it would make a fine one.  I use it as a book bag.  I love the six outside pockets, where I can stash earbuds, mouse, pens/pencils, and other necessary items I want to reach quickly.  The inside has two large pockets, divided by a little Velcro tabs.  I keep the pockets tabbed so I can slide smaller notebooks in there.  It's generously spaced inside to handle my files and my 13"" laptop.  It comes with a diaper pad, but I had no use for that, so I pitched it.  It also has two straps inside to hook on a stroller or cart, but again, I have no use for that either.  I love it doesn't look like a diaper bag.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,This is so adorable. I can‚Äôt wait until my niece can wear it.
5.0,Wonderfully soft and comfortable! I was weary since it was $25 but it‚Äôs amazing!
5.0,Beautiful dress- so many compliments!!! I love it!!!
5.0,Absolutely Love It!
5.0,Very comfortable.. I get compliments on the beautiful colors..
5.0,Showed up to the party in these comfy kickin' booties only to realize my teenage neice owns the same shoes. I'm so hip now. All the kids say so.<br />True story.
5.0,I bought this backpack for my daughter to take on her trip to Europe. She says it was perfect for what she needed to take for 12 days. It was light to carry and it held up well.  Great purchase and didn‚Äôt break the bank!
5.0,I am a boot/shoe/tennie freak! These boots are an amazing addition to my collection! Super comfortable even after a night out!
5.0,Pants are very soft and comfortable! Love the pocket for my phone!
5.0,"Very soft material, nice colour, maybe a lil too big! But for the rest is perfect!"
5.0,a gift for my sister; perfect size...she loved them!
5.0,they look cool
5.0,I love this purse. It's stylish and a really nice color. Looks just like the picture.
5.0,"I purchased the XL cup and it is the most comfortabl cup I have ever worn. I especially like the size, I have XL equipment so it only makes sense to wer an XL protective cup.  It can be worn for hours with great comfort.  It is also easy to sanitize."
5.0,"Quite nice, like the drawstring and back hat design"
5.0,These shoes are really cute!  The quality is nicer than I expected.
5.0,"Fits perfectly!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 about 140 and I got the s/m. I love the high waist, they don‚Äôt ride down, butt looks great!"
5.0,Great material! A little big but if you've got hips and booty it'll be short in the back. I'll be using it for a fun Beach coverup!!
5.0,"Likes:<br /><br />* Great everyday jewelry<br />* Pure and polished looking<br />* Quality construction (No glue or marks of any kind from manufacturing process)<br />* Excellent price point<br /><br />Suggestions:<br /><br />* The chain may be a little thick for some people's tastes<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to receive and review this necklace with no obligation. I found this piece to be very warming. Aside from the chain, (which I mentioned was a little thick for my taste) this is thoughtfully crafted to be a great daily accessory. This could be purchased as a simple gift to show your affection for someone, or as a self purchase to spruce up your look. Either way I don't think you can go wrong.  The two piece heart design is elegant and the crystals shine boldly around it.  Take a look at some of my pictures for a closer view. The measurements in the product description are accurate.  I hope this helps you make your decision."
5.0,"I found them lightweight, comfortable and stylish. Just as good probably better than the more expensive glasses. Frames are not as heavy on your face. Would definitely recommend"
5.0,"Five stars as of day 1. Quality seems much nicer than a previous slim wallet I had. Plenty of pockets but still much slimmer than my bifold wallet. The look is very unique, functional, and ‚Äúguchi‚Äù. I think it will be very much worth the small price tag. No complaints"
5.0,Wife loved it and uses everywhere. Highly recommend and specially for the price.
5.0,"Great looking watch, really nice display and very comfortable to wear."
5.0,"Loved these, this is my second pair.  Much less expensive than sunglass stores as mall."
5.0,Love the colors and they fit well.
5.0,versatile for the imaginative and innovative gal.  Great price and quality
5.0,Bought two for twin girls.  They looked so cute.
5.0,I just received it. It‚Äôs perfect. Slight peachy pink translucent. Seriously perfect. Thanks. Will be back
5.0,[[VIDEOID:d52649cc71b6d5244a25806ac39a19d5]] Love it<br />And price is amazing<br />Looks really good I‚Äôm surprised.
5.0,"I first had trouble getting it to fit on my 2014 Ram 1500, but then I just left it on my dashboard. Came back 2 hours later and it was just warm enough to get it on without too much trouble. Will still need a pair of strong hands though."
5.0,"Even though this runs slightly bigger on me than I would have liked, I have a feeling if I'd ordered the small it would be too small in the arms and/or shoulders.  But I'm keeping it because it's SO pretty and I didn't realize the darker stripes are actually a slate gray/blue, and I have leggings in that exact color already.  Nice top!!"
5.0,This is a great sweatshirt! It fits as expected.
5.0,Nice and firm but stretchy.  Feels very comfortable and dries quickly.
5.0,"Exactly as described! The leggings are soft to the touch, comfortable to wear all day and the color is as advertised. The light ones (khaki) are not see-through, yet are light-weight.  I'll be ordering more in various colors."
5.0,Amazing shoes ! Smell so nice ! Very cute
5.0,Thin. Great for in the home
5.0,"The fabric is comfortable and it has a pocket for keys, etc.  Great work out shorts!"
5.0,"Super cute, fits nicely :)"
5.0,My shirt is too tight.
5.0,"Great classic shirt, perfectly simple."
5.0,I live in Florida but I freeze everyday at work. I am always bundled up since they keep the air at 70 degrees and my fingers are numb. I was so excited to bring my new gloves to work. They keep my hands warm and they are not big and bulky. They have a cute design and I am still able to type on the keyboard and use my phone.
5.0,"Not as soft as my last band (real leather) but it's exactly what I needed. Super easy to install. First few days it was a tiny bit uncomfortable but now that it's broken in it feels so much better and looks great. Made an old watch look brand new, love it!"
5.0,This is a good hoodie. It hasn‚Äôt shrank or faded. I have worn and washed the shirt quite a bit. It‚Äôs very comfortable and the hood is large. Very happy I bought this. Green with black stripes
5.0,"Love this (The Bag Bag) So cute, Bright colors and great for us dog lovers!!"
5.0,"Used these to pack for a 6 week trip and WOW do they work! A giant duffel bag holds SO much more than a hard case luggage, and with these organizers, you don't have to worry about it getting all balled up into one mess! I bought two sets of these and wow they worked well. Kept me so organized (and I am not organized when it comes to packing usually)."
5.0,"Excellent, affordable, cold weather coat.  Washable, too.  I bought this coat specifically to take my dog on walks and hikes during the winter. It gets dirty and muddy like you would expect with a large dog in the woods. You can easily wipe it off with a damp paper towel or washcloth, or toss it in the wash on cold. It's a really nice looking coat for the price."
5.0,"This watch is perhaps just a WEE bit ridiculous, but I LOVE IT!! It's big enough to prove slightly unwieldy in work situations (if you have to do anything with your hands, anyway), but as a special occasion or dress watch, it's fabbo indeed. The shiny brass gives it a slightly steampunk look, which I love. Invicta makes GREAT watches, reasonably priced and extremely well constructed."
5.0,"Very nice.  I'm tired of the silicone-rubber straps for a Seiko 5 and am waiting for a new black canvas band from Seiko.  I wanted leather.  This band looks nice and will work to dress up the SNK 807.  I wish the 18 mm could flare out to 20 mm but for this price, I'm happy with the feel, leather, and look."
5.0,"Adorable! Love, love, love these! Just the right size !"
5.0,and ive dropped them a few times..and had them rub up against stuff in my pack and they still seem very good
5.0,Used these in an elementary school field day event.  Worked out great!
5.0,You never have size small. I have a person who needs small size. You need to get small size and notify me.<br />Mauris Watkins
5.0,"I purchased these gloves because I read these were great for beginners. Because I am starting out, I wanted something affordable and that would last me. I can honestly say, these are both affordable and have great quality.<br />Soon as I got them, i put them on and they fit great. The lights are so bright and each color is so vibrant. Definitely stands out at night. I love practicing with them and can't wait to use them at the next concert..<br /><br />I can definitely suggest these for anyone, especially beginners. Great gloves to start out with!"
5.0,"I  researched compression socks for two weeks before finally purchasing these socks. My concern was that they would not fit properly, as I am near the cusp of both sizes offered (shoe size 9, 5' 6&#34;, A - 16&#34;, B - 10&#34;, C - 15&#34;, and D - 9&#34;).  I purchased the Large and they fit great.  They are very comfortable, the cotton feels much better than nylon compression socks, and they keep your feet warm if you opt to take off your shoes during the flight."
5.0,"Nice but a little too big for me, clunky."
5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my 3yr old niece and she absolutely loves it! It is very lightweight and feels so soft against your skin.  She normally wears size 3t-4t so I bought the size recommended for 4-5yrs. She can wear it now but she also has room to grow.  At just over $10 the price was unbeatable! I would definitely recommend.
5.0,"I‚Äôm allergic to metal and have changed all of my body jewelry to bioflex, these came in just like the picture and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with wearing it! Good enough quality for the price!"
5.0,So soft and warm. Better quality than expected. I ended up buying for my family.
5.0,Very nice .  My 2nd pair.. have black and a blue
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend to place on the lapel of his suit. Its a perfect size and he gets compliments all the time.
5.0,Love the bat for my baseball hats. Looks nice in my sports room. Wish the hooks were a little more spaced out
5.0,"These are a good value. Are they they highest quality satin boxers? no. but for the price they are very good. I used the size descriptions by another reviewer to make sure I got the correct size. Large. I like them some what loose. I have some Croft and Barrow ones that are higher quality, but also were twice the price. I would buy these again."
5.0,Very nicely crafted pair of red coral earrings. Nice wires. Good quality. Class design. Worth the money for sure
5.0,Love the design of green and silver - not too much green for green outfits.
5.0,Very comfortable.  Extra cushion on soles of feet.
5.0,"Love these bra comfortable and great to breastfeed makes it super easy, this is a must of you are planing to breastfeed or pump great price for 3 bras because usually they are very expensive almost 30 for each at retail stores"
5.0,Great gift idea. Stocking stuffers for Christmas.
5.0,excellent product/ very fast service
5.0,"I love my new shades. They are super cute, super light, and perform well."
5.0,"I use this product as a foot soak bath and I love it however, with my clumsy self my foot sometimes spills the water. I found a way around the mess by using pet pads underneath and they work great!"
5.0,"I love this wallet insert!  I do not use it as an insert, but just have it in my tiny purse with my cards, license, etc.  It fits wonderfully, and makes it possible to carry around a small purse instead of a monster purse!"
5.0,"I adore these earrings. They are sooo cool, look good with denim, and people always notice them!"
5.0,Thumbs up....fits nice and very warm.
5.0,"Soft, good material. Price is overrated."
5.0,"Ordered a small for my 12 year old (he is 5' 1"") and it fit him great!  Came just to above the floor so he still has room to grow.  He loved everything about the outfit.  I was expecting a cheep fabric that was thrown together like other costumes we have purchased in the past but it was actually a little heavier better quality fabric.  He is pretty slim so the velcro on the pants had to be pulled tight but it worked out great.  Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Liked very much, get compliments"
5.0,"A staple of my summer looks that I will use more! I got the black and grey two pack in a large and it fit true to size. It's soft and offers a nice stretch! It's a good length; I'm 5'5"" and it goes right below my belly button. I like the razorback look of the straps and it pairs well with leggings, skirts, and shorts! Like with all the other clothing I get on Amazon, I got them on sale, so I would say look out for a deal to get these."
5.0,Love this shirt for hubs! Dries fast with water or condensation (sweat)!
5.0,This is adorable. It is part of a present for my daughter. The quality seems good and is as described.
5.0,I got this jacket for my daughter. She reports that it  keeps her warm in the snowy weather. also it looks just as cute as the picture. It fits as expected.
5.0,"I‚Äôm very happy with the quality of these earrings.  I ordered the 5mm which is the perfect size. The posts are long enough on these. I‚Äôve read several reviews as that being an issue which must be with smaller sizes. In addition to looking great, they are lightweight as well."
5.0,Great price for a pair of sunglasses polarized & fit light & smooth. Cool deal
5.0,My son likes this mask the best. I ordered another.
5.0,I'm so glad I ordered this dress. It fit perfectly and looked so nice.
5.0,Easy to use exactly what I needed
5.0,"Great, for party"
5.0,Love the color. It's very comfortable and great for leisure activities.
5.0,Adorable. I love this bag.
5.0,Best gloves for my 4 and 6 year old boys!  Perfect for those fall days
5.0,"Got this for my daughter for traveling in Europe, she was very pleased with the pack, no problems. Great price."
5.0,"Love these readers. I wear them everyday at work. For me they are my favorite. I have to wear a mask all day at work and since these are oversized they help cut down on fogging up as I can wear them a little farther down on my mask. Even at home I love the way they look. Only wish they came in more colors, I would buy them all!"
5.0,Cute fishin hat but did not have a strap so my baby kept taking it off. So I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 like I would of.
5.0,I did not expect it to be so soft. It looks nice and I purposely got a slightly larger fit so I could comfortable wear another jacket with it.
5.0,"Delivered more than 2 weeks prior to estimated date.<br />Hat is folded, and does come very deformed, but it steamed out easily, and I am so excited to wear it at my friends &#34;Derby&#34; themed bachelorette party!!"
5.0,"I got this dress because I'm sick of wearing my yoga pants every where. I wore it with a lace racer back bra and my husband couldn't stop complimenting me. I thought I was just throwing on a flowy dress for errands, but doesn't hurt that it's cute!"
5.0,This is a gift for Christmas. No reviews yet.
5.0,"These work for the sordin headset. You just have to clamp the ends a little so that the headset doesn‚Äôt come off. The plastic seems a little cheaper than the 20$ arc rails out there, so we will see if they hold up. But still a good product for the price."
5.0,"The fit of this top is spot on and the quality is great; substantial material without being too hot for the summer.  I'm 5' 8&#34;, 36B, 150 lbs and I ordered the medium. I actually ordered the white but got the black by mistake. However, I love the black so much that I kept it and reordered in white. Great value for the price!"
5.0,"This &#34;ROMWE Women's Summer Casual Cap sleeve Jersey Shift Mini Dress is great! Perfect for any occasion. You can dress it up or down very easily. It is super versatile and can be worn in any season. It is very comfortable, losley flows on the body and is the perfect length. And the material is soft, but not see through at all, that was my biggest concern. I am 5'7&#34; and 160 lbs and the Large fits perfectly. I always tend to buy dresses in a Large size because I like them to be roomy and make sure they cover everything. Especially a dress that's supposed to be flown like this one. But if you're looking for a casual grey dress this is the one!!<br />Large: Bust: 38.58 inch, Length: 34.25 inch<br />Overall a fun dress to wear, mind you check your dress size and go a size up if needed.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />All opinions are based on personal use and ar not in any way influenced by the seller."
5.0,"Great Tee shirt, given as a gift."
5.0,I love this easy going summer dress!
5.0,Garment is long enough to where it nearly covers your belly button. Fabric is very soft and comfortable.
5.0,Great pair of sunglasses and very cool packaging.These lenses have good workmanship and if you notice the uv protection
5.0,"This should be in the box with the Quest 2. OK, I know that would increase the price, so I get it. But really, if you're going to be using your headset much, one of these is definitely worth it. It keeps the headset tight to your face for less light leakage, and it keeps it from slipping down over time. Also, it's a nice red!"
5.0,"The glasses are very cool, got a ton of compliments so I ordered another ones in different color."
5.0,These pajamas are actually very true to the size. Material is very soft and comfortable the waistband on the shorts has got a good amount of elastic and stretches pretty good. Does not shrink or discolor during washing or the drying process.
5.0,Looks good on a LARGE guy.
5.0,"2nd ring from LingMei and again I LOVE this ring!!! I'm an August baby and wanted peridot and this is perfect for me. It is set beautifully, I was a little worried it wouldn't be. I opened it and didnt see the shine right away, but when i went into the light...ahhhh just beautiful! I love this seller so far, the prices are great and so far the products have been excellent. I highly recommend. The quality for the price is great. If you want a ring that looks like the real thing..here you go. Really pretty. Very satisfied customer. Have two more things on the way and I can't wait. Worth the 18 day wait in my opinion. Beautiful! Ok, I'm done gushing...thank you guys for nice products.<br />(Pics can't capture how great it is)"
5.0,"Its breathable when working out and not too open that it's a problem. The material is cool and I haven't had to worry about over heating or feeling like I really gotta get out of it asap. It is as expected, each one, but I thought the price was a little high for it. I would've think each one should be priced at $6-7, not $8-9."
5.0,It is exactly as advertised and is a very flattering plus-sized swimsuit.
5.0,Quality for cost
5.0,"Beautiful, fits perfectly!"
5.0,These are so soft and comfortable! They are perfectly stretchy so they stay in place. I ordered smalls and they are just a bit bigger than a regular small. I highly recommend.

5.0,My grandson loved his pjs. We had a pj sleepover. FYI I bought mine here on Amazon too. I'm glad I purchased this for him. Fit true to size and very soft.

5.0,"Well made, warm, looks good, nice side pockets"
5.0,This is a great piece to add to a jewelry project. Strands are perfect length.
5.0,"My daughter wanted this shirt because she had some fun, funky patterned shorts and she needed some plain T's to wear with them. She likes the black shirt because it goes well with her shorts, but also she says she could wear them with her black dress pants, she said the shirt fits well and is comfortable and when she wore them with her black pants, she felt like a ninja."
5.0,I love the way the bra fits and feels just wish I did not have to put it over my head other than that I love it
5.0,Very happy with this bra. It's extremely comfortable. My girls need a lot of support.
5.0,These socks are great! Great grip on the Reformer footbar and hardwood floors. The open toes prevent the socks from pulling when repositioning foot. The best mens socks I've found to use on the Reformer
5.0,Very nice.  Wife loves it.
5.0,Product was as described and fit great for 32 inch waist.
5.0,I just wish they had more colors
5.0,As usual....another great pair! Will be buying 2 more pairs for gifts.

5.0,"These are great lenses. The lenses are as described ,polarized. As a bonus you get a pouch to store them and a koozie. Defintelty would buy these again in the future."
5.0,This is so cool and  actually a lot warmer than you think. I got it two size to big sadly but even with a big it still looks pretty good.  The  sleeves are a little bit tricky  but it is pretty easy once you figure it out.  Material is good to no Scratching material Feel.
5.0,very easy to handle and very helpful i recommend
5.0,Kid loves the shoes he wanted light up shoes but I got him these values for money and he loves them. He called them his fast shoes

5.0,right for the price.
5.0,"Nice soft material, good roomy fit. This always elicits compliments when worn."
5.0,Perfect size and they wrap around so you don't get tge sun from the side. Also they dont slip down if your face gets sweaty.
5.0,classy and sturdy well made
5.0,Very pretty.  I would coat the bottom with clear nail polish to prevent it losing the silver color
5.0,"My husband lost his Nike polarized glasses right before our vacation, so I bought these 3 days before we left them. He really likes them- He loves that they are very lightweight and have a dark lens. He wishes they were polarized but for that price you can't complain."
5.0,Like these better THan the 135$ Justin ray bans my friend got
5.0,very cute and nice and warm
5.0,"They run really small. I would advise one to get this is at least two sizes up. I love the quality of the fabric. I might need to loose weight, but for the most part, they were tight. I fit a large and it was tight, I would recommend at least 1 to 2 sizes up. I like a loose fitting pj."
5.0,"Male, 6'8"", 230 lbs. ordered 2xl.  Fits great, well made, looks good, feels good, good price, got here quick.  Good value, nice buy."
5.0,Ordered and it was there in less than 7 days. Fit perfectly!
5.0,I work outside and I wear this every day. No scratches or dents. It's so strong and reliable and I love the watch. It's really comfy too

5.0,"Very pretty, and soft. I love it"
5.0,"I wore them up to the mountains and they were perfect for keeping the glare down and I looked the part while hanging out at the lodge at the bottom of the slopes. They are better than expected and I always get so many compliments. Even my corgi, Penny Loafer, loves them! I almost never put my glasses in their case, but these survive all the travel wear and tear. They really are scratch resistant. Free cloth case is a plus. The multi colored reflective lenses are rad. definitely a great retro look. I would buy again."

5.0,Exactly what I wanted. This set is beautiful and very comfortable.
5.0,it's a great watch for kids.
5.0,Good goggles.  Keeps water out even during a dive.
5.0,"We had a decades day at work and it was perfect for the occasion. The outfit is see through, especially the back, so plan on wearing something underneath. I also wore a sweater over mine, but I didn't feel it took from the outfit since the fringe is only in the front anyways.  Having the headpiece and necklace included made the costume even more worth its value."
5.0,The watch is gorgeous and looks very nice on.
5.0,Item exactly as described. Color matched image. Very comfortable fit. Highly recommend these slippers.
5.0,Amazing quality. Very soft. Thin but very warm.

5.0,Great quality better than you see in the photo
5.0,OMG these were great quality and adorable
5.0,"The umbrella is just what I was looking for, it looks strong, in my experience it is definitely necessary to put the weight on it, otherwise I would have to fix it to the floor, my family and I are happy with the purchase"
5.0,Works as advertised.  Simple to use.  Spray it on and let it dry.  Steam and shape hat and you're done.
5.0,It is a great quality hiking hat for me. It‚Äôs very wide and great material.
5.0,Love the bands! So far so good!
5.0,No issues with it so far.
5.0,They're gorgeous. Sparkling beautifully. Nice size for going out. Wish they were a tad bit smaller for everyday. Cant wait to wear them!
5.0,"Great easy concept that allows more storage for a carry-on. I use these primarily for t-shirts and underwear. If the items are not folded properly, they wrinkle. Also great for a backpack so that clothing stays separate."
5.0,"I really liked the look and feel of this top.  It's thicker than I thought it would be.  Which is nice because it's not see through.  The nice details on the bottom of the shirt just makes it look even nicer.<br />The back is longer than the front.  Covers enough of my problem areas.<br />The front comes a bit longer than my waist line.<br />Can wear this lounging in the house, for work, or dressed up a little to go out for the night.<br />Shorts, jeans, capri's, or dress pants, this tank top looks nice with either.<br />Size is true."
5.0,"Cheap, simple, and it works. Keeps time reliably, functional alarm and stopwatch, 24 and 12 hour time with date, this watch is unbeatable value. Would buy again."
5.0,"Bought this to cover my mid section. Covers nicely and is a cute style. Nice stretch to fabric, very comfortable. Bought more like it."
5.0,I like that face mask. It proved to be better then others I own. I use it to work in the deep freezer environment so I need a facemask that could keep me warm and protect against cold and wind. And this one does just that. Material is nice to touch and fit is very snug.
5.0,My son wanted a pair of gloves that would minimally reduce his dexterity.  I thought these might work.  They fit his hands great and i think he likes having an adjustable strap. Three stars for touch screen review becaise I do not know how the touch screen feature works and he has not told me.
5.0,Oh my goodness! I can honestly say I never never purchased such an amazing deal from Amazon. This scarf is SOFTER than a lot of my other scarfs which I paid almost 50 dollars for. Such an amazing quality item. Definitely will be purchasing more... maybe all! You will not regret purchasing this scarf.. wow.
5.0,"Originally purchased as a gag gift, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.  Fabric is very soft and comfy.  Looks pretty good and a reasonable unisex size."
5.0,"Bought this tie for my son who promptly took to the internet to find videos on ways to tie a bow tie!  He really enjoys wearing the tie to work, and has become a pro at tying it.  Apparently you can tie a bow tie quite a few different ways to add personality.  He told me that people he encounters at his work are always impressed when they find out that he ties his own bow tie!  The tie is made of a very classy looking material that always looks crisp and wrinkle free, even after many times of re-tying.  The vibrant red color is gorgeous and adds pop to a wide range of colored shirts."
5.0,makes me looks professional
5.0,Love it!!! Finally can fit everything in my wallet. Reading the other reviews made me nervous to purchase but I love it especially for the price
5.0,Daughter loves it. good quality.
5.0,I normally wear a medium but I had to reorder and get a small lovely shirt!!
5.0,It is a lot bigger than it looks which is a good thing. It is perfect for what we wanted. Highly recommend this umbrella.
5.0,"I never knew buying a dress without trying it on could be such an amazing experience! Because of the reviews, I made this purchase, and I have not been disappointed at all! I‚Äôm leaving for a cruise on Sunday, and I‚Äôll be wearing this during that time. It is adorable, Fits amazing, very sexy, And is very forgiving and flattering at the same time. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
5.0,I bought these for my 10 month old so he can crawl around and stand up without sliding around. They fit him great and he doesn't try to pull them off.
5.0,Super quality for the price
5.0,"It's funny and well made, I'm not sure how much more I can say about a t-shirt :)"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:84f5c98dbef02447a03f085feda23ba9]] I didn't have high hopes for this because at the time of purchase it was $26. Most other types of these are well over $40. However, son HAD to have this for Halloween.<br />This will probably not last more than a few wears without getting torn. Oh well for the price I don't care! Cheaper than most other costumes.<br />The only complaint is that it doesn't have hand holes, like the feet holes. I am going to find some way to modify it, though.<br /><br />Plus it shiped faster than originally stated! We ordered Tuesday, it came Friday, when it was originally projected for Sunday."
5.0,Just the best and soft leggings. Ordered more.
5.0,The pajamas looked great and are comfortable.
5.0,Very pretty .comfortable fit.Easy to adjust. Wish had more colors and that go with my watch. My watch is silver clips on sides are black. Still looks pretty but need more options and colors . I wear every day has not stretched out . Worth the money.

5.0,I love this ring.  It's smooth finish and low cost make it perfect for the price point.
5.0,"These seem to be quality well made boots. I‚Äôm deciding whether to keep them or not, I still haven‚Äôt worn them outside as I‚Äôm trying multiple boots to find the ones I love. So I‚Äôm not sure how warm they are or how they hold up. I really wanted the Toronto by Groundies, but it vanished away from Amazon and has yet to return. I love the thin flexible sole. I love that the toe box is wide enough for my feet to splay. I have had the hardest time finding boots and these feel so good. The trouble is they are much lower than I truly want, as I prefer  a tall boot. I also don‚Äôt love the slouchy look."

5.0,"This dress is super cute and made from great quality material. I was pleasantly surprised! My daughter absolutely loves it. The crown is a little tricky, but if we put her hair in a bun it stays nicely."
5.0,"I have a great habit of destroying watches so I wanted an inexpensive watch that looked good and didn't rip the hairs off my arm while wearing.  This watch stays in place, it's thin, durable and looks sharp.  The band is strong, and the clasp closes well and stays closed.  I received quite a few unsolicited compliments on it."
5.0,Great quality and price. Bought for my wife who is a nurse and can't wear her metal bands at work. These are just as nice as the other guys if not better!
5.0,My son loved it. It was comfortable and reusable.  Easy to breathe in and wash.
5.0,Nice quality. Like the fabric.
5.0,Don't mind the scuffs I've been wearing them this week. I work for amazon and these are so far so good with durability. Which says a lot because I run through boots so fast ü•≤ so I like them. Got a lot of compliments.üòéüëç
5.0,Love this cap! Very comfortable.  Keeps my face mask straps off my ears.  I am a  small female adult and this cap is not too big but also fits my husband who is an average size male. I would recommend this cap for anyone who has to wear a N95 mask all day.  I plan to order more

5.0,Easy to put on watch.
5.0,Love these leg warmers. I will buy more for sure!
5.0,Not enough support for a 40DD to wear alone but I use it as a ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù under silk shirts and it does a fabulous job. Also the lace peeking out is a nice touch and disguises cleavage in a professional environment. Great product.
5.0,Good construction and so far it‚Äôs holding up well!
5.0,"This watch strap is quality made and extremely well priced.  I needed a short strap for my small wrist, and this 16mm strap fit both my watch and my wrist perfectly.  My watch is 18K rose gold with a mother of pearl face and rose gold and black hour markers.  This black crocodile band makes the watch look very classy. I love the quick-release pins for ease in changing straps.  Love this product!"

5.0,"Beautiful piece, and quality and workmanship."
5.0,"These are regular ankle socks, but I love the variety in color. They feel like they could easily work interchangeably with casual and business casual attire. Not too thin, but right kind of breathable. Exactly as pictured and match my expectation fully."
5.0,These are amazing!!! They really look like skinny jeans without all the discomfort of skinny jeans. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised when I tried them on. They are a thick material and not see-thru or thin at all. They look really cute with a tunic and boots and I would definitely buy them again.

I wear them all the time when I'm inside, outside and around my house. Walking the dog, playing fetch, or hanging out. Awesome shoes."

I was a bit hesitant cause the stone looked a little plain in the seller photos but i loved the style so i took a chance and bought one for me and my mom AND....i am so glad i did! Not only does the style just look one of a kind each of our stones is uniquely different and she loves hers too! Hers is more sheer and crystally looking and mine is more iridescently sheer. (Photos/video are only of my ring) Indoor and out door lighting the rings are beautiful.<br /><br />The metal seems to be true silver since I am allergic to Nickle alloy and copper. and this ring has not bothered me so far. (925 is stamped twice on inside of ring)<br /><br />True to size.<br /><br /> FYI it took about a month to get here but worth the wait. (Oregon)"

5.0,"this purchase was a gift for my spouse. My boyfriend is 5'7 about 185 lbs.I ordered a large for him.  He has been doing a lot of heavy weight lifting and Hiit works out, his back has widen and his shoulders and arms expanded. The shirts fit him great! they're open y cut in the back and his midsection is loose. Enough to lift, do jumping jacks and burpees comfortably. I will post a picture at the end of the week. The colors on the shirt are just as the picture, I opted for dark colors b/c when he's on the floor the gym floor stains the clothe and dark colors are easier to blend. Really like the product"
5.0,"This is a great watch for the price, would highly recommend, Perfect."

5.0,"I really like this hat to wear when I go for walks in the winter. It covers my ears and also has a small brim to keep the sun out of my eyes. I wish the brim were a little larger, but it's more of a personal preference. The fur is soft and doesn't scratch or irritate my face. I like the neutral color so it doesn't draw too much attention to itself (others I've seen are too ""loud"" for my taste). The corduroy material is fine, not thick - very nicely done!"
5.0,fits perfect and so pretty
5.0,"Sturdy, no need to iron, looks good."

5.0,These are the most comfortable slides I‚Äôve ever owned.  I wear these around the house since I need a good quality shoe to support my feet since I have permanent nerve damage in my back and legs.  You cannot beat the value either since these come with a second set of inserts so you‚Äôre getting two pairs of slides for the price of one.  I have purchases the shoes as well and they are just as comfortable.  I HIGHLY recommend these slides!
5.0,Great looks a lot of complements to my friend to who l give it and he said it feels like wearing a top brand watch
5.0,"Great dress. I purchased a large, I'm 5'8 about 170 and wear a size 36DD. Fits perfectly and the top part of the dress stayed in place all night on NYE."
5.0,I love these socks. Especially for winter the knee height adds a little bit of extra warmth under thin baby pants. My very tall 19 month old is still wearing the 0-1 size. After a year of use the fabric is only just now starting to pill. I'm pretty impressed with the quality.
5.0,Kids loved this for carting around toys
5.0,"really cute and i love all the colors. Fits my newborn slightly big, but in a month or two they will be perfect."

5.0,Perfect for a school play! Nice quality‚Äô
5.0,Nice attractive cap to keep my head and ears warm.
5.0,"These shades are great but if you wear them all day the colors for other items are not true.  Great for helping you find your golf ball.  What we all need to do is to learn how keep the ball in the fairway :-).  So if you want to know do they work, yes they work, now if you hit the ball in real deep grass then these shades or an X-Ray machine are not going to help you.  Hit em straight."
5.0,They are perfect.<br />Exact to size.<br />Durable. Not even a sign of wear yet.
5.0,"Love it. I normally wear a L / XL top 40C bust. I originally ordered XL long sleeve dark wash but it seemed too loose. ****i only want to wear this without layers underneath,  but if I wanted to i would have kept the XL** anyways I returned the XL and ordered a L and it's perfect. Not too tight but seems fitted almost tailored like."
5.0,Love this brand and how it fits. I get lots of compliments on her clothes.
5.0,Bag is large enough for my items needs for nursing job
5.0,"Very cute and comfortable for my child.  Not really warm though, so I layer under the shirt"

Best fit and super comfortable for amazing price. Highly recommend these pants, especially if you've been paying much more for a less than ideal fit!"
5.0,"I bought these for a 12 month old on the 4th of July and they worked great.  It's clear that these earmuffs have room to grow with her (I can almost fit them on my head), and are sturdy enough to last.  I will be using these for years to come."
5.0,"Just a little smaller than expected, not a big deal though bc it still looks cute, but size up if you have curves bc the &#34;assets&#34; will pull it up and make it shorter. Super cute dress though, now one of my faves ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5.0,"Obsessed. Very form fitting, very tight, very short. My husband loves it"
5.0,"I LOVE this bag! I really like small satchel bags, but they really never hold a lot. This bag is still a smaller bag but it holds A LOT more than the average cross body purse. It does smell when you first open it, but that's just because it's leather! My only complaint is that the strap is a little short, but when I hooked it on the top handle it was fine. It is a beautiful bag and is exactly the kind of purse I wanted and needed! I would recommend it to anyone!"
5.0,"I really love it, its so beautiful."
5.0,"Beautiful dress. Great material. This will be really nice for vacation. I'm 5'3"" and it's a perfect length. It hides the belly and love handles well."
5.0,"I am so glad that I bought this shrug. I was skeptical because you just can't tell until you see it in-person but it is well worth the money, maybe even under-priced for the high quality of the product. Great fit and beautiful material. It's an elegant alternative to a sweater.<br />I am going to buy another one!"
5.0,Fit my 7 year old perfectly! Fun and fashionable.
5.0,Perfect fit. Cute back detail.

5.0,Very nice dress; many compliments when I wore it!
5.0,"Love all the colors! I get complements every time I wear them. A little bit worried about how they will hold up long term, the metal posts seem pretty cheap, but other than that they are great and I haven‚Äôt had any issues so far"
5.0,These things are pretty sturdy. They're a bit loose when you first try them on (I ordered 13&#34;) but eventually the strap becomes more friendly and there you go.
5.0,"Very nice necklace. I have ordered this a second time. Good size, nicely made."
5.0,I work out in this and I don‚Äôt get overheated in it.  This is a perfectly mad shirt.

5.0,Excellent quality no iron shirt as we have enjoyed in the past from Lands End.
5.0,Super cute  Great price....will purchase again for sure!!!!!!üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5.0,The dress is very nice. When you wear because it it is so tight and stretchy you look very skinny. Wore it to a corporate party got a lot of complaints. Fits to your size
5.0,I ordered  one size bigger than I needed. Which was a good Idea. Because it provides more work room
5.0,My granddaughter wears it.  Reminds me of a summer day

5.0,My daughter loves this bracelet...makes a cool jingly noise!
5.0,"I love the material of the dress, and the fact that is has a slip underneath not that it needs it because it‚Äôs not see through. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh approximately 185 and I ordered a large. I could get away with a medium but I like the having my dress floor length and a little loose. It‚Äôs an everywhere type of dress. My main reason I bought it is for church, but I wear it casually. I always get so many compliments, it truly is so comfortable and lightweight. You will not be disappointed. The next time I wear it, I will update this post with a picture."
5.0,Nice product and very cute.
5.0,So cozy but yet sexy
5.0,I bought this dress for my 4th daughter.  The colour is quite rich and the material is durable.  It fitted her simply perfect.  Im well pleased with this dress.  I was so impressed by the quality of the dress i bought another one but different style by Woosea.
5.0,"Fits 9 month old easily ( 17lbs) and will stretch so I‚Äôm sure she could use it for a few years. The stars are beautiful, they stand out even more then in the pictures. Love it"
5.0,I got this for my 16 year old grand daughter and she loves it.  Wears it all the time.
5.0,Exactly what wss described and needed by my son.
5.0,Dress was very beautiful and great quality.
5.0,"I ordered the pink, it is a very nice soft pink. True to size.  The length is perfect, long enough to wear with yoga pants.  Nice and warm for cold days."
5.0,"So beautiful! I absolutely loved the way these wings looked.<br /><br />These feel really thick and soft and they seem like they‚Äôre well-made. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the narrowness of the wings. I had hoped that they would be a little larger and look fuller, but honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt let that stop me from buying them because they really are so beautiful regardless.<br /><br />I sewed some extra elastic onto them so that they would be a better fit for my two-year-old son."
5.0,"Very lovely ring. just beautiful on. The kind of ring I put on when the package arrived and i'll never take off. I just got it today so I'm not sure how well it'll hold up but I've tried to bend it with my fingers and it won't bend. It's so pretty, very feminine and different looking."
5.0,Shipped promptly and item received was exactly as described. Very happy.
5.0,To stretch my ear to the next size 5/8‚Äù
5.0,"These Mala beads were beautiful.  They are the first ones I have ever purchased so I don't have anything to compare them to. The stones are beautiful nothing about this seems of poor quality.  I do wish that the cord was not elastic,  but that's just because I'm not wearing it as bracelet.  I did wrap it around my wrist just to try it and it worked out fine however,  that's just not the real reason why I purchased them. Shipping was fast and the packaging was beautiful.  I recommend these Mala beads."
5.0,Larger than one expected but very nice!
5.0,S√∫per c√≥modas y lindas!
5.0,Super easy to clean. Great product. Perfect length.
5.0,"Great color, lots of slots for everything even your cell phone"

5.0,It looks expensive! I love it because I always get compliments whenever I wear it.
5.0,"after reading the other reviews I ordered a size up and it fits perfect.  the sleeves are stretchy lace, so it is comfortable to move in.  great purchase for the price. I would recommend to my friends."
5.0,Like a cute sports bra
5.0,Very well made. All information on the tag was right. Durable.
5.0,"Use with ganster costume, worked really well, looks very good. fit the small guy and a very large guy, went nicely over both shoe sizes.  Like an 8 1/2 and an 11."
5.0,Prefect color
5.0,I love the dress.  Beautiful color. Comfortable. Can use formal/informal with accessories.
5.0,I ordered the black and white dress. The dress fit as expected. The dress does not come with any under shirt. It just comes with the black and white plaid part. You have to find a shirt to make it look like the profile pic advertised.
5.0,"When I received I was surprised. Its so small! But when I tried it, OMG its stretch tons and feel comfortable, thick, not see thorough. Its high waisted and flat my tummy. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Nice daughter loves it.
5.0,Great for picnics of outdoor events to dress up at if you don't want to ruin anything if higher quality. The material is light and perfect for the beach.
5.0,Very nice for work.
5.0,Gloves were as described by the seller.  Warm and comfortable!<br />A quality product at a good price.
5.0,Very nice. Best used with white paint markers.
5.0,Love these socks...  Wear them all the time with and without shoes.  Their like wearing nothing at all.  Have a strip of plastic or something that line the around the inside top to help hold the socks on.  They are just simply great.  Wish I had more and do plan on ordering more...
5.0,"The headband is exactly what I expected.  A traditional martial arts headband about 3 bedsheets thick.  It also is not thin on the forehead like Johnny Lawrence on the Karate Kid, Cobrakai."
5.0,"Fits my medium size partner well, and the quality appears good."
5.0,"The picture does not do this set justice. It is gorgeous, and far exceeded my expectations."
5.0,"Perfect dark wine red, great cut and fit. Nice material."

5.0,Works for me :)
5.0,great buy and work great for out kids to go sledding in
5.0,"I love my new pjs. I just had surgery and needed lounge clothes that feel comfortable. Once I tried them on, I didn't want to take them off. That's how comfy they are. I want to buy another pair in a different color. I highly recommend buying these if you want comfy lounge clothes for around the house."
5.0,Can‚Äôt best this belt it is perfect!
5.0,I love this Bella Swan backpack. The durability is amazing. I bought it when going on a trip to the swan house and use this thing everywhere. The two outer pockets help keep me organized and the large inner one has a space for my laptop.<br /><br />This backpack can be run through the mud and muck and still come out looking great. With the sturdy leather bottom I have no fears of damaging it while hiking and setting it on wet muddy ground it is amazing.
5.0,Such a gorgeous dress! Everything about it is perfect and looks expensive. It is not see through at all which I love. Not sure why other people mentioned it's see through but my dress was fully lined
5.0,"I love these!!!! They came on time and I when I opened the package I feel like I got more than I paid for. I usually buy the expensive surgical steel nose rings from the piercing shops as I am always losing these small studs. But I have had the same one in for weeks with the exception of taking it out to for cleaning, and it has not fallen out once."
5.0,I told hubby if he didn't want to shave his head and beard then he had to wear this mast. He agreed.  Thanks.
5.0,Great for motorcycling!
5.0,For me
5.0,Super cute. Wish there would‚Äôve been a 3t option.
5.0,Same as the picture easy to use and not broken
5.0,The shorts are true to size. A bit snug in the waist. If you want a little breathing room after a meal or something I'd go one size up. But other than that the shorts fit great.
5.0,"This shirt was exactly everything I wanted, and I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does fit slightly slim, but that was to be expected and I wasn't nor am I currently bothered by that whatsoever. I was actually surprised because I've bought from Asian retailers before and the size specifications were all wrong, even after I'd looked into the size I should've gotten. My only complaint is how long it actually took to get here, but I suppose that can't be helped due to this retailers location. This was a very worthwhile purchase and I certainly will be buying from this retailer again! :D"
5.0,"The product is as described, very stylish delivery was fast,will buy again"
5.0,It is a perfect fit. I'm very pleased with style.
5.0,Beautiful my wife loved it
5.0,I've been using these gloves around my wood burner for many years.  I've lost track of how many pairs I have worn out.  I consider them exactly what I need and highly recommend them to others.
5.0,Perfect jeans and great style
5.0,"This item fit well and very pretty, nicely made!! I use as an everyday bra, comfy but was just a little snug around abdomen. I cannot attest to use as sports bra but holds chest area very well!! I purchased 40DD, it was on high end of chart. It did stretch around abdomen as I thought it would. Great bra, I got set with 3 diff colors straps. Definitely worth price and I would def buy again. Hope this helpful to other potential buyers!!! üòÉüòäüòç"
5.0,"Very nice, love them."
5.0,"Beautiful kurti, same as described!"
5.0,"Packaged well; came on the exact day that was stated; sturdy, comfy and very cute!"
5.0,Softness and comfort best describes this outfit
5.0,I really like these tights. They fit well and are high quality. They are not see through and perfect for all workouts!!
5.0,Holds to Fitbit Charge 5 but is more comfortable to wear.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a1248b8ed3c428ee909a9c29d7a9f536]] I have literally shopped amazon for the perfect Yoga pants to wear to the gym.  These are super comfortable! Squat proof. Flattering! Affordable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 22‚Äù waist and ordered XS absolutely perfect fit!  Wish they came in black
5.0,"It will absolutely serve its purpose which is to shield my face from being set on fire and feeling like the surface of the sun due to some medication increasing sensitivity, but I must tell you when I put this visor on for the first time both my husband and son both immediately fell out of their chairs laughing hysterically. They are now calling me Karen and telling me ‚ÄúA manager will be with me shortly‚Äù Jerks! üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So this will probably end up being something I wear to mow the backyard because even I have to admit that it looks absolutely ridiculous, and I laughed hysterically with them."
5.0,How fun are these? When COVID is over and we have family Thanksgiving I'm wearing this for sure.
5.0,Recieved the green gown today 6-24-2022. I appreciate so much for early delivery<br />Love the gown<br />Thank you .<br />Manolita A Rabulan
5.0,I didn't realize these were so large but they are beautiful!!
5.0,This is a most for sneaker heads I put this in every pair of shoes I get from now on
5.0,"i read a review before purchasing that said these were plus size friendly, but i wouldn‚Äôt agree. these aren‚Äôt SUPER small but, compared to my other leggings in the same size, are quite small for plus size peeps. i‚Äôm a size 16 US in most bottoms and i always buy a large in leggings, and this large was really squeezing me.<br />these are also very thin fabric that i‚Äôm afraid would be easy to tear. they ARE NOT see through no matter what, though, so i was thoroughly impressed by that. Just bummed that they didn‚Äôt fit :/"
5.0,"It's a great bra, I like it a lot."
5.0,Stunning piece
5.0,Great price and so cute! I bought for my daughter to give to her MiMi. Seems to be made very well. Mimi loves it.
5.0,It feet‚Äôs perfect
5.0,Love this boot. So cute. True to size.
5.0,I am in a wheelchair and these paints work real good for me for casual ware.
5.0,These are so great I bought 2 pair! They really fit well & feel fabulous!
5.0,Nice to swim in
5.0,Love this shirt. Looks good and is a nice material
5.0,Nomad leather strap is very good.  I ended up buying it here on amazon but I would recommend you take a look at the nomad website for better pricing as they usually running specials and have much better inventory and shipping times.
5.0,Outstanding service! Fits big... And I can not figure out the top??? But it's great quality and gorgeous! Might try to exchange for a smaller size! Very well made!
5.0,This is a cute and flirty dress for any casual occasion.
5.0,Works really good with my silver rings!
5.0,"The more I wear them, the better they feel. Love the colors. Very coastal."
5.0,This was a gift for a friend.  It arrived very quickly in nice packaging to give as a gift.  Will order again!!
5.0,Good set! Looks very nice. I gifted it to my mom for her birthday.
5.0,"Gonna get it in more colors. So cute and she'll be able to wear for a few years, as it's a little long."
5.0,Awesome price. Fast shipping. Really cute!
5.0,Adorable glasses and well made.  Great service!
5.0,"This is really cute. There is a little sparkle in the print that I don‚Äôt think you can see online. I thought it ran a little small. I like a roomy sweatshirt, so I ordered a size up. I bought a large and liked that fit.  It‚Äôs on the thinner side for a sweatshirt. I thought it was really cute and perfect for a casual Thanksgiving."
5.0,Don't mess around with your eyes.  These are a good safety investment.
5.0,Very nice quality and very comfortable
5.0,"This is my husbands wedding band, he has been using it for 2 years now and it is still going strong! My husband works in a warehouse which requires a lot of manual hard labor and this ring has lasted 2 years of that so for the price this is a great ring."
5.0,Great for price!! My girls love them!!
5.0,This jacket is well made. It‚Äôs a thinner material so it‚Äôs ideal for summer. It is professional looking and classy. I‚Äôve ordered 2 because I liked it so well.
5.0,"I love this dress. I ordered it according to the size chart. I usually wear a size 16 and I ordered an XXL. The material is thick but not hot. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. The only problem is I don't know what color to order next!!!! I wore it with a 25 inch petticoat to make the dress stand out more. I didn't wear the belt that came with the dress, I opted for a thicker belt."
5.0,Fits well. Quality is great.
5.0,El servicio es r√°pido gracias  Amazon est√°n haciendo excelente trabajo
5.0,"Excelente , entrega r√°pida ,recib√≠ m√°s cantidad de lo que pensaba ,lo recomiendo ."
5.0,Its so beatiful. Like the picture. I Love blue.
5.0,I bought this for my 7 year old and she loves it. I got her a 10/12 (she's 50 inches tall) and it's big. She loves it. She loves the bunny on it too and was happy to see it had pockets. It's long and it goes a little past her knees. It's one of her favorite pj shirts
5.0,Hubby loves these shirts.
5.0,I like the fit and look is great but the soles and heels are slick on solid floors they slide.
5.0,Really comphy for the shape. Many compliments.
5.0,I love these shoes. Great for walking the creek or plating on the playground. I ordered my son one size larger than he normally wears because the normal size was too small. I plan to buy more pairs soon for my daughter's.
5.0,quality. cute. love.
5.0,Great product.  Performance material that doesn‚Äôt wrinkle easily.
5.0,I made earrings.
5.0,"Not too thick and not too thin, it's just right.  I do recommend washing as soon as you get this and putting in an extra little bit of downy or whatever fabric softener you use for the first time.  It comes a bit on the stiff side.  I love how this feels after a long winter of an extra thick robe.  It comes with 2 roomy pockets and a belt.  It fits just like I'd hoped it would and is long enough to cover me adequately when I run outside in it to take my dog out.  I'm happy with this purchase and I think you will be too."
5.0,Fit as expected. Cute socks.
5.0,Fit is a bit different than most suits but it's cute and comfortable! Images I'm wearing a medium.
5.0,"bellos bello bello y elegante, la tela es esquisita,"
5.0,Great set but I have to stretch my ear further to get it in. The right size. But double plug so the ends are wider. No problem. So many choices of color great.
5.0,It is what I ordered. It does what I need it to do. The color is correct and the size is as expected
5.0,Love it! Color is beautiful!
5.0,This dress is so great. It's heavy weight and I did need to iron the bottom after I washed it. It's amazing. So figure flattering. Got a 2xl and in normally an xl in most shirts and it fits perfectly!!!
5.0,loved it and it fit my wife perfect
5.0,"these our warm,comfortable and great fit.good priceÔºÅ"
5.0,I got them for my great grand son to have at my house and he loves them.  He puts them on the minute he comes though the door and they keep his feet nice and warm during this cold weather.
5.0,Very supportive and comfortable<br /> Also reasonably priced!
5.0,It's fine under sweaters. I little too deep for my personal taste but I'm older.
5.0,Size XL . I hated I had to dress up in a kids costume lol but my child loved it so oh well lol
5.0,"Great tough rubberized keychain. Tough and soft, molds around hard objects like keys and other pocket objects and Pops back to its original shape."
5.0,It‚Äôs hard to find a hat that fits good. This hat fits great.
5.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, athletic build & 135lbs. Bought medium & works great!! 3 Shirts fit great, cheap, $6 a piece & don't have that useless bra shelf built in that drives me nuts. I wear exercise bras anyway. Length is perfect. Shirt is Not too long & I don't wear it as a support exercise shirt but you could buy a few sizes smaller if you want that. I will reorder for sure!"
5.0,"I ordered a size up it fits beautifully, sexy and classy!"
5.0,The thing with creatures of God some of us don't like walking with wallet or keys in our pockets so let alone carry bags due to many clear mandatory concerns so finding a clear bag not too bulky or frustrating handling is difficult to find. Some people don't want big clear bags but that's all anytime makes. I wanted a simple different shape from the norm square clear bags out there pun intended..so already purchased this one months ago and this serving second purchase was because a co-worker eyed my bag and thought it was cute and playfully grabbed my as her own so I was gonna shared the link with her but decided to tell her I'll get her one through my account fast delivery because it's only $10 and she insisted not to go to too much trouble but I said I wanted too so after a little bulging she didn't accepted and said thanks. Grabbed it from my Amazon locker and couldn't wait to share it to her so it wasa friendly gift cause the bag is so right size and carry for someone who doesn't need much transported it's clear and no one at work has small convenient bag like this I'm happy with the product it's still good wear nothings wrong with it still zips straps still strong easy to place on my lunch table during break without beach bag taking all the space. Comes next day if you want it which it's what I always chose for small products I purchase.  Side zipper small compartment big zipper roomy for my big headphones and snacks.  Get one now and walk unseen but seen through
5.0,Works as described. Belt is stiff so it keeps the outer belt in place nicely. Velcro is good quality.
5.0,"I LOVE these. I started bouldering only a few years back. When I discovered top rope I fell in love with the sport all over again and I was hooked. But it killed my neck when I was on belay for a partner and having to constantly look up. As I was training with some friends for my lead certification I saw one of them pull out a pair of these. I asked to try them and I was hooked. They save your neck so much pain. Since I got my own pair every partner asks to try them and everyone freaks out about how clear the prism lens is. Then they realize how much strain it saves on the neck, once you get used to the odd feeling you have at first as your vision and equilibrium stabilize after a few seconds. Very much worth the money."
5.0,"Love the colors. I have small head but a lot of hair, they are warm and soft and fit perfectly. They have a nice stretch so the fit is comfortable over hairstyle."
5.0,These are perfect for a punch of color to any outfit.
5.0,My grandson loved how shiny it is. That's a big deal to a 9 yr old. Haaa
5.0,Piece is very nice and very nicely detailed
5.0,The dress exceeded my expectations. The see through parts aren‚Äôt as see through as I originally expected and I like that. The lace detail on the sleeves is so cute and feminine. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it this weekend.
5.0,I purchased this tee shirt for my great-grandson/s 10th birthday and he wanted to wear it right at his birthday celebration!  That means he loves it!  It fits him with a little room for growth and the color is just as photographed on Amazon.  No complaints!
5.0,Definitely long but perfect length for tall guys like myself. Good material and I received compliments. I'd buy again
5.0,"Great looking wallet! Plenty of space for the basics, well made and fits fine in standard back pockets. I'm happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I purchased this button for my good friend who is going for her PhD to show my support and pride in her journey. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but nice just the same."
5.0,Nice lenses for running or roas Bike.
5.0,Great value for money and sturdy enough to stand up on its own with items inside.
5.0,"My old watch stopped working out of the blue so I need to get a new one that's not too expensive but nice, I got this watch and it looks awesome, feels amazing, and it has a pretty cool alarm clock which I didn't know of until I got it, it has both analog dials and a small digital screen for the time and for the date. would definitely recommend."
5.0,I am glad with my purchase.
5.0,I was really pleasantly surprised by this dress. I now have it in 2 colors. I bought the large and it fits me really well - I am 5'9 and usually wear size 10-12 and 34H chest. The lemon fabric is so fun!! The fabric does pill over time but for the price that's to be expected I think. I also sewed together a little bit of the top to make it more modest as there was some gapping. Definitely recommend this if you're looking to fit a curvy body
5.0,Bought this for a prize for another hair stylist everyone loves it! And it is so easy to clasp!
5.0,"These shorts fit great and are my current favorite for workouts. I wear a 1X and usually find it hard to find shorts that fit well. I wish they had a pocket, tho, for my phone."
5.0,Beautiful color and the fit is perfect - definitely would recommend!
5.0,Very cute and colorful. I purchased it to add some personality to a laptop backpack. Love it!<br /><br />Update: My laptop bag came but the clip was too thick to attach to it so I decided to use the charms that were on the keychain on three zippers. This took a little work and three little rings to attach (the ones it came with are so great I didn't have the right tools or strength to reuse the small rings I had to open to remove the charms). I've attached pictures and have a one of a kind backpack that will bring a smile to my face and hopefully others. I still have the clip with the keyring left to use too (I'm going to use it for my work keys). Now I'm ordering another to use as my keychain because it's so cute and really well made so my keychain will match my backpack.
5.0,"I‚Äôm a pretty heavy sleeper and it woke me straight up! Decided to use 30% on double shock since I barely felt the 10%. Never doing that again! I‚Äôm back down to 10% single shock with high vibrate and it does the job perfectly. My only complaint is when I try to turn it off by holding it down 5 seconds it doesn‚Äôt work. I have to turn it off through the app. So, that one time on 30% was nicking me pretty hard and was very painful. Overall, I would recommend this to heavy sleepers. Just start at a low setting with a backup alarm until you get a setting right that works for you."
5.0,And very well made. Not flimsy at all. Highly recommend.
5.0,What more can I say but wow. These jeans are great. They fit like a glove and the material has some stretch to it so that they are really form fitting and comfortable. ¬†Looking forward to buying more if they are all like this. My fashion has gotten a serious upgrade.
5.0,"So I have a buddy and we always exchange gag gifts.  Each trying to out-do the other.  Most years, I win, but he said he was going to be upping his game this year.<br /><br />When I saw this little gem I knew it was perfect.<br /><br />The package is interesting.  It comes in a little crystal box that is nice but then that is in an odd little baggie.  Better than a ziplock but seems out of place.<br /><br />If you use it I'd wash it first to make sure you don't get a reaction to anything that may have accumulated on it during transport or manufacture."
5.0,During the summer I like to wet it‚Ä¶ Helps keep me cool
5.0,"There is no glitter whatsoever!!!!!  I feel like I scoured the internet for butterfly/fairy wings without glitter, and I finally found this set.  It was absolutely perfect because they are rainbow, my daughter's favorite ""color"" and it was affordable to get one for each of her friends.  They each loved flying around.  The tutu does rip easily, which it did for my daughter, but it was worth every cent. I absolutely cannot stand glitter, and I cannot express enough how awesome this set is.  I never write reviews, but this was worth it. Thank you."
5.0,"We purchased these to go under a mermaid themed dress we bought doe my daughter's 5th birthday. They matched the green on the dress almost exactly and they were way easier than I thought they'd be to get on her, even after she was wet from being in the pool! So far no color transfer or wearing away.... I've got one happy 5 year old!"
5.0,Super cute. Would buy again.
5.0,Good quality fun dress maybe new years eve dress
5.0,"My daughter wears this daily. She wanted a chain for daily wear, but nothing dainty. This was perfect. Great length and the thickness is just right."
5.0,"These are outstanding! You cannot get a pair of sunglasses for a better price on this site! I would probably pay $15 for the glasses alone, although they do feel a little stiff and I question their durability; having a small repair keychain, a cleaning rag, and a firm case just makes it all the better. Of course, the main reason I was looking into sunglasses was because being outside isn't good on my eyes, and I found the gray glasses have the perfect tint so I'm not squinting all the time. Overall, these are amazing and if I ever lose or break my current pair I will be back for more."
5.0,"So the belt just arrived and from the packaging I thought damn this is never going to fit. When I took it out of the packaging I saw that they had double folded the belt. The belt fits great and is attractive the buckle is thinner than I expected, but that is ok. Very stylish and trendy. Great vendor the belt arrived much sooner than the anticipated arrival date."
5.0,A fun sweater that is easy to wear and looks cute. The snaps look nice whet her undone or snapped up.
5.0,It‚Äôs a really good product
5.0,I love this shirt. I bought it in black. It pairs well with white (or other color) fitted capris. It‚Äôs a simple design that can be dressed up for work or dressed down for a casual gathering.
5.0,I get compliments on this pretty scarf - so soft and comfy around my neck.
5.0,Good quality and well fitted to a 5'10&#34; 210lb man.
5.0,Soft and warm. Love the neck cover. Put it on when playing golf in 40 degree weather
5.0,perfect and arrived fast
5.0,Can't wait until the weather cools off so I can wear it
5.0,"Love this watch, readable, comfortable and pretty to look at, just perfect."
5.0,Love this clutch. It's so much longer in person.
5.0,This is my new favorite skirt. Fabric thick and skirt is comfortable. Pockets are. Bit flimsy
5.0,"The first set arrived with one stone out but they sent a new set, no questions asked and very quickly. I would recommend!"
5.0,Love these Glasses.  They are stylish and comfortable.  I get comments on them everywhere I go.  These are actually a replacement pair.  I found my first pair in a boutique and my dog loved them too...she ate them.  So happy to find a replacement here on Amazon!!!
5.0,"I've got several older Casio solar/atomic watches, including a couple of the multi-funtion [barometer, altitude, compass] watches. I was looking for something that ""had it all"". Something I could wear every day that still had all the functions. This watch does it all."

5.0,Granddaughter birthday gifts
5.0,We can hang onto mittens now!
5.0,"True size fit, comfy, stays in place through practice and doesn‚Äôt shift around when doing lots of movement"
5.0,"It‚Äôs almost impossible to find these types of nightgowns in a size 10. Great material, very soft. Well made. My daughter loves it."
5.0,This cape is impressively beautiful as is its quality. I consider  this and other ones I purchased exceptional  in price too.<br />  M. Lou
5.0,"Great for gals with long hair who drive convertibles but don't like wearing a hat ;) Soft, and enough stretch to use it as a thick ponytail band. Surprisingly cool when it's hot and warm when it's cool. Not sure how that's possible, but it works for me!"
5.0,Exactly as described in the description. Perfect for my 8 yr old at school
5.0,"I LIKE THE WATCH AS T DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL, TAKE A DAY OR TWO TO GET THE HANG OF IT."
5.0,Bought this for my son who is a huge DBz fan. The quality is good and it looks so cute one him. Happy Halloween üéÉ
5.0,Very happy about the products and the price is right
5.0,"These shoes exceeded my expectations.  My son has a bit chubby feet and although they were fitted on the first day, the next day the leather had stretched enough and molded to his foot.  They are so cute and comfortable I cannot praise them enough."
5.0,beutiful pieces! i love it!
5.0,Fit well. Look great. Keep my feet from slipping!
5.0,I love these.  They fit great and do not slip
5.0,Worn this now for about a week non-stop. I am very active and have my hands in water a lot and also cook. No stretching or damage so far. The reason I ordered this one was because it came in half sizes and I wear a size 5.5 and that is what I ordered. The sizing was spot on. I buy all the colors and match them to my Fitbit bands. Pretty cute really. :) Next maybe my  nails the same color? Too much? LOL
5.0,"Perfect sweater. Indie with skin tank fife extra warmth and a gggrrreeeat buy. Layer, leggings, jeans. About 100 looks. Must own in your wardrobe."
5.0,"Just in case, I purchased this jewelry plan.  Registering was very easy and when I e-mailed a question to Smart Guard, they responded in a timely manner."
5.0,"Very sexy , fits just right"
5.0,Works great when gardening here in Fl.
5.0,Love these - much better price than FitOvers and same high quality.
5.0,"I was hesitant to purchase a &#34;swing&#34; dress online as swing dresses can be very unflattering on me. However, I had purchased items from this brand before so I went for it. I am so glad I did! This dress is slightly more fitted on top than other swing dresses I have tried (which is great), but loosens up at just the right spot to be very flattering and comfy. I'm certain I will wear this frequently the rest of the summer and could potentially transition it into fall although the fabric is a bit thin for cooler weather.<br /><br />Also, I found this to run true to size. I typically wear a small/medium in tops and dresses and purchased this in a medium. For reference, I am 5'5&#34; and approx 150 lbs."
5.0,Purchased for teenaged daughter...she loved the fit.
5.0,After my dogs ate all of the wrist straps for my Joy-Con's I was bummed to see how expensive they are at retail stores. Thankfully I looked online and found these. This price is incredible and the products seem to be original Nintendo licensed Joy-Con straps. I couldn't be more please with my purchase!
5.0,"Loved it! Again, wish I went for a medium vs a large, but I definitely pulled off the large. The waist belt however is short. I ended up wrapping it through the front instead of completely around."
5.0,My fiance LOVES this!
5.0,My son loved
5.0,I'm 5&#34;2 145 I ordered size 9 and they fit ...There cute and look like the picture. I rolled my bottoms up a little bit to make them shorter ..Definitly worth buying
5.0,"This hat is my 2nd purchase (of same item) as the 1st one was used so much it became bleached out by the sun while I was in our FL pool. It is amazingly cheerful due to the color(inside the rim is navy), comfortable because of the fit and versatile as the solid nature of the rim allows it to be worn in a variety of ways. I know this is the old colorways of the Heat, and IMHO was the finest! The seller was from LasVegas & I was very pleased with the packaging & shipping. I am currently summering in Canada so had to wait a bit. Nonetheless it is still in the 90's here and sunny so I shall begin bleaching this one next.  Best hat company do not hesitate."
5.0,Fits perfect and looks professional and cute
5.0,It‚Äôs beautiful I love !!!<br />It‚Äôs the same at picture
5.0,Wearing it for almost three month and color not change at all
5.0,This bag is great! There are separate features that are perfect for a swimmer's wet items and dry. The quality is great for the price--super pleased!
5.0,"These are my 2nd pair of pants from this seller and I could not be happier; the quality, look, and feel of this product is amazing. I did have to send my first pair back and exchange them because I did not read the reviews carefully enough. I am a 31"" waist in the US, and that is what I ordered; I could not even get them close to buckling closed. The exchange was easy and I ordered a 33"" waist and that did the trick. Because I had to order a larger waist size I ended up with very long length so I took to a local tailor who for $28 hemmed and finished the bottom. Honestly, doing the math ($150 + $28 = $178), these pants are a steal! I would definitely buy from this company again!"
5.0,"I liked it very much, however I purchased two them.  However I cannot return one of them since its past the deadline for returns.  I don't like Amazon's return policy,  now I'm stuck with a product that great but does not fit well, all due to Amazon's return policy."
5.0,I wear these headbands when I run. They don't budge and absorb all the sweat on my long runs. I keep buying more !
5.0,The pants are meh but with dickies the tunic is great! I ordered a Large and it fit great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 180lbs
5.0,"Absolutely adorable sweatshirt/sweater! Ordered one size up to wear with leggings and the fit is perfect. Great front pocket, love the dipped front and back and the hoodie just finished it off. You really could dress it up because of the silver sheen in the fabric or wear it causal. It's a tad see through so either wear a cami underneath or a dark bra. Got tons of compliments!<br /><br />Received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my review. This is my unbiased and honest opinion."
5.0,"This band is pretty pigmented, though not as vivid as the pictures but still well printed. I've had some of the printing come off on the edges, but not badly. Putting it on and taking it off is easy and I don't have to worry about it loosening.<br /><br />I'm uncertain why, but I've developed a reaction to it after taking a break from it for a week or so. My skin becomes red, swollen, and stings. I assume I've just developed an allergy to it as I have sensitive skin."
5.0,"Bought for a festival, was perfect size, well made and was completely mesh, which is hard to find."
5.0,"However, it's not cream- just not a bright white"
5.0,Good quality and keeps him very warm!
5.0,"This wig made my costume!  I was the bride of Frankenstein, and the wig stood up all night without needing any extra support.  Loved it!"
5.0,This snow boots are great for winter
5.0,"Found this little skirt on prime day, and was really excited to try it! Love the material- it light enough for summer but stretchy and flattering. I wish it was still on sale so I could get a couple more ü§£"
5.0,Christmas present for our niece. They love all things Disney.
5.0,"THIS SHIRT IS CUTE AND COMFY, GREAT FOR SPRING."
5.0,"Don't pay attention to the size chart. I was about to get a medium based off of that, but I decided to stick with my gut. I'm 5'3, 154 lbs and the large fit perfect! Super cute dress."
5.0,Wallet was exactly as advertised and had the space I was looking for.
5.0,Love this dress! Very fun and surprisingly comfortable üòä
5.0,"I wore a bra like lace down shirt underneath, I also bought from amazon. I bought it to wear to a Motley Crue concert and got so many compliments."
5.0,"This is quite a nice chain bracelet; simple and comfortable, very wearable. It also makes an excellent extender to use with a necklace."
5.0,I normally wear US medium but I ordered XL (according to the size guide) fit perfect and if you wonder it is elastic waist band for the inside skirt)<br />the skirt and sleeve is a little long.<br />But over all I really love the dress! Will dress for Disneyworld Halloween event üòç
5.0,Love this purse. Get great comments on it too
5.0,Liked having the option of wearing a necklace vs. the fit bit band. Beautiful necklace and the pick included makes it easy to open! Thank you.
5.0,"It looks very sexy, My wife loves it and she said that It makes her feel sexy which I agree. The price is good, The material is Okay, So I will give it 5 stars."
5.0,"Great variety of colors. Hoping same company has solid color options. Adjustable straps and breathable fabric make these comfortable. Haven't tried to use the built in filter feature, yet."
5.0,"This sweater is so soft and comfy.  I wanted to just stay at home and curl up in it, but it is too nice to just stay at home in it.  It is so soft, too.  I am blown away at how wonderful this sweater is."
5.0,"It was a Father's Day gift for my husband, and he loved it! He wasn't sure about the dark color at first, but the vented back keeps him cool."
5.0,very nice jacket. I love it.
5.0,I got this set so I could give the black one to my little sis for her graduation. She loves it. It covers everything and she was able to wear a proper mask underneath it (double mask). It had a nice grip as well.<br /><br />I only wish that the other 2 colors straps weren't white. Love the black one best.
5.0,I ordered the blueish green one and I love it!  there is nothing wrong with it! The only thing I kinda don't like is that it does not have like a wrist strap but other than that it's great. I actually bought two. One for me and one for a friend
5.0,Fits my 15 month old perfectly and it‚Äôs such a lovely and super soft fabric. I think I am going to purchase more!
5.0,"Fast delivery, Great price"
5.0,"Fits my daith piercings perfectly, I bought two so I'd have matching ones, and they are the perfect size. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I‚Äôm always hesitant to buy clothes online because I‚Äôm a big girl who is also pregnant, normally I‚Äôm XL so I order XXL to be on the safe side and it fits perfectly and for the price it looks good"
5.0,As described and the perfect pink. Seems to be well made. I bought a size 110 which is equal to a 3t. This will fit her perfectly.
5.0,Awesome hat fits perfect how bout them cowboys!
5.0,This is a great buy! I love the quality of the shirt! I can wear it during my wedding feeling confident. I am totally satisfied. Thank You
5.0,Estan hermosos tal como semuestran em la foto mencantaron...
5.0,True to size<br />Soft & good quality
5.0,"Daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  I love it so much I‚Äôm in process of buying another, or two or three.  Longer in the back to wear with leggings.  Nice and cozy but not too warm.  Looks great with a vest.  Sized up from fitting guide to a medium and it‚Äôs great!"
5.0,I'm glad I got this cloth. I use it on my stainless steel ring as well as my mom's gold ring and it did wonders to the jewelry. I did pair it with a liquid jewel cleaner which helped immensely. The cloth is good on it's own if you just need a quick shine though.
5.0,"These bags for backpack are great . Light weight , quality durable material . Perfect size . Great price"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:566bb128655c5d9a1e431f3980c8ba9d]] I love it
5.0,"I'm really impressed with the quality of this band. I've had it on non-stop for months, and it still looks like new. Love it."
5.0,The fit is really nice. It's very stretchy!
5.0,I came in second place in the ugly sweater contest.  The first place winner had on a really ugly sweater. The sweater was nice and comfortable though.
5.0,"I love BIG earrings.<br />But I don‚Äôt like heavy earrings.<br />These earrings are the perfect compromise.<br />The shape of the earrings curves great against my face so they lay nicely without sticking out or jabbing me.<br />The resin material is lightweight but sturdy.<br />These earrings stay on and don‚Äôt slide off my ear. The posts and back are well constructed.<br />These earrings are great for a casual outfit - ripped jeans and a tshirt or for getting dressed up - little black dress.<br /><br />** Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review.<br />I hope the information that I've provided helps to make your decision a little easier.<br />If you found this review helpful, please click the ‚ÄòHelpful‚Äô button below."
5.0,I love these shoes! My son says they are his favorite most comfortable shoes! The laces are a bit stretchy too and that helps them tie and stay tied!!! Which as a parent is amazing!!!
5.0,Love this Nice tight fit!!
5.0,I collect hats. This is my favorite. Enough said.
5.0,They came on time & I looked at all of them and didn't notice any stones being loose. My piercing is sensitive to materials and these have not irritated it.
5.0,Ordered them for my wife she loves them I'm still Alabama fan roll tide
5.0,"My go-to workout shirt, super cute and comfortable. I need to get more of them!!"
5.0,Item as described.  Works great for my daughter that can only wear surgical steel earrings.
5.0,"This is such a beautiful piece, looks so much better in person than online! I've worn it many times and gotten several compliments about it. Very unique piece. Extremely glad I purchased it!"
5.0,"neat little guys, keep a pair in my glove box"
5.0,"Perfect fir, I wear it often. Love it!"
5.0,"The chain links were a little bigger than I anticipated, but for the price it‚Äôs great! Still super cute."
5.0,There fit perfect
5.0,"Beautiful, vibrant tie-dyed colors as pictured. Nice fit."
5.0,Very comfortable. Liked that you can either wear it casual or add some heels and dress it up.
5.0,"This sweater has been worn almost nonstop since receipt. It fits nice, be careful though, or you might think it's too big. It's probably not. This one is worn by a 5'9"", 110lb woman, size small. Once on, enjoy the fun shoulder ruffles and soft fabric. Even though it's not cotton, polyester mostly, it feels nice and not ""sweaty"" like other polyester clothing feels sometimes."
5.0,"Awesome. Great quality, great fabric. I bought one size up and it was a great fit. The non-skid strip at the bottom hem is really perfect."
5.0,Love this necklace! Not only is it on a long silver chain with a magnifier but the inside swivels! I got immediate compliments on it!
5.0,Beautiful necklace.  Just right for my teenage niece who likes delicate jewelry
5.0,"I love this knit racerback tank dress for lounging and sleeping in. It is really soft and comfortable and the floral pattern is sweet and feminine. With the weather finally starting to warm up, it‚Äôs finally time to retire the flannel and this tank dress makes me feel cool, comfy, and pretty even while I‚Äôm bumming around at home or retiring for bed. üòä<br /><br />I am very thin and petite (5‚Äô0‚Äù) so I didn‚Äôt find the length to be a problem but I can see a taller woman finding this tank dress too short. I‚Äôm also currently pregnant and all belly so it clings somewhat funny to my tummy area üòÇ but I don‚Äôt foresee the fit being a problem after my daughter arrives and my body (hopefully) goes back to its pre-pregnancy state, more or less. üòú"
5.0,"Great customer service, must have if your glasses don't stay were you want them, sports, jogging.. overall good product."
5.0,"I like the softness and comfort of these shirts on chilly days. Best to buy a little larger, as they run small. I ordered  3X to have a looser fit."
5.0,"Fits a bit small, but they look awesome"
5.0,"They're very comfortable, I washed them with the whites and they're still their off-white color. They work well bunched also."
5.0,I love the bathing suit and the price was quite inexpensive.  My friends who see me in it admire the suit as well.  Keep up the good work.
5.0,Loved it! Great quality
5.0,My son loves his &#34;cool&#34; sneakers!
5.0,"The color and fit is wonderful, not to mention the dress is absolutely stunning. The material is amazing as well. Incredibly soft and lots of stretch to it. I have a tiny pouch though, so I ordered a body shapewear to wear underneath for a seamless silhouette. I also have a petticoat to wear underneath. Can't wait to see how they all look together on."
5.0,"Son loves them  , comfortable"
5.0,This is a nice necklace.  It goes with so many of my outfits .  I like the simplicity of it and the chain has a bit of a glimmery shine.
5.0,Carried it through Italy.  Very convenient.  Holds all you need.
5.0,Awesome quality fast shipping!
5.0,Love them !  Fast delivery and they don't bother my ears like some others I have tried.
5.0,HOT GLASSES!
5.0,Beautiful dress. Fits perfect. True to size.
5.0,"Material is too hot for summer, will be great in the winter. Very long on my 4 year old, I got the size he wears most in other pants."
5.0,"I was a bit nervous after reading reviews of this product, but took a chance on it anyway. I‚Äôm glad I did‚Äîthis is quite lovely, and the video the company posted about how to put the bracelet on/take it off was helpful. I worked at jewelry store for many years and I swear‚Äîpeople can be so hard on their jewelry and then try to complain about its quality. Treat your jewelry gently, folks, that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll keep it from breaking. *steps off soapbox* Anyway, the quality was great for the price, and I‚Äôm psyched!"
5.0,"very satisfied with the Product, I have shown my friends how good it works and I definitely give it a 5! I am 100% happy with my purchase."
5.0,I get complemented every time! Added a black belt and took off the bow
5.0,Like the color fits well
5.0,Just as expected.  They fit comfortably and for a great price.
5.0,Great value package
5.0,"Very nice vest. Fit well. Got for my husband. He wears 32&#34; waist jeans. He has a beer belly, so got him the large. Fit around his belly great. I did take in under the arms. Looked great. Very satisfied."
5.0,This is a really nice long skirt. I was going on a cruise where I would need formal wear and I decided to take this skirt because it had pockets for my room key. It fit well and looked good. I know I will get a lot of use out of it.
5.0,Soy talla L. Ordene L. Y me queda igual a la modelo...un poco suelta... eso es bueno para mi.<br /><br />Talvez si ordeno M me queda mejor.<br />Pero me quedare con L por el momento ya que me gusto la calidad de los colores...muy vivos. Y la tela es un poco delgada... pero no se transparenta. Perfecta para los 70-80¬∞ F.<br />La seque en secadora y redujo un poco. Ahora me queda perfecta.
5.0,this was absolutely beautiful!!!! would definately buy again & encourage others to buy also!! my 6 year old granddaughter loves it & so did her mama!!
5.0,Super comoda y confortable me gusto mucho .<br />Gracias!!
5.0,"A little long but I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô3. The material is sheer but With some nude undies it will be good, there is no slip. It does have a side zipper which is super awesome. The material is a rayon poly blend which is great because it washes great and doesn‚Äôt wrinkle. I‚Äôm 5,3 34DD and always a M. I bought a medium on this and it was perfect with my boobs. If you have a smaller chest and no hips I recommend to size down. I‚Äôm a curved girl and I don‚Äôt think it makes me look fat. Another plus side is I‚Äôm able to wear a normal bra due to the size of straps on the dress. Straps literally align to my bra strap. I‚Äôm going to buy more colors for sure I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs long."
5.0,I love this bathing suit ...
5.0,"I absolutely love sportin this adorable, attention grabbing large bag with all my dogs needs perfectly inside. Love the words, the pockets, the color, texture, and this is a very sturdy bag. Not only do I fit all my dogs items in it, but I also end up throwing my purse into it, too for more hands free to focus on my dog. I recommend this bag!"
5.0,Love it so sexy. I haven't worn it yet but I will soon. I can't wait to hear all the comments. It is so cool I know everyone will love it as much as I do.
5.0,"In case of review lumping (always a possibility on Amazon...and this vendor makes the same style earrings with various combinations of stone), I purchased the 'iolite and fluorite' version.  In other words, a dark purple and dark green.  Most 'green and purple' earrings/jewelry tend towards the amethyst and peridot...which can be varying shades of lavender and a lighter grassy green.  Very nice too, but if you are looking for something a little different, these are fantastic.<br /><br />The setting is as pictured and feels very solid, also very nice and high quality.  The only quibble (and I would make this 4.5 stars) is that the ear wires are just a little less substantial than the earring itself.  Not bad, but just a hair less substantial.  Given the current photos this IS clearly illustrated.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the quality of these earrings, and the colors of the stones as well.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />JTG"
5.0,"Love these underwear! I haven't been able to find them in my regular store, so I was really very excited to discover that I could order them here. They are very comfortable, breathable, and look fashionable!"
5.0,"Me encant√≥, esta muy moderno"
5.0,Great top! Nice weight and very comfy!
5.0,"I ordered these for my husband. I run not and he runs cold, so he needed lounge pants to combat the constantly running a/c. They're thick enough to keep him warm, but not so heavy to be only winter pants. He loves them and he looks good in them. He's tall and slim (30 in waist) and finding pants that fit can be a challenge. The mediums fit perfectly and he was so excited he could just slip them on without having to pull the drawstring up tight.<br /><br />I ordered them just to wear around the house, but they're nice enough to wear outside to run errands if he wanted to. We'll order these again when he needs more."
5.0,"Looks gorgeous. Got a lot of compliments even from strangers.<br />Cons: polyester fabric, don‚Äôt wear when it‚Äôs hot outside."
5.0,"Serve its purpose and arrived quickly, excellent!"
5.0,Me encanta el gorro. Muy c√≥modo y muy lindo el logo del equipo de f√∫tbol.
5.0,"These socks are comfortable and light weight, great for summer."
5.0,It was very pretty small was fine
5.0,"I bought 36w and they are at least that plus the the elastic waist so there is plenty of room.  The pants stretch all over, seems like the pockets stretch too.  Only worn twice and it was hot out and didn't get overheated in the short time I was outside.<br />Ordering a second pair in a different color.<br />I wish they had more pockets because I usually carry quite a bit of things on me."
5.0,These fit my son perfectly and he says they are very comfortable :)
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The first time my friend ordered it, she got a size that was too small based off of reading other reviews. However, I ordered her one as a gift in a size higher, a size 14. It fit perfectly!!!"
5.0,Super cute set! Really comfortable and lightweight for the summer! Ordered a M and fit perfect!
5.0,Very cute and flattering!
5.0,I thought this was the perfect shirt/dress. I paired it with black skinny pants and wore it on Christmas in the red color. I like the fit so much that I‚Äôm purchasing it in another color.
5.0,Plan on getting more. Best underwear ever. Comfortable stretch and invisible.
5.0,Well made pajamas! They‚Äôre soft and comfortable.  Runs slightly small.
5.0,"Great service, good product, love it! A+++"
5.0,love it! just the right size for game day!
5.0,Love these sun glasses. Have had compliments on them. Recommend to others.
5.0,Nice top but just a little too big.
5.0,Very flattering neckline and true to size.
5.0,This is the third belt I buy on Amazon... all of them are very well made and significantly lower price than brick & mortar stores. I definitely recommend this product
5.0,"After I switched to these, I say to myself, 'where have you been all my life!!'. Perfect QUALITY, soft, yet durable, save a lot of space in my luggage. Just perfect!!"
5.0,Cute made well
5.0,Love the graphics and softness of this T. I did order a size up after reading reviews and it fit perfectly.
5.0,"I love it! perfect size! I walk a lot , with my dog, and this has worked perfect to keep my hands free. I can carry several cards, id, money ,keys or even something like chapstick, compact powder etc. the mirror is a nice touch too! nice leather and soft inside. I use minicat not just for walking but errands and other simple outings. like I said love it!"
5.0,"Loved that the quality was the same as what was advertised. I used it for a gift for my boyfriend. The detail and stitching exceeded my expectations. Was well worth it, would purchase other items also. Ordered a large, probably could have gone with a medium but he likes his clothes a little baggy . But true to size. A medium would be the same as a US medium."
5.0,"Wore during a Christmas party, they were a hit!"
5.0,Perfect fit for my granddaughter for school. Great quality. And stylish
5.0,"Comfortable shoe, nice and wide. I order 1 size up"
5.0,"Totally cool product for a fashionable kid.  Fit as expected and the kid it was purchased for loved them.  The have a little button (kind of hidden) on the connection wire for recharging.  This button adjusts the colors and flash patter option on the shoes.  Haven't charged them yet, kid wore them for 4 hours before charging (probably not a good idea for the life of the battery), just throwing that out there.  Overall, a really cool shoe!"
5.0,Fits great had the volume I wanted!!!
5.0,"This blouse is great value for the price. It's not tissue thin and see-through like you get with most fast fashion pieces. This blouse has a good weight that makes it feel and look like it is worth a lot more. If you're old enough to remember how clothes were made before the turn of the century, this is quality you could expect to find in major department stores."
5.0,"I love them, they are a perfect fit. I think they are a little pricey, would love to order another pair, but will have to wait awhile."
5.0,Great inserts - Highly recommend them
5.0,"I loved them for my three month old, they fit perfectly for his face and came with a bag to keep them from getting scratched‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,I absolutely love my purse. Bought mine in black. So rummy and just the right size.
5.0,"I love this dress! The fabric is soft and comfortable, it doesn‚Äôt shine through, it fits perfectly and has the perfect amount of weight to it."
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable.  Keeps mask within easy reach."
5.0,Exactly as described. Better quality than expected at the price. No issues.
5.0,Love this piece looks and feels very nice and pairs with so many out fits.
5.0,Love them. Good quality.
5.0,Ho ho ho Santa is coming.  Such a cute hat.  Fit is great.
5.0,"Being a Vietnam vet, I enjoy wearing something camo themed daily as a proud reminder of my service.  My 20mm NATO fits the bill and adds a bit of raffish, adventurous charm to my watch. No regrets here!  I got fast service, secure packaging and a product I'm darned proud of!  Thanks."
5.0,"Great quality, and fit. Exactly what was expected. Would buy again."
5.0,The bracelet arrived prior to expected delivery date ( hooray) and was the splitting image of the advertised image.
5.0,"It‚Äôs very cute and very long! Doesn‚Äôt keep you super super warm so I probably wouldn‚Äôt use it as a jacket replacement. But the fabric does feel like wool! It isn‚Äôt itchy, and a little heavy, but it‚Äôs nice. I‚Äôd suggest it to anyone who wanted it for a costume or just a cute addition to an outfit on a bit of a cooler autumn day."
5.0,To correct my stand
5.0,"I have left a review of this particular bracelet elsewhere but I am so impressed by it that I want to do so again.  I have purchased 4 of this particular one and it is the most elegant, beautiful mala I have purchased (and I have several).  The price is amazing (and free shipping), how do they do it?  Well worth the wait."
5.0,"If you get the right size, it's the best bra you will ever purchase, hands down! I'm in love ‚ù§!!"
5.0,"I ordered 3 pairs , 3 colors.  Love them.<br />Great quality."
5.0,picture perfect
5.0,"This is a very pretty dress which is sized properly. The dress is soft, very comfortable. The style is loose fitting which gives a nice smooth look. Absolutely beautiful and nice quality fabric."
5.0,I wanted a silk scarf to go between my wool coat and my skin.  This scarf does the job well and looks great.  I have gotten several compliments wearing it.
5.0,"This is a lovely dress. It is good for a special occasion. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
5.0,Love the feel and fit of these shorts. Perfect
5.0,"super cute! You have to have relatively slim thight. I am 5' 5&#34; 135lb and its a little snug on the thighs but not too bad, I wear a 4 or 27 in pants. Super cute though!"
5.0,Perfect fit for my Mom!
5.0,Loved all of it!!!!
5.0,"Eat your heart our Cousin Eddie!  Got this to piece together my Cousin Eddie Christmas costume!  Hey, it is a dickie and works!"
5.0,So cute and flattering! Love this dress! Can‚Äôt wait to wear it!
5.0,I bought this Water Proof Swimming Goggles for my husband. He uses to swim on a daily basis and told me that it‚Äôs very confortable and watertight. It a great google for swimmers!
5.0,"This is the cutest nightshirt - bright, happy colors.  I absolutely love it!  Great to give as a gift or....just to give to yourself."
5.0,Great and comfortable fit.
5.0,Lightweight & very warm.  Great at trapping head heat.
5.0,"I've been swimming for about seventy years and this pair of goggles are a joy to use.  I lost a pair of pretty good goggles and had to buy a replacement pair at the front desk of the community center.  They cost about the same as these Niafeya goggles but were torture to wear.  These googles are very high quality and very comfortable.  I held off writing a review till I could use them in the water and I can report that they are perfect.  Crystal clear lenses, completely water tight.  They have a little button to release the strap so they are very easy to adjust to fit.  The case they came in was so sturdy and well designed I plan to keep it in my gym bag both to protect the lenses but also to remind me to store my new goggles.  This is one pair I would hate to lose.  Highly recommended and very reasonably priced."
5.0,Nice way to add some subtle bling.
5.0,This is a great charm but would not recommend it for a charm bracelet. Too big for a bracelet but will work great for a necklace.
5.0,These slips are wonderful. I wear them under my caftans to provide a little extra layer if I run out to get mail or if someone drops by. They breath and don‚Äôt FEEL like another layer. Comfy straps don‚Äôt fall down. VERY happy with this purchase!!
5.0,"My delivery was late so I didn‚Äôt wear them to my intended vacation spot, but have worn them around the house a few times since it‚Äôs cold out where I live. They are comfortable, seem to be made of a sturdy fabric, and aren‚Äôt transparent when you put them on like some leggings."
5.0,Daughter loved that these were adjustable. She looks adorable in them.
5.0,I purchased this shirt for a theme party. The shirt is great quality shirt for the price. beautiful color. Would buy again.
5.0,"Recieved exactly as stated in the description, would order again."
5.0,My daughter loves it!!!  Thank you!
5.0,I was actually surprised that they were higher quality than I expected for the price. Plus they seem to have an almost rubberized feel to them that I like<br /><br />When I inevitably lose them I will most likely repurchase.
5.0,"Good material, affordable, and came in time."
5.0,Great purchase! Exactly what I expected.
5.0,I ordered a size 5 for my 7 year old and it fits perfectly on his pointer finger where he likes to wear it
5.0,"These are great and breathable gloves for bike riding! Great for summer, spring and into fall but not recommended for winter. I say this as they are a breathable fabric on the top of your hands so they are not a solid fabric although they look like it in the picture. This is for novices who may not know what breathable fabric means. But I love them. You can't wear them when trying to use your cell phone but I don't text and ride anyway! LOL! That is the only downfall I see to them. I would definitely buy them again!"
5.0,"Good value for your money. I keep a bunch in the car.  For one use disposables, your dollars will go far."
5.0,"So far so good, would recommend"
5.0,I love these and want one in every color!
5.0,"My favorite baby shoes! I ordered the silver and the gold pair for my baby girl in size 0-6 and she wore them up until about 9 months. The silver pair held up well as did the gold however I popped one of the elastic bands trying to put it on one day but luckily it was time to go up a size anyway! So I just ordered another gold, silver, & coffee colored in the 6-12 months. My baby is 10 months now & they fit but have about an inch of growing room (just how I like them!). I love that they don't fall off and they're easy to get on. They go with almost every outfit & you can't beat the price! I will def continue to order from this brand/seller. They take a while to arrive but they did come about a week and a half before their expected arrival so that was nice!"
5.0,"I ordered this bag on the 6th of September at night and it was sent out on the 8th, I got it on the 10th!!  I was amazed because I ordered it for 14day shipping, but it came Priority mail!  I am very pleased at the quality, condition and size of the purse I bought.  From the pitcure, I thought the bag would be smaller, but I am very excited that its a more practical size.  Would buy from them again in a heartbeat!!"
5.0,"I love the cut of this. It's perfect to wear asymmetrical or to tie. I like it tied. I wish the fabric on the front would have been darker, but that's just one of those things about fabric I guess. The cut is super flattering. The scoop neck can be worn low or a little higher up. Looks absolutely adorable with a denim skirt, or shorts. I'll be getting a lot of use out of this top. Soft material, and super comfy as well. Awesome."
5.0,"Love wearing these during the winter, especially with my rain boots! They're super cute and compliment almost any winter outfit."
5.0,My husband loves these - says they are very comfortable!!
5.0,"Very high quality hat! I learned to only wear it when I'll actually be out in the cold, because it is so warm.  I love the fuzzy insides as well.  Super satisfied with this hat."
5.0,My husband loves it very nice
5.0,The sleaves were a little long for me but I folded and tucked them but overall I love this dress. Wore it for two special occasions so far.
5.0,This dress was perfect for my Jessica Rabbit costume!!!!
5.0,These are totally cute and fun and priced well. Good purchase.
5.0,Hermosas a mi hija le encant√≥. Buen√≠sima calidad.
5.0,It was a gift for my ex mother in law she's happy with the earring
5.0,They are well made and fit great.
5.0,Was even better than expected. Great seller!
5.0,"Super easy to put in and snaps shut with no issues. No rough edges, completely smooth once clasped"
5.0,"Bought this for my daughters (who was closer to the lower end weight wise and the other closer to the higher end) and it for well on both of them. Worked as expected, they liked having this for the beach and pool!"
5.0,I received a lot of compliments and I felt good in this dress.
5.0,"The varsatility factor of this bag is unbelievable. You can use it as a messenger bag, carry it with your hands and even use it as a regular backpack. It really depends on your preference and occasion when to use any of the 3 carrying methods. I carry my 15 inch surface book and it fits even though it mentions a laptop limit size that's a bit smaller(it fits in the designated laptop sleeve a little tight). The material seems pretty durable and the design inside provides plenty of room. I love that it is divided into 2 main compartments by different zippers. In my opinion the bag is pretty stylish and is now my new every day carry. Honestly, this is the bag that I didn't know existed but new that I had to have. I hope this helps you make an educated purchasing decision."
5.0,love this purse and the color! super cute!
5.0,Absolutely loved this necklace it‚Äôs so beautiful
5.0,"the fit and the comfort and it's a amazing sweater, these last three were gifts to my son-in-laws and they are totally satisfied!!"
5.0,Breathable and protective from sun
5.0,very good glasses.  Love them
5.0,"This dress is honestly perfect. It fits perfectly and the material is super comfy!! It's stretchy, but not see through. The dress is flowy and doesn't wrinkle like my other dresses. Perfect for church and school dances. Definitely would recommend!!"
5.0,"For the price and fit, it's a great dress. The quality is that of a cheaper faux-silk material. I wore it to school on one of our Christmas themed days and nearly froze to death. It's thin and provides no warmth. If it's a Christmas dress, be prepared to seriously layer up, or hopefully you live in a warm climate.<br /><br />However, the other patterns would be fantastic for a spring, summer, or early autumn dress!"
5.0,Husband loves them. Says they are the most comfortable thing he's ever put on his feet. Excellent purchase.
5.0,I liked the Darla slides so much I ordered a second pair for my mom.
5.0,The item was fine. Ever so swift delivery. The packaging was immensely nice. Seller is top-notch. A+!
5.0,"I ordered the white romper. It fits as expected,  I'm very happy with the product.  It's exactly line the pictures,  excellent quality material and flawless cut. So glad I decided to purchase it after much thought."
5.0,"I'm loving this cardigan sweater! Fits perfectly.<br /><br />It's got some weight to it, feels good wearing it. It's thick and gets warm pretty quick. The wooden buttons look super nice.<br /><br />The cardigan is an excellent value and suitable for any occasion, I enjoy wearing it."
5.0,Love it!  Very comfortable!
5.0,This is a very pretty top!
5.0,Amazing dress for the price. Looks and feels more expensive. Received a lot of compliments.
5.0,"Comfy socks, great for long flights."
5.0,fit perfectly and looks great.
5.0,None were broken! It came with all 25 and there were no duplicates!! I love it! Plus super fast shipping! Definitely beats going to the mall and paying a ton of money for just a few! (:
5.0,As described. My toddler loved this for Halloween and just playing pretend. It has held up pretty well to months of toddler play.
5.0,"This has saved me!! I like the grt good deals so sometimes I stand outside stores hours before they open. This keeps me warm in the cold Michigan weather. Battery pack works great, however it is a little heavy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 140 pounds and ordered a medium."
5.0,"I got this for my son who is currently in college. He wanted a backpack that didn't look &#34;juvenile &#34; or like a &#34;man bag&#34;.<br />This fit the bill.<br />Nice color, quality and durable."
5.0,good qua;ity
5.0,Great sun protection... love it.. I stay cool even on the hottest days...
5.0,"Super happy with quality of this band. It fits and feels like the original factory band. However, it‚Äôs slight more flexible and doesn‚Äôt possess all the word ‚ÄúBadging‚Äù as the factory one. For me, it‚Äôs fine.  I like the cleaner look."
5.0,Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. It‚Äôs a cute bracelet and I know she will love it.≈Ç
5.0,My new favorite pair of earrings.
5.0,Fast delivery and great price! Thankyou!
5.0,Worked great for my daughter. She‚Äôs missing some toes and these fit for the most part. Sometimes her toes she has slips through the top but she doesn‚Äôt mind! Great for prosthetics/ orthotics as well since they are adjustable in 3 different place
5.0,Light for spring/summer.
5.0,It is kind of hard to find leggings with pockets or even big enough pockets. I have an Iphone 10S MAX and these leggings have a pocket that fits it perfectly. They are also very cooling when I wear them during a work out. Thank you!
5.0,"Stickiness is perfect, fits well."
5.0,"It‚Äôs very pretty, considering purchasing the necklace to match"
5.0,I think it‚Äôs a great dress especially for the price. It was super comfy. I don‚Äôt expect it to hold up for many washes but it was $14 so. Plus it has pockets.
5.0,These sandals are so cute. My granddaughter was so excited when she unwrapped them at her birthday party. Match perfect with the Minnie Mouse swimsuit we bought to go with them.
5.0,Perfect size and weight. Quality earrings.
5.0,"Fit great. I'm 6'1 210 lbs. Fit me perfect. Added a couple of my own patches to it. Particularly a ""Biden"" velcro patch to cover tipsy on the chest. Then called myself a ""Crash America Dummy"" all night. Was a hit costume at the bar!"
5.0,"Haven‚Äôt put it through the rigors of a good ole college tailgate but as it stands‚Ä¶Love it!!! Exactly as I hoped. Look out SEC, Gator Nation is coming for you. Haha"
5.0,I received this as a gift from my husband and it is very pretty and easy to wear. A little heavy at first but you get used to it.
5.0,My gf loved them
5.0,"love these tops I want one in every color! I've purchased 4 so far and plan to order a few more. the price is right, the keep me cool and comfortable during my workout and they're very flattering!"
5.0,"Not much to say. I work at Walmart and we had a sale on boxers (which I use as pajamas) and pajama bottoms. I got TMNT and Batman at Walmart. But, there wasn't much for STAR WARS. So, I got these."
5.0,Blocks sun and doesn't hold in heat.  Without sides and face mask cap is much cooler than normal cap.  With side and face mask sun is blocked can breath easily and cooler than direct sunlight on skin. Face mask upper portion is mesh but hard to notice with sides on. Went shopping with it.  Its a cap with face mask and surrounding sun blocker. Can be xap alone or add one or both of the attachments. Seemed awfully thin when  i opened package but comfy and cool on hot summer day. Exceeded expectations and opinion when first unpacked.
5.0,"My daughter wanted to be Rapunzel for Halloween. I ordered this, expecting it to be subpar, but it was great! A bit heavy, but she loved wearing it! Held up fairly well over the week of her wearing it off and on. Now we can add it to her dress up closet."
5.0,Love love love the color....pretty decent for the price.
5.0,Good set of clipper. Took awhile to come in but that's not a big deal to me.
5.0,Super cute. Fit fine.  All of them came neatly wrapped.  Does the job of being a cute choker
5.0,"What a great item. Been looking for a belt exactly like this for a long time. Attractive, does the job and comfortable."
5.0,"These shorts are so cute!!! The material is very comfortable, they stretch pretty good and not see through. I do crossfit and I have not worn them to workout yet but I trust they‚Äôll be pretty comfortable. I read the reviews and some comments said to size up, I‚Äôm glad I did! They are a little big on the waist but not I‚Äôm not mad about it. I‚Äôm a size large and I got an extra large.<br /><br />OK so update! I did a CrossFit workout that included running in the shorts they definitely roll up a lot. They also rolled up as I was trying to do box jumps but I did some deadlifts and they were perfectly fine üòä I would definitely wear these for more of an aesthetic workout than a cardio."
5.0,"Comfortable to wear, helps with the glare off the computer light."
5.0,Love this dress! So cute on and really good for a hot day the fabric is thin but not see through at all.
5.0,Love this.  Very warm and pretty!
5.0,Really cute girls fake glasses. I originally bought for the 100th day of school so my daughter could dress like an old lady but she loves them and wants to wear them all the time lol. Has the lenses in them so looks really nice.
5.0,Better than expected and nicely packaged too!
5.0,The color is great. The length and fut is perfect. I ordered an XL and it fits well. Not snug.
5.0,Love these boots!  European sizing is spot on.  No problem with fitting my average size calves.  Very comfortable for long on your feet days!
5.0,"How many people have a close friend who is middle aged and quite prim and proper, and yet would jump on the chance to wear a tank top featuring a California Stoned Surfer Burrito? I do! My friends loves to wear wacky clothes. The weirder, the better, and I think this shirt is definitely . . . different. It's funny, it's summery, and it's also pretty cute despite the weird subject matter. The material of this tank is very soft and thin and contains 50% polyester, 4.2 oz of super soft blend ringspun cotton, etc. This was screen printed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and has a racerback style that my friend likes a lot. This tank is fun and harmless. I don't think anyone will notice the stoned burrito unless they study the shirt very carefully. I'm really happy to have this to give to my friend and I know she will wear it all summer long. I hope this review helps to better inform your purchasing decision. Thanks for reading.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Works great with my dress. Arrived quick and hoopless!
5.0,love since may last name is lord
5.0,very helpful.
5.0,"Absolutely loved the style.  I am a curvy woman, 5'9""  around 200, ordered an XL,  maybe a large would have worked also, but like the fit as it contours to your body.  Suggest getting a Spanx for under the garment. Saw the other reviews and yes,  there is a little gap at the top that will show your bra, so wear a similar color bra and it will be fine.  I liked it so much I ordered the wine one too after trying on this one."
5.0,"Arrived quickly, looks as shown, runs a little small but otherwise it's really nice and worth purchasing again."
5.0,It does what it's supposed to do.  I feel like there is a bit of wasted space though.  It's shapped like a hat but when packing it would maybe be easier if it was square or rectangular.  It might be nice to have a hard storage space above the bill portion.  I store stuff behind the hats too.. like a pair of sunglasses.  I find that I can get 2 hats in comfortably and a third if I cram it in a bit.
5.0,"A little flouncy for my taste, but my kids love me to wear it, so I do."
5.0,"This shirt is soft and comfortable as well as well made, great for working outside in the warmer months without having to regularly apply sunscreen. It's light and breathable yet it protects you from the sun by covering areas normally left exposed during warmer weather."
5.0,The umbrella comes with a cover and a zipper. The opening and closing can be done by the button which is very comfortable.
5.0,"I love these glasses, I have rec'd a ton of compliments.  They are really cute and stylish.  Will order another pair in green."
5.0,Bought it for my wife she loved it..
5.0,it was a gift for sons and grandson. fit the bill

5.0,Very cute  got a lot of compliments
5.0,"Excellent quality  , great buy !  Will use again !<br /><br />S.S."
5.0,Love these bezels. Very nice! Have not tarnished which is a plus since I sell jewelry.
5.0,So silky!
5.0,Really great for during the cold days or to wear under your dress pants for work. The best part is they don‚Äôt move so they stay all day without you having to pull them up or down.

5.0,Same product as at the western store but several dollars cheaper!
5.0,Love these socks. So cute and pastel colors are beautiful.
5.0,"It's a cute suit and is very soft. After reading the other reviews, I decided to get one size smaller than I normally would and it fits well.  I am 5'1&#34;, 147 lbs and a 34 DD cup. I got a medium when I would normally get a large and I am happy I did."
5.0,Love it. Can't wait to wear to my sons baseball game.
5.0,Came as decribed. Super fast shipping!! Only issue i had was it was missing 2 rhinestones. But only i can notice. It also fits my XDS perfectly!
5.0,"I gave this as a gift, it looks great!"
5.0,"Great jacket. Nice fit. Snagged a little throughout the night, but nothing too major. Wore this for a Christmas event and it was perfect!"
5.0,My granddaughter won't wear any other shows at this moment.
5.0,Its fits a little big.  but I will order from this seller again
5.0,"Wish I could find more earrings exactly like these!!!! Love these angel earrings, they are small, but love them"
5.0,"Very comfortable, great support, fit is a bit tight."

5.0,I am giving these as part of my gift to my bridesmaids and they are just the right size and appearance.
5.0,These are great!  Got them to stay on the back porch to throw on when I go out and wear to the beach.  All rubber so nothing to hold water or dirt.  Just rinse off.  My wife wants her own now too.
5.0,"I know it‚Äôs oversized but it‚Äôs not insanely oversized, I got my regular size and it fits perfectly! Good material too, not rough on skin. It‚Äôs perfect for autumn!"
5.0,"Comfortable socks.  The yellow edge is a little interesting...at the back, there is a tag, similar to those you would find on some pairs of sneakers. It's not distracting or uncomfortable or anything, just unique."
5.0,I am OBSESSED with theseüòç<br />They are such HIGH QUALITY! They are a very soft stretchy material. No inner snag areas! Beautiful color! Simple and beautiful! Absolutely inlove. I immediately packed these in our hospital bag for babies arrival!
5.0,Love it!  I had to scotchguard it so it would not show dirt when it goes through security!
5.0,Bracelet serves as a blessing for those who wear it.  Message on card included explains it's special meaning.  Great gift for spiritual family and friends.
5.0,Cute - Small - perfect for holding a toothl
5.0,"Bought these for my sons, for a canoe trip. They are 11 and 12. My youngest would rather see the world in color (???), so he wouldn't wear them. My glasses were broke on the trip, so I grabbed his and wore them. They are perfectly fine for $12 glasses. You get what you pay for, and I did and I am very happy with these glasses. I am 6'3&#34; with a fat head (I think) and they fit me a little snug but doable.  I have been wearing them everyday for work glasses. They are fine. Would buy again."
5.0,Great pair of sunglasses at a great price
5.0,Perfect size for children.
5.0,Granddaughter loves it.  Appears to be quality material and made well.
5.0,I'm a big fan of this wallet. I've had it for a week and it's a great size. My favorite thing is the tab that you pull out to get a card. I haven't had a chance to see if the RFID protection works but I'm hoping I never have to. Great value for the price!
5.0,It was better than expected at this price point. Loved the fabric and the fitting.

5.0,Adorable! My husband went to a man congress from church for the first time. I wanted to gift him something special. He loves it
5.0,I have been a fan of headwraps for years.  These are fun and protect my long hair.  They enable me to put my hair up under my bicycle and motorcycle helmets comfortably.  They are also useful in hot weather to wet down and wear on your wrists and neck for personal air conditioning.  They are a great alternative to hear nets if your job requires you to wear one
5.0,The quality of the glasses is great very durable loved how luxurious they look and feel great deal. High quality

5.0,"This is a cute little watch for very little price, not sure what I'm going to do with it, would be good to hook on to a bag so you always have the time at your fingertips."
5.0,"SUPER SOFT and comfortable. Easily my favorite pair to run in. Not as much compression as UA, but with the softer, stretchier material, you wouldn't get it anyway.<br /><br />If you're looking for an amazing pair to run/exercise/SLEEP IN! these are it!"
5.0,Very girlie
5.0,Received √≠tem very fast.
5.0,"Amazing shoes for kids!  The bend and move with their lil feet.  My grandson loved these.  He did not try to take them off all the time like other shoes.  They are easy to clean, the insoles are removable for cleaning.  And anyone with kids knows they are in dirt and who knows what else all day and to be able to take the insoles out to wipe them and wash the shoes is a blessing.  Well worth every penny spent on them.  I got them on a Deal of the Day and am so glad I took advantage of that deal!"
5.0,Loved them they were really cute
5.0,"These do not ride up. They work well with my Orangetheory workouts (which includes treadmill work, rowing machine, and free weights)."
5.0,Beautiful and exact
5.0,Came as is. Wish it came with the small screwdriver.
5.0,Much easier to get on and off with the same amount of compression.  Much better to me than the original.
5.0,I sent this as a gift and she loved it!
5.0,I purchased a green set of four seamless bikini panties for my 14-year-old daughter. She commented that they are REALLY soft and comfortable. I ordered a size large; my daughter is about 150cm (5 feet) and 45.5 kg (100 pounds). I asked her if she wanted me to order more for her and &#34;YES!&#34; was the reply. We will get gray because she wants something simple.
5.0,"This is my Utah Utes tie. I'll wear them after every win. Hopefully people will get sick of seeing me in it at church the rest of thise season. Maybe they'll just be sick of season me, despite the tie.<br /><br />It's a really sharp tie, and can't beat the price. I don't wear cuff links or the pocket hankie, but it's nice to have them in reserve. I feel like I got all the value of the price in the tie.<br /><br />The tie itself is sturdy and has just the right heft. It doesn't dangle, but is slightly stiff. The sheen in the product photo is genuine.<br /><br />Beautiful tie, no complaints at all.<br /><br />go Utes!"
5.0,"I love the Hurley brand and this hoodie is perfect! It's very warm and comfortable. Works across many different applications; home,office,and going out wear. This hoodie fits as I'd expect for my 6'3&#34; 200lb frame."
5.0,I purchased this for my goddaughter to wear for Thanksgiving and it fit perfect and she looked super cute with it on!
5.0,I like that‚Äôs easy to put in and off the keys
5.0,LOVE this dress! I got so many compliments on it!
5.0,But not bad
5.0,Great design and good quality material
5.0,Love these bracelets! So much nicer than I expected! I've worn them every day since I got the.
5.0,Super soft and comfy. Fit just as expected
5.0,I wear this necklace frequently and it has not turned or broken despite heavy use and wear. I love Edgar Allen Poe and anyone who is into literature or darkness will love this too! I recommend this highly!
5.0,Bought this for a teenager. It looks great on her. So cute!
5.0,Slim style is great to pack in a purse or large jacket pocket!
5.0,"Very comfortable and flattering! Great spring/summer addition. True to size. I have broad, athletic shoulders and the medium still fit properly... maybe not a loose on the top as the model though. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 155 lbs, 36C, size 4/6, medium on top typically."
5.0,sooooo cute
5.0,"Officially my favorite mask, really good quality mask and image, came with filters too. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,"These were perfect! Got this for a Wendy Peffercorn (The Sandlot) costume, but I love them enough I'll wear them normally. A little stiff when I first opened them, but sunglasses usually are. Not terribly tinted, which is great because the world isn't too dark. They fit my face well and are very comfortable."
5.0,"I seldom write reviews, but my WORD is this product amazing. Everyone with a child should own one. Umbrella strollers are light and convenient, but they can be so awkward to carry over your shoulder, and the shape can make things difficult when packing up for a long trip. I bought this stroller because I thought it would be much easier to take on big trips -- boy am I glad I did. The stroller is about the weight of a laptop when folded up, and could easily slip in the overhead on a plane, behind a passenger seat in the car, etc. -- it really does open and close with minimal effort. I bought a yoga strap to attach at the top of the stroller so that I can just sling it over my shoulder for easy transport. It's simple, sleek, and attractive. It cleans up well and -- get this -- my two-year-old says it's cozy. He prefers it to our regular stroller now. Don't think twice -- buy it."
5.0,Great product. I ended up ordering the light color blue and the black. They are so comfortable and no one would question if they were jeans or not. Would definitely order again!
5.0,I so happy wear this costume
5.0,This ring is beautiful..I love it..It's beautiful in the picture and just as beautiful in person and on my finger..I get alot of compliments..Highly Recommend this ring..
5.0,"Thus far, this is an excellent product, well throughout when designing it. More importantly it does exactly what it shows  ."
5.0,For those days when you just wanna hang.<br />My friends love it.<br />I love it.<br />I got a medium but it's too big for me .<br />I work with it though :) .
5.0,I have a small foot. They fit well for a women's size 51/2. Like how bright they are.
5.0,I bought this for my 8 years old but it Fits even for an adult.
5.0,"This is BIG bling! Band is quite large, face is quite large and butterfly on inside of face as well as outside on top. Didn't notice that in picture. Lovely piece, just may be too big of bling for some."
5.0,I can wear it to Sunday Service at church. I love the pockets
5.0,So cute!  Great fit.
5.0,She loves them. Perfect fit. Price on Amazon was good.
5.0,Put your legs in shape
5.0,These are warm enough and the touch screen fingers work better than my old pair of gloves
5.0,My son absolutely loves these cleats! He said they feel really good on his feet and they look great!
5.0,Exactly as pictured. I ordered the red and the darker gray and love them both!  Really appreciate having a stylish top that is comfortable and modest.
5.0,Will see if it‚Äôs worth 80 bucks. Will come back in a couple of months.otherwise the shoe appears to be well made. It fits well and is comfortable .
5.0,These are the sexiest stockings I have ever seen! There are 8 different patterns which are all super seductive!
5.0,I ordered a XL I wear a 38G and it fit perfect.
5.0,Loved it - but didn't look nice on me!! very upset about that
5.0,"Great duffel bag, lots of space in a foldable bag size! Completely satisfied, I highly recommend!!!"
5.0,Gorgeous.........
5.0,"These are exactly what you‚Äôre looking for!! Solid quality and a perfect size for that sleek, Star Wars flair on a French cuff shirt. I combined these with a Vader tie and repped the dark side during my Doctorate graduation. Got my grad photos back and, BAM!, Darth just chillin‚Äô as I reach for my diploma.<br />Not sure about the glow-in-the-dark. I mean, yep, they glow. Does as advertised, but not sure how big of a deal that is. I doubt I‚Äôll ever care.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you‚Äôre a Vader fan with a need for cuff links, then buy with confidence. They‚Äôre worth the money and provide a solid look."
5.0,They take the stress out of driving at night with those ridiculously bright lights! And while driving in the rain
5.0,"Great compression socks, they fit nice and feel good too.  I will be buying more!"
5.0,"Lovely Dolores, excellent construction, and very comfortable."
5.0,"I have bought clothes from this brand (Romwe) before so I knew this hoodie was going to have thickness similar to a t shirt. I love this hoodie and I wear it all the time to work and around the house! It fits very true to size, I normally wear a L/XL, I bought an XL and it fits a little oversized which is exactly what I wanted. The Hem on the bottom is not complete, it's a raw Hem but it's not stringy or ripped. The fit is boxy and a little tomboyish so be wary if you don't like squareish fits.<br />Overall this is the perfect little hoodie to grab when you're just looking for something cute, simple, and comfy to throw on!"
5.0,Adorable slippers for any kids that love sharks and warm toes! :)
5.0,They are worth a buy...... They are beautiful and not that heavy....... even if you just wear these earrings they add elegance and make you glow......
5.0,Gave to my husband for Christmas and her loves them.  Wears them every day
5.0,I'm headed to the Caribbean and this cutie is going with me. The colors are more vibrant than pictured but beautiful. It is a little long but outside of that the fit is great. The elastic upper bodice can accommodate any size  bust. This is a nice dress or cover up on the beach. The fabric is t-shirt like- soft and comfy.
5.0,"I use this bag for work and it fits two water bottles, planner, notebook, keys, toiletries, makeup and so much more. Very good for everyday carry to run errands. It has a shape and straps are very comfortable!"
5.0,"Husband loves these tanks.  Deep cut armholes prevent rubbing during workout, fit is as described, size is accurate."
5.0,"It's for a wedding gift, but these are so cool!!!"
5.0,"I liked this shirt so much that I immediately ordered the second one after trying it on. It is loose, you can move freely, the material is soft, the color is good -- deep navy. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"I bought this so that I could have an accessory I could wear with little thought and would bring some wow to a basic outfit. Well made, easy to put on ,  is a color that is not obnoxious and can be matched with another piece.<br /><br />I can wear this with all black collared shirt by itself or pair it with a belt I bought else where. The color is on a normal spectrum so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it being slightly off hue.<br /><br />Great buy. I am thinking of buying a second color."
5.0,"I really like this bag, it is very roomy, and the variety of straps is a big plus, love the color, this bag is more than I expected, I am very pleased."
5.0,Quick and great quality
5.0,Brought these for my wife and was very apprehensive that she wouldn't like them. She loved them. I was very pleased.

5.0,Very comfortable shirt. I enjoy it very much. It's comfortable and keeps you warm. I got more than I expected and am pleased 5
5.0,Nice hoodie. Seems like it will last quite a while üëç
5.0,Such a cute shirt for spring!! It‚Äôs great quality and the color is actually as pictured
5.0,"The bra ran a bit big while the undies ran a bit small (that could just be because I am short with  a big butt though). I was very happy with the set over all, it's great for the price!"
5.0,They was and wear beautifully.
5.0,"I was not expecting such great quality from a $12 pair of sunglasses, but I was pleasantly surprised!  They even come with a high quality bag/protective case and a cloth for cleaning.  Awesome!"
5.0,"These where a gift. The recipient loved them. Great quality, and color. Fit well."
5.0,Worked out great... Very fast delivery. Less than 48hrs. Amazing.

5.0,Perfect dress for a night out in! Light weight too. Everyone needs a little black dress!
5.0,I love the four sisters pin.  I ordered this pin (or similar) several years ago from a catalog and one by one each sister's pin was broken at the clasp.  I was never able to find a replacement until now.  All of my sisters were very happy to get a new pin.
5.0,"Love the size. Taking it on vacation with me I carried shoes,Christmas presents and make up bags and it all fit."
5.0,"It's hard to pick things out on line because sometimes the item just doesn't live up to what you thought, or hoped. Nothing against the seller but I'm just a little leery at times and try not to get my hopes up. Well, this time, my hopes were pleasantly rewarded. The leather zen bracelet is good looking, made out of darker leather giving it a more rugged look and fits really nicely when I tighten it onto my wrist. I've bought a few others that no matter how tight you try to get it, it was still too large and was obviously intended for a male wrist. Not this one, fits my female wrist just right. My order came quickly."
5.0,Great price for two garage door openers.  Easy to program and they worked great with our Lift Master.
5.0,I loved everything about the bracelet
5.0,"My husband wanted a plain zip hoodie and this is perfect. Nice price, excellent fit."
5.0,It was exactly what I expected.  I will be wearing it for years to come.<br />I only wish it was a bit more purple...
5.0,Quality jacket for the price.
5.0,Bought these for the airplane ride for our vacation and they‚Äôre very comfortable! Stretchy and love the pockets!
5.0,A dingo ate my baby
5.0,I followed the other reviews that said to size down and glad I did. It came very well packaged. Color I had a hard time deciding on but mine were pretty true to what was shown online. I‚Äôve attached pictures of this size 4 held up to my sons size 5 nike shoe. As you can see they‚Äôre the same size. I also attached a picture of the brown I selected next to a different brand cognac color shoe‚Äîjust because I was looking through the review pictures for colors and couldn‚Äôt find any. Son hasn‚Äôt worn them yet but he tried them on and said they were comfy.
5.0,Daughter loves it. Bright colors. Seems to be well made.
5.0,Fits as expected. Very cute
5.0,It ran a little smaller than expected but I still ‚ù§Ô∏è!
5.0,no complaints mean it's ok.
5.0,This dress looked great when worn. Fit very well!
5.0,Safety glasses were delivered quickly. They seem to be sturdy and a great value
5.0,These are super functional and very attractive and provide the caregiver with the much preferred snaps with a crumb catcher area (also with snaps)!  Wonderful!!
5.0,Love the fit.....great for everyday gym use.
5.0,Christmas gift for our great-granddaughter (age 2).  She loved the ruffles and like that they showed over the tops of the boots from her great-uncle.
5.0,"fits great ,love it"
5.0,"Fits a little funny but I also have a small head but other than that I LOVE this hat!! I originally got it for my husband to wear since he works outside all day but I loved it too much. I like to listen to a podcast while I vacuum and do the dishes and this hat does the trick. I was worried about battery life but it lasts a long time! I actually have used it for weeks for a couple hours a day and I‚Äôve only charged it because I feel like it should be low on battery but it hasn‚Äôt actually said it‚Äôs low. It definitely does it‚Äôs job!<br /><br />Update: I‚Äôve had this hat since Christmas 2020 and it‚Äôs still just as awesome! I charge it once every couple weeks and use it for a couple hours a day. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I also found a hole at the top that I can put my pony tail through. It‚Äôs a good buy!"
5.0,"Batteries say are for ""display purposes only."" Smh. Other than that, pretty cool toy! We used it as a cake topper for a Fortnite theme 8th birthday. My nephew loved it. He kept lighting it up (only lights up for a few seconds at a time) throwing it by people's feet tell them they had to dance because it was a ""boogie"" bomb. A little pricey for what it does but it is cute and was a hit!"
5.0,Child loved them. One shoe didn‚Äôt stay charged as long though
5.0,"Love this shirt, plan to buy more in other colors. Very soft."
5.0,"Lined with nylon, good pockets and an easy zipper"
5.0,"Dainty, small and pretty. Nice for work because not overly flashy."
5.0,"This shirt fits as expected. Great for Fall, Winter & Spring. Love it."
5.0,"Nice white leotard. Soft fabric, smooth seams, nothing to bother skin. In white, there‚Äôs an extra layer of fabric across the chest, which is appreciated, but it also isn‚Äôt super noticeable. Lots of stretch but holds it shape, which is great because you can order a size up to get an extra year or even more wear. My almost 3 yo is fine in an extra small, she‚Äôs right around 50th percentile in height and weight for her age."
5.0,great quality! great quality! great quality!
5.0,Amazing was better than I expected would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable top
5.0,These were for my wife and she loved them.

5.0,Super cute on with a white crop top underneath!
5.0,filter adds a layer of protection that the Gaitero
5.0,"I feel these are excellent swimming goggles for children, especially with the one-year guarantee."
5.0,"This dress is great. The material is a heavier weight, not flimsy at all. This dress is great to wear to work on a casual Friday, you can also wear to Opening Day of the Horse Races here in San Diego with the correct accessories! I am 5'2 so it is a tad long, however I am short and used to everything being long on me, so with some wedges problem is solved. I ordered a lace obi belt from Amazon as well to wear with the dress and it is an amazing outfit! Takes the dress to the next level and looks effortless!"
5.0,"Just received the headgear n I couldn't be happier. First off, it's excellent quality. The embroidery on it is extremely well done. The colors contrast well n the logos on it aren't overpowering. As an Army Veteran I appreciate the quality n price I paid for this product. I will be back to buy more.<br />U.S. Army<br />SPEARHEAD"
5.0,Love them. Arrived sooner than anticipated. Go blue
5.0,Daughter loved it.  Fit perfectly.

5.0,Fits as expected for me.<br />Have not used it on warmer weather only using it for southern winter hikes and it works perfectly. May need some underpants for colder weather me`thinks.
5.0,"These headbands sttay put and absorb a large amount of moisture. I sweat profusely from my forehead during tough workouts and sweat will begin dripping through my eyebrows and into my eyes. This has resolved my issue and I spend less time distracted with using towels to mop myself off. Not only that but they keep my hair 100% out of my face.<br /><br />The headbands are soft, but fit snuggly. They do not move and can be adjusted into different shapes. They absorb a ton of sweat. They‚Äôre cute. They launder well. I initially thought they were a bit pricey but I liked them so much I bought another set. Recommend!"
5.0,As soon as I got them I wore them out and they looked amazing with my outfit!
5.0,This dress is absolutely perfect! I Love it!
5.0,"Perfect... holds my chap stick as advertised, I added a little clip to the ring so I can clip it to my keys or a bag and remove when needed. Does it's job and is very cute!"
5.0,"I like this one. It comes with the adjustable ear loops, and also has a space to insert a filter. It comes with two pm2.5 filters. It's pretty handy."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised as to how these were presented. The box has the look and feel of high quality and I liked the drawstring bag the glasses were in. The glasses themselves are really nice. I will update my review after the hubby wears them from sometime.
5.0,"Bought for my wife as a gift. She's bigger so this is more fitted on her, but hangs great on her. She loves that it has pockets and is lightweight without being see through. It has held up well after being washed and the stitching is of excellent quality."
5.0,Fits true to size and it‚Äôs very soft
5.0,These are so nice and lightweight and comfy. They make tha booty looküòâüòÇ
5.0,"It works great, as advertised on our Rolex."
5.0,Bought this for friend who loves Norte Dame. He loved it.
5.0,"Little one wanted a War Machine costume after I showed him the Marvel movies for the first time, this is a great accessory for that. It's sturdy for play while still being inexpensive. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"Love those shorts! They stay in place on my tights during high explosive jumps, they are high waist - so even when my shirt is flying they cover my body well:/)<br />I want another pair:)!!!!<br />They are well made , fabric is thicker- so I don't look &#34;naked&#34;! Huge plus !!! Worth the $$$."
5.0,This is an excellent design. It looks like I'm wearing regular sunglasses. It's also dark so great in bright sunny weather or in the snow. I wish it came in red/gold mirror. I'll buy these again
5.0,"It looks so nice with my Apple Watch series, it fit perfectly and doesn‚Äôt feel like cheap material."
5.0,"I love this bag. Its a good size, not too big or small and made well. It is not too shiny--in my opinion the photo does not do it justice. I may try to purchase the blue color in the future."
5.0,Great price. Item will turn heads looks like it is a very expensive bracelet .
5.0,"While this does feature baby yoda whom I love, I was a bit disappointed in this mask.  It is nice material but the material doesn‚Äôt breathe.  When you wear it, it‚Äôs hot and you breathe it in and out of your mouth no matter how you adjust it.  It is large that it covers extremely well but you feel like you are suffocating.  Also the design is a bit blurry like the ink ran a bit so it‚Äôs not clear and crisp.  Bit disappointed"
5.0,I rub them for good luck!
5.0,I love my copper bracelet.  I put it on when I got it and it has been on my wrist ever since.

5.0,I like this watch because it's simple. And does not distract others from my uniform (military). It also light on my wrist (which is great)
5.0,"If you can own only one pair of earrings, these are it.  Not too gaudy, always tasteful, and gold plated over sterling silver.  Just what I wanted.  I'm allergic to cheap earrings and get a nasty infection from them.  These I can insert and wear forever, sleeping and showering in them and waking up already dressed in jewelry.  These earrings will go with everything from jeans and a tee to a dinner dress for an evening out.  These are just perfect for my delicate skin and for wearing all the time.  Love them!"
5.0,Gave it to my Daughter as a present. She loved id
5.0,"Love this! I ordered a large, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 145lbs, So warm and perfect for my outfits! Enough to layer up underneath.  I was very skeptical about ordering this but I think it‚Äôs worth it. Thinking of maybe ordering other colors."

5.0,I bought this for my son & he loves it!
5.0,I ordered these for my FitBit Charge 4. I don't like the silicone bands it comes with. These are easy to put on and comfortable. Great price too.
5.0,well made glove/toy
5.0,The gloves are soft and not bulky. They fit nicely in my pockets. I wish it had like a storm sleeve in them cause at the wrist it is loose.  Overall they are very nice and you won‚Äôt be sorry. Also the touch screen feature works well.
5.0,Great Quality material arrived fast easy return when it came to needing to exchange for a different size
5.0,Love the adorable factor (3 yr old outgrew his old ones
5.0,I'm 150 lbs 5feet 4&#34; the large fits great I will be ordering the medium very soon awesome product
5.0,Very comfortable and great quality panties! Cotton underwear is the way to go for comfort and these are breathable and fits so well. Price is so competitive and the fact you get more for your buck make this a winning purchase! I've washed these 3 times and still look new! Quality material and definitely recommend these üíØ
5.0,I run a CoC campaign through a series of one shots and my boyfriend currently plays a Antiquarian named Basil who found/was given a washed up book that happens to contain texts about R'Lyeh and Cthulhu and I bought this for him as part of a gift because it fits his character fairly well and also as a bit of a clue for the gangs next one shot and I think he'll really like it because he's really been loving Basil :) For 6 dollars it's a steal and I am absolutely happy with it!
5.0,It's beautiful and comfortable. I've gotten so many compliments.
5.0,I was kinda worried these would be cheap since u get two for such a cheap price but they are lovely well made and a nice pink addition to my bracelet came in a cute pouch also and fast hassle free shipping. I also bought a higher priced bead from another seller I like these more.  I have looked at a lot of stores and on here for beads this is the best I have found for low cost way of adding to my bracelet. I will order more from this seller
5.0,Work great.. love them!
5.0,"The shirt was delivered extremely fast! The fabric quality is really good and soft. The print quality is also very professional. The only recommendation would be to have smaller sizes. Even the small size was fairly baggy on the 5'4"" recipient. But she tied it a bit and still loves it!"
5.0,"These are very pretty and exactly what I had expected to receive. They are large and are definitely &#34;statement&#34; earrings with lots of shine! They are a bit heavy for me, but I don't wear dangly earrings often at all so I'm probably just not used to them."
5.0,"Great quality and cute beach bag, perfect for Hello Kitty fans of any age!"

5.0,Love these pant. Most comfortable work pants I own.
5.0,"Very nice feel to it, but it's a bit clingy. I like my clothes loose for comfort now that I'm retired. How ever it's stretchy so I can loosen the fit. The shirt in the pic looks yellow, but the color is more a cream color. The weight is very good, but the sleeves are a little long, which some people like."
5.0,I am so happy with the fit and look of my new sandals. They fit perfectly and I have gotten many compliments on them. The price was amazing also.
5.0,I can only hope that the finish lasts a long time and that the crystals don‚Äôt fall out too quickly but upon receiving them my jaw is on the floor!
5.0,Love it  very cute n warm fits perfectly
5.0,"I gave it as a gift, and the recipient loves it!"
5.0,Pleased. Good utility belt.
5.0,"I ordered this bracelet to wear to a Christmas party. At first, I was a little apprehensive about the quality and if it was going to look like it did online. When I unwrapped the box I was surprised at how beautiful the bracelet is in person. The shine and sparkle are an added plus. I could also see how this would make a great gift for someone as well."
5.0,Size of purse and allowed compartment is perfect.
5.0,I'm not a tall guy but like to have my ties go all the down to my belt buckle and cover my fat stomach. This one does the trick quite nicely.
5.0,more than one makes ample noise to know where the critters are.<br />well made and durable.<br />very impressive for the price.<br />love em.
5.0,Everything fits! but i recommend you size up 1 or 2 sizes if your a bigger person like me. I usually wear a XL or 2X and I had to get a 3X and it fits very well. you should also size up if you have bigger boobs or it might be tight in that area. I also had to buy a seperate 'vision' peice (the seperate bought one is shown in the second image)  because the original one that came with it was kinda weird looking..but overall it's a pretty good price for what you get.
5.0,True to size and fits great
5.0,Works excellent
5.0,Loved it! Light weight yet keeps you warm
5.0,Such a good purchase! Doesn‚Äôt look or feel cheap!

5.0,Love love love these leggings! The quality and vibrancy of color is better thsn I was expecting and SO soft! I can't believe the price for this quality. I am ordering more!
5.0,Just the right fit for my 9 month‚Äôs old dome. A little snug but not too tight that it leaves impressions. Tight enough he can‚Äôt pull it off too easily.

5.0,"Interesting ring, I work in construction so I haven't wore my wedding ring for more then 40 years.  I was looking at all the rings on Amazon and most were half the price but looked cheap, but either way we are not talking about major money.  This ring stood out from the others and had a great return policy.  The ring came in 2 days as promised and the craftsmanship was great.  It was more then expected, there were NO mold marks like most silicon things.  I have a Black and Gray watch band for my Garmin so it matches.  I received a couple of emails form Eric the owner who wanted to make sure I received the ring and was happy.  I emailed him asking about future colors and ring sizes and he told me they are working on it and would let me know.  Looks like he is the owner of the molds and just not buying 3rd party junk.  Great company to work with and I do look forward to working with them again.  Take a chance for $10.00 more you could have something worth wearing."
5.0,Great looking rain boot on a budget! Unfortunately they ran a 1 full-size big for me and I returned.
5.0,Great looking dress!!!

5.0,I loved getting a cleaning cloth with it.
5.0,Adorable and very well done. Love this jewelry line.
5.0,This was super cute and kept me warm. I wish there was a snap or button in it to hold it closed but other than that it was very nice
5.0,Everything was just as the picture and size stated. I'm really happy with the purchase!
5.0,"I bought this black freshwater pearl for the versatility of having a necklace that could be worn with multiple outfits. I was actually amazed at the quality when it arrived. It was more than expected. The entire necklace actually has a decent weight from the pearls and as far as beauty, absolutely gorgeous. Each pearl is unique with it's own individuality.<br /><br />I'm more than happy with this necklace. Anyone looking for pearls with an affordable price that doesn't skip on quality should consider buying a necklace from this seller."
5.0,I occasionally lost the screw on ball for my existing labret ring and bought these just for that part. They screwed perfectly into the post I already had. Exactly what I expected and wanted. Great value for the price.
5.0,Really pretty!  And very versatile.  The only thing I am concerned about is how long the suede will hold up since I wear it mostly as a bracelet and it gets wet sometimes when I wash my hands.
5.0,husband said they are nice and soft
5.0,Production as described
5.0,"My daughter doesn‚Äôt like wearing dresses, but picked this one for our beach vacation pics. She loves it. It is very soft and comfortable and stays up even if the ties come untied. It also can double as a pool coverup. The only downside is that it does wrinkle easily, but nothing an extra fluff in the dryer can‚Äôt fix."
5.0,This seller was excellent to deal with. I will continue to buy these boot laces from him. I highly recommend.
5.0,"I bought this a gift for my daughter, who I turned into a Star Gate fan.  She loves it and wears it frequently.  It's very shiny.  As such, unless you really know what a star gate looks like, it's not obvious at a glance.  Thus my recommendation that there be some contrast in the coloration between the gate ring and the chevrons."
5.0,This is perfect for everyday carry.
5.0,Amazing dress. Wore this to a wedding and was comfortable all night! Super classy. Hides my large chest and made me feel confident‚ô° the arms are super comfy. Material is not constricting at all. Ironed the wrinkles out on the bottom and was good to go! LOVE LOVE this dress. I bought this with no pictures shown. Hope this helps!!
5.0,"Love the color and the style. Very soft, comfortable fit, exactly what I was expecting. Will be a perfect maternity dress with boots and leggings!"
5.0,Love the fit. Would buy again in other colors.
5.0,Fits so nicely and its soft and washes well.
5.0,My wife is a Ravenclaw.  So naturally she needed a scarf to wear outside the house on those nippy Chicago winter days.  This one is perfect!  She absolutely loves it and it is obvious why.  This scarf is beautiful.  It is very well made and thick enough to keep the cold out.  And with the added bonus that now everyone knows that she is a Ravenclaw.
5.0,Great Product!! Thank you very much!!
5.0,Purchased these gloves as a birthday gift just in time for some very cold weather.<br />These gloves are very warm and fit perfectly.<br />I would recommend these gloves.

5.0,"Soft, stretchy material and fits very nicely!"
5.0,These are so comfortable & smooth all of tbe right places!
5.0,Ordered these to wear under my dresses to avoid thigh rub and they are perfect. Good quality. They do run big. I ordered a large (normally I'm a size 10/12) and I'm now ordering a medium. I'll wear the large too but a medium will provide more support.
5.0,Liked very well
5.0,The wife finds it warm and comfy...as do our cats...
5.0,loved the detail
5.0,"I ordered these masks unsure of what I would be getting. I was pleasantly surprised a the quality. They are a heavy, pressed paper ‚Äî lightweight and smooth. The masks vary a bit in size, but all of them fit adult size faces."
5.0,"Love the fit on these jeans, sometimes frustrating they don‚Äôt have a size I need"
5.0,"I love this style so much I bought a 2nd pair:) I just returned from a trip to Europe - only brought this style and two other Birks - after miles and miles of cobblestone roads, my feet and my Birks are still in great condition - haven't lost any of the rhinestones and the walking conditions were less than ideal - GREAT shoes!"
5.0,"Very happy with this item, was perfect with my outfit."
5.0,"So far theses spray bottles are great. I just mixed up some tick repellent this week and this was a perfect size, easy to squeeze trigger."
5.0,"Great replacement lens! Thinner than original lens but, fit with no issues. Lens are clear nor distortion, performs good as originals."
5.0,"Very nice leather gloves, true to size.  They will certainly last and wear well."
5.0,Very good quality and material. Not see-through or too thick. Great for summer days.
5.0,"Perfect dress for an evening white party. I'm not a big fan of all white, so I went with this off white dress. This dress is very flattering and sexy. I love the stretchiness of the fabric. It can be paired with a cute pair of flats or heels. You can't go wrong with this dress. If they have it in black,,I  will order another."
5.0,Great gloves and great price! Very happy
5.0,"My daughter normally would wear a 10 (only cuz an 8 is slightly too small), so from the reviews I ordered a 11and it fit perfectly to compliment her dress."
5.0,Fantastic product fits great love the comfort
5.0,"Ok ladies here are the details! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù,230lbs, 40D, Apple shape size 18 jeans!  I have ordered this brand before in an XL and 2XL both were huge!! I ordered a Large! Still plenty of rear coverage but gives you some shape! Material is extremely soft and design is sassy! *Sorry I look so rough got home from a 7 hr road trip and just had to try it on!!"

5.0,"I am a guy and this is my first purchase of women‚Äôs panties...<br />I wasn‚Äôt sure what size I was and went with a Large...<br />Though they are very snug on me, I love the feel of them on me!<br />They are as described and I know I will purchase more in the future!<br />Very sexy panties!"
5.0,"I love it, it's so comfortable."
5.0,"I am a huge weirdo when it comes to organization of my keys. I carry 16 keys for work (two of which I need to keep on me at all times) that are extremely heavy. I've struggled for the past three years to come up with a system to make sure I have what I need when I need them without having to tote around everything (house keys, car keys, work keys, safe key...)  all the time. This was it.<br />I don't have to walk around with a huge carabiner with a pull tag sounding like a jail warden. This allows me the functionality I need, and it's cute and sleek."
5.0,"This pants are so comfortable and I love the lines on the pants. I got heather gray, and am gonna get another color."
5.0,My kids loved these charms! Got them as expected and pretty quick shipping!

5.0,"I seem to be having a problem with light sensitivity, ordered this mainly for driving, I am really pleased with the quick service, and the glasses  seem to work very well.  More than likely will get a spare pair."
5.0,"Love this hat! It looks good, and I especially like the olive color. Easy to fold up and carry in my pocket without getting all wrinkly. The bill is a really smart design because it folds but it's still rigid, which helps keep the sun out of my eyes. Just make sure you order the right size... There is no stretch to this hat at all."
5.0,Perfect for people who wear safety glasses and especially prescription safety glasses cause there's only so much fitting to those types of glasses that can be done by a optometrist or other glasses seller and these keep them on your face and don't hold sweat and get nasty like cloth ones. Highly recommend üëç
5.0,Beautiful coloring.  Very shiny and smooth.  Thank you :)
5.0,"Excellent quality! I've paid way more for less quality. I'm so picky - so if I'm impressed, it's actually because it's GREAT. lol"
5.0,This Crep shoe cleaner work amazingly and got out many stains.

5.0,Great patch!
5.0,Works great - can see all glasses - stores them so they don‚Äôt get scratched or dusty
5.0,I would like a smaller size in black if available?
5.0,This dress was perfect for our family pictures!!!!!!!! Everyone wants to buy one! Fits true to size!
5.0,These are my favorite sunglasses! I buy a new pair every six months. They are cheap enough to purchase that often. No expensive sunglasses are offered in this style. Totally worth the money everytime I order.
5.0,ONE OF my favorite pieces !
5.0,"Took several attempts but finally found slippers that give me great sheepskin inner comfort, support, great fit and the added bonus of having a degree of protection if worn outside. Highly recommend these"
5.0,"I love this bag! I love the color! It is a bit heavy, but the 360 rotating wheels make moving it from my office to my car very easy. It is really huge inside and can fit all my files and literature without killing my back and shoulder like a traditional briefcase."
5.0,"I bought this for my 2 yr old son. I wanted a hat that looked big boyish and not cartooney. It was a long search, but this hat did not disappoint!  It looks great on, is well made and fits fabulous! Tons of compliments but most of all my son loves to wear it!"
5.0,Fit my daughter perfectly and they're super cute! I'm looking into getting myself a matching pair tol! Lol. They're easy to clean and don't fall apart. For the price these are PERFECT
5.0,"Currently I need wrinkle free, easy care longer shirts, also enjoy the Kelly green/dot color."
5.0,This strap was perfect addition to my black back pack!  I got lots of compliments.
5.0,Cute fine
5.0,They are fantastic!!! I'm in love with this rings the bad thing is that I have to share them with my daughter lol
5.0,I was sketchy at first but the pictures are glossy and HD as stated and came in perfect state and before time. I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!
5.0,wife loved them !
5.0,Looks perfect on my wife.
5.0,These socks are durable and comfortable.  I wear them as part of my uniform and they hold up well to daily wear and wash.
5.0,Everything is fine so far
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to wash! I have a feeling we will be using these for a few years!üòï
5.0,"For the price and design (and speedy deliver), I can't be happier. I really love this ring. Even in its simplicity, it shines and shows off your finger decor like any other ring. Even if you're not engaged, buy it for the sake of having something nice to wear because it's just that lovely. The sizing is tricky and that's solely up to you. I purchased an 8 because 7.5 is hardly ever offered and a 7 is too snug for me. The 8 fits a little loosely on my ring finger, but it's not so bad that it falls off. Overall, I'm very pleased with this ring."
5.0,I like them. No complaints here. The blue stripes are a little lighter than the color on the picture.
5.0,The picture looks better in person and material does not feel cheap. I ordered a small but it looks like a Medium so i suggest ordering a size smaller. Maybe you guys should try having some x-small sizes as well. Over all happy with my order.
5.0,Comfortable and lightweight. Don‚Äôt break as easily as some do
5.0,I am 5'6&#34; 201lbs and I got the xl I have a small bust and a large bottom. This bathing suit it so comfortable. The tank fits perfect on the chest area. The details on the back are sexy enough for this sporty bathing suit. The blue color is not as bright but I'd prefer this blue anyways. The shorts fit me good the seams are tight so it doesnt roll up or down. The tank is long so it covers my belly in case I bend down to tend to my kids which is what I'm gonna be doing the whole time. I am gonna order another one in a different color. Hope this info helped.
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, great facial coverage, did not fly off in windy beach conditions, washed great in delicate cycle in garment bag."
5.0,These pants were surprisingly comfortable and just the right thickness to not look like leggings or make my legs hot. Will buy again.
5.0,This was a gift for a friend. She absolutely loved the necklace and it cheered her up. She loves owls and yoda and this was the best gift she can ever have.
5.0,Nice bag  using as tote when shopping
5.0,It‚Äôs better than the original
5.0,"Looks just like the movie version. Fits a little wide for my 6 year old, but he loves it."
5.0,Wife loves them and are not too big nor too small for her.
5.0,"I've been using it for a few weeks, everyday, as a tote, to and from work.  The inside has some open pockets on the side, convenient for small items, pens, etc.  The other side (interior), has a zippered pocket on the liner so small things don't get lost, but it also has a really nice zippered pouch that is built in, works great as a built in makeup bag!  The exterior pockets have nice seams and a snap (that I don't use), but the pockets are deep and follow the contour of the bag - perfect for keeping keys or a cell phone on the outside of the bag.  The straps are nice - either use the small handles for gripping, the medium handles for short shoulder or the extra long handle for carrying it messenger style.  The only improvement I could possibly see is making the interior liner a light color (it's black) so that small items don't disappear in the darkness of the cave.  A great, utilitarian bag!"
5.0,Cap was made very well.  The colors were bright and vibrant.  My grandson wouldn't take it off.
5.0,"Perfect hat to wear in Kansas City, 2021."
5.0,looks great confrontable and stylist.
5.0,"WoW!  I have been waiting a very long time for this necklace and now that I have it, it wildly exceeded by expectations. They are even prettier in person. Some have commented on a couple of quality issues, but I don't see it that way.  These are freshwater pearls and by nature they are imperfect.  The only thing that really surprised me was how light the blue color is .... very pastel. but I prefer it lighter so that's a bonus for me.  The chocolate color pearls are also lighter than pictured - they are more of a coppery/gold brown.  I can't wait to wear it out!<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that they are finally back in stock. I had this necklace, and another Chuvora slik thread necklace in my basket since the winter, waiting for spring to arrive. Then, just when  I went to order these, they have been out of stock for months.  So I took matters into my own hands and went directly to the company.  Same price as Amazon, but shipping was not free.  :-(.  For $25, you can't go wrong with these.  I'm going to get another color now, too!"
5.0,So cute and tiny. Love the fake little drawstring.
5.0,"Thought I was going to return this dress, but I was wrong!  I am 62 and this dress (with the right bra) is absolutely lovely.  Could not have asked for a better color, the drape of the skirt is delightful.  Thank you I will be keeping this little gem"
5.0,"Very cute,  my granddaughter loved it!"
5.0,"Got this for my brother for his birthday, he loves it"
5.0,dont have to wear a under shirt
5.0,Perfect size for a 7 year old
5.0,"Super cute and flattering style. Got loads of compliments. Doesnt really wrinole, so great travel dress. Not see through either. Has pockets that slightly are noticeable."
5.0,Very flattering and the material is amazing. Will be purchasing in more colors!
5.0,These are nice and stretchy tights and are perfect for ballet or just to wear with a skirt.  They seem to be very durable and  are easy to wash by placing them in a mesh bag and then into the washing machine.  I hang them up to dry.
5.0,Christmas gift she loved it
5.0,"Love this, very comfy & stylish. Nice fabric."
5.0,"This dress looked incredible, and it fit in all the right places.. I loved it!!!<br />The price was great, beats going to any store to buy a fancy dress."
5.0,"Bought this for my husband for our 3 year anniversary (year of leather) he loved it, perfect fit and great quality!"
5.0,"Fit better than expected!  I'm a 38ddd, got the 38dd, amazing sport,  looks pretty,  too!  I'm buying more!  Just what I need to support the girls while I work ot!"
5.0,I wore this as my vampire dress for Halloween and got a lot of compliments! It's definitely my new go to dress for something cute to wear out.
5.0,They dope asf üòàüòàüòà

5.0,My daughter loved it. Very unique
5.0,"Loved the print, made very good! My grandson loves it!"
5.0,"This was perfect! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù-5‚Äô10‚Äù, 220 pounds & ordered a 1X! It‚Äôs hard to find good length dresses. Fit right above my knee & was flowy - exactly what I was looking for! Would buy this again!"
5.0,I love my Order thank you so much
5.0,I got this bag for my husband and he loved it! The bag is good quality and it looks like so far has help up well. I would have expected a lower quality at this price and I was pleasantly surprised!
5.0,I'm a fan of these studs. I like the glossy shine of the silver and the round shape. These stay in my ears!
5.0,I bought these for my mom something easy that she can just slip on she's got dementia and putting clothes on can be difficult at times some especially with zippers and buttons these made things a lot easier they seem very soft not that I put them on. They seem to have stretch which is good and they seem to stay on her quite well
5.0,Absolutely adorable...I bought this dress for my niece for graduation pictures. It fit perfectly and has adorable pockets. I have received so many compliments on this dresw. Great material.
5.0,its clean simple modern and looks great in any room
5.0,My fiancee loves the necklace! Thank you so much!
5.0,I love how light and most of all comfortable they are.
5.0,Very happy still wearing it not enough time to be fair but for now am very impressed with this band and it holding up to everything I do with it.
5.0,Exactly like the one I lost.  Glad I replaced it with this purchase.
5.0,made a great book mark.  love it
5.0,These are well made and cleanly finished.  The lenses are amber and just right for darkness.  They are optically perfect as far as I can tell.  I like them and am satisfied with the value.  They fit easily and comfortably over my fairly large eyeglasses and the earpieces hold tightly enough to keep the sunglasses and regular glasses in place while riding a bicycle.
5.0,"Nice beads!  I wrap it four times and it's a snug fit, 3 times is too loose. I highly recommend."
5.0,Very complementary
5.0,"Love this !! I'm so happy I made this purchase, I absolutely love this item. Just as described in other reviews, the lace portion is very short so I added leather tights but the long cape really pulls this outfit together and it's so sexy. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a stand out piece"
5.0,Bought this for my daughter on her wedding day...she LOVES it and it turned out to be an amazing gift for a spectacular day.
5.0,These are so cute! The quality is superb and they super easy to unscrew.
5.0,Fits perfect...doesn't bunch in the armpits.
5.0,I need to carry a key with me most of the time and sometimes my pockets aren't the most secure (it falls out sometimes). This simple little thing has been the most comfortable way to keep the key on me. I just wear it around my wrist so I don't forget it.
5.0,"The dress arrived VERY quickly, well before the expected date. It was very nicely packaged with no damage to the exterior or to the dress itself.<br />This dress really surprised me, I did not expect the quality that arrived. I expected more of a casual light weight summer dress, instead, I got a beautiful dress that could be worn to a summer wedding or out to a casual dinner by changing my shoes. It could be worn year round by adding a long or short sleeve sweater.<br />It is a beautiful  chiffon type material that flows, and is lined so you don't need a slip or any other under garment. It fit perfectly, and the cut of the top sits nicely so it doesn't show off any belly imperfections, and sits perfectly on the shoulders. It also has a very cute keyhole under the button on the back.<br />I purchased this dress at a discounted price to test and review."
5.0,The material is very good muslin. Well made and exactly as they are shown.
5.0,"Very nice earrings. Good size, lovely finish. I like them very much"
5.0,"The accessories pack is really nice! I've purchased a lot of wigs over the last few years and I know a good one when I see one. I had to throw out my previous Kanna wig because it was shiny and you could see the cap through the wig fibers. Not the case with this wig. The fibers are soft, not shiny and relatively thick. You can't see the wig cap through the fibers and the colors are really nice. The fibers also lay well and don't get frizzy easily. I'd pay $30-$40 just for the wig. It's that nice. The fact that it comes with all the accessories is awesome. The horns are lightweight and made with EVA/craft foam so they're easy to damage but they look great if you keep them protected. Same with the beads that are supposed to go around the hair. The tail is really cute, but I wanted mine to stick out and not just hang down so I'm replacing the cord with a more sturdy wire. An under wig cap was included with the pack which is great because I'm always losing mine. Everything arrived faster than I expected and was packaged really well. Overall, extremely pleased with this purchase."
5.0,It fits my husband great he loves the feel and its warm. Perfect fit I recommend this item and seller<br />..
5.0,Both the chain and the crystal charm are very nice quality; price was good also.
5.0,I got this for my Fitbit Charge 3 as my band had worn out after almost 2 years. Great price and fit perfectly!
5.0,"Well made, exactly as described, and fits perfectly!"
5.0,Strong metal. Beer can fit perfectly
5.0,Fit well and comfortable on bridge of the nose.  Very helpful with night driving
5.0,"I have a few cardigans that do not have buttons or any way to keep them closed.  I have used cloak pins, but those sometimes come loose, and I've lost a couple.  This works perfectly.  The chain is a bit long for the purpose I had in mind.  I thought I was going to need to have the chain shortened.  I was very pleased to see that the jaw on the clip is deep enough that I can wrap the chain around it therefore shortening it, but leaving it long in case I want to use it that way.  And as others have mentioned, it is pretty and seems well made.  I'll try and upload a photo of it shortened."
5.0,"Cute shirt, just a bit too big!"
5.0,GREAT PIN TO WEAR ON YOUR LAPEL! GREAT QUALITY AND SERVICE!

5.0,These are some of the most comfortable boxer briefs ever. The pouch feels great and gives awesome support.
5.0,Love it I love all my beanie that I buy off Amazon
5.0,I'm 5'10 ordered a large. What I love about these skirts are that they're actually long enough. They actually go past the ankles!! Most of the time when I try to get long skirts they just stop at the ankles because they're not long enough. This skirt gives me the option to make it long or even short if I want to.
5.0,"I love this shirt, it fit's me just how I won't and looks grait."
5.0,"I work long hours as a nurse and my legs hurt at bedtime. I could tell a difference as soon as I put these socks on! They fit good and stay up all day! Awesome product, I highly recommend them!"
5.0,I love the they are really heavy duty which means the best do get them now best earrings I ever had
5.0,"Because it is modal fabric, buy a smaller size than you normally would for a bodycon fit.  It is long, almost to the knees, so be prepared to have it shortened for a club look."
5.0,I love these tops I ordered 3 and 1 has not arrived yet and I‚Äôm not thinking that it will but I hope so I ordered it for my birthday it fits perfect looks good with summer dresses I would Order it again  and I recommended to anyone who is thinking of buying.

5.0,It is a little expensive. But the item is awesome. I do a lot of cold weather hunting. Very warm soft and comfortable. Not sure I would pay this price for a base layer again. I got too and bottom almost$300. Little high for what it is.
5.0,"Just like the picture! Fits perfectly and is very cozy warm. Haven't had a chance to wash it yet but It's actually nicer than my cardigan from Croft & Barrow. Very happy with my purchase. I'm 5'4 ,115lbs."
5.0,I was surprized to learn this was buffalo bone and not fish bone. Other than that my son is sure to like it for christmas.

5.0,Best Ive ever used.<br />Ty
5.0,"I bought these for my rook and daith. They are perfect. They are a bit stiff, but I'm wondering if that's because they are so small. I'll be purchasing more to replace the others."

5.0,"I NEEDED SHER DRESS SOCKS AND THESE WHERE PERFECT! GOOD FIT AND DELIVERY FAST, GREAT PRICE$ FOR 10 PAIRS."

5.0,Old photo but I love the material and how soft it it
5.0,Fits oversized which is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôve gotten SO many compliments and i wear this interchangeably with my winter coat because it‚Äôs THAT warm. Best purchase and i will love to reccomend to everyone I know
5.0,love it a little long but I can fix that
5.0,This sun hat is perfect for my sun sensitive face. Really blocks out the sun.
5.0,My son absolutely loves this. And he makes a splash whenever he shows up wearing it! Definitely runs small... I‚Äôd recommend sizing up
5.0,"Everything quality wise was fine. The sizing was Euro sizing, I requested to return and the seller approved, no problem."

5.0,Great apple strap.
5.0,"A beautiful steel cable bracelet. This bracelet is inspired by those David Yurman cable style bracelets, which I happen to love. But I can't see spending that much money on a steel bracelet when I can get budget inspired looks for so much less. This bracelet is flexible and can fit many sized wrists. I have tiny wrists and I am able to squeeze it together to get a perfect fit. The bracelet is made of two outer solid steel rings and the inner ring is made of a solid steel metal mesh. I recently purchased a similar design of  twisted mesh cable bracelet, which is also found on Amazon, and I think they make a terrific pair. (as shown in my photo). 925 is stamped on the inside of the bracelet. The bracelet arrives in a black gift box. The lid of the box is printed &#34;Pop Fashion - Popular Fashion at the Lowest Prices Guaranteed&#34;. Very happy with this purchase, would definitely recommend for designer inspired jewelry. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Love this dress so much! It's soft, comfortable and looks amazing. The colors are true navy blue and the red flowers pop beautifully!"
5.0,"Great product, easy to install and good value."
5.0,Greatest sunglasses ever. They are lightweight and are wonderful at blocking out glare and bright light while allowing you to see clearly. I have worn them in the rain and I was able to see better due to the polarized lenses.You  should be paying $60 for these. So happy I bought two more pair.<br />Purchased Brown frames.
5.0,We bought 5 for our wedding for bridesmaid's it fit perfectly.
5.0,"They are fantastic, beautiful colors and effective!"
5.0,These are layering camisoles as they are stretchy but snug. They leave very little to the imagination.<br /><br />Other pros:<br /><br />- Fully adjustable straps<br />- Lace is not itchy<br />- Purple color is as shown<br />- White is as shown
5.0,I'm pleased...quality fabric....
5.0,"Doesn't feel thin or cheap. Feels expensive for a bargain price, win!"

5.0,Like the colors and comfort.
5.0,Very nice piece of religious jewelry at a great price. High quality and eye catching when warn.
5.0,"My son has to wear an AFO on one leg.  They are decent socks.  I wish they weren't so pricey, we only got one pair as the place that made his brace gave us a pair.  They do roll from the top down after some use, but we just fold his over his brace to avoid that."
5.0,Adorable! My granddaughter loves them!
5.0,"The material is very soft, and he T-shirt fits very well."
5.0,"I have such a hard time keeping socks on my toddlers feet and these pretty socks helped!! My daughter loves these socks and enjoys picking out the new ones each day (we got the larger pack). On a quality note- these are durable and the elastic works well, they don‚Äôt slip off. The lace is beautiful!"
5.0,"I love this tail so much! I slipped it on a belt and covered the back straps with a bow to hide them. Make sure to cut off the tag so it doesn't stick out while you are walking. I'm 5'1 and have to hold it to keep it from dragging on stairs, but it's not long enough to drag when walking flat."
5.0,"These masks are more sparkly than pictured. I love them, lightweight but comfortable to wear all day, I get a lot of compliments, I will order more in the future"
5.0,Gifted to my wife on Valentine. This is one of my fav brand.<br />Loved this one
5.0,"Fabulous under tights, I wear them over and over again...wash very well."
5.0,My wife üòç ‚ô•
5.0,This is unexpectedly beautiful!
5.0,Fun piece.  Use for those blouses that are too low cut.
5.0,"This is my second time purchasing this ring. The first one snapped right in half -- the back of the right is really flimsy as far as metal goes, but I'm hoping that if i don't bend/reshape it so much maybe i won't have the same problem :/ If it breaks again, i'll have to look for a different solution."
5.0,I absolutely love my shades! They are well made and really look good
5.0,"installed front hitch on vehicle it cased a whistling sound ,  this cover stopped the whistle completely.  Stays on during car wash it is a dream"
5.0,Super cute and fits perfect.
5.0,Gorgeous shine & quality! These earrings are light-weight and beautiful! Excellent price too!
5.0,Gift for grandsons birthday
5.0,Great fit !!
5.0,I love these! Designs are fun and bright. Bandanas are soft and absorbent. Great value! Will order again!
5.0,Great price.  Mom is in a nursing home and is always cold.  She absolutely loves these slipper socks! I am buying more for her.
5.0,Very long! Looks adorable on my 12 year old who is about 5‚Äô1‚Äù.
5.0,"First of all, adorable!!! I look sooooo cute with these amazing earrings and I‚Äôm super sensitive with certain materials but this one is good."
5.0,This is perfect lightweight sweater for layering. It's soft and very fine gauge knitted material. Vneck is flattering and makes my neck look longer. The white is clean and quite sharp looking.
5.0,"Very nice, received excellent compliments."
5.0,"The detail in this bead is amazing!!!!  Very nice high quality!  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Very delicate design, but also looks like it will hold up to wear and tear."
5.0,"These PJs are nice and comfy.  The bottoms aren't quite as tight as they appear to be in the product photo, but I was hoping that was the case. They are tapered nicely (my preferred PJ bottoms and pants style), and the ankle part fits snug if pulled up to the knees on warm/hot weather nights.  The top is large, but not too large to appear overly large when worn."
5.0,I work in corrections and use this clear purse. It is very sturdy.
5.0,I needed help to put it on. I'm 45 at 300 lbs I got a 5xl
5.0,"WOW  great material, soft and light but good quality ... color as expected from image shown"
5.0,I wore a black crenlyn skirt under this dress and people couldn't get enough of it! So unique! All ages adored it.
5.0,"This is probably the nicest flannel shirt that I have ever bought for my husband. After washing it, it looked new. No ironing needed. As I said it is perfect."
5.0,Colors are bright and has held up very well! For the price it's a great deal!
5.0,I'm so glad I read the reviews about the size. I followed everyone's advice and it fit perfectly. FYI- I'm 5'2&#34; cup size 36D. I ordered a size XXL and it fit me perfectly. I ordered the navy blue and I'm about to order a different color. Definitely recommend!
5.0,excellent product was what I imagined
5.0,Very pretty and perfect for the small charm pendant I needed it for.
5.0,"Absolutely loved this dress. I am 30 weeks pregnant, got the XXL. But totally could have gotten the XL, it has a lot of stretch to it. The arms were big, and wouldn't stay up. Other than that, loved it so much!"
5.0,"I usually wear medium tops, but I gained some weight so I ordered up. These fit and are fitted. No guessing what‚Äôs underneath üò≤ I think I‚Äôm going to send back for a larger size because the material is right"
5.0,"good quality, perfect size, fits well on most purses,room enough to carry cosmetics, eye glasses,keys, a wallet and credit cards.  I love it!"
5.0,Stunning and UNIQUE !
5.0,Was able to provide warmth and comfort
5.0,I love this dress and will order it again in a different color.
5.0,Fit very well. I usually buy large or XL and these XL fit very well without being overly tight. I bought two sets. Would not hesitate to buy again or recommend.
5.0,"Nice, sturdy, beautiful crossbody bag. Construction is strong which makes it durable. Small enough, but also large enough to hold all of my personal carry along's. I love it."
5.0,Need to wear a tank underneath. A little shear
5.0,I got this mask for my 1st grader.  I knew she had to wear a mask at school and figured this would be easier for her to keep up with than a mask that hooks around your ears.  I thought about her not being able to keep up with a removable mask or it ending up on the floor or being left somewhere.  This works so much better.  It stays around her neck all day and she just pulls it up when she needs it.  It's lightweight and has cute designs.  I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0,I have alot of wallets like this and i love them all.
5.0,Love it good quality and nice saying
5.0,Looks as picture does. No misprints. It is a gift so unsure of quality or fit.
5.0,"Well made! My son LOVES IT! Make sure you check the sizing info, and allow enough room for if you wear heavy clothes under it. But my son is extremely happy!"
5.0,It came way earlier than the expected delivery date. It's super cute. This jewel doesn't irritate my skin at all.
5.0,Although it is too small... i love it!!! I order L for one of my bridemaids and it's like a small on me. BUT the texture and the laze... LOVE IT!!
5.0,"The reviews said that this top ran small, so I ordered a 2XL. Normally, I take a large. The reviews also said that it was way too small, & couldn‚Äôt get it on. I didn‚Äôt have this problem. It is very well made, & looks very professional. I wear it for work."
5.0,GREAT gloves easy to wear
5.0,Have not used it yet for water aerobics and swimming.
5.0,"Had read previous reviews that these run small so ordered accordingly and they fit perfectly.  Snug, warm, and cozy. Love them!"
5.0,"I bought this dress because I have a late spring wedding and we all know that you never wear it more than once, so I didn't want to spend a lot.  The minute I took it out of the bag I was happy!  I ordered within my size range and it is perfect.  The color is a touch deeper than the photo but that is not a problem. The only issue I have is that I am short (4'10"") so the sleeves are really long, but it will be worth it to me to have them shortened.  I am considering getting another in a dark color as a just in case for other occasions.  Love this dress!"
5.0,Wore on the beach and it was stunning!
5.0,"Great sunglasses, If you like large aviators, you‚Äôll love these. I lose my sunglasses often so I don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on them. As a bonus they are not too dark so you can see in tunnels or when it‚Äôs a windy day and need them to protect your eyes from the wind as my eyes tear up badly."
5.0,So far holding up very well. No tarnish. Get lots of compliments. Bought second one as a gift.
5.0,"I do a lot of walking  and hiking and was looking for socks that were comfortable and with a little bit of cushion.  These fit my needs perfectly. While they are a little pricey, they‚Äôre American made and worth every penny in my book. Will definitely buy more of these."
5.0,Got for a rabbit show. Not best but not worst. Held up thru the show. Runs small
5.0,This is my 2nd watch band from this company. They're great! Easy to install...even comes with the tool to remove the old band.
5.0,I was looking for a leopard print mask for my wife and chose this one. She loves it! She says it is very comfortable and easy to breath. Highly recommend!
5.0,I love my shield I get so many compliments when I wear this at work I bought another one this is definitely worth the money
5.0,Simply beautiful!!!!!! Love these necklaces!!
5.0,This was a beautiful dress. My daughter has a muscular back so it was a bit tight in the lateral area. It‚Äôs a nice dress to wear out to a dance or play. Very welcome to anyone who purchases this product. Great material and the ruffles are fluffy. Thank you.
5.0,I love these pants. I have them in two colors.
5.0,This dress is super flattering. I love the buttons and the elastic waist. It‚Äôs a thicker material which is nice. Fits true to size!
5.0,Great product!  Little things can make life so much better.  I drive 3 different vehicles each week but don't want to carry 3 sets of keys & this thing is so much easier to change keys that with a normal key ring.  I've only used it a couple of months but it seems sturdy enough.<br />The company was great to work with also when I ordered a 2 pack but only received one key ring.  They were quick to give me a complete refund & I reordered with them.
5.0,"It seems pretty,but a little to dainty for the ankle should be more sturdy and bigger"
5.0,Good looking shoes
5.0,"I love these leggings!!<br />I own many pairs of lululemon, and these are up to par with their softness and flattering fit. These are squat proof and offer the right amount of compression. If you‚Äôve looked up other dupes, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen colorful koala leggings. I like this pair way more than the multiple pairs of colorful koalas I own!<br />If you‚Äôre on the fence about ordering a pair - do it!<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 5‚Äù, 124 lbs and I got a small. I probably could‚Äôve done an XS however I‚Äôm not sure how they would fit (ahem, camel toe).<br />I really hope this company decides to make more colors!"
5.0,"Needed to replace a band on my Fossil watch. It‚Äôs made of a rubber material and very durable, bought several other colors as the price was very good. Easy to replace because tools are provided to change the bands out. Like the ability to change out the band to coordinate with my outfit."
5.0,These are great to go workout in.
5.0,"Loved this, out of all the pants I ordered, this turned out to be the best one"
5.0,She LOVES them. One of the best gifts. Now the kids want a pair. I can't find them in their size.
5.0,Lucen de muy buena calidad y durabilidad. Me encanta el dise√±o.
5.0,"Very pretty, fits well, the material is good"
5.0,I had purchased a pair of these from the mall in the beige color and loved them so I decided to purchase a pair on black and then I couldn't find them anywhere. Thankfully I was able to find them on amazon. They are super comfy and look great. I am not a girl who wears heels often but these are really comfy and cute. Highly recommend!
5.0,"Husband loves it, pretty much the only belt he wears r s now"
5.0,"This leather jacket is soft, smoothe a beautiful.  Looks great on my husband."
5.0,I love it so much and all my friends as well.
5.0,It looks exactly like on the picture. Just follow the sizing instructions.
5.0,Love it.  Lots of complements
5.0,Nice and small but holds as much as my old Giant wallet did
5.0,My wife loves these little watches and they keep great time.
5.0,Fits well. Will buy again.
5.0,Super pretty but runs really small and mine was a bit snug but I have a daughter that this will fit and she loved it too so I will gift it!
5.0,These sandals are so perfect for Easter and Dresses!
5.0,Comfortable to wear for working.
5.0,"These are great little socks. Flip flop wearers whose feet get cold will love them. I don't wear flip-flops much as I have feet ""issues""--these socks help separate my big toe from its neighbors! Now if the manufacturer will design a pair with a little extra padding for the ball of the foot, my tootsies would be in heaven. As is, these socks are great, they're a pretty color as shown, and it's a nice pattern; it reminds me of Asian silk art."
5.0,Loved them! Beautiful
5.0,"Great mask. Fits my lovely wife much better than myself, in other words, they are small'ish."
5.0,"I have not actually worn this yet for an extended period, but the fabric, colors and fit are great.  I can't wait to wear it on the beach!"
5.0,"Great design, nice colors and fits great as you wear it few times. Great materials. 5 stars for this brand product. Like very much!"
5.0,Any kid who plays fortnite we‚Äôll love this shirt.
5.0,"Love these! They seem to run just slightly big which is honestly great for how quickly kids go. Great quality, especially for the price."
5.0,"I bought these for my toddler son, and they work great!  I was able to try them on to check them out, and he actually wore them which is a minor miracle.  They have a great fit and the earmuffs are pretty comfortable.  We went to a shooting event and ear protection was a must.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for ear protection for young children."
5.0,I love this little ring. If you love dogs like I do. Get it!
5.0,"I liked the color of this robe and was pleased when it arrived. It's not cotton, but it it is lightweight and soft. It feels smooth wearing it. I like the length, it's not super long. The belt is easy to tie and it did a decent job of keeping the robe closed, however usually when I woke up the robe would not be closed, so if decency is very important you'd want to wear a shirt underneath."
5.0,The quality looks very good. Haven't worn and washed yet.
5.0,"Love the way it fits and feels... Just wish it was a little longer cause I'm tall, I'll definitely make it look good thou"
5.0,"These are amazing! They have a rubber sole, so they provide great stability for early walkers. The open toe, while still having the moccasin stretch, make it a great option for taller/wider footed babies during warmer days. My daughter doesn't fit in most standard sandals because her feet are so short, but also really chunky. These are perfect for her.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product. I never guarantee positive reviews."
5.0,Absolutely love this band!
5.0,I liked the color variation and the snug fit.
5.0,Walking and exercising
5.0,I like them they look good on me üòÄüòÄ
5.0,Muy parecido al original.
5.0,"Very feminine and pretty.  It looked exactly like I thought it would.  I gave it as a gift and the recipient seemed to like it, as I bought it to go with a specific outfit she had."
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! Good quality, true to size. They keep their shape very well!"
5.0,"so far so good...i like the styling of the frames and the glare-resistance is why I purchased these glasses...a larger size would be nice, but this is ok for most people..."
5.0,I LOVE THIS SHIRT. It‚Äôs very flattering and looks like the photo on me. Comfortable and cute
5.0,A perfect fit! AAA +++
5.0,Jazz up your Apple Watch. Save time and frustration.  Take it to a jeweler to have links removed.
5.0,Looks great and fits so well!
5.0,"I purchased this for a long weekend getaway. It was all I wanted and more. This is sturdy and large enough for five days worth of clothing, shoes, a jacket, and essentials. The bottom is impact and tear proof. The seams are made of tough stuff. I love the wheels and the adjustable handle. A tall person or a child can pull this behind. I have the eBags backpack and am very pleased that I purchased this and I will use it at every opportunity."
5.0,Love my top:) Thank you so much!
5.0,"This shirt is very comfortable. I read the reviews and purchased a size larger than I normally wear, therefore it fits!  Thank you to those reviewers.  I have no negative comments. I hope I can say the same after laundering the blouses.  Thank you."
5.0,"I have this in three colors, and they are beautiful! I wear an 18 in my clothes, usually, just for size reference. I wear a tank dress underneath and it looks awesome!"
5.0,Bought for daughter and she loves them.
5.0,"These are nickel size. Not tiny like studs The stones are vibrant. They cam tightly packaged with a white gift box and a cleaning cloth. The back of the earrings has an open weave design that lets the light flow through the stones. They are not thin and flimsy. Will look great with a high ponytail or high bun style. I don't know why or if it matters, but the posts are really long. The earrings came with a second package of clear plastic stoppers, so now I know what those are for."
5.0,"Great material and looks wonderful on. True to size, which with kids clothes is really hard to come by!"
5.0,"OMG I LOVE THIS RING! I get soo many compliments on it. I've been wearing it daily for months now, and it's still in perfect condition. Its a really quality product for the price, and I'm thrilled with it."
5.0,Bought a set for my 5 year old daughter and one for her friend‚Äôs bday! they both love them! They wear them all day üòÜ
5.0,Got for grandson and he put it on as soon as he unwrapped it! Looks really good on!
5.0,"These are so comfortable and well made. They are very soft and don't stick to my skin like some bands do. This is such a great value. The set includes every color you could ever want! My friend and I split the set because there were colors I wouldn't wear that she loves and vice versa. Seriously, just buy them and you will never need to buy another band."
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift for by Brother In Law, who likes to golf. I love the green color and hope he will too as my sister said that he did not have a shirt this shade of green. I think bright colors look great on the golf course and also accentuate eye color and skin tone. This color looks great with all hair colors and skin tones. The color was true to what is shown in the picture and it shipped very fast. I think the material will wash very well. He does not like pockets on his golf shirts, so this was perfect. We purchase a lot of Nike products because the quality is exceptional. The price was great as the tag said $45 when it arrived, but I paid $34. We never put this type of material in the dryer and they never shrink, wrinkle or fade. The style is very nice. There are 3 buttons. I think this shirt would also look great with a long sleeved shirt underneath for casual wear in the winter or St. Patrick's Day!"
5.0,My 4 year old daughter loves these glasses. They fit her perfect and are adorable!!
5.0,This is perfect! When my hands are full I‚Äôm able to slide this on my wrist and not worry about dropping anything! It‚Äôs also really cute and easy to find in my purse! Getting my daughters some so I can stop having to help them look for their keys!

5.0,Cute readers!
5.0,Little thicker than thought but love it.
5.0,Great value and style. I will purchase again.
5.0,"My first review on this product I gave it 4 stars because when I first got it, my cards wouldn't fit into the card slots.. I've come to realize it was only because it was new. I had to break in the material, so now that it has been awhile having it, the card slots are more loose and my cards fit perfectly. But my dislike of the ID slot still stands.. The area around the ID slot covers my information and part of my picture so when I'm asked my ID, I have to take it out of my wallet every single time -.- not kool. Other than that, the wallet's a good buy!"
5.0,A fine product with excellent customer service. I will keep this company in mind for future needs.
5.0,"Wonderful and amazing. Looks great altogether, looks good even alone. LOVE IT!"

5.0,"me encanto, practico, el tama√±o y material exelente"
5.0,Second time buying these glasses and like them. I know even use these as my normal sunglasses
5.0,"Gorgeous necklaces! This was bought as a Valentine's gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it. There are other places on Amazon I've seen these being sold and I wouldn't recommend buying from them. This was definitely worth the purchase,  the engraving is good, it got here days earlier than I was expecting and they don't look or feel cheap. The chain is a bit short and I don't like the specific type of chain it comes on personally, so I just switched it to another one when I got here. It's a gorgeous necklace set, definitely worth your money."
5.0,"Past the one wash and fall asleep in it test, success!"
5.0,"I LOVE this outfit. I will say if you have longer arms, expect for the hoodie to not stop AT your wrists. But it‚Äôs still cute. Wore bracelets and a shirt to off set the sleeves.<br /><br />The pants fit over my hips and not at my hips which is flattering.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 150, usually wear a medium and ordered a medium."
5.0,"Great fabric and nice fit. I am probably a medium but ordered a large so it would cover my chin better. The adjustable ear loops are great! They wash up nicely, too!"
5.0,good quality...wasn't sure what to expect from the picture
5.0,Love it! Will be wearing at pride weekend in Palm Springs come November! Thanks!
5.0,This is now one of my favorite necklaces and I have quite a few.  The length is perfect.<br />Quality made too.<br />I love it so much that I have earmarked it to remember to consider it as Christmas gifts this year.<br />Highly recommended.
5.0,I bought these gloves to play a game with my grandson who is 3 years old. I put them on and chase him around the room pretending to be a monster getting him. He puts on the other set of gloves and then we have a monster fight‚Ä¶ ha ha great fun‚Ä¶
5.0,"I was hesitant to purchase another dress online but I am so happy I did.  This dress is flattering and comfortable, perfect for the summer weather we have been having.  Added plus is the pockets!"
5.0,absolutely love them. excellent quality for the price and they look very sharp. one size fits all. highly recommended. excellent seller :)
5.0,I‚Äôm a size XL but i order L and it fits perfectly..I just love it..great product.
5.0,"Perfect size, color and texture to hold my reading glasses safely in my purse.  Love these."
5.0,"Awesome, you can adjust the size for a secure hold."
5.0,I love this necklace!  It is beautiful and comfortable.
5.0,"Wool, well made perfect for cold weather"
5.0,I absolutely love this wallet! I always have issues with carrying a purse but this makes it so much easier with the ring. I'm also a sucker for leopard print so that's a plus!
5.0,There are nice
5.0,The fitting was just right thank you
5.0,"Just perfect, my daughter's favorite shoes. Love that the toe strap can be adjusted as well, good quality."
5.0,Well made does not feel cheap or look like a halloween costume. Well worth the price. Will be using it for a photo shoot for my wedding save the dates.
5.0,"Super comfortable, like walking on some clouds."
5.0,REALY LIKE THEM
5.0,"These are LOVELY socks, the color is true to the picture.  These 2 pair are the first I have ordered of the SLS3 brand.  They seemed very tight across the foot when I first put them on then as I wore them they became very comfortable and I didn't want to take them off.  I REALLY like them.  These ARE compression stocking, and therefore hard to put on, as are all true compression stockings are. I ordered them a bit large in that my size is at the beginning of the size range and I think that helped. I also have skinny legs.  So please keep this in mind if you order. There are videos on YouTube that show you how to put them on properly and make it a little bit easier.<br /><br />I saw some reviews of people complaining of a long foot and long leg.  With compression socks you place them where they should be and then smooth out the extra fabric.  Don't pull them up to your thigh, their meant to go high on the calf and just below the back crease of your knee.  Same with the foot, set the heel and toe to the proper place then smooth the sock into place and you will be very happy with them."
5.0,I love these Bermuda shorts. They fit perfectly and the color is beautiful! Very lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,ADORABLE AND SO COMFY AND FLUFFY
5.0,"If you are a fan of Gwen from League of Legends and want to cosplay her, I would recommend purchasing from here, and since their prime, it makes things easier.<br /><br />Some notable information<br /><br />I ordered an M, Returned it cause received a 2XL in the mail and was drowning in it. So after a while, I ordered a Large. It fits me but the arm/shoulder sections were a bit too tight for my liking. Finally, I settle on an XL.<br /><br />My body sizing for reference is 5'3 ft in height, 36 In Bust, 30 In the waist, 38 in Hips, shoulder width: 15 In, Thigh Circumference:  20 in, and so on.<br /><br />Pros<br />- The outfit and some of the accessories are made of high-quality fabric.<br />- It arrives quickly and since it is prime if the outfit doesn't fit can be easily returned.<br />- It's a bit loose around the waist area so, it is comfortable to move in and I don't feel as restricted<br />- There is a zipper in the back, and it is pretty easy to get on by yourself at least for me it was.<br />- This outfit comes packaged extremely securely and came with a box inside a box that was taped up on every side.<br />- The Socks, go up to my thighs and fit, there is not the squeeze tight kinda fit, no there is the comfy fit which is a rare bonus.<br /><br />Cons<br />- The black fabric under is a bit itchy on my skin, so if you got sensitive skin like myself wear something under it like a cami to help.<br />- The Material is a bit heavy so be cautious if you are wearing this to an Anime convention during the summertime when it gets hot.<br />- The bows are crooked<br />- The arms/shoulders are still a tad tight but nothing too major so it is easier to deal with.<br />- The gloves are strange in size, they're a bit small width-wise, luckily I got small hands, but the fingers are way too long so I plan to turn them into fingerless gloves.<br /><br />Overall rating; 7 out of 10.<br /><br />The outfit is good for the price, could use a bit of improvement on some factors but besides that, it seems worth it, and I can't wait to wear it this July for Anime Expo.<br /><br />Please note these photos were taken under dull fluorescent indoor lighting, and look much better, and brighter in outdoor lighting."
5.0,Used the glasses for a more clean and sophisticated look.
5.0,They look amazing and light weight and love the style and come in a cute case
5.0,Great album
5.0,"Simply put, it does what it says it's supposed to."
5.0,"As crazy as this may sound, I never knew I could love a sports bra so much! It's perfect! I can finally run without feeling parnoid!"
5.0,This dress far exceeded my expectation! So pleased I purchased another color to add to my collection!
5.0,Without a doubt these are the BEST sunglasses I've ever owned. The quality of these glasses are outstanding. I've owned $300 Ray Bans and I will never do that again. In the future I will ONLY by my sunglasses from SUNGAIT. As a matter of fact I now own 3 different pairs of sunglasses from SUNGAIT. They are all different styles and I get compliments on each pair I wear. I can promise you this when you buy these glasses you will NOT be disappointed. The only issue I have with these is the frame gets really hot in a hot car. So I need to let them cool down a bit before I put them on. I only have this issue because I'm bald. I'm sure someone with hair this wouldn't be an issue with this.
5.0,"Excellent design, well made, love the large zippered comparments."
5.0,It fit exactly like I wanted and the color was exactly like the picture great pj set!
5.0,"Product as described, works well and fast shipping."

5.0,Excellent with softness.
5.0,I like this product because it's more sturdy then a lot of other umbrellas
5.0,I really  like these shoes.....very comfortable.
5.0,I wore these to an outdoor wedding and received appreciative comments all day. They are extremely reflective and look a lot classier than the typical colored rim heart-shaped sunglasses.
5.0,"Beautiful dress! Ordered this for my holiday party after sending two different dresses back. This dress fits well, but would be more flattering on larger chested women. 5'6"" 32dd, 135 lbs and got a medium. Fit perfectly. It's a very forgiving style so you can dance without worrying your dress will expose anything."
5.0,They must run small.  My Son usually wears a 2X but got these in a 3X due to the size chart.  He really likes then.  They're roomy and comfortable.  He ordered a 2nd pr. and intends to get a different color.
5.0,Dressy sweater appropriate for office attire. Packs without wrinkling. I bought one size up and the fit was perfect.
5.0,Me agrado por que no tengo que atar los cordones y asi son comodos para quitar y poner
5.0,Love the colors and how they fit on my grandsons feet.
5.0,Lovely coat ...you can't really top a London Fog after all but this was too big for me and the weight of it felt heavy on my shoulders so I returned it.
5.0,Cute & Durable
5.0,This is my favorite holiday sweat shirt. I got so many compliments on it when I wore it during the holidays. This is definitely a shirt that I cannot wait to wear this year. The fit was great and it did not fade in the washer.
5.0,I chose the rating because the earrings I picked were gorgeous! I have told family and friends! I would love to give them as a gift.
5.0,They work great I have used them for a couple of months already and still have a good grip on the bar. This is a lot better then having to hold and slide out the spring clamps that came with my weight set. Plus the color looks awesome.
5.0,Love itü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
5.0,Absolutely beautiful necklace. I have gotten many compliments on this necklace
5.0,Love this necklace!  I wear it nearly all the time!
5.0,"They feel a little lighter and less sturdy than name brand glasses, but they look more expensive than they are.  My husband was very happy with them.  I must say I really like how they look on him.  This is a universal style that would look nice on most face shapes. He was looking for a pair of cheap polarized glasses and this was a great find."
5.0,"Beautiful purse! Looks gorgeous in the grey, and it is very roomy! I needed a bigger purse but still wanted it to look structured and cute. This was exactly what I needed and the price was good!"
5.0,So cute! Bought it for the girls for a talent show!
5.0,"Me gusta el tono es igual a la imagen , me gusta el pelo de la capucha se ve hermoso"
5.0,"I got this gym bag for my son and he really likes it, he can put his shoes in the shoe compartment and take it with him to the gym. it's convenient because of the size makes it really easy to carry"
5.0,Stopped my trigger fingers....got different colors so they don't stand out too much.
5.0,"Best gift ever, came fast, wonderful quality"
5.0,"Very warm, fits well , good for winter"
5.0,"Actually saw a pair of Stance socks in a different color for boys, at a specialty store in the mall and thought they looked so cool.  However, they did not carry any kids size medium.  I found these online for my daughter and she loves them!  I bought her a few pairs in different designs and some for me and my son as well.  Love the cool and unique designs!  This particular pair are thick and well made quality socks!  The material is soft and comfortable, but sturdy enough to last.  The colors are true to the picture displayed online and the fit is as expected and maybe slightly with room to grow, although my daughter is petite.  I bought the kids girl's size med as she is currently wearing a kids 11.5 shoes size for reference.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"Ordered this band based on reviews and I‚Äôm so happy I did. It‚Äôs a beautiful band, durable and comfortable. Exactly what I was wanting. Plan on getting more colors."
5.0,super cute great quality fast shipping. got many compliments
5.0,A little lighter material than I thought. Good fit and appearance though. Overall very happy with it.
5.0,These are so cute and fun!<br />The poop is my sons favorite!!!
5.0,This is a great set. I get tons of compliments on the earrings and the necklace is great by itself or to layer with other necklaces.
5.0,"This product is beyond adorable! Looks exactly like the picture. My 2 year old is going to love it (giving it to him this weekend for his birthday)! We are going on a cruise, & the size will be perfect for all his clothes & toiletries. The back back is a nice addition & will be able to fit all his snacks & books."
5.0,Beautiful. Perfect for my daughter in law.
5.0,Very nice looks great on get a lot of nice comments when it‚Äôs worn
5.0,"Looks great, fits great, love the pockets! Great colors and well stitched too - all winter didn't loose a stitch!"
5.0,"Better than a Kavu bag! I bought this bag to match my winter jacket and it is so much better made than I thought. It also has so many more pockets than my other $60 kavu sling bags. Didnt realize it had a usb cord and port until I was going through all the pockets! Love the extra touches like the rings on front, the hook inside the front pocket for my keys the side pocket for my phone and the bonus pocket on the shoulder strap! Well done! Please make this bag in more designs and colors. I have a different sling bag for every season/holiday and would love to see more from this company!!!"
5.0,Suite cute dress for all body types.
5.0,"This is a very unique necklace, the color is very beautiful, it can match many clothes"
5.0,"I'm very happy with this fanny pack! There are a lot of packs to pick from on Amazon, but this one seemed to have the most bang for the buck: well-made, heavy duty water resistant fabric, lots of secure zippered pockets and sporty-stylish (not lumpy-frumpy.)  I don't know if I'll use the little hole made for your headphone wire, but it is a nice touch."
5.0,They are perfect... loved them...
5.0,"Great quality. Fits just right, you might want to get one size up to have a little room."
5.0,Great quality ties for an amazing price. The light blue tie has made heads turn and have gotten many of compliments on them. If your standard knot doesn't look great when done try another style. My go way to tie a tie didn't impress so I changed it up and bailed the look I was going for the first time
5.0,Good purchase.  I sized up for a more loose comfortable fit.  I feel if I had ordered my actual size based on the size chart it would have been a bit more fitted.
5.0,Bought it for my Granddaughter and she loves it... It is made very well and the pearls really make it beautiful.
5.0,"This is a stunning dress for the price. I needed a floor length gown for a Mardi Gras ball ASAP and with prime had this one in two days. I wasn't expecting how well made it is, and how gorgeous the blue is in person. It's one of the comfiest dresses I've ever worn which isn't something I often say about outfits for formal events.<br />Will be reordering another color or two."
5.0,Very nice expandable belt. Classy looks.
5.0,"These are the only mittens that stand up to a Minnesota winter. They stay on, my kids hands are warm and dry. Family recommended them they are worth every penny"
5.0,Super cute and great quality- my toddlers loved them ! True to size
5.0,"Socks fit very well. Glad purchase was made, feel very good while running. Ran 5k for the first time and could tell the difference."
5.0,I decided to wear dresses all the time and I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It's well made and stretchy. I usually wear and XL but decided to go up a size just to ale sure it would fit and it does. I'm 5' and it comes just below the knees. It's comfortableand I love the feel of the material.
5.0,"Gorgeous dress, beautiful neckline"
5.0,Functional and feels right.
5.0,Very cute cover up
5.0,"Wallets are nearly a dime a dozen, and it seems that those with impractical designs prevail. I want 1) many card slots, 2) decent quality leather, 3) a coin Pocket on the outside, 4) small enough to fit into a jacket pocket without sticking out but 5) not as small as a typical trifold, 6) RFID blocking, and 7) not ugly. This does it all, and after years of wishful thinking, my search is over. My new wallet came yesterday, everything has been transferred from my ugly nylon wallet that is of a similar design as this one, and my old one is being relegated to my vacation-in-Mexico wallet."
5.0,This product is excellent. The one drawback is it distorts my vision. I get frequent headaches from wearing these sunshades.
5.0,Loving this watch for the price! Straps are very cheap and will eventually break over time. Keeping time perfectly so far.
5.0,Love Love! Perfect for my tragus piercing!
5.0,Ame este conjunto
5.0,Now I feel like Amphrite! Posidons wife :P Greek seagoddess
5.0,my 23 year old son loves to photo bomb...this is perfect and TOO FUNNY! everyone gets a kick out of it! 50/50 cot/poly...true to sizing and shouldn't shrink much!
5.0,This is a great alternative to a string backpack as my daughter is only allowed to carry the sling or string type backpack at school. The sting backpack didn't even hold up for a month. This is a much better bag!  It's very durable and easily holds all my daughter's notebooks and supplies. It's just as durable as that other brand that starts with a &#34;K&#34; but at a fraction of the price.
5.0,It fits well and is good quality.  Wore it to a Halloween Party last night and got several compliments.
5.0,High-quality and very comfortable women's jeans from Calvin Klein. The size and description is fully consistent with the stated specifications. My wife is very happy with the purchase. I recommend everyone to buy.

5.0,"Fast and friendly delivery NICE üëçüèª It‚Äôs a pretty good mask the eyes are a bit weird but it will do. Overall I‚Äôm pretty happy  with this product. A bit smelly, will let it dry out all day. Thank you Amazon üëçüèª"
5.0,"Price was a little high, but overall, a beautiful necklace. Received on time. Just would recommend a longer necklace for future purchases.<br />Thank you."
5.0,I can sew and the detail is excellent
5.0,Exactly as pictured...accurate size.....very good value for Sterling Silver
5.0,"Gem Avenue was very prompt in their shipment and the price for the jewelry was very reasonable. The piece is what you would want, beautiful, but sturdy. I have confidence in Gem Avenue and would certainly shop there again, especially for large colored CZ jewelry, which I really enjoy. Everything from Gem Avenue has been gorgeous!"
5.0,Very Cute! I liked the glasses they fit very well.
5.0,Very nice and easy to use. Will hold larger stones and stretches almost three inches. Very affordable.
5.0,"The quality was much better than I thought it would be for the price,"
5.0,I liked it very much and used it as a shawl and a scarf for prayers
5.0,"Beautiful fabric, bright colors! I‚Äôll buy more if these head bands."
5.0,"Nice pants. , fit me perfect , confy and everybody at work compliment me."
5.0,"I wasn‚Äôt sure about this bra but I decided to give it a go. This is actually super comfortable to wear. I will wear it all day and sometimes forget that it‚Äôs on. I love that it doesn‚Äôt have any underwire. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm getting older or fatter or what, but I have gotten to where I am no longer wanting the underwire."
5.0,My daughter ordered this dress to wear for a event and worked perfectly!! Will order more in other colors
5.0,"I gave this shirt to my grand daughter for Christmas and she practically lives in it.  The quality of the shirt and the color is good, and the fit is perfect.  It could not have been a bigger success."
5.0,Nice gloves. Worked great this winter with my son.
5.0,"These bracelets are so shiny! And the design in them make them sparkle like crazy! They are so pretty and comfortable, and they sound very nice on the wrist, as well!<br /><br />1 star - Awful! Want my money back!<br />2 stars - Bad but not horrendous.<br />3 stars - Decent/Good<br />4 stars - Really good!<br />5 stars - Excellent! Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Super warm and fits snug. Not too much stretch but enough that its forgiving if u have lumps. Love it!
5.0,"fits well, looks great, keeps me warm and comfortable."
5.0,These brackets only last a few years they work great until they break from sun exposure over time.it would be better if they were made of steel.
5.0,I am in love with these liggage tags!  I would highly recommend them as well.  They are excellent quality and match my purple luggage!  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon!
5.0,"good quality, fit great and very comfy"
5.0,Super value arrived quickly
5.0,Love ut looks just like it dose in the pic
5.0,my Grandson loved this shirt
5.0,This is perfect! I have a few jackets that don't have hoods. I like to have a hood in case we get rain while I'm out.  I hate umbrellas. This is great!
5.0,Great price for a great product. Varied colors and comfortable. Rubber gasket holds them securely to your glasses. I am pleased that they are adjustable in length as standard sizes do it adjust to length. I am very happy with my choice.
5.0,"Perfect fit, nice soft material. Luv the color and style. Enough show of cleavage for a sexy night out."
5.0,"Love the fit! I‚Äôm a weightlifter, 195 lbs, 5‚Äù11.....length and width is perfect!"
5.0,I bought these for my husband and loves them. They are a perfect fit. As for the ability to use a smart phone while wearing these has yet to be determined but that is not why they were purchased. They are excellent quality.
5.0,"Love this dress.  It's comfortable, classic and affordable.  I'm using it in a wedding but it fits so many occasions that I will be able to wear it for work and leisure.<br /><br />The pleats in the back exaggerated my butt, which I can live with but I didn't expect."
5.0,Fabulous!!!!!!!
5.0,One of my favorite sets of pjs
5.0,gift for a 4 year old.  She loved it!
5.0,"I am a sucker for a yoga pant with a pocket so when I saw these go on sale I had to give them a go! I am so happy with my purchase! They fit just right. For context I am 5'2"", 120 lbs and I ordered a size small. They are thick enough to not be see through but thin enough to not over heat me while I am exercising. I would definitely recommend these!"
5.0,"Lost it in a car accident,  but will definitely be repurchasing!"
5.0,"This skirt was so much cuter on, than in the picture! I received so many compliments!"
5.0,Lovely earrings! Good quality. I wish they were a little bigger and a little thinner but that's more personal taste not so much the earring style.
5.0,Very nice school shoes
5.0,Cute dress for upcoming trip

5.0,The boots were a perfect fit.
5.0,"I love these rings, they are heavy and solid.  The one on the second finger (pointer), you will need huge hands in order to fit it like shown in the picture.  I put it on my thumb.  If I put it on my middle finger it moves around a bit.  But I love it though."
5.0,Great price and cute. A little baggy if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. Going to buy more
5.0,"Right size, nice colors, our daughter is beyond happy whit her mermaid gymnastic suit!"
5.0,My favorite pair of sleeves
5.0,"My daughter LOVES these shoes, they are very cute and fits to size. There is a little switch inside the shoe that you can press to switch the color of the lights there is also a usb cable to charge the shoes.<br />Great buy, we saw these shoes in the mall for $89."
5.0,Such a great idea! This light is so helpful at night when I am grasping for my keys. It is small so it takes up practically no space in my purse but is still bright enough to be super helpful. Arrived super fast and packaging was all good. Would definitely recommend for anyone!

I ordered it and put 8 names on it and a few hours later I remembered I needed to add one more name, so I emailed them and asked if it was to late to add the 9th name. They emailed me back and said no problem and didn‚Äôt charge me for the other name and birthstone. Very good customer service will order from them again in the future."

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:aa28a6b55edeb23665b783277f572134]] Wow this watch grabs your attention watching the precise mechanics of time.  I love the second hand spin wheel.  The sapphire glass and 50 meter water resistant gives me extreme confidence when wearing this watch anywhere.  The scratch resistance is something I look for to keep the watch face easy to see.  Plus, it keeps the watch in tiptop condition.  Very impressive and feels comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"

5.0,"Just got it yesterday. I like it. I like it a lot. Not as long as i thought. Thought it would be at least 1/4th of my fore arm. It's about the same as the average leather wrist strap. Regardless. I like it, and will most likely wear it whenever I need to dress to impress, and it isnt too hot. :)<br /><br />You may commence praising me on my impeccable grammar. lol"

5.0,"Fits like a glove, gorgeous fabric too"
5.0,"The face masks are a good fit, use cotton fabric that is closely woven (I quilt, so I recognize these fabrics), wash up nicely. At the same time I ordered carbon folters... then I read reviews about filters. Turns out that a plain tissue folded in half is probably the best for masks with a place for filters! I'm using the tissues now and everything remains good!"
5.0,"Given the cost, I was a little leery of purchasing these, but they actually work really well - fit over my glasses perfectly!  Very comfortable, too."

5.0,It also deserves 5 gold stars!!
5.0,"These gloves are a pleasant surprise being very soft and supple at such a low price. Not only do they look good, they are warm enough to deal with the temperature hovering around zero recently during a typical Minnesota winter. Comfortable to wear they were worth a blind purchase, something I don't like to do when it involves gloves or footwear.<br /><br />Being thin leather, they should not be used for any kind of labor and are meant for general use. I plan to take care of these and when they wear out will buy them again.<br /><br />Well worth the money."
5.0,"my niece's sorority symbol is the fleur de lis. These earrings are perfect for her--even in professional settings, as they are tiny but still have that sorority thang."
5.0,I love it! Beautiful blouse!
5.0,"I love these earrings.  They are very light weight, do not irritate my ears and because of their design they do not blow off my ears on windy days.  I do not enjoy wearing earrings that are heavy.  I was looking for an earring that I could wear daily & these are perfect.  Look just as pictured & arrived in 2 days.  Would highly recommend."
5.0,"My five-year-old granddaughter wears leggings all the time, and these are the softest ones she's ever worn.  They are silky soft, and the colors are beautiful (my granddaughter especially loves the pair with the butterflies on them).  The leggings are machine washable, but it's suggested that you not dry them in a dryer (hang them to dry instead).<br /><br />The sizes provided were a bit confusing to me, since they are listed by age and not by size.  My granddaughter wears a size 6 or 6X, so I ordered the 6-7 years size (instead of the 4-5 years size).  Luckily, these do fit well, although they're a tad too long, but it's really not a problem.  They can be easily cuffed if necessary.  And the quality of the fabric is exceptional!<br /><br />The listing does provide a size chart which includes the child's height for each of the size groupings.  My granddaughter is tall for her age, so the larger size does work for her.  These are beautiful and comfortable leggings!"
5.0,Just what any serious Blues Fan needs for Christmas
5.0,"Great product ‚Äî delivered on time.  Quality construction and looks good,  too!"
5.0,So cute and compact and yet the right size.
5.0,I love how they look with the bridesmaids dresses
5.0,"Beautiful, are more detailed than in the photo."
5.0,It is little thinner but i like the quality. Best to use during fall and spring season. I also loved the little thank you note than came in the package. It means how much they care about the customers. Now i want to try the grey color.
5.0,I love these. Their not too tight or too loose. Great lounge pants and not ankle huggers!
5.0,"Really pretty earrings. I wish they were a bit larger, though."
5.0,"Great belt, fought with belt holes for decades....this thing is marvelous . You can ratchet just up to where it is comfy , not a hole beyond that might be too tight or too loose. Wear with a suit and long airline flights , etc. always comfortable . Good quality build I expect to last."
5.0,Beautiful & Comfortable. Cotton-Polyester. Not T-Shirt Material. I usually wear an XL--purchased XXL--fits great--length about 4 inches below my belt (like the model)...NICE!  The package says to wash by hand and hang to dry.  Looking forward to wearing my top this weekend!
5.0,Super cute. I did suspect that it would run small so I ordered a size or two up just in case. I was right because it fits my son perfectly!
5.0,"I picked these up for my husband in a large in the black and he is pleased. They are a bit long in the fingers, but I think the size down would be too tight. Plus, with the extra room I don't have to worry if they shrink when I hand wash them or sanitize them. I spray them with Lysol then hit them with high heat in the dryer for 10 minutes. They have held up well. I ordered these for him to use in his classroom. With the current Covid directives, teachers are required to have the windows open and the air handlers running, no matter what the season. We are moving into winter and it's already freezing in the classroom. These gloves offer great warmth without being too bulky. He is able to use the track pad on his ChromeBook and type easily without hitting the wrong keys due to fat glove fingers. All in all,  a great pair of gloves that would make a great gift!"
5.0,Best bra. Really!
5.0,"I put this on as soon as I get home from work, it‚Äôs beautiful and beyond comfortable."
5.0,This is a beautiful charm for my bracelet! I love the Swan and the blue is gorgeous :)

5.0,I use these socks to wear with my monochrome red chucks. Perfect for my small 6 1/2 wide foot.
5.0,The quality and color are very good. Whoever saw the bags asked where I bought them.

5.0,This is nice stone
5.0,"These are my new favorite readers!<br /><br />The case is actually useful, I can get always get the power I need and the lenses does not distort like my previous brand.<br /><br />I will continue to order these.<br /><br />ABOUT MY PREVIOUS BRAND<br />I normally purchase Igog‚Äôs but have been experiencing some issues the last couple years.<br />- It is hard to find the correct power.<br />- The case is useless because once you take the readers out, you distort them putting them back in. This eventually leads to the nose pieces breaking off.<br />- The lenses are no longer uniform. They distort as you move your eyes"
5.0,I don‚Äôt pack my bags without these packing cubes. Have several sets. Best things since sliced bread!
5.0,Looks good fits well decent price  That's all folks
5.0,"Love my dress, its trendy, comfortable and fits well.  Have gotten many compliments, its become one of my favorites."
5.0,"Love this hat, it's extra large which is great for my big head. It's actually bigger than my head which is nice because i like to wear it loosely."
5.0,Legit soft hoodie! Will be ordering more!
5.0,"Just roll it into itself... very compact and durable. This is the perfect overflow bag for any adventure, don't hesitate."
5.0,"My son has sensory processing disorder and has several sensory issues. This shirt has helped him so much! When he wears this shirt he doesn‚Äôt fall, and he feels more secure! This is the second one I buy. He wears it all the time! It is a must buy!"
5.0,"A mi nieta le gustan y aunque est√° un poco caro, son sabrosos"
5.0,"Gorgeous dress! Some of the reviews said it was too large around the shoulders but i didn't have that problem. I am a size 16 with a 42DD bust, I ordered an extra large and it fit like it was made for me! The fabric has a little stretch which is nice and it looks fabulous with a petticoat."
5.0,The fix was just perfect.
5.0,wore it to universal studios and it was so comfortable. I love it
5.0,"If this dress fit, it would be amazing. I'm normally a 10-12, bra size 36 DD. I ordered an extra large, and it was just too tight."
5.0,Merchandise arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly like the pictures on line.
5.0,They are adorable! My girls can dance and twirl in them comfortably. They appear to be made well although I'm sure the skirt would tear sooner if they used them to play in rather than just for dance class.
5.0,I love this bralette.  It has an actual built in bra.
5.0,"These are worth the money! Best silicone tunnels on the market. The last silicone tunnels I purchased were cheap, had a huge outer rim, and had a seam on the outside surface of the tunnel that rubbed and made my ears raw. These ones are super soft and squishy, and made so the seam is on the inside of the tunnel and therefore not in contact with any skin! I will never skimp on silicone tunnels again. Kaos Softwear is my go-to from now on."
5.0,Great slippers. Comfortable and warm on my cold tile floors.
5.0,I get so many complements when I wear these skirts. I bought 3 and still want more but they are not available.<br />Why have you stopped making these. Please make more.

5.0,"Great hat, love that you can adjust the size.  Excellent quality."
5.0,My son in 6‚Äô4. He is pleased with them. 3 different pockets but after looking at the picture and understanding each I guess it‚Äôs ok
5.0,Bought for a friend that loves dragonflies. She loved it. Very pretty!
5.0,Super delicate and so thin it's barely there. That's what I was looking for - I don't think you could find a ring that is thinner and more subtle. It does shine in the light.
5.0,...so you know how you make a purchase on line &  you kinda just want it to be CLOSE to what the description said. This my fellow Amazoners is EXACTLY what I'd hoped for. They're so cute & the fabric is so high end. I wanted them to be kinda baggy but because the waist is contoured they look customized. I just want to stay cool & look cute as we ride this pandemic out & these fit the billüëç
5.0,"This was the first outfit I bought under the Allegra k series. I had my initial doubts, seeing the stereotype of asian mass produced goods would have below standard results.  But the price was pretty good, compared to the hard smack that Trinidadian wallets take to buy clothing inland.<br />The dress material is not too thin, so you don't have to wear a slip under it. But it's not too thick to make the shape boxy or stuffy.  The cotton blend is soft and comfy, and it washes well in the machine, and I don't have to iron it.  Right now I'm a bit under 110 pounds, 5'4&#34;, very low muscle mass, not much butt or boobs to boast of. I spite of this,I still look pretty attractive in this dress. Waifs smaller than my size could rock an extra small. My size small isn't tight, but comfy."
5.0,This is beautiful but didn't quite fit my toes as snuggly as I wanted.
5.0,Y son loved these sandals. They are true to size.
5.0,"I was told by my physician that I should wear compression socks to keep the legs circulated and the varicose veins in check.  She showed me the pair she was wearing which were colorful and stylish.  Upon returning home, I checked Amazon and found these and decided to order since the pricing was very reasonable for a package of 6.  I received my package and immediately tried a pair on which were very compressed fitting but not uncomfortable.  I do think this sock will be very helpful to keep my legs in better circulation!"
5.0,"It is a great value for the money, and I love the latch, it is big enough for me to manipulate by myself."
5.0,This dress is just as pictured!  I highly recommend it!  I love it!
5.0,It‚Äôs true to size and fits amazing!!
5.0,Love this style pant and the fit is so comfy! This pant is the reason I love this brand. Bought this in the grey and light blue color. Both are extremely comfy and great to workout in.
5.0,This piece of jewelry is beautiful. Great size for the price.. I bought it in all turquoise. Wore it in Hawaii. It comes with a short chain but i have a long rope chain and it looks great with it as well.
5.0,These work well and feel comfortable. The little carry bag is nice too. I would totally buy again.
5.0,"Super sexy, washes and wears well, looks great on and I got a number of compliments on it throughout the day and evening I wore it.  I will definitely purchase from Pastel by Vivienne again!"
5.0,Super cute! Fit is accurate!
5.0,Love it!! I‚Äôm usually a large and needed to re order an XL and it‚Äôs still snug the chest area. I‚Äôm a 38D if that helps.
5.0,These are really great quality and worked perfectly for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party!
5.0,"Nice give as gift he love the black ""smudging""Nice looking cap!"
5.0,This earring was small but fit my upper ear cartilage piercing perfectly. I do think the 10mm would prob be too small for an earlobe. I got the white gold now I think I‚Äôll get the yellow gold. It‚Äôs a simple look that was exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"I have larger breast and have always hated button-down tops because of the ‚Äúgap‚Äù problem. Well, I bought this on a recommendation and was so pleased to see the buttons are actually faux. There‚Äôs no gapping and it has the perfect stretch. I‚Äôve already bought the same dress in two other color patterns."
5.0,My granddaughter loved it. I placed her moms picture in it and we pinned it to her bridal bouquet.
5.0,Will grow into cute
5.0,Love these glasses . There weight is amazing and I will order another.
5.0,Bought these for my 7year old. Very easy to wear and very comfortable. Great quality for the price we paid. She looked absolutely adorable.
5.0,This dress is beautiful. The fabric is of high quality. It fits perfect. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 142# and I bought a medium. I‚Äôm a 34DD.  I do think a small would have not fit in the chest and glad I went with a medium. The pattern is very pretty. You can dress this up or down. Very versatile.  It is so comfortable. It‚Äôs almost like cheating. It‚Äôs so pretty yet I feel like I‚Äôm in my PJ‚Äôs at the same time yet I looked pulled together.
5.0,"I had a pair of Callaway Golf foldable readers $50.00, These are more sturdy and a fraction of the price. VERY HAPPY with this purchase."
5.0,The fit is perfect as is the length. I love these yoga pants and the material they are made. With. This is my second pair and I will be buying more.

5.0,Good quality ties at less price!
5.0,Fits good and feels good
5.0,I like this watch a lot. It is a little large for my wrist but it is a really nice watch.
5.0,"These pants are amazing! They fit perfectly, length is about mid calf. They are high waisted which is what I prefer for working out. They are very soft and start soft after washing and drying. And they don‚Äôt show anything when bending over! I will be buying more pairs of these!"
5.0,Get size larger
5.0,They were perfect for my cousin who is visually impaired
5.0,"Was for my husband swollen feet and ankles.  After 3 days, his feet were back to normal.  Very comfortable to wear.  Wears them everyday.  Good quality!"
5.0,Sturdy and well-detailed.  All 50 stars visible.
5.0,Why spend $100.00 for the same belt from a high end retailer?  This is ideal for going though airport security without having to take it off.  So way to punch an extra hole if it does not fit correctly.
5.0,"Unfortunately they slipped off my ears easily.  I wish I had put plastic guards on the wires because I lost one, and there aren't any more on the seller's site."
5.0,"Excellent transaction with this seller.  These are outstanding riding pants, fit like a glove and are so comfortable.  The lighter colors can be worn without concern about sweat showing.  This seller offers these at competitive prices &  prompt delivery.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again and would highly recommend to others."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c1f558992f6d1a2e366a8fde5ae1661b]] Have been very pleased with this watch winder. Has been working as advertised. Very sleek looking and made well. Can hold up to 4 watches and can be set to different intervals. Works on plug or 2 D batteries. Both work perfect. Currently using batteries and working great. One thing I like is that it‚Äôs quiet and won‚Äôt even notice it at all. Also like the blue color backlight that you can turn on and off. Nice little feature. Overall this is a watch winder and would recommend with the look and features this offered. Very pleased with it!
5.0,nice snug fit though
5.0,Matches the rose gold watch and also this fits the petite sized people perfect.  No idea how long it will last but seems decent quality
5.0,It is really cute.  Small but a good deal for the money
5.0,I loved this. I was worried about purchasing a large because everything I order online comes too small. I am 5'0 163 Ibs and it fit well. I will purchase again in another color
5.0,Black History Month
5.0,"It's feminine, delicate yet strong and a lovely accessory."
5.0,I love these pj's.  They do not crawl up my legs when I sleep or twist around me.  Keeps me very warm.
5.0,I love how they keep my arms warm but I can still use my fingers. They could be longer but I am satisfied with what they are
5.0,"I don't leave a lot of reviews, but I LOVE this bag!! I didn't think I'd like it this much... And FYI, I got the brown one and it looks MUCH better in person! Very good bag for the price!"
5.0,This is the tweed type weekender I've been searching for
5.0,The light isn't bright enough.
5.0,"Comes as a three pack. Pattern (cats) is cute, durable and very useful. Bought for my sister for her travels. Only on issue...she won't share them with me!"
5.0,"Fits great, lover the material."
5.0,shockingly warm and comfortable - as comfortable as they are ugly!

5.0,Beautiful dress! Way better than I expected
5.0,Great looking band. Easy to adjust length.
5.0,"I have really thick glasses. Like, coke bottle glasses, but its no joke.<br /><br />And I have a small nose.<br /><br />Heavy glasses + small nose = slipping glasses.<br /><br />These work great to keep my heavy glasses on my face. They are comfortable, and they were easy to slide onto my ear pieces. highly recommend."
5.0,"This is a very pretty necklace. I picked this particular one because the ring I placed on it is gold and the ""golden"" sunflower makes it good for either a gold or silver ring."
5.0,Getting ready to wear it this weekend. It fit just as expected.
5.0,Really like the memory sole. I need them in all of my footwear. Well priced. Will see how they last.

5.0,Great item. So beautiful. Actually even better in person. My Mom loved it along with many other people who saw it.
5.0,"Great strap for those occasions which call for quick changes from or to the ukulele.  It doesn't require any alteration of the instrument itself, and the hook slides over the top of my laminate ukulele very nicely without worrying about damaging the wood at all.  It does require that you keep your hands on your ukulele at all times, unlike the kind of strap which requires the installation of an end-button, but that shouldn't be a problem.  This strap has two adjustable sliders so it's possible to get the height of the ukulele just right.  I'm 6 feet tall and I was able to get this set just right."
5.0,After having kids the girls kinda head south a bit so trying to find a supportive bra for large girls and one that does not make me look like I'm 90years old was hard. I tried this one out and I can't believe it.. This was it perfect in everyway I would like wider straps but for a 36F I have no complaints it's so pretty and really comfy wish they had more colors.. Wow will get more finally found my bra..
5.0,Lovely earring.  just the right size and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"We love this cute hat for our little guy but I'd say it runs small, which is what we were anticipating, our son is 8 months old, has a very normal sized head, and it fits perfectly"
5.0,This is a very cute top and it fits well.  Using the size chart provided I ordered a medium since I wear an 8.  I purchased the blue and love the color.
5.0,"I was looking for a nice little gift for a graduate who likes penguins, and this necklace along with the earrings are just perfect."
5.0,"I got this to help combat the cold season. I love blankets and hoodies, so the combo seemed like a great way to cuddle up. The liner is super soft and thick, so it's really warm. The outer fabric is also soft, but not as soft as the liner. It is quite large, so it's great to snuggle up in.<br /><br />I've warn it consistently since I've gotten it, and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />My only worry is how soft it'll remain after being washed over and over."
5.0,I love this purse üëú
5.0,"I bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. Along with buying her a matching necklace, she can now show everyone who the ONE TRUE GOD is. She loves them :)"
5.0,"DOES WHAT IS CLAIMS TO DO, LOOKS GREAT AND AT A VERY GOOD PRICE."
5.0,Can hold a lot but the straps aren't too heavy duty so not for too much weight. But all around I love the bag!
5.0,Gorgeous and well made. Would buy again
5.0,I love the design and the flexibility of the straps -- super comfortable to wear around my neck. I was worried they might not fit on my original Wayfarers due to the thick arms (after reading some of the reviews) but they were super easy to slip on and still feel secure.
5.0,Gave these as gifts to family staying with me.  Everyone loved them!
5.0,Looks great with my Panerai
5.0,"Don't normally like &#34;jewelry&#34; but this wristband intrigued me and when I got it, am very happy with it. Great price and fast delivery"
5.0,SOFT!!!
5.0,I bought this for my 11 year old for Christmas. The graphics are amazing. My son is thin/small. It's cut fitted but nice and long. I think he'll love it!
5.0,"First of all I‚Äôd give this more than five stars if I could. Once you use this type of strap it‚Äôs doubtful that you‚Äôll ever go back to the old traditional strap that has your camera at your chest. With the added length of the strap and the camera at your waist it‚Äôs easy enough to grab your camera and start shooting. The adjustable strap is well made (and strong) as is the safty tether, both having quality secure metal fasteners. The padded portion of the strap has two metal zipper pouches large enough for batteries and media cards. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong with this."
5.0,I used scissors to open the holes for the mask. result was great.
5.0,This dress was way better than expected. With other reviews I was thinking of wearing as a shirt.  But it is definitely long enough.  I am 5'6&#34; 150lb and ordered a large. I should have gotten the medium. The hem line is a couple of inches above the knee. It is loose around my bust line as well.  But at the price you can't really beat it.
5.0,the product is really good the lether are very beautiful and look so elegance
5.0,"I bought this as part of a care package for seniors who had their year affected by Covid.  The quality was great.  I did remove one of the tags by unstitching it so that I could personalize the strap, but it left no holes or anything.  It looked really good!  The girl I gave it to was very happy."
5.0,Very cute  kitten change purse  Thanks
5.0,Very comfortable and fitting
5.0,"Really good looking top. Fabric soft to the touch, fit slightly loose. I intend to hand wash it though because I have a feeling fabric would stretch in a machine."
5.0,Looks great. Exactly as advertised. Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Really like it. Nice weight. A bit big, but Ok."
5.0,Very cute girly shirt. Nice material too. Dress up or down. Have it in green will buy it in black
5.0,El color vibrante y la tela de calidad. Ordene la talla Ly me qued√≥ justo como quer√≠a. Mido 5‚Äô4‚Äù y peso 143 libras
5.0,"Good quality! Recovering from shoulder surgery,  needed tanks to match my loose fitting tops. Great fit and comfort."
5.0,This key chain is perfect! Its elegance and design perfectly match that of the sophistication of the Continental keys which it holds! I love it!
5.0,Sometime ago I had my cataracts taken care of but still needed reading glasses. I bought a couple of pairs but they didn't quite do the trick. These glasses give germ clear vision while I read or do close up work. With the transition vision detail I don't necessarily have to take these glasses on and off; I can wear them until I want to remove them.
5.0,"I can‚Äôt say this is the most wonderful sun glasses I have ever owned. But it is so clear and the best of all $10 a pair, I can finally afford to buy 2 pairs at once for backups cuz I loose them all the time. This is my 4th pair."
5.0,Loved it! First one a S/M I couldn't fasten the top around my neck but quick fast easy replacement and the M/L fits much better. It's beautiful and I can't wait to wear it.
5.0,"Product Name: Black Cufflinks<br /><br />Product Details: You get one pair of cufflinks<br /><br />My Experience: We gave my husband this pair of cufflinks as a gift for fathers day.  He loved the quality of them.  They look amazing in person. He can't wait till our friend's wedding to show them off.  Don't forget that you wear this with a french cut dress shirt.<br /><br />Pros: Quality is amazing.  These even came in a nicely packaged box so it was easy to wrap up and give him.  Nice touch!<br /><br />Cons: I did not find any con's at this time.<br /><br />Package/Delivery Experience: Box was just right, and it came on time. No issues and no damages.<br />Seller Experience: Seller has been great. They checked in by email to make sure it made it and if I needed any help."
5.0,This dress is unique and gorgeous
5.0,I love this dress! The material breathes well which is important on hot humid days! I'm off to see if I can find more dresses!
5.0,"Shipping was quick. This was a Christmas gift,she liked it.."
5.0,The pictures don't do these justice at all. The beads are so much more vivid and detailed then you may think.  The bracelets themselves are securely crafted and all the details are tight and secure. Well worth the bargain price.  Will be buying more.
5.0,Love the Cape ! Customers always comment in it . God Bless America !!
5.0,One of the shoes charged up but the other one didn't. Amazon quickly sent out a paid return slip to send them back. I recorded and all is good.
5.0,This dress is beautiful! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and 230lbs and it fits like a glove. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it on my girls trip to Punta Cana! Going to purchase several more.

5.0,"Perfect hat for those sunny days, great for any size head. I use it for my newborn and see that it‚Äôll fit for some time to come. Also great as a nursing block for on the go nursing."

5.0,"I work on my feel 10 hrs a day, walk an average  of 5-10 miles and  I am required  to have safety shoes..... when I saw them and saw they were ""air"" type of shoes I had to give it a try... and I tell you they weight nothing... my feed are no longer in pain... I will buy them again..."
5.0,Exactly as advertised and what you would expect for price. Arrived in a timely fashion. Was satisfied with transaction.
5.0,"Worth the money, very useful. There may be a couple bad ones in the bunch but that to be expected."
5.0,"Like many people, I've been pretty much living in lounge wear because of the pandemic. Summer has gotten trickier because I still like to wear pants, but it's too hot for anything fleecy. These are fantastic in that regard because they're super lightweight. They're comfortable and soft. I haven't worn them to work out but they seem like they'd be a good fabric for that. I think they fit pretty TTS, if anything maybe on the slightly more fitted side but still plenty of room."
5.0,Awesome<br />Great price<br />Fast shipping
5.0,LOVED EVERYTHING
5.0,I purchased this for my husband to wear at a Masquerade themed dinner dance.  The quality was great and it tied to fit. So size was not an issue.

5.0,Gorgeous! Even better than the pics
5.0,Ponchos are compact and able to be packed in a small bag for emergency use. They are great for single use but not conducive for multiple wears. They are lightweight and serve their purpose!
5.0,"Looks good on my smartwatch. Exact color as described by the seller. Matches the color of my smartwatch, with bezel number mark color brown and case of brownish-grayish color."
5.0,The coat is perfect and as expected.
5.0,Nice quality product. The brooches shine like diamonds in the light is going to be a wonderful touch to the wedding bouquet.

5.0,"I liked the first one I purchased so much that I got a second.  Color stays bright and doesn't fade on to other clothing in the wash.<br />Seems A little expensive  at $17.99 for a t-shirt, but worth it."
5.0,"Arrived just in time for my date with my boyfriend. Tried it on and when I tell you I look good, I look good lol. I am 130 pounds and have a little curves so I ordered a medium. I am super glad I did because it was a little tight getting it on but once I got it on it was fine!"
5.0,This item was perfect for the graduation and matched the occasion exactly as I expected.
5.0,I suffer with throbbing pain and pressure in my legs after standing for long periods. These socks alleviate the discomfort. I usually wear them around the house. They don‚Äôt roll down. They are a little hard to put on but thats due to the compression material.

5.0,I would buy this product again.
5.0,I love this product. My wife and I were getting tired of having to take our wedding rings off during workouts and forgetting them places or cutting up our ring fingers from working out with our wedding bands. These came in handy as they work great fit great and are very comfy. I personally forget I am wearing them during a workout at times. I would say they are a must have if you are working out often and want to wear your wedding band.<br /><br />I have to admit that I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. It did not impact my opinion though.
5.0,"Bought a size 40 black shorts and they fit well. The pockets are roomy, great velcro strength. Just wore them to SeaWorld and Busch Gardens with my family for spring break and I held 4 smart phones and my fat grand daddy wallet in my pockets with my keys on every roller coaster and had no issues. Going to buy another pair right now if they have the color I need."

Easy to store in my purse, coat or sweater pockets. These are a fun gift for friends that are always feeling cold."
5.0,Works exactly as advertised.
5.0,These sunglass attachments have worked well to fit my Kliik Denmark collection frames which are a little oversized and didn't work for the smaller attachments. Go on easily with clips and stay on.
5.0,Booom!!!
5.0,"This looks fantastic on!  I am 5 foot 7 1/2 inches, I'm a size 4-6, this goes down to about my knees and fits perfectly over my body ! The  Quality of the material Is awesome!"

5.0,She loved it my daughter
5.0,"Lovely shoes - I love the colors, which complement each other - my daughter loves putting them on - even though I mistakenly bought a size bigger...!!!"
5.0,This is an amazing bathing suit!!  Very flattering!  Only downside is that it is a little  tough to get out of when wet and putting it back on (to use the restroom) takes a while. Everything considered- an awesome suit!
5.0,These are the first thing I've used to cover my toes that stayed on.
5.0,Just as purchased. Beware that this is a larger sized statement necklace so you're going to make a statement with it! The hot pink color was very bright and great for any fashionista.
5.0,cute as heck
5.0,It is hard to find a spring ring necklace chain these days; I am so happy to have found this one.  Most of what is available is lobster claw clasps but I have trouble closing them.  Spring ring clasps work much better for me and my clumsy hands.
5.0,So warm and a great fit.
5.0,Love this bracelet. 5‚≠ê
5.0,Nice band. It is adjustable so there is a sliding buckle. I totally forget that the buckle is there. The band is very comfortable and easy to put on. The edges are soft and don‚Äôt cut into my wrist.

5.0,I was worried these would be super tight on my head but they're perfect and the material is very soft and stretchy.
5.0,"These socks feel great. They are cushioned, soft, stretchy. They wick moisture well. I highly recommend for jogging or working out. The color is an extremely bright neon green. If you like that, then these are excellent athletic socks."
5.0,The quality of material most certainly surpasses the price indeed.  Great fit for me.  I would recommend ordering per size chart.  This item is most likely not sufficient for waist training however as an addition to your wardrobe or for cos play it is exquisite.  You will definitely get more than your money‚Äôs worth.  Treat yourself l!
5.0,Nice stretchy material. Sexy Outfit for night out on the town.
5.0,"Love it, fits well and it hides the imperfections, the material is very nice quality."

5.0,The crystals catch any light. The latch is classy and secure. I love these earrings
5.0,"For the price point, this watch strap is great. It does not feel cheap or poorly made. The rose gold matches perfectly with my watch and did a great job of replacing my old watch strap. Overall, it is a very nice strap for the price."
5.0,"This was perfect for me, as I like to use large rollers in my hair and cover them up with a slumber cap.  This one was perfect size, as it covered all my rollers and was secure.  It also has nice little holes in it, for excellent ventilation. (Not Hot).  I am pleased!"
5.0,"Dress is very flattering, classy and a bit edgy for brides to be...and Mom approved<br />(This a size small)"

5.0,Love this item~ One of my favorite shirts EVER!!
5.0,It‚Äôs very comfortable and soft. Sometimes I will order shirts that are a small and they still tend to run big. This shirt fits as expected. I‚Äôm thinking of buying other colors. I like the casual look with this shirt.
5.0,Absolutely love these shirts. I wish they were still available.
5.0,Great fit!  Extra slouchy like I hoped!
5.0,I got this for my grandmother for Christmas.  It is perfect because it has a magnetic clasp. She has arthritis and now she can put this on with no problem.  She loved it!
5.0,"I wore this for the first time yesterday and got so many compliments!  It's a unique shirt and very stylish.  I ordered the small & i'm 5'2/106lbs.  It fit me perfectly, and even though it's a looser fit shirt it still was flattering for my figure.  Quality of the shirt is great too.  It was definitely worth the wait on shipping!"
5.0,Used for a costume in a play. Very nice quality.
5.0,This top is great!  I wear it alone or over my sleeveless black dresses.  I love how the bottom hem on the back gives it a flair.  I wish I could get another color.....<br />Thank you!

5.0,Husband loves. Just right for what he needs them for. Thank you!
5.0,Material too thin had to return it.

5.0,Very soft and comfortable dress. Love the pockets!!
5.0,Love this watch! I'm super active and I bought one for me and my boyfriend and we both love them!
5.0,This jacket was exactly as advertised it was warm and cozy why I was on the mountain snowboarding and stretched when trying to move around
5.0,Came out of pkg and the fit was just right. I expected them to be too long. The length not too long.
5.0,Bought it to display and love it!!! Would probably fit better on a child that an adult but that‚Äôs fine. It looks great and would recommend. Perfect in my display case!!!
5.0,Love the material. It is very flowing. Fits great. Do not like the fact that it wrinkles very easily. But I would buy it again
5.0,These are a great quality sock. I purchased these for my husband and he just loves to show them off!! Proud veteran!!
5.0,i loved!
5.0,Extra pretty.  I love it!
5.0,I wore the left glove under a very hot plastic brace. They kept my hand from being sweaty and stinky!
5.0,"sized up, glad i did. there‚Äôs room in these pants but if i has gotten my actual size i don‚Äôt think they would have fit. they sit on the hips, if you don‚Äôt wear an undershirt or belt be careful when bending over etc. also they are a little more flared at the bottom than i imagined they would be from the model in the photo. but not a big deal for what i need them for."
5.0,"This is my 4th set of these, I keep just putting them on all my shoes.  These have fit just right in all my shoes so far, converse and adidas."
5.0,Love the material and fill
5.0,"At first I  thought this pack would be too small for my carry on 7-8 day trips. I compared it to the standard 22 x 14 x 9. But after I watched some Utube videos on how to roll or bundle I found it more than than fit my needs. Especially when you go on plane wearing a complete set of clothes; which I always forget to consider!!  I fit in 1 blue jeans, 2 shorts, 4 tees, 5 boxers, bathing suite, 2 sandals (one larger with the back straps), hanging toiletry bag, quart liquid zip lock,small misc stuff like day pack, vitamins, etc.And all of that without using the expansion.  I also use a personal carry on for my netbook, charger and Boise. Quality very high. Very comfortable for my 5'9&#34;. Consider also that the airlines want to go to the small  sizes and this pack meets that!!<br />And if there are no overheads, I can go under the seat !! This pack is a WINNER. I HOPE TORTUGA REINTRODUCES PRODUCTION?<br />I looked at the Breaker. Who wants two small sided pockets on a pack that only fit small items?? I need the room to be in the main compartment in order to fit in items I NEED. I can always fit in small items in a large main compartment !! SOMETIMES I WONDER WHAT THEY ARE THINKING"
5.0,They are very comfortable shoes
5.0,This is a very cute bag!  I will be carrying it at my son's wedding and it's the perfect size and compliment to silver shoes.  I can't speak to the durability yet but at the price if it only lasts one day it has served it's purpose!  Thank you!
5.0,I ha d. Been looking for something light weight but anti-slide because the ceramic tile in our new house was making my feet stay so cold.  I have circulation issues in my hands & feet & they tend to be cold anyway.  These Yoga Pilates socks were perfect.  They actually went one step further & provided a mild compression stocking to my feet which doctors have said will help.
5.0,"simple, reasonable size, and works well."
5.0,"Very cute, fits well, and I love the case they came in."
5.0,I bought this necklace for my granddaughter‚Äôs 17th birthday. It is lovely and delicate and she loved it.
5.0,Very high waisted to help suck everything in. For the most part are squat proof. Very comfortable.
5.0,all my grandkids loved it
5.0,Excellent quality for the price and incredibly well fitting. Not too long or too short and better than expensive branded ones out there.
5.0,Beautiful watch but solar battery wouldn't hold a charge .Amazon Customer support help me solve this issue with no extra expense to me so it's turned out üëç
5.0,"I purchased this for a friend and was pleased with the product. Double lipped, comes packaged in a sterile little baggie. Great design, great colors. 10/10 will shop this store again."
5.0,Very cute shirt for the price
5.0,"These are awesome! If you're looking for cat eye frames, these are the ones to get."
5.0,"Great quality, quick shipping. Very happy with it. True to size."
5.0,"Beautiful! Looks just like the picture, plus it's stainless steel, so won't irritate skin like other non-gold metals. It also won't tarnish either. Very reasonable price for fashion jewelry that can be an every day wear; also has a nice polish that can pass for white gold. I actually like stainless steel even better than silver, because with silver you can't leave it on if you're sensitive to the other metals like nickel or copper. Also the bracelet isn't flimsy and looks very solid and durable."
5.0,It fit my grandson perfectly. He loves them
5.0,"Super cute, inexpensive but fun earrings."
5.0,"These are great. I ordered some after looking at a lot of what else was offered on Amazon. I was hoping to find some real cashmere, but I didn't. In lieu of that, these are a sturdy, well-made, acrylic pair of leg warmers. They aren't itchy, they stay up well for me, and they're warm! Just what I needed. (And I like the charcoal grey color I selected, too.) I liked them enough to buy a second pair as a gift for my Pilates Instructor. :-)"
5.0,"Love these Capri leggings! Good quality print, super comfy."
5.0,"Very well made you can wash it ,dry it and it still keeps its shape  I get so many compliments when I wear it. I was shocked when I was shopping in Bloomingdale‚Äôs  and so many people was asking me did I get my dress from there"
5.0,"Perfect glasses, look great"
5.0,"This is a good quality shoulder bag that has enough compartments and easy straps. It has enough space availability for your mobile devices, pads, headphones, etc."
5.0,This dress was a great fit! I'm 5'8 athletic built so it's always difficult to find a dress to fit me.
5.0,"I am so impressed with this company's customer service (in particular-Katherine).  I had a minor issue with this wallet and when I notified Amazon/Access Denied,  I got a personal response expressing concern and their willingness to take whatever steps necessary to make sure I was satisfied with purchase.  I had already purchased a replacement wallet from their company because I needed it quickly and will just get a refund on the other wallet.  I love this product and the company.  See for yourself .  You won't be sorry!"
5.0,Bought for granddaughter! She liked it!
5.0,too small in bust area
5.0,This handbag is very well made and has many outer and inner pockets to made finding things easier.  I am very pleased with this bag and would recommend it.
5.0,-My kiddo loved it - thanks!
5.0,love my rings i wear them with everything
5.0,Fit perfectly on Huawei GT2
5.0,Love these earrings. So cute and fun and great for the price. But they are a tad heavier than you would think. But still great.
5.0,"These are my all time favorite yoga capris! I am an avid review reader, but I rarely find time to actually write reviews, since I have a toddler who never sleeps üòÖ However, in this case, I feel obligated to leave one.<br />For reference. .. I am 5'7&#34;, 155-160 lbs, with a post baby belly (I should have lost months ago!) And I ordered the large. They are so comfortable, I had to order more, because I was literally wearing them 7 days a week!<br />As others have stated, they are slightly longer, and not tight on the ends, until you pull them up to mid calf. Not a problem. They are NOT see thru, and the best part?? They STAY UP on my waist. Finally, no constant rolling down!!<br />I have had them about a month, and still in love."
5.0,I love it I wear size 8 pants and I got a medium and fun me but top is a little small but will make it fit with a non cushion bra üòç

5.0,"comfortable, bright white will make any outfit stand out"
5.0,Looking good.
5.0,These are great shorts I love them but they are so hard to find. They don‚Äôt ride up great for active moms and they are cute.
5.0,"I was so shocked when I opened the box. These are the most beautiful glasses I have ever seen. And I get a new pair of prescription glasses every year. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really appreciate this $ price a very happy customer."
5.0,"These were bought only for costume, but is now in his normal rotation for everyday wear!"
5.0,"i absolutely love these! I love all things high top and the color added the extra umph to the style. dress them up or down it goes both ways. the shoe fit is a bit narrow for me, but still able to wear thin socks and get away with it. i usually wear a 7.5 but reeading the reviews i ordered a 7 instead, which is best with thin socks and not thick socks. material is definitely a plus! i didn't expect them to have this type of material. it is definitely well made"
5.0,"This was a gift, but the person loved it."
5.0,This shirt is super soft and comfortable. I love it!
5.0,Great socks never any issues and shipping was fast and no problem.
5.0,Fits perfect so comfy
5.0,"This is the second poncho I purchased.  I love how comfy it is, and was devasted when my first poncho got a hole at one of the seams.  Perfect for work, lounging around the house, or grabbing a drink with friends."
5.0,Nice product easy install no slippage nice fit will buy again
5.0,Good color and Logo
5.0,"This set of replacement mounting brackets is a sort of generic bracket for the ""wond down"" sun shades.  I have these shades on my front and rear patio.  The circular loop on one side that is made for a crank-type raising/lowering rod had broken due to the Arizona heat.  The plastic had gottern brittle and, even with care, the loop cracked and the rod beacam unuasable. I only needed the side with the loop and it was very easy to install and replace the broken one.  The new replacement pice feels much stronger and works excellently."
5.0,Purchased for my husband.  He has owned three of this same cap and wears it all the time (consequently it gets dirty and we replace it).  It fits very nicely and the style is perfect.
5.0,sdds
5.0,These are gorgeous!!!
5.0,Very nice shoe for kids
5.0,"This suit is AMAZING.  It makes me look like I have an actual waistline, instead of chunky and straight up & down.  I'm short waisted and thick in the middle.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 168 lbs, 40C bra. (I'm all leg length).  The size 14 is the  correct size for me but I have to admit that I do show some back fat with this suit.  A small price to pay for an indented waistline which I haven't seen in years.  I'm not overly busty so the bra  fit beautifully.  The bottom of the suit is plenty spacious in the rear end area.  While  I wouldn't call this the most comfortable swimsuit I've ever worn, I would say that it is  the most flattering that I've ever owned.  I think this suit is ideal for women who are short waisted  or have an average length torso.  If you are long waisted, it may not work.  Absolutely beautiful swimsuit.  I wear a pair of short swim shorts over this to hide the top of my thighs as the legs are cut higher than I'm comfortable with."
5.0,Solid shades
5.0,Size large bermuda shorts very tight
5.0,It was a little bit sheerer that I wanted but beautiful colors.  I use in on top of a yellow top I have.
5.0,This is designed as a cover up but I can see me using it in so many other ways.  I love the design and feel of this cover up.  I wore it to work today paired with a solid colored shirt and slacks.  I received so many compliments on the outfit.  It is very light and flowy.....just what you want in the summer heat.  This is a one size fits all and I normally wear a size large.  I loved the way it fit...or actually didn't... It was loose and flowy.  Great addition to your summer wardrobe. Beautiful vibrant colors rounded out this unique piece.
5.0,"While no as thick as a mask, it is something my teen son will wear and does. They are easy to wash by hand each time he wears and dries quickly."
5.0,These are very nice and fit well. looks great.  My foot is a women size 8 and they fit perfect.
5.0,I just love these. I've bought other brands that were not as good. Either they were itchy or didn't like the material that they used but these are just perfect for me. I also really liked that it was a set of 4 and the colors are as advertised. I would've purchased these sooner because they are that comfortable. I have a rather large wrist and these just fit perfectly and could even be adjusted to move up above my wrist if I like.
5.0,Perfect. Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Great looking shirt.love this shirt.
5.0,"I have no dislikes at all! Everything is perfect! My nephew is pretty tall for 10 so I ordered the medium adult, he was super excited it came with a tail, he is on the spectrum for Autism and this costume made him super happy! Thank you for having such a well put together costume making this gift be a great one"
5.0,very comfy and launders well.
5.0,"I like the belt, perfect size and color."
5.0,I love it. But no pockets
5.0,"Loved them all, the only issue is that the stone flairs seemed a bit small."
5.0,"The even helped my see better in a blinding rain in the day!.  I have only used them twice so far, once at night but with someone else driving; still I could tell distance more clearly, and could see well enough to judge whether or not to make a left hand turn with oncoming traffic.  I think these are going to help nicely!"
5.0,This product is amazing have bought three packs and are amazing. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for great boxers. They come in an incredible zip bag. Are super comfortable and will continue buying from them.
5.0,Beautiful kurti very comfortable material love it

5.0,Love these! Wish they came in even numbers but they are very beautiful - they do look more rose gold though. Can‚Äôt wait to make something with these!
5.0,Belloooo
5.0,"IT STATES RIGHT IN THE TITLE: &#34;FRINGED&#34; It was made that way and it's funky and CUTE...deliberately.<br /><br /> I love this shirt! The linen is a nice weight and the color is a pretty powder blue. The shirt doesn't fit me as long and baggy as the cute, tiny model, but it's plenty big. I normally wear  Large in shirts and am 36C-36D And I wear a size 8-10 (medium) on the bottom.<br />The sleeve cuff and neckline are finished with a cute raw edge with a double top stitch. SO CUTE! The shirt is finished nicely. The bottom is finished with a top stitch and the neck facing is also top stitched so there's no fabric to roll up and wrinkle.<br />I am so glad this shirt fit because I LOVE IT! It's  linen. Linen wrinkles, so keep that in mind if you need to be pressed and tidy. Personally, I love wrinkled linen. Comfy stuff!"
5.0,Loved necklace!
5.0,Just what I wanted.  It's perfect
5.0,These are even prettier in person. High quality. Look expensive and are my new fave earrings! I got them in gold.
5.0,"This dress is beautiful.  It'seems flowy, sexy and the colors are nice.  It is a little low cut, but other than that it was perfect.  I received many compliments and injuries about where I purchased it from. Great buy!!!"
5.0,"It was perfect. I did order up in size to be careful and I realize that wasn‚Äôt necessary. However, it looks good as an oversized sweater. Love it!"
5.0,Fits perfectly!! So cute and sqaut proof
5.0,"I like everything about the Jacket.  It is very lightweight and very warm.  It is a little fragile, but this is urban wear, not for ski slopes, mountain climbing or walking through the woods.  Secret chest pocket is practical and useful.  A little bit tight on me but I would by this jacket in this size again."
5.0,"The bluetooth works great. Plays music nicely. Even says the never that is calling if a phone call comes through. Keeps your head warm, too. No complaint so far."
5.0,Got it for my husband as a Christmas present and he absolutely loves it.  Fits properly and is very comfortable
5.0,"You too can look and feel like a million bucks wearing these shirts. Charlie Sheen can get the biotches and so can you. Great customer service, love your product.."
5.0,My 12 year daughter loves it and its a oerfect fit. Looks elegant
5.0,Seemed a little above average for the ‚Äú normal ‚Äú large. Mom said it fits more like an extra large.
5.0,It is so comfortable & is so pretty I want one in all the colors! The size is exact. It is perfect!
5.0,Easy to install and it looks great
5.0,"I absolutely love the fabric, fit, length, print and style. You can dress it up with blazer or not.Either ways its a great piece!"
5.0,I love them.  I am so glad I found this pink color!  I had tried the copper and silver and didn't like either of those but the pink makes them cute and fun.
5.0,I love everything about these.<br />The pocket is a great bonus!!
5.0,Perfect for my board members.
5.0,Really nice !!!<br />Thanks
5.0,This item came exact how it looked in photo.
5.0,Love the hat. Flimsy bill but matches the look. Wear this hat all the time.
5.0,Its so beautiful!!! I love love it! Thank u!
5.0,"I love this hat, comfortable easy to carry."
5.0,"the dress was beautiful!! Got SO many compliments. The only negative thing I‚Äôll say is that there was no description that there would be ruffles on the sleeve. But that‚Äôs ok, the dress came out great. Look at my picture for a reference!"
5.0,Such a cute charm.
5.0,These pants are great! They fit me really well and the material is great quality. I love that there are pockets on both sides-they are perfect for a cell phone! I‚Äôve worn them for workouts and lounging and they are perfect for doing both! Would recommend
5.0,Just the right size for a necklace
5.0,"I wear these almost everyday. They are casual enough to wear to the gym, but can be dressed up just as easily. Def will be buying more!"
5.0,"Any Taylor Swift fan would appreciate this Anti-hero necklace.  If you listen to the lyrics, they are dark, but also quite brilliant.  Any Swiftie would be proud to wear it!"
5.0,"When a boy‚Äôs favorite animal is the wolf what do you get him for Christmas? Wolf Slippers!!<br /> Had to find a box for them to wrap, but he was SO happy to open them!!<br />They do keep his feet really warm (as is usual for this type of slipper). They have also been keeping all his friends feet warm too! We had to have a talk about not sharing feet stuff.<br />Anywho 2 months in and they have held up very well even with all of the extra use & abuse all the kids have thrown at them.<br />Spot cleaning has been on par with other stuffed animals. (A little baking soda & toothbrush to scrub, water to wipe up all the baking soda, dry toothbrush & a blow dryer on cool to dry and brush back to normal. Hang in sun to finish drying).<br /><br />We absolutely DO recommend these slippers!<br />&<br />We hope our review is helpful to you!"
5.0,easy to slip on and off.  I love the hue they provide and they really filter out the harsh rays better than my other sunglasses.
5.0,"Got a medium, fits perfect. Had to iron because it came pretty wrinkled. Light weight"
5.0,"Took a chance and couldn‚Äôt be happier, the lenses are as clear as possible. There‚Äôs a nice little suction when you put it on and notice it when you remove it."
5.0,Looks great.  Large is just a little bigger than I expected
5.0,Bit my husband loves it .. we sewed on it
5.0,Cozy! Can't fit my foot into bootthoughwithteseon.iweartemassipersistead
5.0,Bought this for cheer for my 6yr old. She absolutely loves it. Fits great. True to size. Color is vibrant.
5.0,These scarfs are legendary! So many compliments. I gave them to all of the ladies at the office and they LOVE them. I have all colors.
5.0,I purchased this lounge set based on other reviews and I am glad that I did. This is a very comfortable lounge set. I purchased this set in blue. The material is very soft and cozy. They fit true to size. I am between a 12/14 and ordered a size Large. I am glad that I didn't size up. I am bigger on the bottom so the Large fit well. The top is roomy but still has a cozy fit. I have washed them in the washing machine in cold water and dried in the dryer and the set holds up great. The pants have elastic but no drawstring and have very deep pockets. Definitely plan on purchasing other colors!
5.0,"I've ordered several pairs of Huggins online and have frequently been disappointed because they were usually much smaller than shown/described or very light weight.  These were not a disappointment at all. Nice substantial size without being to big, nice weight and true Sterling. Very impressed and would buy again!!"
5.0,Excellent value..  Bought two more in different colors.
5.0,"Got this as a gift for a friend. Perfect, box it comes in is very nice. light weight."
5.0,It wss was s shift for my son.
5.0,Very flowy and cute!
5.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; tall and weight ~120 lbs. I typically wear a US size 2 or a size small/medium in junior's styles at retailers like Forever21. I ordered a 2/4 in the E.JAN1ST Women's Spaghetti Strap Jumpsuit V Neckline Loose Harem One Piece Romper based on other reviews and comments. It fits perfectly. The cut is a v-style like in the photo. It appropriately covers my 36&#34; chest. I wish that the straps were adjustable as the synthetic fabric is on the slick side and has a tendency to slide down easily. The pants portion hits around the ankle like shown in the photo. They taper up and wider out at the knee.<br /><br />The E.JAN1ST Women's Spaghetti Strap Jumpsuit V Neckline Loose Harem One Piece Romper is made from a polyester blend. It has a bit of stretch to it. It is easily washed on the cold setting with like colors. I am able to dry mine on normal. The material does not wrinkle too easy, and holds up against body heat on warm days. The seams are all well constructed and smooth against the body. It is overall a comfortable fit. The jumpsuit is super comfortable and flowy, great for a hot summer day when you don't want to wear something form fitting. The jumpsuit pairs well with a cute vest or denim jacket for cool nights. I recently wore it for a party that I was hosting, I received many compliments while feeling as comfortable as I do in my pajamas! I can't wait to order this jumpsuit in other colors. Between the elasticity of the material and the loose nature of the design, I believe it is safe to order in your true US size. This romper is competitively priced compared to similar styles from other retailers. At $14, it is prime eligible and will arrive to you within two days. Similar styles retail for $40 at brick and mortar stores like Kohls or Macys. I recommend saving yourself the trip to the mall and giving the E.JAN1ST Women's Spaghetti Strap Jumpsuit V Neckline Loose Harem One Piece Romper a try."
5.0,My mom loves it!! outstanding.
5.0,"I bought some paper thin Modo prescription glasses that have rectangular frame arms (about 1mm x 0.6mm) and the stock temple tips are a harder plastic which led to my glasses sliding all the time. I tried several other options including other thin temple tips (meant for 1mmx2mm) that were too loose for my frames. These fit great for my glasses. It took a bit to get these on the frames, but with a bit of effort I got them snakes on. They are just a tad too long compared where the originals ended, but it doesn't affect their use."
5.0,I love this product! It‚Äôs one of the best things I ever purchase.
5.0,"I like it,but you'd better check your production line because I just noticed that there's a cut that starts on the top edge and goes almost all the way thru the key ring holder. I only carry it iny pocket and know there are no sharp edges there."
5.0,"2 months in and they are still spotless (i take great care of my lenses). They are also very bright, as in they don't give you a dark and smoky tint like black lenses do."
5.0,"Great socks, like the colors"
5.0,"This product is exactly as described/shown in the add.  Very pretty!  My 14 year old niece liked it too - so I think it is good for a variety of ages.  It arrived earlier than expected, although it was a little annoying that there was no tracking info available for most of the time it was being shipped.  But overall I'm very happy."
5.0,Love these.  Exactly the size I was looking for.  Look of high quality
5.0,"Good quality, nice fit"
5.0,Got this as a birthday present for my mom and she loved it! Got her the maroon color. Very thick and nice color and keeps her wam
5.0,They aren't as long as I tought they would be but they're still perfect. Thanks.
5.0,kid loves this!  A little more grown-up Minecraft.
5.0,Excellent glasses in pretty colors
5.0,Came quick fits fine
5.0,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality. The fabric is a good weight/quality, and this particular dress looked awesome."
5.0,Beautiful fine quality.
5.0,Great jacket. Runs a little small but I guess it should fit close to keep heat close to body.  Got this for myself but my daughter took it so I guess I need to order another one.
5.0,More beautiful in person! VERY lightweight &amp; EXTREMELY elegant!
5.0,I bought these goggles for my kids (ages 3 and 5) and myself. They were so comfortable. The goggle did a great job minimizing the strong light from the sun as we skied. Also the size is perfect for shielding most of your fact from sunburn while skiing. This one size fit perfectly for my kids (over their helmets) and myself. What a great purchase! I highly recommend it.
5.0,"Love, love this dress!  I bought it to wear while traveling and mistakenly left it behind in Tanzania. I was so disappointed that I am mediately went online to see if it was still available and sure enough it was. Therefore, I received a replacement dress. Let me rephrase that. I bought another one"
5.0,Used for meds until too many bottles were added. Versatile.
5.0,"I think it‚Äôs a very cute bag and I got it to carry around my camera. It happens to fit my Polaroid camera which is a decent size, and then even my small fuijfilm camera along with other stuff. Downside is your friend may say it looks like a lunch bag (or at least my friend)"
5.0,This are tine and pretty to match a stud...I love it :) giftable and comfortable :D
5.0,"Let me give my height and size to begin with so that it might help someone else.  I'm 5'11  36DD/30/41 167lbs-  I ordered the purple top and the black one too.  I ordered an XL even though i normally wear a Large....The XL is a perfect fit for my figure and height.  I would NOT recommend this for anyone shorter than 5'9 because of the length.  This is made for a tall person, long waist...etc.  It runs a size small so order up one.  The sleeve length could be longer but it's not a big deal.  The bust is great, it's just long and flowing through the middle and covers the hips and upper thighs.  The material is awesome and doesn't appear to hold wrinkles at all.  The purple is the most beautiful purple i've seen i believe.  It's jewel tone, deep, rich amethyst purple...stunning.  I will wear these with leggings and sandals in the summer and thick leggings and boots in the winter with a long trench cardigan....highly recommend this top!  Especially if you're TALL and long"
5.0,"Loved it! My daughter loves it, wore it for Halloween and dresses up regularly. It's a little big for her, but it can easily fold in so no big deal. I highly recommend it!"
5.0,"I'm very thin, and probably could have really used xs, however,  the quality of the outfit is wonderful,  and I will be wearing to my father's funeral"
5.0,"For those who don't like to wear a watch, this is a simple, easily read alternative to clip on a handbag or keychain if preferred.  It comes in a variety of very pretty colors too."
5.0,"Love these readers!  They are so compact, the cases are cute and sturdy!  Ordered another set for a gift."
5.0,It was just what I wanted! Thank you!
5.0,"Fits great, get lots of complements"
5.0,"These are super cute and comfy shorts I bought to wear to my pole dancing class.  I am 5""6 175 lbs and ordered  a large. I could have worn a medium for a little more compression in the belly."
5.0,"I bought it in red and also black. I love the fit and material. Fits me perfect with just enough stretch. I'm 5'5, 126 lbs. I bought the large in both colors. The medium would have fit too. I like the little extra room across the bust."
5.0,Works well for my husband who is a delivery driver
5.0,Grabbed at the last minute for a formal  wedding--quite lightweight but very beautiful! -------I don't know how long lasting it will be --but for the cost---that's not a concern--very happy with this purchase!
5.0,This mask was purchased for a masquerade birthday party. It was a perfect fit.
5.0,Happy to report that this is very soft!  It looks like a fat short tube when you get it but it's quite nice on and can be worm different ways. Good purchase.
5.0,"These face mask brackets are comfortable and prevent my masks from being ""inhaled"". They make breathing while wearing your mask much easier and work well with both cloth and disposable masks. I have shared them with a few friends and family. Highly recommend."
5.0,"This jacket is very stylish and the fabric stretches to allow a flattering fit. I wore this to golf on a cold day that had some showers and I stayed warm and dry. When it began to rain harder, I wore a rain jacket over this J Lindenberg jacket and I stayed completely dry. Most of the golfers left the course and I finished my round!"
5.0,Beautiful shirt. My husband has 3 short sleeve ones and this long sleeve is absolutely beautiful. He will enjoy wearing it.
5.0,"The cutest dress!  It‚Äôs flattering on all different body shapes & forgiving where you need it!  Nice light weight cotton, cool & comfortable. I will definitely buy more colors!"
5.0,"This ring is perfect. Just big enough for the names to be read but not to large on my hand. Size is good, it does catch on the inside of my clothing if I'm not careful, but I'm sure that will stop with time."
5.0,"Very comfortable, functional and can be worn under many kinds of clothing - not just workout wear.  My only difficulty has been zipping it because of the little lip on the bottom."
5.0,For well and was exactly how described ! Very comfortable
5.0,"Very nice shirt. Good quality and great colors. The fit was great in the shoulders but it did not taper at the waist like I would like, but it wasn‚Äôt too big, just roomy.<br />Tie and hanky was beautiful. My husband looked great in them.<br />He is tall and has long arms so I was glad when I saw that the sleeve lengths were available in longer lengths.<br />Great price too."
5.0,"I like the earrings they look just like the picture but I‚Äôm giving them to my oldest daughter as a Christmas present ,but I know she is going to love them."
5.0,My daughter loves it.  She wears it with pride.
5.0,"Love this watch! Very simple and modest, but it makes a statement!"
5.0,This dress was everything! I wore it to a Keyshia Cole concert lastnight for my birthday.I usually don't purchase from Amazon so this was definitely a first but I am very pleased with my purchase.The material was thick and didn't have a cheap feel to it.im 170 lbs and a little hippy and ordered a medium.
5.0,love it  the clasp is great
5.0,I find this belt more comfortable than my regular belts.  My regular belts always felt one notch too loose or one notch too tight.  The logo name sticks out too much when I try to wear this belt with slacks and a button up.
5.0,I bought this hose to recycle my washer grey water out to my yard. A previous review stated the hose didn't seem to be measured correctly. Maybe that was corrected but I ordered mine just a bit bigger and used a worm gear clamp to tightened it down. It seems to be a very durable hose and I expect it will last a while even with the sun exposure. I would reorder.
5.0,The style and colors I liked nice.
5.0,"We didn't think this would hold up after washing but it did, still looks great. Print was nice, sized right, and loved that this shirt was soft and thin as we were wearing it in a cruise in the Caribbean where it was hot and humid."
5.0,Good shirt to use as beginner cosplayer.
5.0,She loved it was kinda small so next one she went 1 size up an it fit
5.0,Nice comfy work pants. Stretchy and stylish
5.0,"This blouse has U.S. flag design on front and back with the hem's fabric extending in a crisscross design. Nice, comfy, casual blouse."
5.0,I ordered these for my husband and he loved everything about them.
5.0,Bought for my son. Fit a little big but he's very thin. The quality of the leather is great very soft and well made. Recommend this seller their packaging was great.
5.0,VERY Nice Looking on my Overcoat Lapel!!!
5.0,These are super cute and fit just as I expected they would.
5.0,I bought these for my grandson to wear to the rodeo and the have held up much longer than I expected. He even loved them...didn't want to take them off and is still wearing them 6 months later.
5.0,Love these! My baby girl is 9mo. And these fit just right on her with extra room for her to grow into.
5.0,Bought these because I needed some lounge pants I could wear that weren‚Äôt tight leggings. A bit more high waisted And longer than expected But I like them regardless. I purchased a medium.
5.0,What you say ? Buy it .. if you can dress you'll see what I mean ! Pick your size honestly and it will fit !
5.0,Looks just like my own Pandora stopper beads.
5.0,Its a great hoodie and I plan on wearing it a lot
5.0,"This is a very pretty dress, but as a tall lady I can't wear it. I am six feet, mostly leg. This dress came to about mid thigh, and there would be no question of being able to bend over at all. The fabric is nice and heavy, and it looks more expensive than it was. I just wish it was a bit longer."
5.0,"Bought this bracelet for my Seiko Sumo. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with the Seiko bracelet except it was just a bit too small being the watch is a JDM model. I saw the Strapcode Endmill online and really liked the looks. In person it looks even better. I think it gives my Sumo, which is a beautiful watch, an even higher end look. The bracelet is well constructed with solid end links and the links themselves are attached with screws for easy sizing. My wrists are large so, all I had to use were the micro adjustments.<br />The Endmill bracelet is really comfortable on the wrist due to the construction of the links.<br />I've bought three Strapcode bracelets and they are all well constructed and sharp looking. If you're looking for a good after market bracelet, you can't go wrong with Strapcode."
5.0,I love these purple thermal bags. Lots of space to put a lot of items and to keep them cold. Love the purple
5.0,"It was perfect for my Egyptian goddess outfit I put together, however I did end up taking it off before the night was over it did start to irritate my neck a little when I started sweating I guess but that‚Äôs probably just me, overall it was cute I got a lot of compliments ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,These jocks are comfortable and they look great! Love wearing them during my workouts!
5.0,Very pleased to find that Alicia Klein Brands was offering this product on Amazon as it was a perfect gift for my niece who was traveling.
5.0,Love the color and the fit.  Wish it were more affordable.
5.0,blue
5.0,"I'm  completely in Love with my ReduShaper.  I've  been overweight for almost a year, but now I'm  working out using my shaper and I've  noticed that my clothes are fitting better and I've  lost 10 pounds. I'll  definitely recommend this to my husband and friends"
5.0,Skirts are more than worth the price paid. They wear and flow well . Colors are vivid and pleasing to the eye.
5.0,Quick delivery and as described. Good value for the price!
5.0,"The dress was a perfect match to the picture on Amazon, fit as expected and was of good quality.  Very comfortable and paired with nice jewelry was perfect for a winter wedding.  Great inexpensive dress. Love it!"
5.0,My favorite nose rings
5.0,"I'd like to say, I'm an incredibly heavy sleeper.  I would have to set an hour's worth (Sometimes more) of alarms to ensure I'd get up on time.  My wife would inevitably end up waking before me, and I'd generally still only wake up to her kicking me.  The first night I got this, I was skeptical.  There are many bad reviews, and I was still worried I'd sleep through the shock.  I was mostly correct to be worried to sleep through it, however, upon setting it to 100%, I do not sleep through it now!  I've been waking up on the first alarm for about a week now.  I feel like I'm getting much better sleep considering I'm not a groggy mess hitting snooze for an hour to two hours.  It's incredible!<br />Also, to address the negative reviews, I'm mostly curious if people just don't understand how it works.  I've had little to no issues.  I've had trouble connecting twice, and all I did was turn off my phone Bluetooth and then turn it back on, and voila!  It automatically connected upon my phone reestablishing Bluetooth.  I haven't had a problem with it not registering that I have an alarm set.  As a matter of fact, when I don't have it connected to my phone, it will still go off if I had an alarm set!  Not to mention, I have only charged this once in a week, and it's still at 59% battery as of writing this.  Granted, I only use it for sleeping.  Needless to say, I'm beyond happy with my purchase and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
5.0,"Really cute shirt..I am 5'4 145 lbs. Bought the medium and for me fits perfect since I don't like my clothes to fit right, has extra room. Really soft."
5.0,"I received exactly what it shows on the picture! I was so worried based on negative reviews but i was pleasantly surprised to receive exactly  what i expectect! I am obsessed with this dress. I am a new mom, breastfeeding is hard as it is but this dress makes it so much easier. I can wear it at home, answer the door to get my groceries, sleep in it, nurse in it. I can do everything in it! Its an everyday/ everything dress! Soft, stretchy like a great quality tshirt. Sooooo soft. Its beautiful. I got a small. It says L on the tag but whatever! I love it! Not sure why people complain is too large when is clearly meant to be an oversized dress lol"

5.0,"Really like these ~ good feel, nice fit, super fashionable."
5.0,My favorite pair of boots! So good i felt inclined to write a generic review hoping I can inspire the next tentative soul to take this financial investment and receive overwhelming compliments from acquaintances you desperately void small talk with.
5.0,Very good. My son like that
5.0,My father absolutely loves this robe
5.0,"Seems like a really well made purse super cute and I like it quite a lot! Shoulder strap comes inside of the purse, so you can decide whether or not you want to use it.<br />Only one pocket on the inside.~<br /><br />Color of the keys were the color I expected, but the rest of the pink seems to be more of a purplish tinted pink?<br />So if you're particular about color my photos better represent the in person color then the listing photos at the time of this review."
5.0,I liked the sweater for the character and for the ugly sweater parties
5.0,I ordered a large size. I normally wear a medium but I ordered a size up and it fits perfect. It has two hoods I love it

5.0,WONDERFUL!  This watch is much better than what I hope to get.  It is beautiful.  The picture in posted on amazon does not do it‚Äôs justice.  And It keeps time precisely = clock in my ipad pro.<br />The watch is easy to put on/off.  Fit perfectly for my wrist and with my bracelets.<br />It does not get fog... and can handle my everyday use nicely.  I am so pleased...I am hoping and looking to buy more from this seller.... I still want to buy addition one with two time zone on small rectangle clock face....
5.0,Small but roomy. Perfect overnight bag.
5.0,"Purchased these for my daughter. She doesn't have her ears pierced but I really wanted something cute for pictures. They are larger than I expected, so they were pretty huge on her 3 year old ears. They clipped on and stayed put without pinching and hurting her. They are very bright and shiny.

5.0,"I almost hate to rave too much about these shades as they feel like such a great secret.  Super beautiful sunglasses.  I searched ALL over the famous internets and after much research landed on these. I love the flat top style and ordered the tortoise, which I think is especially attractive.  Dark fading lenses of high quality - 100% UVA and UVB.  Heavy quality material and feel to these sunglasses.  Excellent seller too.  Package arrived quickly in an appropriately sized and well-packaged box.  Will buy from them again.  Love.  Love.  Love."

5.0,"Nice hat, love the gray and logo too."

5.0,Love it. I‚Äôm gonna buy another color so I can layer them.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous!!! I wear it all the time. The material is thick, not flimsy, but it breathes and it's a little stretchy. It's perfect. I love it. The fit was a bit loose, but it was fitting enough that it wasn't too noticeable. But I maybe wish I ordered a size smaller. Hasn't stopped me from wearing it to work once a week"
5.0,Excellent color and fabric texture. Comfortable and practical.
5.0,This band is beautiful. It feels solid and was easy to size by removing links. The tool and extra pins were an added bonus.

5.0,"So pretty, I love it! Was a little hard to open the clasp the 1st time but it gets easier as it gets used"
5.0,The mask locks are my 'go to' kind when I make masks. They are easy to use and so small they aren't even noticed when you're wearing the mask.
5.0,Very lightweight and comfortable. Very good value. I could‚Äôve bought a half sizer to wear with socks but I‚Äôm sure they will loosen with wear.
5.0,"I bought this shirt in grey, size small, and am very happy with it!<br /><br />I really like the fabric. It's super soft, drapes well, and feels sturdy and thick rather than sheer and thin and flimsy like another brand's similar shirt that I bought.<br /><br />The cut is flattering. I'm super skinny, 28C (sister size to 32A), with normal width shoulders, and I don't look super flat or like I'm bursting out at the shoulders. It's not so drapey that I look like I'm drowning, and it doesn't make me look pregnant even though I've got mom belly.<br /><br />The pockets are really awesome. I carry my phone on one side, men's style wallet and keys on the other. The pockets are big enough to hold my stuff, and the fabric is sturdy enough that it doesn't sag."
5.0,"Originally bought this shirt for my trip to Jamaica. Obviously, the trip has been canceled because of the China Virus. The shirt is ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è It has the look at feel of a $100+ shirt. It is a little tight in the arms. If your a bro and lift arms heavy this may be a little tight in the arms. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 and usually around 260lbs. It fits perfectly almost like it was tailored.  It is a bit thicker than I thought for linen, but it‚Äôs still ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:aa85a7ca790cf463f012812d8a771fcc]] Show stopping, head turning, vibe catching. I got a size small because everyone was saying how giant the jacket was. I am a very tall woman!!!<br />I am super skinny but I am almost 5 10!<br />This jacket is so warm you will be hot it definitely needs to be cold outside!<br />It is so beautiful and so well-made I want to order another one"
5.0,"The watch was safely placed on a pillow and in a box. It had no scratches. Whenever I turned it on, it started to work. I am very pleased with this watch."
5.0,Quality strap and hardware. Like this strap!
5.0,"Very happy with these.  They fit right, feel right and make me wish I'd have switched over sooner (used to wear boxers).  I thought I'd try them even though they were expensive.  I figured if they aren't worth it, I'll never buy them again.<br />I will buy them again."
5.0,Love it and material is good as well
5.0,"Great quality and fit my face perfectly. The lenses that I selected weren't overly dark, but seem to protect well."
5.0,"I've been wearing this toe ring since I purchased it back in  July 2021 (8 months). I do not take it off. I shower with it wear open and closed toes shoes.  So far it has not rusted or turned my skin green. It's extremely comfortable to wear,  thin yet  durable.  I can't even feel it on my toe.  It's fantastic. I will be purchasing more. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Best workout tanks, love them. Wish there were more colors because they are so comfortable I'd wear them everyday."

5.0,I had many compliments on this dress.  I did have to pin the top to not show as much cleavage.
5.0,"Was very excited when I ordered these based on the reviews.  They just arrived and I could not wait to put a pair on.  The material in fantastic, high quality and thick.  They sit very nicely high on my waist and provide nice coverage.  They are very comfortable, with room for a guy :-) ...but also make me feel very sexy wearing them.  Don't hesitate to get these.  You will love them whether a girl, guy or sissy!"
5.0,fits as described
5.0,"Very cute with jeans and boots- its soft and does have a little crop to it- id say its a bit oversized in my opinion but not huge. It does have a little of a mock neck that isn't show in the pictures up close unless you know to look for it but its super cute. It has a neat texture to the sweater that makes it look different from the rest. Pretty well made, super happy with it!"
5.0,The quality was amazing for the price. It doesn't turn my finger green like some jewelry i've purchased online and the little details on the ring gives it a great touch.

5.0,Nice fit and the quality is really amazing. It's not your typical cheap low quality cardigan It's something worth It's value. I'm pregnant during the time a received the item and although the buttons didn't close the rest of me seemed fine. I won't be pregnant forever so I can't wait to wear it after my pregnancy.

5.0,Beautiful shirt but it runs very small. The shoulders dont look like the picture. But very pretty
5.0,"My details:<br />43"" bust<br />38"" waist<br />43"" hips<br /><br />I originally ordered the XL, which was form fitting but not uncomfortably tight at all. I did return it because it was a little too short and if you wear any spanx under it, it clings and doesn't hang nicely and it ends up rising up even higher on the body. So I ordered the 2XL and it fits wonderfully. It hugs the body very nicely but still has some wiggle room and is about 2.5 inches longer on me than the XL. It can tie in the front or the back, but not having a flat stomach, I'm definitely a fan of it in the front. :) The thickness of this is a plus because it doesn't show every lump and bump, and it's warm. I actually found this dress mentioned in some article and that people were raving about it. I totally understand why!"
5.0,Good material and style to carry. It is great for groceries as an alternative to plastic. No odor.<br />It is also great idea to carry kids beach toy.

5.0,The kids liked their watch. It was pretty.<br /><br />This watch was very attractive. It had a very smooth and sleek look. It looks very nice on the wrist.<br /><br />It is very flattering. It fits well on. It is very comfortable to wear. It goes on and off easily.<br /><br />It worked without a problem. It kept good time.<br /><br />The quality is very good. This would make a very good gift for someone.<br /><br />The price is reasonable. I would recommend it.

5.0,"I love real ladybugs and this lovely little charm. It's beautifully designed and stands out on my bangle. Can easily fit on a Pandora bracelet, but I like wearing it on the NQ bangle that I purchased at the same time.

5.0,I had never heard of this brand until recently. I find their garments to be of a high quality and affordable. These pants are comfortable and the fabric is not too thin. They do provide some compression as well. The boot cut balances out my fuller thighs (at least I think they do!). It‚Äôs worth taking a chance on this brand.
5.0,Love these gloves....they are super cool and look awesome with my bike. :)
5.0,"Love it , will order all colors"
5.0,"This shirt is of much higher quality than other shirts at this price point. The cotton is a little heavier than most all-cotton shirts (more of a work shirt than something you would hang a tie on). Suited my needs to a tee as I like all natural materials, and I would highly recommend it to people with similar requirements."
5.0,"Love! It's so comfy, soft and very flattering!"

5.0,"I bought 3 of these shorts. I've worn these to workout in and to lounge around. Very comfortable for someone who hated shorts lol<br /><br />2 are the same style: ""Black"" and ""Lavender Gray"". These are soft/smooth in the front and have some mesh at the bottom. My pictures show these two. This style is slightly more fitted.<br /><br />The 3rd is ""2028 Black"" which has a bunched up waistband and no mesh. This was a bit looser on me.<br /><br />Both black shorts were bought in a size 8. Lavender was a size 6 and not noticeably smaller/tighter on me.<br /><br />Stats:<br />My waist is 27-28"" and hips 37"". Thighs are 21.5"". I wear a size 4/6 in Lululemon bottoms and a size 4 in Aerie jeans."

5.0,"I have a mixture of 30D, 32C bras - I received the medium and should have went will the small. Even will the band being a little loose - it does give good support - enough for low impact exercise (walking etc). Definitely the most comfortable sports bra I own. The padding can easily be removed. Nice neutral color and design. The crisscross back goes well with many sport tanks. So happy to receive this at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,exact color and fit.  Loved them

5.0,Very lightweight and comfortable and I'm going to buy another pair
5.0,"I invested in an expensive pair of boots and they were starting to scuff up ruining it‚Äôs appearance and water proofness. I remembered neatsfoot oil from being a kid, I new Fiebing's to be a good company and they offered pure oil in a practical sized container. My boots look brand new, there water proofed, im pleased. One caution though, read label, it will slightly darken light colored leather, however, the end result is very pleasing."

5.0,So comfortable and I get so many compliments
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit. I live in Hawaii, so I own and have seen a MILLION different types of swimsuits. This suit is so different from all the others and so striking. I wore it yesterday to our most recent trip to the beach (we're there 2-3 days a week) and I received so many compliments while walking the length of the beach.<br /><br />I received a MEDIUM. I'm 5'4"", 117 lbs. and the Medium fits perfectly. It's takes a little finesse to tie the striped side just right...too tight, and your right boob looks squashed. Too loose, and your boob isn't supported properly (there's foam cup liners inside the suit like any other swimsuit). Just right though, and the girls look great!<br /><br />If you're looking for a swimsuit that will stand out and be different from EVERYONE else on the beach or at the pool, then this is the suit you're looking for. Absolutely love it and definitely recommend it!"
5.0,"Super cute and feminine! Fit just as expected. I'm 5'7, 135lbs., 32D and I ordered a small. A lot of compliments on the sweater and like all PattyBoutik clothes, it's very flattering material and cuts."
5.0,I got it for my granddaughter for a school trip to NYC.  She was thrilled and it worked great and made her feel so much safer.
5.0,"These are pretty solid workout shirts. Sweat wicking, light and surprisingly durable. Not to mention they are designed to eccentuate your arms and chest which makes upper body days all the more satisfying."
5.0,My son loved these socks!  Great for either dress slacks or jeans.
5.0,"Very cute and easy to open.  Large enough for keys, lipstick, driver's license and small wallet."

5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, it fits like a glove and it is exactly depicted in the picture the way I  received it. I got one in khaki and black size small .<br /> I am  5'9<br />130  pounds  and my bra size is 34 E<br /> The material is super stretchy and very comfortable ."

5.0,"Love these boots! Using them for Harley Quinn, Black Canary and probably some other cosplays, curve a bit at the heel and toe. I got the &#34;multi colored&#34; ones and they're black and shiny and 1/2 the price as the regular ones!"
5.0,These are exactly as described. Great product. Great price.
5.0,"I love these, they look really good."
5.0,Purchased for my sister to use on Halloween... She has youngsters so I wanted something less scary - this headband is perfect in that regard.  I think it looks better in person.  It's bouncy and fun.
5.0,"If this dress came in 10 colors, I would buy all 10.  It is the perfect maxi dress! I'm 5'9&#34; and the length is just right. It's incredibly flattering, and if you're bigger on the bottom, as I am, it drapes beautifully and doesn't cling."
5.0,Very functional and well made with quality materials

5.0,exactly what I wanted thank you
5.0,It's nice but too small for me
5.0,"The option to custom order a ring is the only way to go. Do a little research on what the different factors mean (diamond clarity, etc.) and you can set your bounds on a ring that matches your specifications and budget. I purchased the ring for my wife (2nd marriage). We've been married for 6 years and both wear plain wedding bands ($15 specials). I had waited far too long to get her something nice and she was absolutely surprised and thrilled when I gave her the box to open. I wouldn't hesitate to use the service for my wife's next surprise."

5.0,"So much love for these pants! They stretch just right, they allow you to move freely, and they fit snuggly around my curves, but they do not give me muffin top!"
5.0,"Great, great functionality. We used the cash envelopes for several budget categories and this is PERFECT. I have had this item for a couple of years and carry it daily in my purse. There is wear on the edges because the gold material is very soft but other than that it has held up perfectly. I‚Äôve recommended this product to lots of people!"
5.0,Loved the color and how it fit.
5.0,"I have been trying many different bands like this and this is my absolute favorite! I‚Äôve been wearing it for a few weeks now the the quality is fantastic, no issues. This strap is my favorite because it tucks in the doesn‚Äôt stick out. Best bang for buck 100%"

5.0,"They are heavy but I was ready for this. It's not a plastic but a real stone that's why you gotta be ready for some weight on your ears. Besides that, they are amazing! I use them for dressing up casual outfits."
5.0,Super comfortable. Looks great with boots. The color was definitely what I expected.

5.0,"I gave a matching set as a gift to my best friend's parents, and both the company and the shirt was excellent. The men's shirt fit true to size but the women's shirt needed a size up. The company exchanged it right away with no hassle and the happy couple wear them on their cruises (of which, they spend 70% of their time per year doing). The colors were great and as pictured."

5.0,"Perfect,  just as described."
5.0,Great item. Very comfortable. Exceeds my expectations.
5.0,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect or if this was just pseudoscience. My son has sensory processing issues. I hardly ever write reviews but I feel so strongly about this products‚Äô potential impact on people that I had to. 10 minutes after I put the tank on my 6 year old he asks me randomly if it‚Äôs supposed to make him feel calm. I did not tell him before hand what the shirt was for.<br />I answered his question with a yes and he said good, I feel a lot better with it on. From one worried parent to another, buy the shirt you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
5.0,"The green color of the swimsuit is nice, the fabric is too comfortable, and it is also a good pajamas after taking a bath at home."

5.0,Excelente... Fabric Great!!
5.0,absolutely adore!
5.0,For the price the dress is beautiful made. I gave it 4 stars due to it arriving with a small hole in the sheer area and I added a clear strip of material across the back near my neck line to keep the dress up. The arms seem to fall off when I tried it on. Just made the adjustment by adding the clear string. I wore this to a Mardi Gras ball in New Orleans 2.21.2020
5.0,"Will be using the chevrons on a ""Quilt of Honor"" for my husband."
5.0,"I love it! Super soft and comfy!<br />I'm a small M and I initially bought a size M which was way too large, size S fits perfectly"

5.0,Bought this for my hubby when we were going on our Anniversary cruise he loved it.
5.0,"Most masks do not fit a man's face very well, they slide down the nose and are restrictive.  This mask fits his face comfortably and covers his nose to his chin very well.  The material is a good blend of stretchy cotton. I guess we will know if they shrink after washing in about a week when they are washed, I don't plan to put them in the dryer.  The filter insert makes me feel confident that he has good protection from virus germs.  The adjustable ear loops have definitely added to the comfort."
5.0,Great protection while using a chainsaw.
5.0,Very goofy hat lol daughter loves it. Good quality.
5.0,"My daughter loves this! She is a 4T, so I ordered a size 4-6. She has room to grow, but it's not too big. Great quality! Very pleased!"

5.0,"Absolutely loved this. Quality necklace.  I am petite, 72 years young, and wanted a shorter chain that I would either wear alone or with other<br />chains/necklaces. The 16 inch length is perfect for me."
5.0,"I really like this band. Very easy to put on and off. The quality of the stainless steel is very nice. The band tapers so it‚Äôs thinner at the bottom, so it looks good on a person with a smaller wrist."
5.0,"Love these, quality made and super comfy and stretchy, great work out or running pants"
5.0,Very helpful to keep our masks on hand. Kids don‚Äôt leave them on a desk at school or drop them. They are easy to wear and adjustable in the length!
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes and wore them all the time until she grew out of them. Great for walking babies!
5.0,Great replacement for a well broken in robe
5.0,I get lots of compliments on this case. Super cute
5.0,"These arrived on time, they look exactly as pictured, and they fit perfectly! I read a lot of reviews that they were hard to get out once you put them in, but (knock on wood) I haven't had that issue at all. They come in and out very easily and look great! Would absolutely recommend these. I have sensitivity to all metals in my ears, including surgical steel and hypoallergenic options, and the acrylic seems to be a really great alternative with a lot of options. Will most definitely buy more designs in the future."
5.0,"Great gloves, I was at New York City temperatura probably 30 degree they keep my hands warm. Very light material<br />Great gloves Not for snow"
5.0,There earrings are really nice and elegant. The built is great and it measurement of the listing is spot on. My wife really likes it and not daughter is also asking for it. I would definitely recommend these.
5.0,"If you have a hard time finding wide enough footwear, look no further. These are so soft and comfortable right out of the box, they required no break in period. I was surprised at how roomy they are. One caveat: if you don‚Äôt like feeling every pebble, these aren‚Äôt the shoes for you. They are close to barefoot with the sole pliability. I personally love that I can feel the maple tree spinners on the sidewalk."
5.0,These leggings are a mid-rise legging and fit true to size.  Lots of stretch which made them squat proof when in the gym today!  I‚Äôm always leery of side stripes on pants but these are super slimming!
5.0,I like these hoops because they can't hide under long hair.
5.0,"I love this thing. It's everything you want in a high collar. The buttons are real, and it's pretty high quality for the price!<br /><br />I will say that it does ride up every once in awhile, but with the right shirt it stays in place."
5.0,"Fue un regalo, est√°n lindos"
5.0,is is was good I love it that exactly what I was looking like it  I give it* five star  Hope to see you soon  victor arthur

5.0,I bought this bag in pink and LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! This is the perfect size and so well made.  It's extremely cute and has the long shoulder strap as well.
5.0,"My first go-around was in 46 degrees with zero wind and total cloud cover. Once I got the pistons pumping, my legs were nice and toasty. From that experience, I can well imagine that sunny days in the mid-thirties should present no problem. Also, the padding was surprisingly comfortable. This is a good product, and not just for the price, it truly is good."
5.0,The material is so silky and soft!! Heaven to wear!! Love Love this!!  My go to pants!!  Color is as pictured!
5.0,Very comfortable and perfect size to fit.  These pants don't breath well so 90 degrees plus causes you to sweat and get hot.  I wouldn't use them in warm weather.

5.0,"It was the perfect, casual shirt to wear with shorts on a hot summer day."

5.0,I orderd thinking it was a watch. PLZ READ CAREFULLY. &#34; IT IS A RING.&#34; It is same as pic thou. But my mistake!
5.0,Second one I have bought. Have had one since 2013 and it is perfect so bought #2 when I bought a Rolex.

5.0,I love the material and the light weightness of it. I got a size up because I'm gaining and it fits perfect and very much comfortable. I plan to order the other colors I just love them all.
5.0,"Bought these for my teenage girls for school, after school sports. They were starting to have problems with their arches (much like Dad) and peeling feet. I wanted to get compression socks with no additional buildup at the ball or heel. Most socks build those areas up, destroying the purpose of orthotics that distribute your weight evenly.<br /><br />They love them and report less tired feet but most importantly no pain in the arches. Since the socks naturally disperse moisture (unlike cotton that stores it and stay soggy) they keep feet dry, so no peeling.<br /><br />Highly recommend these socks. Great price too!"
5.0,Love this cover up. I usually wear a size 16 and it‚Äôs very comfy and adorable.
5.0,"Perfect rainbow fit, will last a a few years"

5.0,There are so many pieces in this set with room to pack a lot in them.  Quality is good.
5.0,"I am 5'11"", size 10, bought a XL - perfect fit for me.  Fabric is great, soft, lightweight, has a stretch to it, and I like the waffle texture.  After having children I appreciate the knot detail, it flatters my tummy, gives me  a little freedom in the mid section.  I bought the light blue (which is beautiful), but it is a tiny transparent in certain lighting, so consider that when looking at colors.  I will buy again."
5.0,"No complaints from my wife, so 5 stars are in order."

5.0,My sister loves these pop it‚Äôs and unicorns so I bought this for her 15th birthday this year

5.0,"I am 5'5"", 168 lbs, not too big around the hips but do carry extra belly ""cushioning"". I like how these pants fit me. Comfortable, light, and not too see-through. Perfect for the summer!"

5.0,Esta hermosa pero justa
5.0,"I used the clips to replace a stretch loop that held the excess straps. They work well for me. And I have plenty of spares. I have seen other reviews mentioning the tightness of the clip. Mine were tight, and I doubled the strap to ensure it stays. Good product."
5.0,Daughter loved it.  Did just right and colors were as pictured.
5.0,Absolutely love this tank top. The material is extremely soft.
5.0,With all the junk product out there in the belt market- this is a very dressy quality leather belt at a reasonable price. I think the 35mm width is great for both dress and casual pants particularly if you aren‚Äôt skinny. It stays in place  better than a narrow belt and doesn‚Äôt slide down below your waist<br />Trafalgar is a great product if you can get it at the right price.
5.0,I really like these shoes
5.0,"Fits as described, my daughter uses them as undershirts and loves them."
5.0,"Super cute and comfy! Lately I have been purchasing more of my clothes on Amazon Prime.  Mainly because I am a mom and I hate shopping now.<br />Anywho, It's always sketchy to buy because you never know if things are reviewed by the same audience or if they are completely fake.<br />  This dress ended up surpassing my expectations so I am pretty happy about it!<br />I am 5'5, have nursing breast (34DDD) and weigh about 135 pounds bought a small.  I have a Momma pouch and this dress still looks good. I want to buy others but the other colors I want don't ship via AmazonPrime.  They wont arrive for another month and Michigan summer is almost over.<br />I would also say this dress is better quality than ones I have purchased in the past from Targ*t or K*hls."

5.0,MF OG Chappie. Got this for my friend who loves DieAntwoord and this movie. True to size and graphics are great.
5.0,This is my favorite hat ever. I bought it like 2 years ago and I'm wearing it as I write this. I've washed it a few times with no issues. It doesn't make a huge mess of my hair and it matches everything. I look a bit like a hipster but I'm alright as long as I don't wear a flannel with it. Or at all.
5.0,"I bought these in a medium, I'm 5'5&#34; 128lbs and the fit is perfect. They are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. Will be getting a few more."

5.0,Just the right size. Very nice.  Will use it for my trips.
5.0,Love the size and room. I can fill with lots of stuff.  GBR
5.0,I ordered this apron for his art class in school. He has yet to use it but the material is pretty thick and it fits him well. He is an average height 8 year old. You can adjust the neck strap which is great. It also has 2 front pockets which he liked.
5.0,"It is a very nice man's purse. Too big for me though, gave it to my son who always carries a lot of stuff in his billfold. Excellent leather, and configuration."
5.0,The bag fits all my gear and is perfect.
5.0,I have long fingers and skinny hands.  These are the first pair of gloves that I have been able to find that actually fit me right.
5.0,The color is absolutely beautiful and it fits perfectly! I love showing legs and this dress makes it possible without being too revealing.
5.0,"I love this shirt.  I will say, however, that it does run on the small side.  I normally wear a Small or size 4, but bought this in a Large.  It fits me perfectly so I can't even imagine how the actual Small would fit.  I am looking forward to wearing it a lot!"
5.0,Good quality & I wear everyday
5.0,This brand of leos is the absolute best!
5.0,I love it! She will grow into it lol I couldn't find anything smaller that I loved as much.  Thank you!

5.0,"I love everything about this dress, great quality, I get a. Lots of compliments on it"
5.0,"I have a SuperSonics fan in my house, so every year on gift giving occasions, I buy Sonics gear. This bucket/ fisherman hat was such great quality. It was in a sealed bag and tagged. The stitching is nice. My husband has a head of hair and this hat was a perfect diameter. It looks great with other wearable Sonics gear in our closet."
5.0,"These are so much fun to wear, especially when you are driving or are hiking on a sunny day. They give you plenty of protection. I have gotten so many compliments. Beautiful vibrant color, I‚Äôve ordered the red and just placed and order of the blue one."
5.0,My son loves the color and the fit!
5.0,"Good quality, sizing was the problem I‚Äôm size 10 so I ordered an XXL well it was huge, but I made the decision because some reviewers said that it runs super small, lesson learned, I think a size L will fit perfectly, thank god is free returns, I‚Äôm sending it back and getting an L instead. But buy it this is worth it"
5.0,"Love this thing. I have to bend over a lot at work and I love to wear flowy comfy tops. But, I am very flat chested so usually when I bend, there's this vast open space where boobs should be filling up a shirt lol. And you can see down my bra or worse, everything o_o Even with regular, tighter fitting tank tops and scoop neck shirts, there's a bit too much exposure. This collar is great because it's cute af, matches my style so I can use it with everything, and is like a big, half-shirt sized censor bar for my lumps! Modesty, yo."
5.0,Very nice school bag! Highly recommended!
5.0,I bought these to be more eco-friendly. I found that they are sturdy I have put multiple gallons in one bag. I love that these come in case to store them I keep them in my trunk. I am able to make less trips because they store more and weight is better distributed. This is my first step switching to reusable items and the ease of it has lead me to exchange other items in my life.
5.0,It‚Äôs awesome Quality fit with a good price
5.0,They fit perfectly!!!
5.0,We purchased this for a trip into the snowy mountains. They kept my kids feet warm and comfortable while we were hiking/playing in the snow.

5.0,My daughter loves these glasses! Super cute and fits a toddler head well.
5.0,"Very cute watch! My daughter got this from &#34;Santa&#34;. Packaging was pretty bare, which for this occasion worked out perfectly."
5.0,"I do a lot of hiking in the summer months and this is a nice, light easy addition to keep dust out of my face, the sun off of my head or to wet it down and wear on my neck or head. when it is cool it is also easy to wear under a hat to cover my ears or my neck. I keep several in my hing and camping gear."
5.0,Flattering under my scrub top. I‚Äôm not sure is the compression is all that helpful for my back pain though.
5.0,"I am 5'5, 175 lbs. I thought I ordered a L but I guess I ordered a M. The length is perfect and I love the pattern and fabric but it shows every curve. At the moment they are not offering in a L so I am keeping and will wear around the house until I lose the pandemic pounds ; ). Would definitely buy another pattern in a L."
5.0,These came quickly and are the same great feel of all lularoe leggings

5.0,Good to use around the house and occasional trips outside.
5.0,I have purchased these several times. I invlude them as swag for little  girl dresses that I sell. The sets are adorable and great quality. Sometimes the paint is a little messy on some of the beads but all in all a great product. My little customers love them.
5.0,Its just lovely..... go for it wont regret.... yes it runs little small so better to order one size up
5.0,Great fabric....most beautiful.  Just too large.  I wear a size 2.
5.0,Just beautiful but I must admit bI haven't given it a good using yet. Looks great!
5.0,This thing is awesome!  Not something I would normally spend my money on but it was a gift.  Shortly after getting it I had to go out and clear snow in 15 degrees F and 20 MPH winds.  My head was the only warm part of my body.  Just awesome.  Time will tell on the durability but leather and real fur how can you go wrong.<br /><br />Not being a dues paying member of PETA I can't think of a better use for the rabbit's hide after he is done using it. (Well maybe a genuine Tonak hat from the Czech Republic.)  Highly recommended.
5.0,Bought for my nephew for Christmas.
5.0,Nice glasses. Fit nice. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,"This shirt fit very tightly on a slim child who normally wears a small and was difficult to get it on so we sized up. However, the results are amazing and my grandson‚Äôs behavior is remarkably improved! I highly recommend this !"

5.0,"Ordered the size 10: My son is 8 and a little tall for his age, it was slightly big but he will grow into it. I see this lasting til he‚Äôs a teenager as far as size. I‚Äôm hoping the quality is good enough to last awhile too. It‚Äôs very soft, thick and very well designed. I‚Äôll be ordering one for myself too."
5.0,Fast & Solid!
5.0,perfect for a gift!
5.0,"Very cool earrings. They are very small, which I expected and have a kind of chunky look. Well see how they hold up, but they look well made."
5.0,Pretty bracelet love it
5.0,my favorite industrial bar
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! I have medium length sisterlocs and was having a tough time finding something to put them in at night that didn't have the elastic band or dry out my locs. I bought a large to fit now and future. It's so soft and doesn't irritate me. It stays put and keeps my locs moisturized. Def worth the buy.
5.0,Great fun for a 4th of July or American holiday gathering
5.0,Finally!!! I can buy decent bras without having to burn a whole in my wallet. I am a 38 DD and they fit great. My hubby things they are incredibly sexy which is always a plus. I normally bought Victoria secret bras but I have to say I love these more. I have the coverage and support I needed with a good lift and the perfect amount of clevelage. I will buy again. They lasted through the wash great. I hang dry these no dryer!!!

5.0,I love the colors and they look great on my grandson.

5.0,Beautiful! I got it for a gift from our 9 month old son to his dad for Christmas
5.0,There nice looking. At a good price.

5.0,"Delivery was faster than expected and the product is just awesome, great quality. I bought it for my son‚Äôs Cat in the Hat day at school, they had to wear wacky hats and he really loved it. The fact that it was also a lego activity and me not just buying some random crazy hat was a big win for me."
5.0,"I actually wore this for my 40th bday and am pregnant! it had nice stretch, showed of my cutie pie baby bump nicely, and was super comfortable."
5.0,My son loves this and started a trend at school with all his friends ordering the jacket. They are so cute in 4th grade!
5.0,"I've already purchased 3 of these tops and I love them. I like the fact that they are form fitting. I have trouble getting tops that aren't too long or too loose on me because I am petite but these fit perfect. It's nice that all 3 fit pretty much the same, a lot of times when I buy something each color will vary in how it fits. I feel it's a great price for the quality!"
5.0,It is perfect for a wedding or s<br />Whenever you want something a lil sparkly
5.0,I've used heel plates for about 20 years.  Just got these and found them to be an excellent product and a reasonable price.
5.0,"This is my second review, now that I have had these for a while.  These are the very best I have ever owned.  They do not feel like a control panty at all; extremely comfortable, yet do the job. A perfect fit. They launder beautifully, holding their shape and color.  These panties are very feminine and attractive, making them a pleasure to wear.  I recommend this product  wholeheartedly.  You will not be disappointed!"
5.0,Daughter and her friend both received as gifts.  They love them.
5.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and 135 lbs. and small fit me well. The style of this top adds some billowy fabric to the tummy area, and I think that hides any actual tummy showing (at least for me‚Äîmight depend on your body type). Overall I feel very comfortable in this top and would recommend it."
5.0,This was a gift to a friend who is an attorney. It looked nice and was a big hit.
5.0,It's the perfect wallet. What more can I say.
5.0,"these are the best fit over my glasses, such a good fit they look like regular glasses lens not snap on.if your eyes are such as any light hurts this snap on is what you need..very happy..ty"

5.0,I was hesitant due to some of the reviews but I‚Äôm glad I gave it a try. It‚Äôs sturdy and looks great. The only downside was it took a little longer to get here. Other than that it‚Äôs a great buy
5.0,It is both comfortable and elegant
5.0,"Soft like butter!! They‚Äôre stretchy, super soft, and so comfortable. I bought size large and I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô9, 185 lbs. My only issue (which isn‚Äôt even really an issue) is that I have a cat and dog and their hair sticks to it Very easily.. but that‚Äôs my own problem lol"
5.0,These came a few days after ordering and I was very pleased. They fit my face well and didnt look as awkward as I thought they were going to look. Im happy about how cute they are.
5.0,"Pretty good smooth backing, not scratchy. Very comfortable. Looks great! Thanks!"

5.0,"It fit perfect, and I feel like the set is really well made. The material isn‚Äôt paper thin and the colour is gorgeous. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, my waist is 27‚Äù, hips 38‚Äù,and  I wear a 36B. I got a SMALL and it fit great. Hope this helps someone. (:"
5.0,Nice quality.<br />Love the shirt
5.0,"Any kind of MGS fans can buy this and look badass without a problem. Many people won't recognize the emblem, but a fox with a knife looks awesome regardless."
5.0,Sunglasses are that thick plastic & beautifully designed. I have a round face and the fact that they are oversized and the shape of the frame really accentuate my face in a flattering way. I love the darkness of the lense. Theres something about black over sized sunglasses that look so elegant. This is one of them.
5.0,"i love these, they r amazing"

5.0,"I've not worn leg warmers since college, 50 years ago.  But I went kayak camping during a very cold week, and realized that leggings are the perfect accompaniment because they crush down to nothing and cover the part of my legs that remain bare when I wear my go to kayak leggings.  These marino long leg warmers are perfect.  Cuddly, easy on and off.  They look smart.  I'm thrilled with them.  Perfect solution for chilly legs."

5.0,Liked how dress stand out
5.0,I really enjoy the sweeter. Great quality. Probably would be best for fall and spring. I live where 20-30s is a common high temperature so it would be a little too thin for winter but other than that it‚Äôs really nice.
5.0,Bought as a future birthday gift for my friend.  It's very nice and the saying really says what I feel.  Can't wait to give it to her.
5.0,"Love the fit, looks great with leggings, very vibrant colors, lots of nice comments"
5.0,"Once I figured out how to adjust the band length and attach it to the watch correctly,  I had it upsid down the first time,  I really liked it.  The look was exactly what I wanted.  I did have an issue with it coming open every once in a while ,  I don‚Äôt know if it was because I did not get it fastened correctly or what.  I did quit using the band because if this."
5.0,"If you‚Äôre worried about it being itchy because of the sparkles don‚Äôt I wore this dress on a cruise (B.C. before covid) and I had no issue at all, all night in this dress! I needed it because it was for an elegant night and I‚Äôd say the shoe fits here. This was everything I needed and more and not out of my price range. I don‚Äôt feel it seem too cheap the dress was perfect and fit great"
5.0,"Excellent purchase.  Shipping prompt and jacket as advertised.  I had looked for an ice fishing jacket for my husband and ordered and ultimately returned two.  My son in law purchased one like this for snowmobiling - couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase!  Well worth the money, this will last my husband for years and years..."

5.0,Made her happy...
5.0,"I had ordered a couple of dresses for a wedding I was going to attend out of town. I needed the orders fast, and knew I wanted a '50s look. I ended up going with this dress ([[ASIN:B00UAHJCES Sleeveless Cocktail Party Dress Cotton Swing Dresses Size L F-11]]), but when I ordered it and another similar style, I knew I wanted a petticoat beneath it. I needed something that was available via Amazon Prime, so I found this one. I'm 5'1&#34;, 117 lbs. and usually wear a size 4-6.<br />This petticoat has enough give in the waistband. It is awesome. The color was perfect, adding a great peek of color beneath my skirt. I already had the red sash that I added to my dress, forgoing the belt that came with the dress.<br />I was concerned at first because the petticoat was SO flattened when it arrived. I fluffed it out and still was a little disappointed. However, I decided to put it in the dryer by itself on low for about 15 to 20 minutes, and that helped to add some &#34;oomph&#34; to it. I even added some sweet orange essential oil to a couple of wool dryer balls to the dryer to give the tulle some fragrance when I moved. I use a wheelchair, but guests at the wedding often helped me up out of the chair and assisted me in moving about - not only did I love it, so did they. People were so excited to see me looking good, and they loved my outfit.<br />The red is a rich red - think Coca-Cola red, and that's the color you get with this.<br />I was a little concerned that being 5'1&#34; would be a problem with a 26&#34; skirt, but I could take the waistband and shimmy it up or down to adjust it to the right length easily. The material is not scratchy, because most of the tulle is not up against your skin (even for me in a wheelchair).<br />I really think that even though this is not super poufy, it provides a great amount of pop for just a few layers of tulle. It's not that really stiff tulle that you'll find on short ballet tutus. But even though it's not super poufy, I think that a person who can move better than me will find some great fluidity and movement with this item.<br /><br />EDIT 11/29 - added pic of same crinoline with this dress:[[ASIN:B01CE1T4H2 YACUN Women's Vintage Floral 1920s Rockabilly Swing Cocktail Party Dress Black_L]], but note that the comments on that picture are about that dress in particular. You'll see how the crinoline works with the red trim on that dress, though.<br /><br />I know there have been reviewers who have said that their petticoat has torn/ripped after they wore it once. I don't know if that was a flaw with the material the company used for a particular color or what, but I have 1) worn this baby under three different dresses several times, and 2) tossed it in the dryer (on low for 15 minutes with wool dryer balls) to fluff it up right before I wear it each time and have had no problem."
5.0,Exactly as pictured and warm!

Orange is the color of sunshine and this does not disappoint for a sports jock or just an orange lover. Arrived in PERFECT condition. Easy to activate. No complex settings. Simple.

5.0,"They arrived on time, they fit good, goggles are a little straight don't bend on the nose, but still happy with my purchase for the price! Fits a toddler nice in the head, and fits an adult a little tight but okay, if you have a bigger than normal head they might not fit you well."
5.0,For the money the best one you could get.
5.0,This is a beautiful ring. Period.
5.0,True to size. Very comfortable. Memory foam sole. An odd neutral as it's not very lavender.
5.0,I like this shoe though a litttle big or feels good
5.0,"Bought for my husband because he tends to go through belts pretty often. I was skeptical but turns out these last; even more-so than really expensive ones. He loves it, has purchased more for different color and buckle options and I don‚Äôt think he will go back to a standard belt ever again. We have also purchased for other men in the family and they love them too! Highly recommend!"
5.0,Very worth it

5.0,"Love this necklace. It‚Äôs small and dainty. I never take it off, I sleep and shower with it and it never looses color. Just a beautiful piece. This is my second Dogeared cross necklace."
5.0,"When I first received these I was worried that the quality of the chain wouldn't be good, but so far they have held up. They are beautiful, and they look just like the pictures."
5.0,I wanted a second anchor point for my shade.  one higher up when the shade was not needed to be completely lowered and another set nearer to the ground.  this fit the bill and works perfectly
5.0,"How cute is this shawl?  I love this thing!  I was sent this black one from Pembrook Fleece to review for them and I cannot recommend it enough!<br />If you have been looking for something to just throw over your shoulders and keep you warm and cozy this shawl is a great choice.  It has great embroidery detail on the pockets to give it that stylish edge.  It's perfect to just throw over some cute leggings if your headed out on the town or to throw on while you are at home snuggling up to watch a movie.  Not only is it really cute but it's super soft and comfy!  I plan on taking mine camping with me this summer.  How perfect would this be for sitting around a campfire?<br /><br />I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."

The black v-neck is great however, the blue floral crew neck version material is too thin. Breast material is too thin for size large BOOBS! Haha. Ordering the v-neck version of same blue floral material today to see how that one is."

5.0,"Excellent quality hunting hat. This is a very nice Real tree hat. It has six breathing holes along the top to help keep your head cool. The is a camo strap with a metal buckle in the back to adjust the size of the hat. There are four rows of stitching around the edge of the hat holding it together which shows what  solid quality this is. It's very comfortable to wear. The orange color is bright, perfect for hunting in the woods, but the visor part is camo which I personally prefer. Overall, a top quality hat that will fit just about anyone and last for many years."

I bought long scarves before this purchase, but I'm glad I have these bonnets now my hair is properly covered. Did a shower test, took the bonnet off & my hair was barely damp!"

5.0,How did I ever live without Spanx!! I love them.
5.0,Stunning and simple piece

5.0,"My favorite hoody hands down,  Fits just right, arm length long enough for us tall guys (I'm 6' 05"") just right!"
5.0,"I was afraid to get this as an ""open box"", but I'm glad I did.  I got a super awesome deal on it.  It is a perfect addition to my dresser.  It is sturdy and well made, but a lot bigger than I expected.  The very minor scratches due to the open box are not a big deal, since the color is supposed to be ""distressed"" it blends right in. I had a hard time finding the so called scratches.  I'm glad someone else complaint, because it was definitely my gain.  :)"
5.0,"Beautiful chain, stainless steel is awesome because it doesn't tarnish, this chain is cheap and it has shiny look to it like if it were diamond cut, I got 20 inch I recommend getting 22-24"

5.0,"Very pretty, I brushed the fur before wearing it to get any loose fur. Great for a wedding!"
5.0,"This sweater is so comfy, it‚Äôs like wearing a blanket! I loved the pastel pink ‚Äúblush‚Äù color. It does seem like it might lose its shape over time so I‚Äôve made a real effort to not yank into on/off as I normally do my clothes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 180 lbs and ordered an XL (my usual size), could have done with a L but I actually like the oversized fit. It‚Äôs definitely boxy so be prepared to belt it in some kind of way if you want to show your waist. Would be super cute over a button-up with collar and sleeve cuffs peeking out. I‚Äôm obsessed."
5.0,"My mom Loves it! She places all of her cards (rewards card, calling card, and credit cards) she said that she still have enough space and wonder that the smaller versiob is already enough for her. The down side is that the lock 9f the wallet can be easily broken when you always open your wallet. The wallet really does look like the picture"
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for. I am making a Duke Nukem costume for Halloween this year. It came exactly as pictured and is a great quality product  Fast delivery and a friendly company.
5.0,One of the Christmas gifts for my granddaughter.  They were something she wanted.  Well-made and very fashionable.  She loved them!

5.0,Comes with a handy tool to take links out with
5.0,It's so cute and perfectly fits my chrome book!
5.0,Everything about the mask was awesome except that it fit a little too snug. Maybe they could have been made a tiny bit larger to cover the nose and chin comfortably and the elastic a bit larger as well.
5.0,"I have very poor vision at night.  When I told my Dad, who is a professional truck driver, this he recommended purchasing a pair of glasses with yellow lenses.  After scouring Amazon for a pair that looked good for a woman, I found this pair.  I traveled to Florida from Texas and drove in the evening for several hours.  Typically, this would be very difficult for me, but with these glasses the glare was reduced and I was able to determine distances better.  They helped focus my eyes and helped with eye fatigue.  I would definitely recommend them.  I like the shape and also comfort of these glasses as well."
5.0,"I love this belly ring, it's really pretty.  I've been wearing it for a few weeks now with no issues.  It's kind of big though, so bear that in mind.  I'm far from a flat stomach and have a fairly deep belly button so while it's a little big, it's fine for me.  For someone with a flat stomach though, or a shallow belly button, it would probably be too big."
5.0,"nice looking, good arrangement of slots and interior pockets, large size has not been a problem...."
5.0,"My grandson loves Clemson.this hat is colorful, warm and well made."
5.0,Tis is simply beautiful earring

5.0,Love it!! Thanks guys!!
5.0,Product is as described..fast shipment
5.0,Great deal. Great product.
5.0,"I was immediately impressed by how flattering this was on. Snug fit, but I believe it's supposed to be. Great as activewear even for a non dancer because it's light and does not move around."
5.0,I love purchasing these type Chinese cut underwear. I find they shape around the rear and over the stomach very nicely! Good fit for American shaped women and girls. I would buy again.
5.0,Fast shipping. Also got a bonus green bag.
5.0,Love this dress. Wear it often. Very comfortable and great length.

5.0,"I absolutely love this band, it‚Äôs very comfortable and durable and beautiful ü§©"
5.0,Very comfortable socks and vibrant colors.  Size is as stated.
5.0,"I bought these socks last year and just bought 4 more pairs as they have become my go-to socks in the winter. They are soft, not itchy, not too thick and not too thin, keep my feet warm and the top elastic isn't so tight to leave marks in my calves. They are just about the perfect sock for me. Would highly recommend."
5.0,I love it and have had so many compliments on it.
5.0,These were east to get on and off my one year old. Warm and cute!

5.0,Great fit for smaller wrists.  Super comfortable and easy to adjust.
5.0,"I loved these joggers so much that I added several other colors to my Christmas list. They fit just right, love the tummy control and length. Super comfortable and easy to move in. Material is on the thin side so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for cold weather but overall a great product. The pockets are awesome and I really liked the charcoal color."
5.0,This is my 2nd pair.  They lasted about a year but wore them weekly to work.  The comfort is just great.  I ordered a new pair to take on my trip to Europe
5.0,It gives me the shade that I need. Yes you might get a little line from the hat on your forehead. But I don‚Äôt care the shade that what matters to me.
5.0,"I dunno...<br /><br />Bear in mind that the model depicted in the description is a child and the socks are very good fit.  On her.  I purchased these for an adult, but I have my doubts whether they'll fill the bill (so to speak).  We'll see.<br /><br />Otherwise, the socks appear well made and are worth every cent of the $6.99 plus Free Prime Shipping (to Alaska, thank you very much)."
5.0,Perfect fit!! I love this dress definitely purchasing in a different color. The material is great not thin or to heavy. Tons of compliments. The pockets are a wonderful perk. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 132 purchased small in black.
5.0,"Good product, my daughter loves it"
5.0,Bought to tote winter gear to and from school. Love this bag!  Sturdy and graphics bright and clear.

5.0,"Love it!!!! Came early, so Im happy. Very cute and true to what i was told i was getting."
5.0,Very well maid and nice fit.
5.0,"I love this Romper! I ordered size small and I am 5'7, 110lbs, and even being so slim I didn't have to keep pulling it up (like I have to do with some of my other rompers) it stayed right where I put it! It fits nice and snug at both the top and the waistline ~ The length is just how I prefer all my pants/jeans/maxi's to be ~ It goes clear to the floor and I could even wear some wedge's with it as well and it would still be long enough! The material is wonderful ~ It is so soft, lightweight and it hangs beautifully ~ Great for a summer day! This Romper is made very well ~ No loose threads and the leg lines are perfectly straight! It may arrive, as mine did, wrinkled, but after I ironed it ~ On the silk/satin setting ~ It did not wrinkle at all after wearing it all day! I would recommend this to anyone ~ But having said that, Unless you have a good seamstress handy, I don't know how well this Romper would work for any lady shorter than I am, but if you are 5'7 or taller, go for it! I believe you will love it as much as I do! Thank you for taking your time to read my comment on this Romper... üòâüòäüòó"
5.0,I love this necklace. Very pretty on and lots of compliments!
5.0,Good product at a good price!
5.0,So comfy & cute definitely worth getting
5.0,It was perfect for the bling needed for our tournament
5.0,"Even though this shirt was somewhat small, it still looks good when I wear the skirt I ordered to wear with this shirt, so it's not a big deal at all! Allegra K has a ton of clothing that I would order all the time if I could just because their clothing is super cute and made perfectly for my figure. The shirt is extremely soft. It doesn't have any stretch to it, so order a size up depending on your size!"
5.0,Look great and I really like the polarized lenses. I lost them in mexico (as I always lose sunglasses) and came home and ordered two more pair. Can't beat these for the price
5.0,"This is my fourth pair. Again, perfect."
5.0,Very nice Bbq apron for my husband!!
5.0,"I recently purchased the Jo Progressive Multifocal Computer Reading Glasses and I am extremely impressed with their quality and functionality. These blue light blocking metal reading glasses are designed specifically for computer use, which is perfect for me as I spend a lot of time working on my computer. The cateye design is both stylish and unique, and the progressive multifocal lens allows me to easily switch between reading and working on my computer without having to constantly change glasses. The metal frames are durable and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I highly recommend these reading glasses to anyone who spends a lot of time on their computer. Overall, it is an excellent product."
5.0,These are excellent collar pins and very good value for money.
5.0,"Got them for my son , he loves them and says they are comfortable ."
5.0,"I don‚Äôt love how they fit my butt but other than that they‚Äôre great. Definitely a mom-jean fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2x like 100lbs, and normally wear a 0/24/25 and these were great.<br /><br />The tag on mine says 26!"
5.0,One broke and I had to reorder but I got a lot of compliments on them
5.0,I've had these for a little over a year and they've just started to show their wear.  They are used for frequent grocery delivery and have held up well.  I have received countless compliments about them.  These are my go-to bags for carrying cartons of eggs because they are sturdy.  I've delivered a lot of eggs and none have broken yet while using these bags.  I hope this helps!
5.0,Work like a champ.  It uses those back in my military days and the last ones I had were terrible about pulling hair.  No issues whatsoever with these.
5.0,My niece is really happy with her new looking baby crocs would recommend for baby‚Äôs
5.0,"such a cute dress. not quite as loose as the photo shows, but it's not quite a bodycon. it's dressy but not too dressy, which i love. the length is great on me, which is hard to find being 5'9. worth it all the way!"
5.0,"I didn't expect it to be so see thru, but I'm ok with that. A nice light tank top underneath makes me love this blouse."
5.0,Love this top for training. Although you could wear it anywhere
5.0,Love it...gift for my husband. Thank you!
5.0,Fun socks. Warm. Durable.
5.0,"So cute, I can't even. I make friends every time I use this."
5.0,Shipping was fast and product was just as described. Wife loves them. If ever they come up again its a deff buy from me.
5.0,I like the colors and the quality of the material. I knit scarves and hats and I use these gloves to make up sets for the homeless. The price means I can afford to give them away in quantitiy.
5.0,"Item received sooner than expected. My thanks to the seller.  Packaging was excellent. As far as the watch goes, I am happy to be part of the ""Casio Oak"" club now with the ownership of this watch. There are lots of great YouTube videos out there that are from those that appreciate this watch ""as is"" or from those who have additional fun with it by modification to appear somewhat like an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch. The appeal of this version of the Casio G-Shock 2100 model  is the price.  I also believe it to be the least popular since fans of this watch tend to go for the solid dark colored versions. I decided to take a chance and purchase this watch.  I am happy to say that I'm more than pleased, and now owning it and seeing it in person, I would personally pick this one over the others. It is larger than a G-Shock square yet lighter and just as comfortable. I will be one to modify it. Using 'AliExpress' app to try out a gold metal bezel and wrist band. Maybe it will look cool or maybe it won't work.  If not, I can always switch it back to the original bezel and band. Viewing this online,  you'd think it would only work for a holiday or festive occasion, but the colors are subtle enough to wear for everyday use. The analog hands have a decent enough illuminating indigo glow when coming in from the outside into a dark area. It also has additional lighting for the digital section. The watch also has a cool feature that with the simultaneous pressing of two buttons, you can temporarily move the analog hands of the watch out of the way to read the digital display of the time. Along with traditional features that come with a G-Shock watch, I am not surprised to find that I am more than satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"Absolutely love my belt. Fits great, is durable and light enough to wear bikepacking and bouldering but classy enough to tuck a collared shirt behind. Plus, I know that my money is going to support folks who care about quality and innovation.  The carbon is molded right here in the US, which is important to me. I love how simple it is to buckle and unbuckle. Really makes those emergency IPA ejections faster and less stressful. Sure, it's a bit pricy, but you're paying for quality and the knowledge that you're dismantling globalism while also buying a versatile, aesthetically pleasing, and handmade piece of bomber gear."
5.0,After trying several products this one is AWESOME ! This product is perfect for wearing covid masks and glasses.<br />One quick spray in each lens does the trick üòâ
5.0,"durable, small and delightful. it is so cute and sparkly. you can't see all the sparkles on the pictures. just big enough to hold your cell phone and small personal items needed for a date night. love it is worth the price"

5.0,"absolutely loved everything about this dress, the color, the fit & the length! perfect for a wedding or holiday party!"

5.0,"Love it, I purchased this as a surprise gift for my wife and she loves it! Well made, usually things like this are cheap and easy to break. But this is nicely made and sturdy."
5.0,"This is one of my favorite tops because it is long, is well made, and has pockets which are very handy. It is also very cute."
5.0,"These are now my toddler's favourite shoes!  They are very well-made of leather, soft inside with padding around opening."
5.0,So comfortable I often forget to take them off! We‚Äôre getting another pair

5.0,"So cute! I got them for Halloween, I made myself ‚ÄúThe devils fallen Angel ‚Äú<br />They‚Äôre actually pretty nice quality, I looked through a bunch before I decided on this one and I‚Äôm really glad I did! Super sexy and soft, but they are very delicate!  Surprisingly my feathers didn‚Äôt come out, maybe like some tini pieces I wouldn‚Äôt notice. I couldn‚Äôt reach them so mine are a little high In the picture my boyfriend took lol I recommend these for sure if you‚Äôre looking for good quality halo and wings! I‚Äôll be saving this costume for next year!üòç"
5.0,These are so cute. I am using them to make charms for potions and they are just perfect!
5.0,"very good quality, best belt for the price"

5.0,So cute. Fit better than expected. Received it in the perfect amount of time. I can't wait to wear it out.
5.0,Strong and beautiful. Vibrant color.
5.0,"This mask is so much more comfortable and lightweight than the cotton masks I was wearing.  And I feel more safe and secure knowing they are infused with copper to kill bacteria. Gives me peace of mind to have that extra protection.  It's a lightweight stretch so it gives and is comfortable on the ears.  The prints are really well designed, which of course is a plus, but not as important is safety...  I bought it for the copper technology and glad I did.  I will definitely be buying more in different patterns."
5.0,"I just bought another one. Color, size, cut, quality are perfect."
5.0,"Nice, light weight rain jacket.  It fits properly and kept me dry during a clay shoot in the rain."
5.0,Always fast shipping. Good quality. Love the keychain. Customer service is excellent!

5.0,"Wonderful product. Small, light, durable."
5.0,Light weight and good quality!
5.0,Love it Love it I purchased a MK gold purse that matches it exactly  It is the highest of quality I loved it
5.0,"I had ordered this Women Sexy Tempting Lace Babydoll Lingerie in black, since that seems to be my favorite colored clothing since it seems to make me look at least a little bit tinier :) So of course while wearing an outfit like this, I want the same effect.<br /><br /> I normally wear a L or XL in tops, so decided I would go with the XL, and I am glad I did, because it fit me perfectly. My main fear when ordering these types of products online, they will be cheap. I was surprised when I could actually get into this outfit without any worries about a piece ripping. With the bottom being so flowy, the only thing you have to worry about is the straps and bust area fitting and for me this was not an issue.<br /><br />This is a lace looking material and is partially see-through, however, you cannot tell much when in a dimly lit room (which works for me). The one small problem I had was the g-string that comes along with the outfit. I wear thongs normally, but I just could not get this on comfortably at all, so I just grabbed a pair of my own and threw them on.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice looking product, fit me well, and does not seem overly cheap like some other brands out there. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
5.0,Love this dress but it ran large in my opinion.  I bought it based on the size for my youngest daughter.  Turns out my oldest daughter can wear it because it fits her better.  It's silky soft.  Great color!
5.0,Necklaces arrived as described and in a cute protective pouch. Necklaces have no odor and will work well for a pendant I was given. No concerns.
5.0,Just the right size! Looks like real leather. The price is perfect!
5.0,So fun and cute...yet a little ridiculous!
5.0,Fit perfectly. Didn‚Äôt shrink or fade when washed.
5.0,Cute and tiny. Fits A LOT and more. The only problem is the paint on the zipper is already chipping but no big deal. Secret pocket for knife
5.0,Great fitting and very sexy
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9398262ee96f0b6db88dac796b5e66bd]] I was honestly skeptical, but I REALLY love these!<br />I bought the black pair in a small and the blue pair seen in the photo in a medium. The small was a tad bit of a struggle getting them over my hips. I could hear some of the thread break as I yanked anxiously yanked them over my hips, desperate to make them fit.<br />They actually fit great once I got them over my hips, but after buying the medium ones I realized there wasn't s struggle and they fit the same everywhere else the small did.<br /><br />I'm going to buy the pink pair soon. I'll update photos for the pink pair.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Squat proof shorts.<br />Functional.<br />Breathable.<br />Comfortable.<br />Adjustable strings on the side for longer or shorter shorts.<br />CUTE.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Scrunch butt could be a little more scrunch in the booty crack. It's like a scrunch just ON your booty crack instead of IN your booty crack to define the shape of your booty. They need to scrunch it more from the vagina area and up to really get the scrunch to fall INTO the booty crack.<br /><br />I'm 5'3 1/2""<br />132 pounds.<br />My hip size is 35.5 inches.<br />I usually wear small, so I recommend sizing up if your hips are around the same size or larger."
5.0,This is truly an exquisite mala that can be worn as a bracelet or necklace! Love it!
5.0,This dress is beautiful. Bought it for my daughter‚Äôs semi-formal dance at school. We both love it ‚Äî charming cut and color.
5.0,"Such a great dress! Comfortable to wear and it breathes which is important because I live in South Florida! I own several of these.  The hem is lower in the front and back and just slightly higher on the side, modest. I'm curvy and I don't have to worry about it being to short!"
5.0,It was made well love the colors very patriotic
5.0,Good quality masks. They fit both my 4 year old and 7 year old well. Would buy them again.
5.0,"These shades are fantastic. Look great, fit perfectly and the price is right. Highly recommend them."
5.0,"I have not worn hoops in years and recently became interested in them again so when I saw these hoops I instantly feel in love. They're the perfect size, not too big not too small. They don't hurt my ears or feel uncomfortable. Highly recommend!"
5.0,These are really really pretty! They add just enough to any outfit. Very happy!
5.0,"Caveat: This is my 10th pair of Cowtown boots, so I may be a bit biased.<br /><br />I've been buying and purchasing Cowtown Rattlesnake boots for about fifteen years now. They are like tennis shoes to me. Daily wears, resoled and re-heeled when they wear out, and they are cycled in and out of my wardrobe. My wife got me a pair of these fancy timber rattlers for my birthday and I'm extremely pleased with them. The snip toe is tough-looking and the fit is good. I might try and stain the top of the sole where the stitching is because it's tan in color and a bit light for my tastes, but that is the only thing I'd change. This is a beautiful, beautiful pair of boots, handmade and comfy. A great choice. I'm thrilled to have them."
5.0,"my mom loved them! comes with clear backings and met expectations, delivery was a bit late but very happy overall"

5.0,This slip was perfect for my 1860s period skirt.
5.0,"I have very small wrists so finding a bracelet that fits is a challenge. I ordered this bracelet because it is available in different sizes. The ""tiny"" fit perfectly. The bracelet itself is simple and elegant, not gaudy. The design and craftsmanship are beautiful. I highly recommend this bracelet and this company."
5.0,These gloves are great! I usually just wear the flimsy cloth kind and end up getting them wet and just pulling them off. Not these gloves! They are sturdy but still lets you have free movement while working. And the right hand is ingenious. I can use it and not have to have a trowel right on hand. Great invention.  My neighbors have all commented on them and wanted to know where they can get some...and i told them &#34;Amazon of course!&#34;.
5.0,My son loves them! Love the case and accessories that it came with too!

5.0,"Super cute, material on the cheaper side but you get what you paid for. The cut and style is apot on. Slightly sheer so i suggest getting darker colors or wear a slip. Perfect length too. Im 5'3 and it hits mid thigh"
5.0,These fit my 2-year-old really well! They keep his little hands warm and dry. I recommend them.
5.0,"Just want I expected,great for the price."
5.0,"SO COMFORTABLE OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This dress is so comfy and soft!! For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and about 200lbs, I bought the Large and it fit perfectly. The one thing I will say though is don‚Äôt dry it in the dryer, let it air dry. I made that mistake and it shrunk, it wasn‚Äôt too much but it was slightly shorter and the sleeves were a little tighter. This is such a great dress for the price!!!!"
5.0,Very soft and versatile for all outfits... My fianc√© loves them!
5.0,My wife loves it.<br /><br />I would give it 4 stars because I liked the one in the picture better.  Yes they will vary.  But I'm sure they pick the nicest one for the photo.  Not what I hoped for but still very nice.
5.0,Love love love this band.  It is so comfortable and fits my Active 2 (20mm) perfect.

5.0,bought as a gift for my Daughter
5.0,seems like a good quality product
5.0,Love them! Ordered more. Originally I got them for my son but he had really wide feet and they didn't fit him but they fit my husband and I just fine. They are the real thin ones which I love because my feet don't sweat as much.
5.0,"I can't say how much I LOVE these necklaces!  Each came with a 24&#34; rose gold chain (because that is the color of the wire wrapping the stone) they are all beautiful colors, size and weight are comfortable. My amethyst is very dark - I can wear it with black.  I have a black velvet cord that I sometimes use instead of the chain.  I get so many compliments when I wear them!  I have told so many people about these - I HIGHLY recommend!!"
5.0,Beautiful glasses. Love them!
5.0,"Cool, my daughter loves them"
5.0,"This bracelet is very well made<br />Shipping was fast<br />Seller sands by his product, and is quick to resolve any issues<br /><br />Cheers & Happy Holidays,<br />Marc"

5.0,"Tiny Rick<br />Do it, they'll all be jealous Morty"
5.0,Great pair of jeans.

5.0,"I've received many compliments on this set. It's a great accent to many outfits and is pretty versatile (I've worn it with jeans and dresses). The only problem that I have is one of the earring's post is loose which makes it difficult to secure to my ear with the back as it wobbles around when I try to place it on there. Other than that, I love it!"
5.0,It looks good and the fit is great.  Nice and warm also.
5.0,"These have just the right amount of stretch, colors go with everything, oh and they do absorb . Plus they wash and dry great. Highly recommend and the price is right."
5.0,I like that I can wet the band and it won't get damaged
5.0,"Bought as a gift for my wife, who is a nurse, and she loved it. It's smaller and more &#34;dainty&#34; than the image gives it credit for. Very feminine and not gaudy at all."
5.0,Grande kids like it
5.0,"It was a gift, and fit was perfect. They are very soft."
5.0,I bought an extra large I usally wear plus size 1x but really I should have just gotten a large

5.0,Beautiful dress. Fits well and the quality of the material is better than expected. I was pleasantly sruprised by the purchase and would recommend this dress to anyone. I also love the side pockets.
5.0,"I receive my purse and absolutely loved it. It arrived on the day that it said it would and it was packaged nicely. The only thing I would bring  to the attention of other buyers is in the picture from the seller, it clearly shows that all of the zippers are green and the same but as you can see from this photo, the two front zippers are silver and the top and back ones are green.  I wish they had all matched but was not bothered by it enough to return it and would definitely purchase another one."
5.0,"The cosmos head bands do the job they are intended to do, Comfortable and absorbent great buy thanks, you will not be disappointed."
5.0,"I love my Bella Marie Dana shoes, i have the Coral color on right now as a matter of fact. Delivery time was great"

5.0,Very comfortable. Second pair I bought!  They do stretch so you may want to go a half size smaller. Love them!
5.0,Color is a little off but is well made and fits good
5.0,"Bought to wear when pregnant and definitely flattering and comfortable. Lovely color and pattern. I'm 5'9"" so it's always concern about how long dresses are. This one is Decent length, good with flats for me at work."
5.0,"The Hat is great. Shipping was horrible. The hat arrived flat.  It had to be reformed.  No protection, just flat in an envelope."
5.0,"Best pjs ever. I love pjs( I have asked my family to bury me in pajamas). These are my favorite!  Comfortable and light weight. They are flexible and stretch just  right, and snap back into shape"
5.0,I like the material and fitting
5.0,"Fit and quality are beyond expectations. Great value, great functionality. Warm, durable and it just plain looks great. Very pleased with my purchase. Thank you."

5.0,Fit perfectly and comfortable on my girl
5.0,"Works great, a bit hard to put on at first. Ordered one size large than usual. Certainly does its job."
5.0,"I was reading about different stones and their meaning, and decided to invest in a bracelet. It looks nice, and goes well with office clothes. Now waiting for some magic :)"
5.0,As described. Easy to use with the head band and clip. It came a little bit squished. It took a little while to straighten out.
5.0,They fit just right and look even more beautiful . I also live that they are elastic so can fit anyone
5.0,"My granddaughter loves this backpack, great quality!  Definitely recommend!!"
5.0,"It‚Äôs so soft and warm, I am obsessed with this set.<br />It looks adorable, very pretty colors and pattern. Looks like it was hand made from the outside, because it‚Äôs perfect but it feels like it was not from the inside because of the soft and warm fleece all around it. It‚Äôs on both the scarf and inside the hat too. I am obsessed with the high quality and amazing comfort of this set. I am in love. 5 stars all the way."

5.0,perfect for the days I don't want to damage my wedding rings. I received a discount to review this product. I love them
5.0,Hands down the best jean jacket I‚Äôve ever owned. The material is knit but it looks exactly like regular denim so it‚Äôs ultra comfy. The fit and quality is great.
5.0,They fit true to size. Good quality. They don't slip off into my shoe. I waited a few washes before I reviewed. They are still like new after washing a few times. They feel great on my feet because they are breathable and not tight nor loose. And great price too
5.0,Great vibrant color
5.0,Made well & exactly what description described
5.0,These are my favorite masks<br />Most breathable if it‚Äôs possible to breathe In a mask
5.0,"It's perfect! I'm 5'1&#34;, 115lbs and a 34c bra. I ordered a medium and I love it!"
5.0,Smaller than I expected but it worked out
5.0,So far I like them
5.0,"This sweater is great! I ordered an XXL and it fits my 6'2"" son perfectly.  He likes it just a little loose and this size works great.  It is so soft and smooth, not like a regular sweater or sweatshirt. The material doesn't shrink either."
5.0,"Excellent shades. They do their job, and look nice. The cloth bag was a nice surprise. Will buy again!"
5.0,Fits great! As described. Had a terrible synthetic smell upon arrival. Nothing a good wash and some time in the sunshine couldn't handle. Very happy with purchase!
5.0,"This dress is a must buy. The material felt great. The split was really high, and I felt like I was holding the split closed the whole night.  You sit down and all my snatch was out. Lol. BUT I got some many compliments the whole night. One female offered to give me a shirt to wear for the night in exchange for my dress. Lol"
5.0,"This was an amazing deal and better quality than I expected. The toe ring variety helped me figure out what looks good, and size as I like to wear a lot of toe rings. Thanks!"
5.0,Exactly what I expected! The color is gorgeous and it feels like it'll stay in just fine
5.0,this geometric style purse is very popular in Japan.  My granddaughters have different colors and styles of the geometric purses and they are asked all the time where they got them.  We are not Japanese.  It's so much fun having quality items from other countries. (they are made in China)
5.0,"These have been my go to socks. I love that they are different colors and it's easy to match them up when doing laundry. They are thin, but they work great for boots and flats. Not something I would wear to keep warm. I have a size 7 shoe and they are a bit big for me/they move around a little bit but they are still awesome."
5.0,I use this Turban for covering and protecting my hair. The silky inner area of this turban does a great job at minimizing friction on the head.
5.0,This bracelet is beautiful.  It's a gift for my granddaughter and I know she will love it.
5.0,"These are good. I have larger legs from weightlifting so I have trouble with normal boxer briefs riding up and stretching out almost instantly. These are shorter cut and good material, they sit right up at the top of the thigh and don't roll up."
5.0,was a good purchase
5.0,I really like the material and the way the dress flows...great for the office and after-work event!
5.0,"Great sandal.  Super comfortable and good arch support.  Only negative is that if you wear them with wet feet (i.e. out of a swimming pool, etc.)  they do retain water in padding and will stink eventually."
5.0,Such an awesome bag. I was surprised of how well this thing was made. Perfect size for everything I need for school. Even added my own design to the bag üòä Definitely will be ordering again. Thanks so much!
5.0,Well made and gorgeous colors.
5.0,Purchased for a young woman who is a Bucks fan. She loved it!
5.0,I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs just $7.99!! It feels like a dress from banana republic.  Love the fit. It‚Äôs made of a thick material.
5.0,"They're a TEENSY bit smaller than I thought but they're still perfect! They're so pretty I love them. They go awesome with a nice outfit and they're perfect for everyday wear, too. My ears are somewhat sensitive and they're not bothering me or itching. The colors are a bit off from the photo but they're still real great."
5.0,I just recently found out that you are supposed to seal the cork on Birkenstocks every once in a while.  I tested it on my oldest Birks first.  They where in sad shape and all dried out.  Came out great.  The cork looks like new.  I did use my own brush which is a little softer.  This is a great product.
5.0,"This lightweight cardigan looks great over sleeveless tops and dresses.  It is very soft, holds its shape, and is perfect for air conditioned offices and transition spring and fall weather. I wear a Small-Medium depending on the fit and brand. I ordered a Medium and it's just right."
5.0,"This mask was for my husband to wear to a holiday party, and it looked fantastic on him."
5.0,I have had this in the cartlidge at top of my ear since i got it about 3 months ago. Still looks the same and many compliments

5.0,I‚Äôm Super Satisfied! I was lucky enough to to be born on St Patrick‚Äôs Day ! I ordered this for a party at the last min however not expecting to receive  item ... I‚Äôm in Love ! The fit was perfect I‚Äôm a size 12 so as reviews suggested got a medium ! I was the Princess at the Party !!
5.0,"Great design, accurate in craftsmanship, simple to use and great flickering light. True to the movie. Great buy, awesome addition to my collection, highly recommend it."
5.0,They fit perfectly but can be hard to take off & put on.
5.0,This was a gift and the recipient loved the logo and soft material. True to size.
5.0,"These socks cost a little more but are completely worth it to me. The comfort, durability and optimal size and weight let me enjoy wearing them as opposed to just having socks as a formality to protect my shoes from sweat and my feet from rough edges. Before I discovered these my socks were always loose *somewhere* and I was living with that since it doesn't actually hurt anything but these fit perfect everywhere and it is so nice."
5.0,LOVE these leggings!!  So comfortable and soft!
5.0,"This is very comfortable. If you're looking for a leggings that will move with you no matter how active you are, this is what you're looking for! Very light and stretchable that you will forget you're wearing one. Has some tummy control if you need it. I love the think waistband that will keep it from rolling down. So far, im loving it!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,Resistentes y muy bonitas
5.0,really cute for the money.
5.0,Love them I have them on right now. Quality is good!
5.0,"Love the ray bans... description was prefer, color was perfect, fit is perfect... I will buy from this seller again... LOVE the glasses.<br />Great item and price."
5.0,these are very beautiful.
5.0,I love these frames for my son - it's perfect for busy rambunctious boys üòÅ
5.0,Very pretty scarf. I ordered every color. Very pleased with item & I get tons of compliments it when i wear it. You can pair it with just about anything. I will be buying a few as christmas gifts for loved ones who also love Ms. Monroe. Thank you for this lovely scarf.
5.0,"This dress is one of the most comfortable dresses I own. Light and perfect for casual wear. I wear it with a cardigan and use it for work, and it‚Äôs perfect."
5.0,"Because they were so inexpensive, I was concerned, but they fit great and my iPhone 6 fits fine in the pocket!"
5.0,"I got the royal blue purse. It looks even better in person. Sized just right for petites. It doesn't look like a large purse, but with its multiple compartments and pockets, it can hold a lot. Yes, it IS genuine leather. At first I wasn't too fond of the gold-tone hardware, but if paired with accessories that are mixed metal, this purse pops. It matches almost every one of my fall/winter outfits. It's soft, but still sturdy. I store it with air cushions in my closet to keep its shape. I used leather conditioner to protect the leather, and the blue became a richer hue. The stitching and workmanship are very good, and the hardware is durable, not flimsy. I wasn't paid or given anything for this review. I've bought many ""genuine leather"" purses on Amazon that have turned out to be PU leather or outright duds, and they all had to be returned. This is one of the very few times I've been extremely satisfied with a purse purchase."
5.0,"I loved the length, the top part fit nicely, and then it dropped like an empire waist, which I loved. It was light and flowly but still had some weight to it so it did not cling. Very pretty color, have in Silver and Red.I think it will be able to be worn for 4 seasons, with different accessories... leggings, scarves, jewelry, ...etc."
5.0,So happy to find quality latex free product. Felt pain relief right away as using for healing after wrist and arm surgery and needed compression.
5.0,"Comfortable, durable, kept my scrubs clean. The price is good for quantity and quality."
5.0,My son loves this outfit.
5.0,"The picture makes it look like it is mostly black with some grey, but really it has a nice shine to it and the black design makes it look really cool and unique. For what it cost, it is pretty great. Tribal design looks a little bit satanic and would not recommend a Puritan to get it, but it is really interesting and I do not think that was the intention at all."
5.0,My fiance loves him they're great for on the bikes and he wore them during the covid-19
5.0,Fits great and super cute and nice and comfy.
5.0,"Comfy , soft and a good stretch"
5.0,"Perfect fit for my 5 yr old. Well made, arrived quickly."

5.0,Beautiful ring and wife loved it!
5.0,"it is amazing stuff,kids love it.."
5.0,I love this hat. I will be wearing it at my churches women guild Spring banquet &#34;Hats & Fashions&#34;! It looks awesome with my outfit. Thank you FayBox for a beautiful hat.
5.0,"I‚Äôve been looking for combat boots for years now and I haven‚Äôt found the right ones for me. I saw this as a great option since the heel looked thick and it felt comfy. I do like how simple they look, but they also offer a thick sole which is what I prefer.<br /><br />I usually wear boots during the fall/winter where everything is rainy and cold. I thought the added thick sole would provide some protection during colder + harsher climates.<br /><br />The only thing that could be improved is to offer half-sizes. However I‚Äôm usually a size 8 w/ wide feet in women‚Äôs and that fit well. My toes are up towards the top, so hopefully it doesn‚Äôt cause any blisters. However, untying the laces and loosening up the boots help!<br /><br />So far so good! I walked around for 10 min in my house and no issues so far. I‚Äôll update my review once I wear them outside."
5.0,So soft and well made!
5.0,It looks like the image. Very cute
5.0,Great costume! So comfortable!!!
5.0,Very pretty and looks like the expensive ones.
5.0,exactly what we were expecting.
5.0,"I originally ordered the large, which was didn't seem tailored enough.  I'm fairly broad shouldered, 5'6&#34; , 132 lbs, 36 B.  The medium fits perfect."
5.0,"I love the look of the item, it looks of good quality, and although my niece hasn't used it yet since I am gifting it to her this Sunday, I believe it is a great gift for the price!"
5.0,"UPDATE: I loved the first two so ordered in size 6 and 7. I do wear them in public, not all at once. The grandkids love playing with them. These are fantastic statement pieces. Look at the lizard on the sides. Love these.<br />So I ordered 2 sizes, an 8 and 9. I‚Äôve lost weight so the 8 only fits when my fingers are a bit swollen. These things are huge and a sparkly statement piece. I ordered 2 more, a 6 and 7. These are the size of a boyfriend class ring and I love them. I‚Äôve let the kids play with them, they love them too. Don‚Äôt take yourself seriously, have some fun and get one of these. Shipping takes super long, cost is ridiculously low. Order one in each size and enjoy what you get."
5.0,"Fit amazing, my daughter loves them. They are a great ""in between"" weather tight, with a unique color combo"
5.0,Wife loved it but I needed one size smaller. I don't think it was listed in her size but she will wear it anyway.
5.0,"I was nervous to buy a dress online, but it fits perfect, and I will be buying from seller again,"
5.0,"a few years ago, I purchased two lights in the 99cent store and use to put 1 in my car and 1 in my purse, they were called Luma Lights. Over time, I gave one away and then I went back to 99cent store and they were gone. I went on line and now they have a different name and a very different price, but  I love the light features"
5.0,Love this dress!  So comfortable. So light.  Perfect for summer
5.0,"Absolutely perfect fit, well built too! I bought all the colors!"
5.0,Other headbands are tight and give me a headache. These ones fit just right. Will repurchase.
5.0,My 7-year-old absolutely loves these. They are so sweet and pretty. There's a little bit of sparkle on the shoes and the elastic is nice and stretchy so they're easy for her to get on and off by herself. She says they're very comfortable and has no problem dancing and jumping around in them. Love these.

It's very flattering very flowy and so glad that it's beautiful. It's not sheer at all so you can't see through it but the stretch is amazing and very forgiving I just pair it with a pair of good leggings ankle boots or even dress shoes and I'm good to go.

5.0,"I got these Cufflinks for my oldest son because he just recently started his career in the Navy and is always looking for cufflinks for his shirts.  These cufflinks are great because they are big enough to show and not TOO big that they are &#34;cheap looking&#34;.  Easy to handle and lock smoothly into the cuff hole.  They really shine and don't &#34;smudge&#34; easily and when you do get a print on them they wipe up easy.  They arrived in a little black box for easy use and storage and the box is small enough that it can be easily packed to take where ever you go. These cufflinks would make a great gift for any man.  I will follow up this review with photos.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review, the experiences and opinions are my own."
5.0,This was a huge hit for our warriors fan!  He loves all things warriors.  So it was great to find him something unique that wasn‚Äôt clothing based!
5.0,"This watch is soooo cute! It comes with games, camera, camcorder & so much more! I bought it for my 3 year old niece, she loves it!"
5.0,"Very pretty necklace.  First off, I love rose gold. This necklace is that color, very dainty looking and a sweet design with the heart and key.  Beautiful gift for the girlie in your life, ok packaging but lovely piece."
5.0,"My daughter has worn this hat all winter, and loves it! I've washed it a couple of times and it has stayed nice:)"
5.0,"Very cute! Cardigan is thick and nice quality, my 7 yr old was thrilled!"
5.0,"Exactly what I'd hoped for, solid construction, durable, and prevents my wife from stressing over dinging up my wedding ring. I was a size 13 ring when I got these and I'm down to a 12 now and they've fit the whole time and not uncomfortably. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be loose until I get down to an 11 or 10.<br /><br />Given that it's silicone, it catches the skin unlike metal so I would recommend taking into account whether you're gaining, losing, or maintaining weight. Clearly, there's more flexibility with this material so plan ahead if you want longevity out of them.<br /><br />As a bonus, the bag doubles as a jewelry bag for my wife on short trips! Related, after she saw how much I liked mine, she wanted them, too! Got her the women's set, which honestly I was way happier about in terms of rings. My titanium band versus her engagement and wedding ring at the gym? She was skeptical at first about the quality and durability, but now I don't have to worry about her losing the equivalent of a 2008 Hyundai Fit at the gym while washing her hands ;)"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c9dfce4896989ac12c9a3b3cfa671ecf]]
5.0,Very nice bracelet. I'd like more than one
5.0,These were exactly what I  wanted. Thank you.
5.0,"Im always iffy about dresses that dont flare out a little to hide my stomach, but the overlapping material does an incredible job of hiding the most lumpy parts of my stomach. I'll definitely be wearing this alot this summer and it looks super cute with a jean jacket for the chilly days too! Im 5'4 200lbs and I got an XL"
5.0,Nicely made and fits over my calf. However if you have larger calves and have trouble with the purchase of some boots because of this I would think these would be too small. They came from China so delivery takes a while but still came before the expected delivery date.
5.0,These are fabulous and look superb on!  It's so much fun to get a really great looking pair of sunglasses for a very  nominal fee!  One problem mine have is the screws at the end of the stems are not flush with the plastic so they catch and pull hair when taking them off.  I'm going to buy a small eye glass screwdriver set and see if I can tighten the screws so they don't scratch my head or pull my hair.  But even if I can't correct it; I LOVE THESE SUNGLASSES.  They're within my budget and I still get to look chic! I'm delighted!
5.0,Sexy and I loved how it fits
5.0,"I am pleased with this top. I bought it on a great sale, I think because they were only a couple of sizes and colors available. I bought it in a small and it fits like a small to medium. I got it in and I see lilac and the color is very pretty."
5.0,"I‚Äôm a large usually, but most if the time they , the tops, are to tight in the top areas..I ordered an xl.... should have stuck with my true to size...Other that that great chiffon type dress!! Great on really hot days!"
5.0,Loved the multiple colors and fit perfectly. Quick shipping too
5.0,I love this color and this set.  It is cheap but I really like it and looks so great to match a skirt and pants I already have.  It will work out fine with my outfits.  Too cute.
5.0,Who doesn‚Äôt love a grumpy Mickey!
5.0,Once I received my mask I am very pleased with it's construction and protective ability.
5.0,Love these bags.
5.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for. I needed a large size, as the arms on my sunglasses are large. And these fit perfectly. Plus they are soft. And they stay on."
5.0,Love this ring! It's a delicate ring and looks amazing on my finger.  Georgian jewelry is amazing!
5.0,I have a hard time finding aprons that aren‚Äôt too tight on my dad‚Äôs neck. These worked well.
5.0,Cute and surprisingly comfortable.
5.0,"Very pleased with the quality, the fit, and the look of the shoes."
5.0,It wat it is.100% thx Q God
5.0,This piece is very heavy ( the charm) the chain itself is not a heavy metal ( its ok) no one can tell that its not real rose gold and for the price you get 2 bracelets. Nice costume pieces
5.0,There are so many features on this watch I literally have to watch YouTube videos.
5.0,"Great pair of earrings for those who don't like wearing big earrings.  Give a nice simple look, drawing the perfect attention to you."

5.0,It's a perfect fit! I will be buying more in the Fall
5.0,I love this piece!! Fits my Ginger Snap necklace perfectly. Bought the wolf one because I love Huskies and Malamute dogs. It reminds me of two pets who have since passed over the rainbow. I was so glad to find it on Amazon . Will continue to shop this vendor again! Sent me a free gift as well that I have worn also and really like!! Thank you so much.
5.0,I bought these for party favors for my granddaughter‚Äôs birthday and I was pleasantly surprised by the size and colors. I was expecting something fairly small but they are the perfect size to use as a stress reliever and for kids to squish. The colors are vibrant and the characters are cute. I think the kids will love them!
5.0,"Because of my arthritis, the clasp is a bit difficult but it is a good looking piece for my fitbit."
5.0,These are so beautiful and amazing value getting two pairs for the price ! I wear the small ones for everyday and the larger ones for going out.
5.0,"I got these to wear under my helmet since I own a motorcycle. Keeps me warm enough and can even wear it on a hot day because the material used, allows air to breeze through my whole head."
5.0,These were even cuter than I expected. Super sparkles all over! Cannot wait to gift them!
5.0,At first I did not think they were polarized but the clarity is amazing.  Thanks for them.
5.0,This necklace is stunning in person. It's a very well made and versatile piece.
5.0,Ordered  larger because I like loose.
5.0,Pure pink color.  Fits as expected.  Nice.
5.0,Is was a gift for my daughter to give to her BF
5.0,"Bought it for concerts, hockey and football games where the venues require a clear bag.  Not nearly as large as my regular handbag, but venues limit sizes and this meets those limits.  This one holds my phone, Kindle Fire tablet, cowbell, sunglasses, reading glasses, keys and the small black wallet it comes with.  Another reviewer complained that the latch doesn't stay closed, but haven't had that problem.  Changed out the chain strap for a real leather handle I bought on Etsy, because I prefer a hand strap and not a shoulder strap, but the chain it came with was very nice quality.  Overall the bag is pretty, holds a decent amount for an event, and is well made, especially given the price."
5.0,"Have been on a search for a leave-in earring for my second piercing. I love that this one has no difficult screw on thread on the post, normal post thickness for small ear hole, and great snap on round ball back. (also came with 2nd standard ear nut backing) Very comfortable to sleep in and no irritation whatsoever with my sensitive ear. Unfortunately my daughter loved it so much she took it! Guess I have to order another..."
5.0,I love the way it fits and feels its a great dress
5.0,High quality earrings! I get lots of compliments on them.
5.0,They are a great color and very comfortable.
5.0,"I purchased them a size up, so that I could put in my orthodics, due to feet problems, and they are very comfortable and stylish. My foot doctor suggested ugly shoes for foot problems, so I took matters into my own hands! Great with jeans, but better with leggings that show off the cool studs. Love love love!<br /><br />Ok, so now it's 3 years later...<br />I wore the hell out of these boots and the heel blew out this month and was  not repairable. I am inconSOLEable. Please restock these."
5.0,These workout tops are the best!!! They are not tight/form fitting so you can be comfortable while getting your sweat on! And the sides are open (but not too open) for the perfect amount of ventilation! I loved mine so much I had to get another color!!!for reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 145lbs I got the Medium!
5.0,"Love this pullover. It's very cute. Not super thick but it is warm. I ordered an XL. I am a large. so I would order up, but nothing crazy. I also don't like things tight. Overall though, I love this pullover."
5.0,Glasses are good lenses clear fantastic price
5.0,So cozy and soft. Keeps you warm. Just sleeves are a bit snug
5.0,We bought this as a &#34;congratulations on your new job&#34; present for my son.  He loved it and was very impressed with the great quality of the leather and workmanship.  He uses it every day and it has held up well.  Its spacious without being too big.
5.0,"Just beautiful! Got it for my mother in law as a Mother's Day gift, and she loved it very much!"
5.0,"Absolutely love these! They fit perfectly and hug everything in the right places. Supposedly NVGTN dupes but I don‚Äôt have any to compare. For reference, I am 5‚Äô9 and 155 lbs and these fit me perfectly (I got a medium) you really can‚Äôt beat the price. Will be purchasing more! :)"
5.0,It is a super cute star earrings. It is so shiny and stunning. I wear for daily use. It looks more beautiful in person. I definitely recommend it!

5.0,Fun shirt for social workers.  Great gift
5.0,Nice fit! Love them.
5.0,Fits as expected - bought a small for my friend (size 2-4) and a medium for me (size 6-8). Soft material and the cut of racerback is flattering!
5.0,Good quality fits perfect
5.0,Cute glasses. Received timely
5.0,"I love the style of these glasses. They look so good worn. I love how the lens is pink but the actual color you see is a nice shade of black. Perfect sun protection, and I have very sensitive eyes. Love the color and quality. One thing I do have an issue with is my hair gets caught in the frame and sometimes pulls so if you like to wear your hair down like I do, be wary of this."
5.0,"This dress has a 1/2 length under arm zipper on the left. So the dress needed to be an extra 1-2 sizes to comfortably close, at least for me. Otherwise  it's gorgeous & the return to re-order was easy too !"
5.0,Got this sweater for my daughter. She loves it. Hardly see here with it off.
5.0,Such a beautiful scarf!  I love it!  Makes me feel great and patriotic when I wear it.  Its very light and sheer and is absolutely fun to wear.  USA!

5.0,I loved the style and ease of slipping your foot in and you‚Äôre ready to go!  There was nothing I didn‚Äôt like about them !  Very well made. My problem is my foot is shaped odd and I was very d these didn‚Äôt work for me!!!  I‚Äôd still recommend buying them !!
5.0,"Great Tote, very nice, easy to fill it up and have it a bit heavy, but I love it."
5.0,Love love love it! Fits my girl perfectly.
5.0,Love it! I got them for work and I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be so comfortable. Definitely recommend.

5.0,"The blue stone appeared lighter than pictured, but matched perfectly with dark colored demins.  I have received nice compliments when wearing them"
5.0,Very nice band. Good quality leather and the included strap pin tool was a nice touch.
5.0,the color is a lot lighter then picture
5.0,Works great! Got my shoes clean.
5.0,Very cute and fashionable.
5.0,"Awesome gift for any Barca fan. What can you say, it's a &#34;Santa&#34; hat in the colors of the Blaugrana with the club shield embroidered on the front."
5.0,"It fits well -- probably more of a one size fits all.  It comes to about my waist so I believe it's the newer cropped jacket/sweater length.  Bright colors and breezy fit.  Very see-through so will and does look good over sleeveless tops or dresses for a light covering (or hiding upper arms).<br /><br />I haven't washed it yet but plan to just wash by hand in cool/cold water as I would wool sweaters and hang dry.  The tag says it can be machine washed with delicates, hung to dry, and cool iron if necessary.  I've been burned before washing ""red"" things without prewashing alone to check bleeds first.  This garment looks like it would not bleed but it's a deep and bright red so I'm cautious."
5.0,"Super Cute!  I am 40, 5'8, 180 and athletic build.  Fits me perfect with a little room to spare."
5.0,"Love the weight, look, clasp lock. Perfect! Thank you."
5.0,This necklace was made well and looks great with my black and white plaid suit.
5.0,I wear these comfortable shorts under skirts. As underwear they are soft and comfortable also.
5.0,"I was very impressed with these sunglasses. I loved the way they looked in the picture, but I was unsure how they'd look in reality. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they matched the picture exactly. I need sunglasses while driving otherwise I'm squinting the whole time and sun glare off shiny objects temporarily blinds me. I've been through a lot of sunglasses, from cheap drug store to high end name brand. I'm very picky about how they feel on my face. I'm horrible about not wearing sunglasses when I need to because they bother me so much.<br /><br />These sunglasses fit perfectly! I was so excited when I first put them on. They sit a good distance away from my eyes so that my eyelashes don't touch the lens but not too far away that the light on the side distracts me. The part over my ears was comfortable not too heavy or irritating. I find i'm able to wear these for long periods of time without having any irritation on my face. I would definitely recommend if you like the look of these in the picture especially if you're super picky about how they feel, like me.<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Great color if you like Beige and have light or similar color shoes.  Strong shoe string and no fraying so far.
5.0,Cute and fits good. I ordered small and am 5 6 and 120 pounds.
5.0,Bought this dress for Vegas! Felt so sexy! My husband loved it!
5.0,great feel. only buying supreme comfort from now on
5.0,they fit just as the description says they would.
5.0,Love the product it was better than what I expected! Strong and durable:
5.0,Love the lightweight material yet sturdy to hold radio clips.  Feels good and doesn't pressure the upper pelvic area when sitting.  Great product.  I plan to buy more for each set of pants so I don't have to always remove belt from pants to pants.  Remove the belt is the biggest hassle because the belt clip is larger than most average belt loops.
5.0,Exactly as described. Worked perfectly. Fast shipping.
5.0,"I purchased two of these bracelets.  One in the 7-inch size and the other in the expandable version for my mother (who has arthritis in her wrists).  The quality of the hematite is gorgeous and I love the touch of the blue tiger's eye in the center.  Both my mother and I have a lot of negativity flowing around us, so that was the main reason I purchased the hematite.  There isn't a lot of stretch to my 7-inch bracelet but once I got it past the widest part of my knuckles it slid perfectly!  It's very comfortable to wear."
5.0,pretty good quality.  they are a little stretchy so that's great for activities that may come up.  Like grocery shopping in a bear pit.  You never know when you have to look great and have to preform at the same time.
5.0,"When you wear this tie people will love you! They will all know you are a cool guy! All of the women who didn't notice before can't stop thinking of you! When you wear this tie you are wearing a piece of rock and roll around your neck like a glorious badge of honor saying ""I'm kind of a big deal"" but in a way that is unsaid, yet completely understood. This tie changed my life, and it will change yours too."
5.0,One of my favorite pairs of socks! Fit me perfectly and don‚Äôt slide down. I‚Äôm a size 7-7.5 and my feet are small so sometimes socks can be big on me but these aren‚Äôt! The ruffle is adorable & I love them!!!
5.0,Amazing item!! Looks good for the price
5.0,Exactly what I expected! Fit is great!
5.0,Fit perfectly and I love it.
5.0,Adorable. Pretty heavy and good quality for price. Means a lot to me.
5.0,Got these as stocking stuffers for my wife. She really likes them.
5.0,The shoes were adorable!
5.0,"I love it! The color is incredible on my skin tone. The fit is perfect, snug in all the right places. If you have an hourglass shape, you'll love this.<br />I wouldn't wear it on a hot day (above 74 degrees) as the material has some quality and thickness to it. It's perfect for that perfect sunny day and definitely good for an indoor event on a chilly day. Everyone kept commenting on it as I walked around town.<br />It's great for formal or casual cute situations. The day I wore it, I also found a wall that is the same color! Fate! It was meant to be. It's a great dress!"
5.0,Tags hold up well & come w/privacy
5.0,Fits perfect.  Does run small but I ordered a size up like all suggested and it was perfect. Can't wait to ride!
5.0,"I LOVE LOVE LIVE THIS. I already have 2 more colors coming, and plan on getting 2 more after that when my size is in stock. I LOVE the feel of the fabric. And I Love how versatile this dress is. Can be made into any fashion style or look. From casual to dressy. Perfect length, and easy on off. Love it. Go with your gut on sizing. It‚Äôs a true size fit.<br /><br />UPDATE: I placed a second order for the navy blue. I love it too. I now have pink, bright blue, navy blue, and black. Waiting for the bright green to be in stock for another order."
5.0,"The black waist band is a little tighter than I would like it to be, but I absolutely love it and will buy another in a different color"
5.0,This was a gift from my husband two years ago  It is truly one of my favorite pieces from Carolyn Pollack.  The signature beads are flawless!  The necklace features an adjustable chain closure so that you can adjust it to several different lengths to accomadate various necklines.  You can also use this with enhancers for a truly elegant look.  This is a substantial piece of silver with superior workmanship.  Truly an heirloom piece.
5.0,Fits nice! Feels comfortable and smooth! Wife cant wait to wear it out!
5.0,My granddaughter loved it !<br />I saw her reaction when she tried it on!<br /> What more could I sayüëç
5.0,"Cute, good fit. Decent quality for the price. I like it."
5.0,i bought these for my 13 year old son that wears a size 6 shoe and they fit perfectly and are comfortable.
5.0,"Great color, so soft, great fit.  Just as advertised."
5.0,"I didn't have high hopes for these when I bought them as I had read a few poor reviews, but took the chance anyways. I have really thick hair and wasn't sure if these would be sturdy enough for me, but these are the BEST hair ties! They hold my hair snug and they don't slip out at all. I work outdoors and hike all day; even with sweat and branches pulling at my hair the ties stay put! I will occasionally adjust my hair during the day out of boredom but it is not necessary at all!! Perfect for activities! I was skeptical about their &#34;re-shrinking abilities&#34;, but I leave my used stretched out tie on my nightstand while I sleep and in the morning it is good as new! I have only had to use one tie in the past month! Love love love these! Highly recommend them!"
5.0,"Bought these gloves for my husband as a Christmas present. They're soft, comfortable, & well made.<br /><br />Shortly after Christmas, we had some really cold days (in the teens) & quite a bit of snow fall. My husband was outside clearing our driveway & playing with the kids for a few hours & was very impressed with how well these gloves held up. His hands remained dry & warm the entire time.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone living in an area that gets cold snowy weather."
5.0,Wonderful silky fabric. Beautiful coral color. Well made. Ordered another in a different colorüòä
5.0,purchased for my son - he loves it.
5.0,Very impressed with this belt out of the box. I would say that the sizes run a little small. I have a 34&#34; waist but I wanted to be able to carry IWB so I got a 40. With out any gear I'm on the 3rd tightest best loop. I still have 4 more that I can loosen it by.
5.0,"Great dress, nice and stretchy, cute color"
5.0,Beautiful  dainty bracelet I have gotten a lot of compliments on it
5.0,Bless shirt dont fade its well.
5.0,"The dress fit my daughter so perfectly, and she looked gorgeous in it."
5.0,"This bag is perfect! The rose gold color is absolutely gorgeous. Not a tinny colored or brassy gold rose but a TRUE BEAUTIFUL ROSE GOLD. It‚Äôs RFID protected, big enough for a big cell with case, credit card pockets, and straps that are knotted inside so you can tuck them in for a clutch evening bag or pull them out for a beautuful, light, not bulky cross bag . Thrilled with this. Great bag."
5.0,I just love them and reminds me of kunais from Naruto
5.0,"These are very comfortable! And they fit well, true to size. I'm an XL. They're the perfect length too"
5.0,"These hoops are medium size, the fit and finish is very elegant and they are not too heavy.  Highly recommend for both work and evening wear."
5.0,It fit my Triathlon watch perfectly.
5.0,"Beautiful watch band! I have worn it for about a month now and I am very pleased with my purchase! Lots of complements! I was happy to find that it came with all the tools needed to remove links (resize) and easy to follow, step by step directions. If you‚Äôre on the fence about buying, I say go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
5.0,Very Pretty necklace...only wore it one time and has gotten many compliments! Came on time and packaged well! Would recommend!
5.0,It‚Äôs very comfortable I love it
5.0,"I am 5'4'' and around 130lbs, I ordered a small in the black and loved it so much on me that I ordered the Khaki color as well! It is awesome material and nice and cozy. Perfect"
5.0,"Great quality, fits very nicely."
5.0,These leggings fit perfectly and are so soft and warm.
5.0,Just as pictured. Cute colors and nice thick quality silicone. Easy to clean
5.0,"My daughter got this for her stepdad to play with a guitar he got from his daughter before she passed away. It‚Äôs very good quality, strong enough to be used regularly and still have as a keepsake. He loved it."
5.0,"Love the sleeck style. It turns it into a luxury phone. Plus, it has slots for your ID or cards so if you want to just go out without a wallet... you can!!"

5.0,But I was told they are comfortable and durable

5.0,Very nice jewelry  Arrived quickly

5.0,"Looks great and fast shipping!! I got the black. Nice color and material, not too bulky, stretchy and fits just right. I'm 5'3 115lbs and ordered size S."
5.0,Great goggles. Make sure to remove the film before using as this does make vision blurry as other post mentioned.
5.0,I am very missed shaped but this makes me look like a new person
5.0,"I now have several colors of these capris, they will go with anything, are highly consistent in size, and the material is good quality.  They are only see thru in the light colors paired with loud underwear.  The jade color is actually closer to aqua and goes with any other aqua or turquoise outfits."
5.0,Very stylish and works very precise
5.0,"Perfect for my beach cruisers Love these seat covers Pretty, Comfortable, good fit, and  great price.<br />I recommend<br /><br />Thank You"

5.0,This hat was just right for a school play my son was in. Fit as expected and arrived on time.
5.0,"I love these socks!  They're soft, have great grip for barre and yoga work and are super comfortable. I have little feet (5-1/2) and a lot of socks, slippers, etc. are huge on me.  These fit me nicely but still have a lot of stretch available to accommodate larger feet. The straps on the instep are comfortable as well. They stay put and don't cut into the tops of my feet.  I'll definitely be ordering another pair!"
5.0,Great duffle for travel or sports.  Strong and large enough to hold plenty!!!
5.0,It is beautiful - just what I wanted.
5.0,Love the feel of material. Quality seems good. Love the print! It‚Äôs perfect for me!
5.0,"I love this dress. As others have mentioned, it is a bit on the thin side, so I‚Äôd probably wear a slip under it if I were going out. But if you‚Äôre the type of lady who wants to lounge around your house being both comfy and glamorous, this is the dress for you!"
5.0,Love my Ring
5.0,I bought this necklace as a gift for my husband and im so glad I did bc he loves it. Its a beautiful yellow gold. The pendant itself is sturdy and the perfect weight. Its a really good deal! Makes a great gift that won't break the bank.
5.0,"It is well made and really beautiful, it is pretty wrinkled from packaging but that's to be expected. The crown sticks on with bobby pins. My daughter is a size 6 - 7 and I bought the 47-51 inches."
5.0,Es un poco clara
5.0,They're very warm. The length and circumference of the cuff enable easy access to the paddle shaft.
5.0,"This is a fantastic watch for the price.<br /><br />I‚Äôve always said that good food tastes even better when it‚Äôs cheap. Some would call this a ‚Äòcheap‚Äô watch, I think it‚Äôs just ridiculously inexpensive.<br /><br />It looks great and keeps time well.<br /><br />If I were to be picky; it feels a little light, and the date/day ticker doesn‚Äôt always tick up.<br /><br />The dial and operations of the watch all work fine. It comes wonderfully wrapped and protected, with a legible guide and an adjusting tool.<br /><br />I would happily pay twice the price for one of these watches. I‚Äôll update if it breaks in two weeks."
5.0,"this fits like it should, and it is super cute."
5.0,Great how it looks
5.0,Love the style. Good quality for a great price.w
5.0,"First pair came without yellow Spongebob tag, returned and easily got replacement. Had everything including the yellow Spongebob tag! Fits excellent condition! Looks great! Amazon took care of my order well! Also got the nebula blue spongebob timberland boots as well! Also, They're Real, Not Fake! Recommend getting these a half size down from your original,  run a little bit big."
5.0,"Im lacking words to describe how beautiful this dress is. The fit is perfetct, the line gives you an illusion of a smaller waist and wider hips! OMG"
5.0,These are absolutely above 5 stars! They are fun and lightweight! Stunning earrings.
5.0,Very flattering. I can't believe how great it looked for how inexpensive it was
5.0,Love how professional it looks
5.0,I got these in mind for my daughter whos is three to play dress up with. These seem to be every well made bracelets. She likes them which it the best part. She really likes to use them when she has her princess dress up tea party. I haven't noticed it making any kind of marks or green marks on her after she has worn it of a long length of time. Which is a huge plus for me. Not even the metallic smell I've noticed the dollar store bracelets have given her before. I would wear these for a dress up night on the town or even with a pair of jeans for a casual date night with the hubby. They are a very versatile bracelet. You can dress it up or down with them.
5.0,"This is a great apron for work and one thing I love the most about it is how it is resistant to chemicals such as bleach. The other black aprons I tried ended up with bleach stains but this one does not. As for the fit, I am 5'3' and the apron hit two inches below my knees. I wanted it shorter so I had to remove the threads holding the straps and sew them to a different location since the buttons were not short enough for me. If you are taller than me or do not mind having a low cut apron, then this is the one for you. I noticed that H-style aprons around $10 are rarely sold on Amazon now."
5.0,They feel so soft and too thin but still warm.
5.0,Cute shirt! Just don't dry it in the dryer for too long. The material is pretty weighted and solid. I like the sleeves and how sleek it looks draped on the body. Good buy!
5.0,So surprised by the quality of these ratings! Beautiful colors. Got 2 pair from this company the same order and both are so pretty!
5.0,Makes my hubby feet feel better after a long day at work
5.0,Tallis Prayer Shawl 24/72 Blue and Silver is my best prayer shawl!
5.0,I absolutely recommend this product! It's snug throughout but not too tight where it is uncomfortable. It's very breathable and easy to move in. It's great to wear under dresses and pants and minimally shows through. I also like how the inner lining of the black underwear is grey rather than black.
5.0,"Excellent fit and finish. Have never seen one of the $200+ straps sold for Rolexes but I can‚Äôt imagine how they would be better. Solid product for a fair price. You are buying a strap, not a watch."
5.0,"If you can‚Äôt tell by my name...I‚Äôm a MAN!!<br /> I Purchased this for my wife from my kids, for a Christmas present"
5.0,"While it‚Äôs not the best bracelet of this kind I have seen out there, it‚Äôs still cute for just $13.99. I recently saw other seller offered for much less but I have already given it away. Given it 5 starts because it looks nice and make someone very happy."
5.0,Steve Madden is my preferred boot brand. These fit the same as other styles from the brand (I'm always a 6.5 and this fit as expected.) The velvet texture is beautiful and I can't wait to rock these for fall!
5.0,I love this top however it fit a bit too tight for my taste. I purchased Med. My size I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and weight 125 LB It‚Äôs a bit tight on my upper belly and breast. If i got LG it would be too big. So if you like tight top it‚Äôs a very nice top.
5.0,Love the Lexus bling
5.0,Awesome Bag. Way better quality than I even imagined or expected!! It's definitely well worth the price
5.0,"My husband doesn't like umbrellas. I bought this to wear it on rainy and snowy days. It rained heavily today and it was exactly what he needed!  The design of the pockets and sleeve openings is very practical, and the fabric is soft and comfortable.  With it, I don't have to worry about him getting wet!"
5.0,"For the price point, these skivvies feel like my higher end underwear. As a matter of fact, I'm probably not going to buy CK undies anymore because these are a superior product. They feel like cotton but don't get loose at the legs and ride up like other boxer briefs. Great for being active in hot and/or humid environments."
5.0,I had about 6 wallets and I got rid of them all in place of this one.Has plenty of slots for my many id's and credit cards.
5.0,"The top fits true to size. I did have to alter length though, which was not a problem.  It was a beautiful little dress. Very affordable."
5.0,Great qulity
5.0,The shoulder strap was a bit short but minor concern
5.0,Nice size just a little bit larger than a money clip. Good material. I like it
5.0,"Ordered  xxl, was way to small"
5.0,Great product. Sturdy and pretty.  Son loved it
5.0,"I am normally a small<br />Or XS. Based on previous reviews that it ran a little small, I ordered a small & medium. The medium was too big.  The small had a little room so I ordered an XS just to be sure. That fit perfect for me. The dress has some stretch to it which is nice. I am 5‚Äô3 - 123lb and DD."
5.0,This was a fantastic Father's Day gift for my dad. He really like this pocket watch since he collects clocks.
5.0,A bit heavier than expected because it is so well made. Love it.
5.0,"Super bright colors, just as advertised, very high quality tights, and they fit just as expected."
5.0,wmw
5.0,Very well made and very beautiful!
5.0,I love this blue Topaz pendant beautiful and matches the earrings my husband gave me for Christmas perfectly
5.0,Fits perfect! I got a large. So silky and comfortable! And feel cute In it.
5.0,My husband absolutely love this shirt!
5.0,"wont fall off the backing even when pulled quite hard, hard to lose"
5.0,Was a gift and was received very well.
5.0,Great top and so glad you are carrying Lands End items now as it is easier to shop for almost everything at 1 site! Thanks Amazon.
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture! fits great and it arrived as expected...paint it with a little clear polish to make it last longer
5.0,Was surprised to find that the pants fit perfectly. I have long legs so I expected them to be a little short but they were a perfect length.
5.0,I ordered a larger size so it would fit. The larger size is extremely long. Beautiful and very good quality fabric.
5.0,"It is just slightly tight but will still work fine.  It also is a bit long for me, but I was able to take it up a bit."
5.0,I am new to watches and wanted to get a nice watch to get started with.  I wanted a fancy citizen watch for 99$ that was solar and sexy.  Buy my wife being the brains of the family suggested i start a bit smaller to see if i actually wear it.  This watch is very nice. It keeps time very well but there are a few issues that i have with it.  First the band feels very thick and stiff when you get it.  I wanted to replace it immediately. But why spend more on a band than i did the watch.  Do i wore it for two days and the leather molded pretty nicely around my wrist.  It had become very comfortable.  I don't like how the largest numbers on the face are the minutes instead of the hours. It's a small detail and i got used to it but i don't care for that aspect of it.  The date function works well and that's a nice plus.  It's not a small watch by any means but i have a wide wrist do it sits off center.  No big deal but maybe you care.  The most annoying thing to me is that the second hand does not land directly on each second.  It's a bit off i try not to look too closely because it bothers me and i can't say why. Overall this is a good product and if you can get over the tinfoil i listed you will be very pleased.  Buy with confidence.
5.0,Cute. I will buy again.
5.0,"This held everything, Even full size shampoo and conditioner."
5.0,I love it!  My favorite!!
5.0,"I don't do much skiing so keep that in mind as you read. However these work good for my uses. You just loop around and connect, making it easy to carry everything"
5.0,"Ordered saturday and got it Monday!<br />They're perfect and they do glow in the dark, check before you put the piercing in, it'll be easy that way<br />I took the first picture in my closet"
5.0,Joanna is a very nice lady.
5.0,Seems like high quality.  It was easy to adjust the metal links.  Looks classy compared to the silicone band.
5.0,"Great watch, great price."
5.0,I wore this to Nashville my son had a destination wedding and everyone hung out everyday at the pool. I looked great not too sexy but still hot never age appropriate just enough so he was comfortable n I was still happy. I would definitely recommend this for the fit style and occasion
5.0,"It's hard to find a maxi that is the right length, so score! Also the waist was higher than I liked, but actually fit my waist quite well! Hides the mushroom top üòä"
5.0,looks great - lovely!
5.0,"By adjustable, I thought it meant belt holes. It just means it's made out of elastic material and will stretch as much as you need it to, possibly leading to unflattering bulges. Luckily, it didn't bother me that much.<br />I must say these are super classy looking, elegant, and worth the price. They pair well with most solid color dresses, and are professional enough to wear to work."
5.0,Fits just right for me size 8.5 shoe  -- just right amount of compression
5.0,Love it!!  Fits perfectly and is soft and comfortable.
5.0,"This dress is fabulous!! It‚Äôs super comfy! The fabric is soft and flowy! It hugs all the right places. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù & 204lbs with a lot of junk in the trunk. I‚Äôve already ordered this dress in a second color. Also, pockets!"
5.0,Buttery soft leather.  Perfect size for me. A very nice conceal carry purse! Tons of pockets
5.0,"If you want simple and functional over expensive and fancy, go with  this version. It is very sturdy,long enough to hold onto easily, and will hold your jewelry firmly. I have have nothing but positive experience with it. I also like that it is lightweight."
5.0,I bought this for my adult daughter & added charms to it. She loves it!
5.0,"These are so cute,  my daughter wrote them for xmas, and got many compliments..she wears a sz 11, I ordered an 11, they are slightly big, but I expected that."
5.0,Love it. Just as pictured.
5.0,Perfect watch for me. I love everything about it

5.0,Was a Mother's Day gift. She loves it.
5.0,My fiance loves his shirts
5.0,She loves it. She's worn 4 times and it's a conversation piece and at times special treatment.
5.0,Product maintained shape and color after washing in cold water
5.0,This shawl is very luxurious: velvety soft with a nice weight  to it. When wrapped around your shoulders it feels like a warm embrace. It would make the perfect gift for a best friend if you could part with it. Indulge yourself or your close one with the understated elegance and outstanding quality of this beautiful wrap.
5.0,"Soft, well-made, love this pajama set"
5.0,My sister saw me wearing them and promptly asked if she could have them :). I of course obliged but I got on Amazon as soon as I could and ordered another pair. That's how much I like them! They are very shiny and....they certainly are attention-getters. Very easy to put on and very easy to take off. One of the best!
5.0,thats all
5.0,These are so cute and convenient I will say the hand area is a bit small but it can be tweaked a bit with cutting and maybe resewing or something
5.0,These were purchased for a Bible study group gift exchange and they were a hit!  The recipient wore them the rest of the evening and had great fun!  She did say later that her cats weren't certain what to do when she wore them around the house.
5.0,"Homeyee dresses are beautiful and comfortable! I have purchased 5 dresses and love them all! They are true to size, if you are conservative size up. Quality dresses at affordable prices. I highly recommend this product."

5.0,I love it. Really cute.
5.0,"I recently ordered my husband a size 38 in this LUCHENGYI Men Canvas Belt. I was pleased when it was delivered. When I opened the box there was yet another box ( see pictures below)<br />Inside a metal black 6x6  attractive box just the box is worthy of mention this would be a nice gift box or as in my case I'm keeping it for myself knowing I'll find a use for it somewhere.<br /><br />The belt itself is a attractive one. It is thicker than I had thought it would be about 1/4 inches thick maybe a slight more my eyes are not really best these days. The tongue is solid brown leather and the buckle is a matted brownish - gray color metal matches well. The canvas part of belt or the back portion is a darker brown with lighter brown stitching ( see pictures below ) the stitching that runs along the seams are also a lighter beige color. I inspected all seams for loose threads or flaws and could not find any. The overall craftsmanship of this belt I would say is very good.<br /><br />  My husband likes it very much and it fits him well. I ordered a 38 and when I went to show my husband the size I could not find it anywhere on the belt. I would suggest they stamp size somewhere on belt. Other than that he loves it and I'm happy his pants are not sagging.<br /><br />I would recommend this belt it is attractive, well made and priced fairly.<br /><br />Disclosure.  I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review. This discount does not effect or influence my opinion of this product."
5.0,This dress definitely deserves 5 stars and two thumbs up. I have gotten nothing but compliments since I walked out my door this morning. Absolute strangers are complimenting me on this dress. It's a perfect fit and I love the flowing factor of the dress. In flats or heels this dress works!!!

5.0,Really nice looking watch! Highly recommended. Turned out great for wedding pictures!
5.0,Very comfortable love the fact that they protect my eyes from the bright sun
5.0,"Finally leggings that are thickly lined and keep me warm in outdoor winter weather!! Thin fleece lined leggings won't do it, you need these for sure. They are too short for me but I don't hold that against them since I'm very tall. I just make up the difference with tall socks. Also I ordered a size up after the first ones were a bit too snug. These are a must buy for anyone in colder climates!"
5.0,I received a ton of compliments on this shirt. The fabric is so soft. LOVE LOVE LOVE
5.0,Love this it so beautiful. As an Autism Mom I LOVE wearing it. It's well made and so beautiful. I get asked where'd I get that all the time and it's so beautiful any time I wear it. I love it. A Beautiful Well Made Jewelry Set.
5.0,Absolutely love it. I am large-chested but smaller in the waist. I got a large just to make sure the v-neck fit correctly (I'm DD cup). On the adjustment I need to make would be to shorten it a little bit at the bottom as I am only 5'2. It feels great!!
5.0,fits great and the style is lit !!
5.0,love the colors to put on these are by far good investment....love them

5.0,"The color is beautiful, fits perfect, breathable, so so comfortable, I recommend this outfit!"
5.0,"Sooo I normally wear 8 in boots. I read the other reviews about downsize and end ordering 7 and 7.5. The 7.5 fit GREAT!!! My foot are narrow and legs are skinny and I feel this boots fit me like a glove LOVE IT!! They are not real leather but they are not stiff, they are pretty flexible.. LOVE IT!!  My only concern is the sole is plain as you see in the product pictures, so I hope they don't get slippery in some type of floors.<br /> I already order the 7.5 in brown !!!<br />In conclusion I LOVE THEM in black, that's why I will have them in both colors !!!"
5.0,Super cute!  I got a lot of compliments on them.  Highly recommend!!
5.0,"My daughter LOVES this hoodie! She is a big fan of Attack on Titan, but wasn‚Äôt sure about it from the online pics. It‚Äôs a tee shirt hoodie so it‚Äôs thin. When it came in she squealed! I got her an adult medium, and it is just a tiny bit big on her, but that‚Äôs how she wanted it. She‚Äôs in 5th grade and 105 lbs. I would recommend this shirt. Very pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,Ayudan bastante y quedan bien ajustadas
5.0,"This bottle opener is amazing.  Not only is it perfect for golf and a fun conversation starter, it works great.<br /><br />For those courses that allow glass bottles this is a must have.<br /><br />I love the sturdy and larger size carabiner.  From the pics you can see how I attach it to my key.<br /><br />The carabiner also allows for quick release without having to remove the key or turn off the golf cart.<br /><br />It fits perfectly in your hand and it is easy to open the bottles with it.."
5.0,Great customer service from Delmonico Hatter! Bailey makes a quality hat.
5.0,"I have Raynaud's disease, so my fingers turn white and become a bit painful/numb when exposed to cold weather for too long. I hike frequently and spend lots of time outside in the colder months, so I got these mittens for short bike rides outside and long hikes. I really love how warm they are. Even when it is windy, although they are not windproof, they keep my fingers very warm. This pair plus handwarmers inside keeps my hands toasty for hours. Also, they clean really easily in the washing machine."
5.0,My granddaughter is wearing this outfit today for the first time.  It's adorable.  Washed well... very little shrinkage.  Very happy.

5.0,Bathing my new puppy.
5.0,"We have a toddler that outgrew his 2T minion pajamas right around his second birthday. Granted, it‚Äôs funny watching him try to squeeze into a pajama that fits like spandex, but it‚Äôs not practical. This set was exactly as described, got him to forget about the previously loved set and fits as expected."
5.0,My 7 year old daughter loves this dress! The skirt is nice and puffy and is fun to twirl in. The cap sleeves and criss cross back are cute without being revealing. My only wish is for the material on the top to be a little thicker but it is ok. Definitely buy this for your little princess.
5.0,Love it. Will buy more
5.0,Every body around me give me so many compliments for this beautiful shirt
5.0,"The fit, the feel, and the durability is amazing!"

5.0,"I bought this bag originally for a vacation/cruise over a year ago. I was looking for a bag that was smaller than regular school backpacks but big enough to fit enough stuff for walking all day. Let me tell you, this bag was exactly what I was looking for! To this day, I still use it for my vacations, hikes, and beach days. I am able to fit my planner, pens, wallet, sunglasses, and 3 bottles of water in the big pocket as well as keys and other smaller stuff in the front pocket. There is also a little pocket in the back :) highly recommended!"
5.0,"I did buy a larger size than I would buy normally but it fit great. Super cute.  The halter straps on the top did start to detach from the bra at the top of the connection after about 2 washes, but this may have been prevented if i had used a garment bag."

At first these appeared to be thinner than a normal thick sweat pant however, they are so warm and lightweight, the fabric is great. It is nice to find a pair of sweats that don't shrink in length and are a good length to begin with, they fit my wife who is 5'8 perfectly. Would definitely buy these again."

Soft and comfy, you can't go wrong with these socks! The girls have so much fun, mixing and matching them so that it looks like the characters are fighting or hanging out together. Lol!

The snaps at the side and neck make it very easy to slip over his head. Material is comfortable and very soft. He‚Äôs a big, tall guy, so we ordered the 3XL...it fits pretty well."
5.0,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE 2&#34; INCH HOOP EARRINGS...  I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM FALLING OUT WHEN I PUT THEM ON. THEY SNAP CLOSED SNUGGLY. THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN THE YELLOW GOLD COLOR.  THEY DO NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN. HANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUCH A WELL JEWELRY!
5.0,"I had a pair similar to this for about two years. My dog chewed them up, naturally I was devastated. Luckily I knew the size and the brand therefore I was able to order them online through Amazon. They arrive fast and actually look better than my older ones"
5.0,He says that he don‚Äôt even feel them when wearing them hopefully they last!!!
5.0,I purchased these to complete my aesthetic and they do exactly what I wanted them to! They really give off that cute nerd vibe
5.0,Holds my Raycon Headphones in the studio. I'm very protective of them so the fact that it's sturdy enough for me to trust it with them says a lot if that makes sense. Make sure you don't shrug off the surface prep steps. Trust me.
5.0,Great product BUT....it‚Äôs a bitch to open. I fight with it every time. If there‚Äôs a trick someone please tell me.
5.0,"I love this top, it's so dang cute my sister and a dear friend both bought one!"
5.0,High quality piece that fits my wardrobe.  Dainty piece to add to my outfits.  It has held up well and no turning colors.
5.0,Great product.  Got it for the wife for Christmas.  She will love it
5.0,That is the sentiment on these socks and I LOVE them! I've washed and dried mine several times and the quality remains the same. I've given them for gifts and they always get raves. I even gave the child socks (a pair with a spare). I've bought several to keep on hand as gifts.
5.0,"Love the look and will be great for golfing.  I wish it had pockets on the outside, not in the shorts."
5.0,Works great computer
5.0,I bought these as a birthday present for my husband. They are really good quality and fit him quite well. The company contacted me as soon as the order was shipped out.
5.0,These are great. Husband is on his feet all day and his legs and feet were fatigued and painful. These socks cured the problem completely!
5.0,I have sun damage on my arms and wanted something to cover it up. These sleeves are very pretty and don't look cheap. I am happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I love the design, the colors, the fabric, everything really. I just wish it were a little wider, at least about 4 &#34;(10 cm)."
5.0,"A few of the links had fallen off when I recieved it, but they were still in the bag so I was able to re-attach them with some needle nosed plyers. If I had stronger nails that probably would have worked to. Anyway, it is very pretty. Don't let the picture of it on the girl fool you though. It looks like the picture on the right. (only one strand, not two) Really no need for two anyway. It has enough detail by itself."
5.0,Love these socks! After wearing these I refuse to wear cotton socks any more. Keep my feet cool and dry. Completely eliminated blister issues I had been having with cotton socks
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband who is 6'5"". It fits him perfectly and he's already wanting to order another one! The material is light and airy and it has high quality. I would definitely recommend this item."
5.0,My daughter picked this backpack for the 1st day of kindergarten and she was very pleased when it arrived!! I love the matching lunch box and the fact it's a set.
5.0,These are awesome color changing sunglasses! Other brands sell for $60 or more. I expected them to be flimsy but they're not. Thick and decently made for price and color changing ability and also comfortable to wear. I bought the 'Peach/Yellow' and they turn a dark magenta/pink in the sunshine. I'm not sure if the other color options change into the same pink? They are fun and I plan to purchase more.
5.0,It was a gift and she absolutely loves it. She receives compliments all the time.
5.0,My favorite Hawaiian shirt.
5.0,Love these.  Perfect combo... light weight but big enough to get noticed.
5.0,Todo bien es igual como se muestra en las im√°genes.
5.0,"Painted with clear polish. Ordered silver and gold. Both are still wonderful after a year of periodic wearing. No tarnish....Weird gold, but matchings gold on typical buttons or zippers on clothes. Great gift and purchase. Size is a half dollar or a little bigger than a milk jug top."
5.0,It is very nice and fits well.  Not much else to say
5.0,These were a hit at my daughter's Quincea√±era!  Everyone loved them.

5.0,Most outstanding purse I have ever seen anywhere.  Just beautiful!!!!  The photo of this purse does not do it justice.  Gorgeous.
5.0,Got this as a gift for a friend that loves Mickey Mouse and she lovesssssss it
5.0,The dress is stunning. ü§óüòä‚ò∫The cobalt blue is so gorgeous.üëç It is a little see through. So a slit is needed. I receive so many complements.
5.0,They are very comfortable and the color selection is spot-on. I'll probably buy more.
5.0,Great value for the money. Variety of colors. Big jewels to make it stand out. Overall nice pieces. Fast shipping.
5.0,Perfect size and color of both the cross and the string.  Very simple symbol.
5.0,"This skirt will be very long and big in the waist. I am a voluptuous woman. I sent back a large and got a small. Since I opted for the smaller size, I have to put it on from the head. This skirt is beautiful and well made. I always get compliments every time I wear it. It was so beautiful I decided to order two more colors, while they are nice, they still do not compare to this one."
5.0,"If Teal or Green is your favorite Color, you should accent your wardrobe with a gorgeous Multilayer teal and black crystal teardrop choker necklace!"
5.0,These fit great and are awesome quality for the price
5.0,Love this sweater. Colors are exactly as pictured and it is one of my favorites.
5.0,Love them! My grand daughter is 4 and she wears a size 10. These are a little big on her but some dress shoes are half size off. She put them on as soon as they got here and wore them for hours. They are well made and beautiful.
5.0,easy to put on with zzipper in front. Supports
5.0,"Love the way they fit, and soft as cotton can be."
5.0,I bought these not knowing if they would fit well or if they would be uncomfortable to wear with flannel sheets.  They are so silky soft that this was not a problem.  They are very well made and fit perfectly.  I love them.
5.0,my metal plate was durable even after it survived the CA warehouse fire. I got a note saying the packaging was damaged in the fire and it was fine.
5.0,"This is the cutest sweatshirt. Everything about the purchase was good and easy . I ordered a XL which I thought was a kid size but was bigger than I expected. This however is a good thing in my opinion. My daughter is a lil on the chubby side and it will still give her room to grow into it . It‚Äôs adorable and well made . The quality feels like it will last a few years if taken care of . This was definitely one of my daughters favorite Christmas gifts . The price was also very good especially with how good quality it is . Thank u so much , we love it"
5.0,I love this necklace. It's beautiful and very inexpensive.
5.0,Lovely  charms
5.0,so elegant.
5.0,Earrings were beautiful
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9d2f0149ac8b32f6bf171b690e37711d]] The fabric is thick and by no means cheap. But because I sized up one size to a medium, I was hoping for a looser fit, and I got the looser fit however, the arms and wrists were looser than I expected. I‚Äôm hoping with a good wash and dry it may shrink a little, but I overall love the fit the high in the front and low in the back the details on this it‚Äôs a very classic and unique look. Versatile to fit, dressed up or casual with some sneakers. Love this and will buy again in more colors. I just may get my usual small."
5.0,Many plane rides are just too cold for me the blanket was AWESOME to have aboard and fit in my back pack nicely!
5.0,"Great Wallet!<br />After constantly wearing out my debit card while carrying it in a regular leather wallet it is a welcome pace to see my cards and other items protected and dry.  I spend many days afield hunting here where I live in all kinds of conditions and this wallet does the job.  While it is not for carrying large amounts of cash (as if anyone does these days) it is perfect for all the personals, cards and a moderate amount of cash for emergencies.  I would rate it a 4.8 and the best wallet I have ever owned.<br /><br />Thanks."
5.0,"I was looking for something to clean my jewelry fast, and i found it! This cloth is very easy to use and it definitely cleans and polish my jewelry. Good alternative compared to chemicals that are very hazardous and can make any situation worse. Im very satisfied!"
5.0,"Since I don't make long, treacherous hikes, I figured these would fit the bill nicely.  Waiting for better weather to try them on the trails, but have worn them around town and they are very comfortable and light weight.  Since I need more arch support than they have, I will add my own insoles.  They offer nice ankle support.  Don't think you can go wrong with these even if the only ""hiking"" you do is around the neighborhood!"
5.0,"""This is a unique little gift for a sorority sister. It met my expectations, and I may decide to order others."""
5.0,"Really happy how thrust dress turned out!! Bridal pictures for me on the beach, super laid back, cute and fitted, and was the perfect size. I'm 5'9 120 small and it fit like a glove. Highly recommend if you don't need the fuss of a crazy expensive white/bridal dress!"
5.0,I love the way this dress hugs to my body.
5.0,"The watch is very nice, I am satisfied with all aspects partaking. The packaging hadhad class to it as well. The only problem is the band removal tool. It is weak and requires direct pressure otherwise it will easily bend. (Makes it easy to bend back tho lol) I was able to fit it to my wrist without braking the tool, but again, it requires steadiness and attention to detail.<br />I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for a cheap, nice touch to their attire"
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Great color and size
5.0,Gave it as a gift. Was very cute and quality materials.
5.0,"Love these, great fit. Will be ordering more."
5.0,"Runs small but a perfect fit for &#34;ME&#34;- I'm a very petite woman. I usually need to have my clothes altered to fit but not this time.<br />Depending on your size and how you like to wear your clothes, it could be a little tight around the shoulders and arms, if my arms and shoulders were slightly bigger it would be uncomfortable to wear but for me its a perfect fit."
5.0,"I love these tunics, very comfortable. Fits tighter on top and loose around hips."
5.0,Shinola Watch is made in the U.S.A. and large<br />Face I can see. üòÅ
5.0,"I bought these to go with this dress (HUHOT Summer Dresses, Women Flared Midi Dress with Short Sleeves Floral Skater Dresses(Flower-13,Small) and it looked great!!  So cute...very pretty details."
5.0,love them just wish they were a little larger
5.0,"Does what it should , and doesn‚Äôt itch"
5.0,"Wasn‚Äôt for me but for my grandma and she love it it fit it perfectly and if she‚Äôs happy am happy, if you know your size and get your size you won‚Äôt have any complains :)"

5.0,Pretty and flattering
5.0,Exactly the way it looks in the picture . Satisfied
5.0,Usual excellent quality with buying Life Is Good. Graphic of Jake & Rocket very cute!
5.0,"I probably have 20 Fitness Fox headbands in different styles and fabrics (check out the website for lots of fun options). They are well-made, hold up great in the wash, absorb sweat like crazy, and, most importantly, they stay on my head no matter what activity I'm doing. Seriously, yoga, running, crossfit, they can handle anything and look good doing it. I've already recommended them to several friends and would not hesitate to do so again."
5.0,Very nice jacket. Doesn't make you feel like your in a box. Comfortable and very well made.
5.0,"This was really unique. I liked it a lot. I thought it was flattering. I thought it was different. You could dress it up or down by what you wear with it. I like things that you don't see that often.<br /><br />The fit was good. It fit on well. Because you tie it, it is pretty flattering and adjustable. It was extremely comfortable. I was very happy and would recommend it."
5.0,Never ordered.
5.0,My husband is picky and tough on belts. He says these are the best ones he has tried. Hopefully they will last a long time!
5.0,This headband was a great affordable option to dressing up for Halloween without being over the top or anything. I wore it for about 4 hours straight & it didn‚Äôt hurt my head at all. The lights worked right out of the package. The button was easy to access while still on my head to change the lights from stagnant to flashing. So cute!
5.0,"I think this is a fabulous dress! It would make a great staple piece in any wardrobe! I am 5'7, dress size 6, pants size 11, and 148lbs. A small fit beautifully! The fabric is soft, stretchy, and warm(Perfect for this mid October)! I paired it with my knee high boots! I believe it paired nicely with a solid scarf, a high waist belt, and a cardigan! I love the v neck! The best feature is the pockets! Overall a very nicely made dress! I would buy again!"
5.0,"I am 6'4"" and fit fine."
5.0,"Big fan of Aurola leggings & shorts, i have quite a few pairs."
5.0,Perfect!  No seams to cause chafing which is what I have a hard time finding.
5.0,"I purchased the ice cream purse. The quality is great. It fits my iPhone 6plus, small wallet, a few makeup items and be able to fully zip close. The chain is long. I'm 5'5&#34; and it hangs down to my hips. The chain is removable. I'm in love with this purse."
5.0,"It's soft and lightweight, but also keeps you quite warm and snuggly on those chilly days.  Quality product that's not like anything I've seen in stores.  Adds a nice flair and texture to your look.  It does take me a minute to fuss with it and get it to lay like the picture, but well worth it. If you like the ruffled style as well as lookin' good while stayin' warm, then here it is!"
5.0,"These socks are very soft. They seem thin which is good for breathing, but might cause them to wear too fast. Will update if this is a problem."
5.0,We love this
5.0,"My stepson loves it, super cute and functional! Also like it's not stiff and rubbery for him."
5.0,Love them very happy
5.0,"Fits well, looks good. Held up well in wash. Love it!  Will buy from here again."
5.0,"Purchased in May, so have been wearing these for several months now. Fit exactly as expected and much better quality than I thought they would be for the price. Broke in comfortably after wearing them a few days.<br /><br />I will disagree with other reviewers regarding some saying the tread of the boots is too soft or thin. I personally like this because they provide a superior grip to harder compounds. For those that use hiking boots to actually hike, this is a significant plus in my opinion. Have worked extremely well so far and held up great for Tennessee and Kentucky trips. I've got a feeling these will be better than the Columbia, Timberland, or Merrill boots I've previously used when I make my yearly trip out west this fall. This may be my new go to brand."
5.0,"Go Dawgs!  Nice purple color with a great ""W"".  I love the detachable loop.  Great for valet parking or when you have multiple keys for different locations/purposes. Would buy again."
5.0,"Bought this for my son, it fits him comfortably. He wears it to work. Washes well!"
5.0,"This dress is amazing! It‚Äôs very loose, but it‚Äôs still flattering.. don‚Äôt ask me how that‚Äôs possible. It hung right above my knees, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6. The chest area does sit a little low, and when I bent over it was possible to see just a little more than I wanted exposed. I wore a tank top with it that matched the dresser and it looked so cute. I did wear this to work at the hospital. I got lots of compliments. I wish it came in different colors and designs‚Ä¶"
5.0,The scarf is exactly as pictured and extremely light.  Received on time.  Happy with the purchase.
5.0,I love this dress. It‚Äôs perfect for the spring. It‚Äôs so nice for a weekend out with the family.
5.0,Love this band!  It is my second one and probably not my last.
5.0,My niece loved the cowboy hat for her bearded dragon! Excellent transaction! Thanks!
5.0,Love this!! Fits perfect and is so comfy!!
5.0,"This is the second pair of these leggings that I own. I have nearly worn the first pair completely out, so it was time to replace them. They do run a bit on the small size, so I size up and they fit perfectly! Great legging for either boots, booties or flats! I must have staple item for your wardrobe!"
5.0,These leggings fit just as I had hoped. Just the right amount of compression throughout the legs and I love the compression in the high waist tummy area. The green is completely squat proof. These are a great alternative to the more expensive name brand leggings.
5.0,It was delivered earlier than I expected.  I love it! A couple small dings on the back but other than that it looks perfect! It will make a great gift for my Swedish boyfriend.
5.0,"I bought this for my husband. He is a bigger guy, so I was concerned that it may not fit his head, but it fits perfectly and he says it‚Äôs warm, for those cold mornings, working outside. The sound is great. I would recommend this to anyone. Such a cool product."
5.0,"When I purchased this in Large color black, I was actually 16 weeks pregnant, a little bloated (190lb, pear shape) but the stretch in this product is amazing!!!!<br /><br /> The skirt is light weight, form fitting and comfortable. The top is soft, on the thicker side material and comfortable! I have smaller waist and small boobs but it was still VERY form fitting too! But I think it looked great not too short/cropped.<br /> idk if on large chested women it would be very cropped??<br /><br />If it‚Äôs a hot day I‚Äôd probably swap the top but for a night out or a cooler day, this is perfect!!!<br />Plus it made my pear shape body look amazing! I wanna buy the red now !"
5.0,My boyfriend has used a minimalist wallet for years and absolutely loves it! was concerned about reviews about it breaking but so far its held up great. Would buy again!
5.0,Nice material and quality.
5.0,"Good quality, perfect height for work shoes. Not too high, not too low"
5.0,"My waist measures 33&#34; and the belt fits great. Seems durable, lays flat, and the elastic is very stretchy. No complaints. It even reminds me of the Hello Kitty bow, which I find adorable. I plan to wear it with my pencil skirt. I greatly recommend."
5.0,Roomy and easy to get to content while easily fitting in my front pocket.
5.0,LOVE THESE HEADBANDS!!! Literally the best headbands on planet earth. These are the only ones I have found to fit my head and stay in place all day and during my workouts! And they dont give headaches like others. So soft and you can wash them like regular clothes! love love love fitness fox headbands and hairties!!!
5.0,Great quality and well worth the price. Used them in 20 degree weather and I was very comfortable.
5.0,My grandmother loves it. Very comfy.
5.0,The costume fits well and is comfortable.  A good costume to buy.
5.0,"Soft material.  A little thin so I wore a white tank under it. The darker colors at the bottom were not see through. Super cute, very comfortable.  Colors did not bleed in the wash. I usually wear a 16 in pants / extra large.  I bought an extra large and it fits perfect."
5.0,"soft, comfy, love the look"
5.0,very soft I ordered up a size cause I like loose but and flowing.  Nice and loose falls to hips and I'm 5'7.
5.0,Lenses are legit. Real happy with them. Swapped out the old with the new in no time. Perfect fit. Even have me a sticker!!
5.0,I bought this top after seeing a similar made blouse sold for quite a bit more. Great quality and satisfied with the fit and price
5.0,It's hard to buy clothing without first trying it on.  This dress did not disappoint.  It fits me perfectly and size estimates stated were exactly as described.  Dress received was exactly as pictured also.  Would order from this company again!
5.0,"Love this dress! Super sexy! No bra needed because it has good support and has adjustable straps, I am very busty 40D 5‚Äô4 190 pounds , I bought a yellow one in a large and it was tight but looks good, XL was perfect gloves look without looking too tight...I bought this dress in white, black and yellow! Love Love Love it! The material is nice too! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,This is the most useful phone case I have ever owned. I don't have to worry about my phone falling out of my back pocket. It the perfect reason to ditch my giant purse.
5.0,"I probably shouldn't even bother writing this, as there are hundreds of reviews already. I'm a Casio watch collector, so I can't resist. I have the &#34;higher-end&#34; brother of this watch, the A158W. It has the stainless steel band. The function is the same, but this one is much more comfortable, due to the soft and semi-porous resin band, compared to the hair-pulling bracelet. It also has the superior electro-luminescent backlight. (the A158W has a single, dim LED on the side, which brings me back to the 80s, when they had incandescent side lights)<br /><br />The A158W has a nicer display. The light gray background is smoother. On the F91W, we can see the gray background is kind of grainy and not quite as contrasting with the LCD digits. The A158W looks more dressy though; doesn't make you embarassed to wear it to business casual work."
5.0,"These earrings are really pretty, given as a gift and glad I purchased."
5.0,My 8 year old son loves to run around in costume playing. This adds to the fun.
5.0,Cool tie.  Battery life is short. Brighter than i thought it would be.
5.0,Nice officially licensed tee for game days. Has held up well through several washes (no peeling of the text like you find in some shirts of lesser quality) Happy with the purchase.<br />Thanks
5.0,Very cute!! Went great with my 50‚Äôs outfit!!
5.0,"Excellent hat.  It was exactly what I was looking for, a nice conservative but not dowdy hat.  I needed to replace a favorite felt hat that I had worn since 2006 or so, and this turned out to be a good choice.  The brim/crown proportions are pleasing to me, and the felt feels substantial.  The sizing choice provided on the product page ran true.<br /><br />I didn't realize the interior was lined as it was, but that was a big plus.  I got it at the tail end of Texas winter, so didn't have long to wear it before having to put it away, but I will have it out again next winter."
5.0,It was just as pictured and the seams seem to be well made.
5.0,"I love the front cut on this blouse - long cut from the upper torso to just above the belly button with long intertwined lace. It does not have the under garment, so you must wear teddy-type under garment to cover the sexy long cut (or you may wear it just by itself and reveal a little view of your chest with bra and some part of your upper torso '). The long front cut reminds me on those Rennaissance dresses as well. I am 34B-106# - 5'2. My usual size is small, or petite 0/2. This blouse is made with 100% polyester and it fits me well.It's heavy material and cool enough to wear but it does not absorb the sweat in the summer. The color is sparkle olive. Since I am smaller frame, this blouse when I wear by itself is actually half way between body and  my knees. I wear this for a social / girls evening gathering with black Capri. My friends love the front cut of the blouse as well. It looks sexy."
5.0,"Good quality, fast shipping! My daughter loves I  would recommend this product üß°"
5.0,This dress fits perfectly and is super classy. Highly recommend and might get one in every color!
5.0,BEAUTIFUL! The necklace arrived earlier than expected and is beautiful. Much heavier than expected. Well made and very unique. I purchased for my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:82532bd79ad85eb4e3c858d693a26733]] I‚Äôm a personal trainer so I can right away tell if this is a hit or miss! BIG HIT! It‚Äôs not see through, it shapes you well, fits as expected.<br />I‚Äôm about 118lbs, 5-5, usually wearing XS or S.<br />The feel on the skin is great and the ombr√© effect is awesome! Bf loves it! I wish they had more colors in ombr√© though‚Ä¶ A MUST HAVE!"
5.0,I am a size 11 and these socks fit well.
5.0,Is a gift.. Waiting for when I give to him the reaction.
5.0,"I need a thin, flowy tank for Warped Tour this year so I don't die of a heat stroke (it's always held in the middle of July here in Cincinnati) and this is perfect! I have a pretty long torso so I always have trouble finding flowy tanks that go past my waist and this fits perfectly! I'm about 5'8 and 179lbs for comparison."
5.0,These are cute and funƒè
5.0,I bought the Elephant case. So super cute!! Very sturdy and fits my thin frame glasses wonderfully. The inside is velvety soft and protects very well.
5.0,nice material and fits well
5.0,They fit perfectly and are a great for running breathable fabric love them thank you
5.0,This is a great motivational component that reminds me to move on
5.0,Received just as pictured
5.0,This fits my GMT II perfectly. It‚Äôs visually indistinguishable from the OEM Rolex links. The quality is excellent. And the price is certainly much lower than your pay for genuine Rolex parts.<br /><br />The only thing of which to be aware is the included screw doesn‚Äôt seem to mate up well with the original Rolex links. So you just need to be sure to use the screw that comes with the link with that exact link. Not a big deal.
5.0,good in hot sand to play volley
5.0,"I have gotten more compliments on this purse then I ever had any other designer purse I own. The purple is on point, it's a rich plum and it is gorgeous!  I have random people come up and tell me how much they love my purse, and when I tell them where I got it and the price they just can't believe it. I've had this purchase for a couple weeks now and use it as my every day purse and it still looks as good as the day I got it. I soooooo recommend the purple, you won't be disappointed!"
5.0,"I go through luggage quickly but this set is holding up nicely. The wheels roll easily, the inside lining is high quality and the handle is well made. The plastic travel baggy in each suitcase is an awesome bonus. And the pockets in front are perfect for throwing in last minute things. Great value for the price. I love that they can link together so I can push my son's stroller and pull 2 suitcases at once. I had a difficult time finding 4 wheel suitcases that would link together. I'm very happy with this set!"
5.0,This brand is great. I order a size smaller for better support.
5.0,"I love the style, however I should have ordered a 36 waist as it is very small. Also they are much longer than a 34 length and come unhemmed? For the price I would expect them to be the length ordered &#34;not do it yourself. I am still giving them an excellent rating because the quality of the material and the style are great."
5.0,I love this bra. It fits perfectly. Good support without being too tight. I'm glad I ordered up in size as recommended in other reviews. Delivery was fast. I will be ordering another one of these in the future. Extremely happy with my purchase.
5.0,To wear to protect me from COVID 19
5.0,"I love it! It's casual and comfortable. I am 5&#34;4, ~140lb, got a medium which fits great. It's more of a weekend casual dress, but I even wore it to church with black leggings and boots and looked good."
5.0,Perfect for my mailbox key so I don't lose it.
5.0,"Better quality than I expected.  I have a 22.5&#34; head and it was on the large side.  If you're smaller than that, it'll probly be hard to wear but larger and you're good to go.  Great for quick costumes or if you need something to paint or cover.  The patch and decorations were easy to remove and were not glued, so no marks left behind."
5.0,Got these for my princess for Christmas and she loves them
5.0,Very comfortable was able to wear them all day to shop.
5.0,Perfect for MMA classes. It fits really well and does not slip out during a hard workout
5.0,Gorgeous!!!! These are definitely worth the money. I get so many compliments on them.
5.0,Adorable! So bursting with color! I am officially only buying from Amazon. From forever 21 and even Francesca's they're 4 times more (not at forever 21) and break. This feels sturdy and is definitely attention seeking! If you like the image you'll like the product (excuse the image it was for Instagram so a couple purchases are shown)
5.0,It‚Äôs great looking and pops off the watch .
5.0,My toddler loves them! Very durable
5.0,Really set. I bought it for my wedding it is very elegant!
5.0,"Very superb watch. So far, so good I've been getting great comments on this watch. Every button and every dial on the watch works. Besides being so bulky, it has some weight to it. The only downside to this watch is the bands. The bands is too small."
5.0,"My replacement sweater came so fast. The size XL fits perfectly. I ordered a darker color, purple, but I like this sweater so much I may get it in another color."
5.0,just what I wanted.. .thank you!!
5.0,Now!  This is a true Green Bay packers bracelet.  I was expecting something cheap.  It‚Äôs not!  This is a very sharp bracelet. Get It and you won‚Äôt regret it!
5.0,Very attractive. Comfortable. Updated my high school watch so I enjoy wearing it again. üëçüèªüëçüèª
5.0,I love this dress. It fitted perfectly. I use it for work regularly. I have been complemented every time I wear it. The material is soft. My only issue is I find the end of the sleeve itches my skin. To resolve this issue  i just fold up the sleeve a little. Other than that I find the dress to be great for the price.
5.0,"Great product, as described. Good quality."
5.0,The most comfortable jeans you could ever wear.<br />I will continue to purchase them.
5.0,"These socks took my air travel to another level. My legs were not swollen for the first time I think. Great product, I'll never fly without them!"
5.0,I ordered this for my daughter's kindergarten Graduation photo shoot and it was beyond perfect!
5.0,"Bought for mom who‚Äôs 50, she loves it and wants in every color... I also want one. It‚Äôs cute!"
5.0,"The necklace is so beautiful, and my 12 y/o son got it for me this Mother's Day (2020), so it is very meaningful to me especially when he explained why he picked it.  The silver & rose gold tones really compliment one another.  I love the moon background & the fact that it has a Mama bear & baby bear isn't ""just because"".  My son said he picked this necklace in particular because of my ""Mama Bear Attitude"", and because I don't let anyone hurt him.  My son's father (my EX-husband) has an evil, manipulative girlfriend, and she likes to bully my son & has even put her hands on him & when I found out I showed her ""Mama Bear Attitude"" - no holding back.  Twelve year olds don't usually show emotions, and now is when they start pushing away from their parents.  So, this past Mother's Day will most likely be one of the best mother's days that I will ever remember."
5.0,Very nice dress for the price.  I bought this for a costume party but the dress is higher quality than your typical costumes out at this time of year.  I am a 36in chest and the 38 size dress is snug up top.
5.0,very fashionable and comfortable
5.0,Adorable! So many compliments!!!!
5.0,"Great boots, are truly waterproof."
5.0,Fit snuggly; stay put!
5.0,I love this shirt! Super comfy! The company was great responding to me when I had questions!
5.0,Very cute I‚Äôm tall so it‚Äôs a little shorter than I hoped but nothing a pair of leggings can‚Äôt fix! It runs large though get a size smaller. Def comfy and not see through like many of the inexpensive dresses you find.
5.0,"warm, comfortable, touch screen works, and fast shipping."
5.0,Perfect to keep my ears warm on my walks.  Good price for product.  Fits well.
5.0,Nice pair of glasses. You'll see the world just red.
5.0,"Very beautiful raw silk scarves. Can wear singly or double. Be gentle with them and they can last a long time !<br />Good packing, quick receipt: Thanks so much!"
5.0,"Leather of excellent quality, beautiful color easy to combine, small but functional."
5.0,"I bought this for my bathroom usage. I used to wear a normal slippers which had no particular cushion with it. However, I decided to try this ergonomically design slippers. It turns out great and the massage foam is fantastic and comfortable."
5.0,"beautiful, arrived on time. Gives you a glamorous look with any dress or shirt."
5.0,"love these! If you gotta wear 'em, it's awesome to be fashionable as well! bought another pair for backup! got the bright colored ones, too!"
5.0,Love it fits perfect and doesn‚Äôt get tangled in my hair
5.0,This wallet is so cute and functional. It is well made and a perfect match for my faux-leather bag I bought too. It came quickly and was just as described.
5.0,"I am 6' and 195# with wide, sensative feet.  I looked for months to find a slipper with proper fit and supportive foot bed.  Most slippers are flat with foam or very little support. The toe box is wide and tall--unlike most slippers.<br /><br />This model, Orthofeet 331, met all my needs: excellent support (great footbed),  materials and fit (12 2EE). The vendor is first class.  Shipment was received ahead of schedule.  The indoor/outdoor sole is a bonus. Very reasonable price.<br /><br />&#34;Good on ya&#34;  Amazon and Comfort Feet."
5.0,Se siente. De muy buena calidad la tela
5.0,This is a special message to always remember and hold dear to your heart. It came with both a necklace and keychain as well as 2 dog tags.  The dog tags are good quality.
5.0,"Super cute top, worked out great for a hot rod shoot. Flattering enough I wore it out again üñ§"
5.0,"Fits well,and is  comfortable for body armor. Provides a rider some reassurance for the anticipated cycle mishap(s)."
5.0,Daughter wears them a lot.  They have not broke after two weeks of her playing with them.
5.0,"Excellent fit, good quality, very comfortable. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"This swimsuit is a great deal for the price. It looks expensive, similar to styles I have seen at department stores but for a third of the cost.<br />I really like the feel of it, it seems very well made.<br />It runs a little small but I always size up in swim and that worked for me. The only issue I have, which I have with many one piece suits is it could be a little longer in the torso. But I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù for reference. If 5‚Äô9‚Äù or below, I‚Äôm sure this would fit perfectly. Fit is good on me, just scoops a little further down in the front than I would like.<br />The style is amazing. I was a little worried about the cutout pieces and how that would look on my not so perfect body, but they don‚Äôt really show anything and add a ton of style.<br />I also really love the cross cross straps at the top.<br />Overall, this is a great swim suit for the price."
5.0,As expected.  And delivered promptly!
5.0,Love it. Bought it to make my son jealous
5.0,Nose Ring. It was exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Gave me a refund
5.0,"Very good product, beautifull"
5.0,"Was exactly as expected, Hope my oven handle doesn't break anymore"
5.0,"These are my favorite sunglasses I own, I have super expensive shades that I always worry about breaking or throwing in my purse, but these sunglasses are amazing. The price point is so reasonable and they last me year round, I have them in every color. They fit well under the brim of a baseball hat too which is a plus while walking my dog or at the pool. I highly recommend!"
5.0,"It was perfect for my eight year old, she loved it."
5.0,It‚Äôs so beautiful

5.0,I wore this for a masquerade party and everybody loved it. I had ppl asking where I got it. It‚Äôs light weight and easy to put on. If you wanna stand out definitely buy it
5.0,"I really like these! They aren‚Äôt thick, which is what I wanted.  The material is very smooth and does not attract lint and dog hair like all my other leggings - this is so awesome if you are used to doing yoga in the living room while sweeping the floor with your yoga pants.  They are not too skimpy and very comfortable.  The pockets are genius."
5.0,"This is probably one of the best rings EVER!! I bought it because Tungsten is suppose to be one of the best for a ring!! My husband is in the military so he needed something durable, we got married 3 years ago and the ring is still going strong!! Doesn't have a scratch on it and he wears it every day, it's even been to war!! I even watched him grind his ring on cement multiple times to show his buddies that it doesn't scratch! He has no idea where I got this ring lol it is greatly equal to a store bought ring that's worth 300$! The ring is still even shiny! Just like it was the day I got it!! If your looking for a great ring for your man, this is the one to get!! :)"
5.0,This sweater is perfect!!! It‚Äôs nice and smooth‚Ä¶ not hard like others. I bought large so that I could wear with leggings and I‚Äôm in love

5.0,"Love to wear these with my hair down, makes it easier to get ready for work, the various colors match with any outfit I put together too."
5.0,Looks awesome! My nephew is going to love it!
5.0,"I'm 5'3&quot; and 129 lbs and it was a little big, but a comfortable kind of big (I ordered a small).  I love it!"
5.0,Love the way this brand fits high quality
5.0,These sunglasses make anyone who wears them look like a celebrity.
5.0,This tie is very nice.
5.0,I absolutely love these shoes!
5.0,"This watch band has gotten many compliments, and everyone is shocked when I say that it is not authentic and only cost $15. The magnetic clasp works great, and changing the band in/out is easy. I change my band almost daily, sometimes twice a day, as I wear my watch for different purposes, and it really is simple.<br /><br />The magnetic closure is also nice because I can get it to actually fit better on my wrist (I think I'm &#34;between holes&#34; on the stock band, really).<br /><br />The metal on the part that clips to the watch is definitely more the &#34;stainless&#34; metal - if you have a stainless watch it'll fit right in. It doesn't match my aluminum watch exactly, but it doesn't bother me one bit.<br /><br />Solid product, great price! They offer a nominal discount if you buy both this and one of their bamboo stands also...even better deal there."
5.0,Love this it is easy to use.
5.0,"I love the Dr. Cool headbands for workout class - they keep the sweat out of my eyes, don't pop off my head, and, yes, I know it's gross, but the cool, damp sweat keeps you cool on your forehead. I wish they would make these again."
5.0,The image is on both sides and is solid.
5.0,"My daughter likes this unicorn bag very much, and it is very shiny. It contains her favorite earrings, necklaces, rings, hair clips, rubber bands, (all of which are decorated with unicorns) big love."
5.0,Feels like I'm wearing slippers.
5.0,"This dress is sooo comfortable! I'm 5'1, 115; I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. It was delivered way faster than the expected delivery date (i got it in about 8 days!)"
5.0,"Made of good quality, tried it on, but have not worn yet but can't wait."
5.0,"I actually wasn‚Äôt expecting much but figured for the price I wouldn‚Äôt be too distraught if it wasn‚Äôt up to par.  I was wrong.  The quality was way better than what was expected and aside from just trimming a few extra threads, overall great.  The color accurate and fit exactly matching size chart.  Most bodies come in different shapes and sizes even if you may be the same height or weight, everyone carries the weight differently.  The big detail here is that it‚Äôs straight from China and for the most part that means smaller sizing than Americans.  I still however, found the sizing more generous than expected and had no problems fitting the dress.  I‚Äôm glad I bought it and at a great price!"
5.0,I'm already using these pins and very pleased with how they look.  Will be giving them with the shawls i'm making for gifts.
5.0,Lovely product for the price.
5.0,Perfect gift for my daughter. The quality is very well made  We are very please with the product and would fully recommend it and order again
5.0,"I love this brand!! Best active leggings I have found anywhere to date. I have bought three pairs of leggings from 90 Degree, one full length pair in black, one 22&#34; pair in the heather/guava color, and another 22&#34; pair in the watermelon color. In the past, I've had trouble with brands like VS Pink Ultimate wearing on the inside of my thighs and the fabric ripping. I have never had this issue with this brand! Definitely rivals brands like Athleta and LuluLemon. They fit wonderfully, and the length is perfect. Excellent quality, excellent price! &#60;3"
5.0,Fit my baby niece perfect
5.0,Great for relaxing hair
5.0,"Nothing to dislike at all. In fact, I had so many compliments and people wanting to know where I bought them that most coworkers are wearing them. so many patterns to choose from."
5.0,"Love it. Its not small @ All. Its 2xs bigger then a small sized chinese take-out Box. Its red/white pic looks leather but Not,.so be careful when ordering id looked closly because theres 2 different types of these purse 1 has 1strap 2nd has 2straps so the 2straps cost more. I prefer the 2strap style. That comes with the thank you handle and the other handle comes with chain and shoulder has red material on it. Deep pocket inside. I did order the pink one at 1st but got cancelled for some reason Not sure so reorder in the Red think would like better"
5.0,"I love them....very vibrant and quality made. The only thing I do wish is that the birds were not facing the same direction, other than that, I love them!"
5.0,YESSS I LOVE THEM VERY CUTE THANKS üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
5.0,Very nice drape. I've never bought clothes from amazon and am pleased with this. Only one word of warning about the neckline: it is a wide boat neck and makes bra straps visible. I like the look and wear it with a strapless bra
5.0,"Happy with purchase , very nice and good quality"
5.0,Great buy!!!! So comfortable! Perfect fit... a lil big but I like it a little loose!! 100% will recommend to all my friends and family!!

5.0,I am 5'6.5&#34; size 34 D I got a medium. Fit was good.. not completely sure if I will keep because I want a long dress but great experience for my first perchase of clothing on amazon.
5.0,"Love the hat, very light material."
5.0,"LOVE THE FABRIC, PRFECT FIT."
5.0,Esta hermoso üíô
5.0,Far superior to punching holes in a leather belt.  It seem to be durable.  Time will tell. Totally satisfied at this point.
5.0,Very well built sturdy glasses. They are definitely polarized and take the glare off the water. Fit Nicely. They come with a case and cloth for cleaning.
5.0,It fits very well!! Arrived in great condition. I definitely will have to hide it my brothers.
5.0,Excelente tela queda muy bien
5.0,Everything is great. Fits as expected
5.0,My husband has a very very bad case of Plantar Fasciitis and can never be without support.  He is very happy with these slippers...so much so I bought him another pair for traveling.  They are well made and give him proper support for this foot.
5.0,"I bought this shirt to wear at Disneyland. I wasn‚Äôt sure about the sizing since a bunch of other reviewers said that it fit small. So I ordered my regular size of medium & also a large. The medium was perfect in a comfy way, not snug at all. The large will be returned. My advice is to buy your regular size. The material is very soft & the graphic is cute!"
5.0,Better than what I expected.  Nice size!
5.0,Ordered size small<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 ~ 120 and it fits really nice<br />I like that it‚Äôs relaxed fit<br />Nice color & fabric
5.0,Beautiful color-better than  the  picture
5.0,"I brought these glasses to see if they would help my 22 year old grandson who is color blind.  I received these today and took them straight to my grandson.  They worked, at least 99%, he stills sees blues as black.  He cried when he could see the colors in his wifes blouse because she is pregnant with their first child, a girl.  He was so happy, and especially when he went outside and could see all the greens of summer, where before all he saw was a lot of brown. I didn't realize they come in contacts also, so I will probably see about getting those also. I am so grateful you carried this product and that it worked for my grandson.  They are amazing!  and I will let the company that makes them know also."
5.0,"Winter in London and Scotland never touched my toes. Thick and comfy. Colors were lovely. There has been some slight pilling, but not a lot. Great value for the cost!!"
5.0,"I like that it is beginner friendly (this is my first time stretching) , not only does it come with all the sizes necessary but it comes with everything you need and even a little note with a guide on it for beginners. It is perfect! I think the only thing that could be more helpful/improved on is being sent with some sort of lubricant or oil, but other than that it has everything you need! All the jewelry in any size! Also i love how colorful it is ! lol #pride"
5.0,"Super cute, very comfy to walk in. The clasp is kinda funny to hook but does stay in place. The 1st pair I've bought in years that don't cramp and bind my pinky toes."

5.0,just as it was described the picture didnt do it justice it is amazing my husband was very happy with it

5.0,"The peached ones are my favorite but it isn't clear which ones are peached fabric in some cases. The black camo are peached and I've bought a navy peached pair too. 5'7"" 150lb and large fits me just right."
5.0,"I like that the size fits perfectly.  It is nice, warm & long.  I wear it in the evening & also to bed."
5.0,My daughter loves these. Warm and no issues trying to get the seam in the feet just right.
5.0,I scored these for free!  I haven't water tested these since it's mid-winter. But they seem to have a great suction around the eye. Looking forward to getting out in the pool with these bad boys.
5.0,This dress is so cute. It‚Äôs a steal for the price. I wear a medium and it fits great and not too snug. Loved it so much I bought 2 more.

5.0,"I bought the USsizeXXS=TagsizeM size, was quite sure how it would fit as I usually get US XS sizes.  However, the shirt fits perfectly, and my family and friends all had good compliments when I wore it.  The material also makes it feels like a pretty good quality shirt."
5.0,"People these are ear muffs, not a Hugo Boss suit. They are adjustable and the ear pads are soft. They keep my ears warm. I am a mail man and outside in Northern Missouri weather. They stay on and fit nicely over my ears. Unless you have huge ears or a huge head, these will work great. I don't understand a lot of these complaint reviews as they are $8 ear muffs."
5.0,"I got a large and could've gotten a medium but I like having the extra breathing room. I'm a 38C so this is great for women who have a bigger upper body. I have big arms and it isn't tight at all. I love the lantern sleeve! It cinches at the right place on my waistline tho and then flares out which is very complimentary of my body!<br />I agree with one of the comments tho it does look a bit Amish if you just wear it as it is, but def wear heels and dress it up! I wish it came in black or navy blue tho. The rust color is between orange and red.<br />Also I'm 5 2 so it's like ankle length for me I'm too short for the tea length but I still think it's cute. The material isn't so cottony, it's stretchy a bit like spandex but thicker so it's not see through.<br />Overall I'm pretty impressive for the price and the stretchy material! A curvy girl's best friend!<br />Def conservative too so you can probs wear it as a teacher"
5.0,Very cute shoes and great quality
5.0,"So cute. They arrived intact with no pieces missing. I didnt find them too big or heavy for me and I dont wear big dangly earrings often. I look forward to wearing them around. But beware, someone noted that the hooks are made of nickel. If you have allergies or sensitive ears, proceed with caution."
5.0,"Love this Bib necklace, it is well made, a beautiful Red,sits well ."
5.0,"Super cute but very sheer!  Love the style and the fabric!  Well made, quality materials."
5.0,Great shirt at a great price. Don't let the tag size fool you. This item must be mainly sold in China.
5.0,"Oh, so soft and comfy!  And she loves them!  The fit is perfect; she regularly wears size 7/8 and the medium fit her perfectly!<br /><br />Big fan of wash, dry, and go!  Comfy to wear, easy to wash, and looks great too!<br /><br />I also like that the bottoms of the pants are a regular hem. It allows the pants to work for school, too.  (Instead of the dreaded elastic hem). Drawstring is a little different, it's actually sewn in. No worries, the pants fit perfectly and I don't have a long string to tie up in my wash,<br /><br />Summary:<br />(1) Imported<br />(2) Machine Washable<br />(3) Fleece jogger featuring rainbow waistband and cuffs<br />(4) Side seam pockets<br />(5) Faux Drawstring waist<br /><br />Sizes:<br />XS(4)<br />S (5-6)<br />M(7-8)<br />L(8-10)<br />XL(10-12)"
5.0,"Love these, so warm, can pop outside if I need. Size perfect fit"
5.0,Muy lindo y la talla perfecta
5.0,Finally I found something that fits just right! No need to sit or stand on one knee trying to tide the shoelaces. Life and timesavers! I'm wearing my sneakers pretty much every day and it's so easy and comfortable with laceez!<br />Definitely will buy more!
5.0,"Nice and warm, great with the beanies !!!  Girls love them !!!!"
5.0,Easy to replace and much cheaper than buying a new pair!
5.0,"Super adorable ankle socks!  Material is soft, very comfortable to wear, I wore it to the gym today, I think it's great for daily wearing and exercising.  Not a super thick or super thin fabric, they are just right.  The owls and bears came adorable as expected but what I didn't know was they have fluffy ears, took a close up pic of them, super cute!"
5.0,"I'm always leary of tops this cheap, but IT'S GREAT!<br />I ordered 2 of these, thinking I'd just use the top for keeping cool when working out in the garden.<br />It came with bathing suit bottoms (boy short style) so I have that too. The top is a little flowy for my tastes for a swim suit...but perfect for wearing as a top on hot days.<br />I ordered the 10 -12, as I am a solid Size 10.  It fits perfectly!! I'm not big breasted, but have a 36 width. The elasticity is great, and the tie between the beasts is a nice feature. Sturdy straps with easy slide adjustment. I'm 5'6"", 130lbs<br />I'd wash this on delicate or hand wash setting, and hang to dry.. I have no idea about the dryer, but a low heat would probably be fine.<br />Can't wait to get my second one this week!"
5.0,Perfect fit and made for a great addition to my Halloween costume!!
5.0,Neat economical handbag.  I wanted to add some patches to a jean handbag and decided to give this one a try.  I like the purse because it is big enough to do what I wanted to do.  I really like the price and that it was on Amazon Prime.
5.0,"The gloves look great, without any loose stitching or other defects.<br />They are soft, flexible and nicely link with my ski jacket.<br />It is 18 F outside yet they keep my hands warm and cozy."

5.0,Glasses look great and fit properly without any adjustments.
5.0,Love all my yellow box flip flops. So spongy and can wear all day with no pain!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress. I'm having a very relaced, really small 10 person wedding and I am using this dress as my one bridesmaid dress since its gonna be hot. I was worried about fit since she is in between sizes so I went to the bigger side, and it is unnoticeable that it is barely too big. Honestly the dress is beautiful, the grey is soft and lace/crochet is so detailed. Just beautiful. We are going to add a waist sash to accentuate her waist. She did say it was the most comfortable dress she has put one."
5.0,Item as described.  No complaints.
5.0,Fits GreT
5.0,Nice key chain. Looks just like the picture.
5.0,I had got this for my niece birthday she wears a 7/8 so I got that size some people had wrote to go a size larger but I got her actual size. The dress is made of a very soft stretchy material so it fits great on her and the length is a good length also on her. The material of the dress seems to be made well and will last. She loves cats so I was so excited to find this dress she loved it!<br /><br />The cats on the dress look good to looks just like the picture shows. The colors are so pretty to very colorful nd bright great for a summer time dress! The material is not thick ether so makes it were its not so hot wearing in the summer.<br /><br />I received this product free or at a discounted price for my honest opinion.
5.0,"was a gift for a two year old and she loved the pj's wanted to were it all day. ate ,napped, and played in them"
5.0,It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it
5.0,Good quality .. no duplicates.
5.0,Loved. Silky material thought so little clingy
5.0,Super cute excellent quality and fast shipping
5.0,Very tiny but just the same as the image.
5.0,"I was nervous after reading some of the reviews, but I really love the dress! It‚Äôs not see through and very comfortable. I wear a medium in everything, and a medium in the dress fit perfect."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS!!<br />I'm on the small side with tiny breasts and can't be bothered with bras so this was perfect for me. Husband approved.<br />There is ever so slight space in the bra cavity (cause I'm lacking) but it's unnoticeable and it doesn't look off at all. I got the mint color in a small, I'm 5'4"" between 115 lbs with a wider ribcage, 34 A/B and the padding form is perfect for having something flattering up top while not being skin tight on the tummy.<br />LOVE it. Will he purchasing the black and white as well when they're available in a small!"
5.0,"I've been needing to get more septum rings as I only have 2 at the time. I generally don't like horseshoes as they are very plain jane looking however I can never resist black products as black is very modern, hip, sleek and one of my go to favorites as it matches everything!! Some of my nose rings, I can't wear with certain things because it just clashes and I'm not into clashing items. To recieve not only one, but three of the septums pleased me as I need more jewelry.<br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Well made and my daughter loves it.
5.0,"This is a great product.  I have never before seen chains of this quality for such low prices!  And even though the prices are low, the product is not cheap quality.  The chain is very pretty and durable.  I've had mine for a while now and I've not seen any visible wear or tarnish on it.  I exchange the chain between several different pendants and it works and looks great!  Highly recommend this product."
5.0,"A must buy for your AP royal oak offshore. Don‚Äôt pass this up, buy buy buy"
5.0,"I have IBS and my abdomen gets uncomfortable if the waste is too tight. For years I was using a braid leather belt, which would allow me to tighten or untighten my belt slightly instead of another 1 inch hole away. I decided to give this a try after seeing it on Sharktank and love the functionality. The quality isn't the worst, but if they sold a pure leather belt on the high end side, I wouldn't mind paying $100 for this belt. All in all, this does have the made in China feel, but it WORKS!!! and I think that's the most important selling point of this belt.<br /><br />The sizing is perfect. Actually I ordered a larger length and cut it down to size. It took about 30 seconds to cut the belt and reinstall. Super easy."
5.0,Ordered for my 6 year old. He loves it and says it‚Äôs super comfortable. He‚Äôs rather small and the extra small was the perfect size for him.
5.0,This is literally the light weight heavy duty jacket to get! I like the light color when hiking or do other sport. It also dropped down to 32 with 15 mph wind gusts and was raining. Jacket repelled water and kept me warm I was pretty skeptical on the warmth aspect due to being so light and thin but man few times I actually had to take it off haha. Great jacket. Stop reading and just get this already - totally worth it.
5.0,"I was given my ribbon bracelet jan 2014 by my Brazilian friend. Two of my wishes realized in July 2014 and September 2014 and the last one on  Dec 31, 2014. The ribbon fell off the morning of  Dec 31, 2014. I didn't believe it at first. but the ribbon does work, but only if you believe in it. ... I didn't think it would ever fall off either because it was pretty sturdy."
5.0,"Two pairs for the price of one at others sellers,can't beat that.Thank You!"
5.0,"Perfect for phone, keys, id and credit card."
5.0,Regular septum rings at a decent price.

5.0,"Very comfortable, easy to sleep with this watch strap on my wrist. Easy to install on my watch. Love the colors and the fabric. It's stretchy yet adjustable."

5.0,These socks must be made out of kittens because they are so soft! They are perfect when wearing boots and keep your feet warm! There are 6 different colors and two types of designs.

5.0,Love this hat. Many compliments on it.
5.0,I purchased this purse for my great niece for her birthday.  She loves Vampirina.  The shoulder<br />handbag came in earlier then expected.  She loves the handbag.
5.0,"Solar powered, sapphire crystal and  moving bezel. The only drawback is resin band. On my G-shock band is thin and soft, but on this watch thick and solid. Info regarding watch size can be easily found in internet, just added some additional pictures to compare size and dimension with some of my watches."
5.0,Very pretty - lightweight and eye catching.
5.0,"I love it, it fits perfect and feels nice and soft. Would buy it again"
5.0,my daughter loves this so much so we got it for her bday galaxy party. its definitely big on her but she didn't mind and wore it belted. Will get a good few years out of this dress. She is picky and says it doesn't bother her. soft material
5.0,My daughter loves her new leotard!!!
5.0,"The color and fit are very flattering, I really liked it. I haven't washed it yet so hoping it doesn't pill but so far, great cardigan for the price."
5.0,Cute outfit. It seems to be a little bigger than 18 months.
5.0,This is great so far. I had tried similar frames (3)  that cracked within a week and returned then.  Hoping this works well. Great quality. Customer experience and  service was also fantastic. Thanks.
5.0,"This ETSYG 32'' Silk Scarf Women's Fshion Pattern Satin Headscarf Headdress arrived right on time and in perfect condition. This 100% silk scarf is so beautiful! The colors really pop just like the photo shows but even prettier in person. For my style the scarf  is just the perfect thickness, being fairly thin. It is so silky and soft to the touch even my toddler daughter is in love with it! Being a 32x32 size its perfect size for a neck scarf, hair accessory, or any other variety of ways that you can wear an accent scarf. Care instructions are a bit harder but very expected for a 100% silk item warm water below 30 ‚ÑÉ wash alone and don't use machine, hand wash only and then Iron on low heat and it is compatible with any dry leaning method. So since its delicate as expected just try to keep as clean as possible!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review"
5.0,"Went perfectly with my costume, here in the Covid age. Got tons of compliments."
5.0,A must for any Game of Thrones fan!

5.0,"My 11 yo wears these everyday for school. Light, breathable, very nice graphics"
5.0,Well made and boyfriend loves it.
5.0,I wear a 10-12. Ordered a large and they fit perfect.
5.0,Great build quality
5.0,"These are very nice, but I could tell right away it's not 935 sterling silver as advertised. I recommend purchasing a jewelry coating to make sure the metal doesn't rub off or tarnish. I bought the jewelry coating and you'll have to coat it at least 3 times. The coating tends to make it stiff and leave residue in the clasp so give it 2 days to dry and you can work the bracelet a few times to make it loose again. Then you have to remove the coating that's collected in the clasps after it dries. That was a chore."
5.0,"shipping was quick, looks like the pic. Has a nice weight to it, so it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all. Sits on the head very nicely, tucked easy in my hair. The ends of the crown has little loops, and it came with pretty metal hairpins, I guess meant to help secure the crown, so that‚Äôs cool. The complimentary pair of earrings was a little weird lol but they‚Äôre cute"
5.0,"This scarf is Wonderful & beautiful! It's very elegant. I wore it to work today, with a mustard long skirt.<br />I  had many people compliment me on this scarf. I will buy more. Thanks for making me look & feel beautiful!"
5.0,I had these in black and loved them . People even stopped me to ask about the brand. Got the second pair in darkblue and was happily suprised to get them on sale.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e2bfde739de06c9d5c1d0111627dcc9c]] Love these pants looks just like the picture Nd fits true to size
5.0,Very nice warm set
5.0,Love this dress! The swing dress fit is exactly what I wanted. The material is nice and soft and of a good quality. I got the yellow dress. I did wear a camisole underneath. But that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm funny about that kind of thing.  I‚Äôm pretty sure with the darker colors I won‚Äôt feel the need to.<br />The hem line on this dress isn‚Äôt even all the way around. It‚Äôs a little shorter on the sides. I didn‚Äôt realize it until I got it but it doesn‚Äôt make a difference because of how I style it. Over all I love it! I will get more patterns and colors!
5.0,"I love this dress!! Perfect for summertime church, movies, & going out for dinner. I love sunflowers & this is perfect!!"
5.0,Thank you everyone loves this
5.0,"Fits great. Not too tight or loose. Much better feeling fabric than that of so many of other sun hoodies. Purchased for long distance hiking, although weight is fairly irrelevant due to this being worn clothing. Still, it is very light. Time will tell if it wicks well and doesn‚Äôt hold odor, but off too a great start. Only thing that would make it better is a 1/4 zip and maybe some other colors. Great product for the price!"
5.0,These attach to your glasses very easily.  They are very light weight and attach securely.  They are adjustable.  My husband tried on his glasses and they held very securely.  Great purchase and value.
5.0,"Ordered these shorts in grey.  I went by the size chart and they are a perfect fit.  My cell phone fits well in the pocket.  The material is soft and being 100% cotton it did shrink a little, but I wash in cold water and light dry.  The length is great and I really like the white stripes going around one leg.  The waist is stretchy and also has a drawstring."
5.0,I love these sunglasses. The fit is just right for my face! I have such a hard time finding glasses that look decent and these definitely do.
5.0,I got it for work and it‚Äôs a great bag . Really roomy. Order some for my co-workers also .
5.0,"I hardly pamper myself, but as I get older, I find I want to.  This mask makes me feel like I am in the most expensive spa!  I use it 2 x a week (should use it more, but I am lazy, lol) and watch tv.  20 minutes later, I peel it off and toss it.  My face drinks up the essences that are on the mask and really makes my face soft and makes me feel good.  And if I feel good, that is 5 stars right there!  It has this cool tweezer so you can pick out a mask at a time.  I love the company thought of that.  I have yet to have an issue with the top ones being dry.  This will be a definite on my re-purchase list!"
5.0,Bought a pair for my tennis shoes.  I liked them so much I got a pair for my wife and she is now an advocate as well.<br />No more tying shoes.  Even tennis shoes are now slip ons.  Graet!
5.0,These racks keep all the balls tight for a superb break. Love it.
5.0,Love em for the money.
5.0,Fits my 13inch macbook Pro with space to spare. Perfect for work.
5.0,"Great accessories for my kids who really are in love with their favorite Harry Potter. They ask me every day to buy for them all accessories for them. I didnt find something like that in stores. Super happy me and my kids about this purchase. Affordable price. If your kids are in love with Harry Potter like mine are,for sure buy it!"
5.0,Pereft
5.0,Will add some color to it but will be great for my Mardi Gras costume
5.0,Fits my dad well.  He loves the design
5.0,"This is incredibly soft and I love how it doesn't irritate my skin. I was afraid it wouldn't fit, but it was only slightly bigger than expected which is fine because the elastic waistband is doing its job!"
5.0,Our niece had a feeling it was going to be small the glasses. But it fits perfectly.
5.0,Great fit and quality!  My son loves them. He‚Äôs 27 and has a beard and they fit great!
5.0,Awesome beanie.  Not too shallow which I was worried about.  Representing the Trojans!
5.0,Eres bueno
5.0,This is really nice<br />Xtra points for the price<br />Better than my original band<br />This beats the others
5.0,Durable fabric runs a little tight. Order 1 size bigger for shrinkage in the dryer but overall a great product!
5.0,A cute touch to any bathroom. Looks like the kitty is peeking over at you
5.0,"It's the exact same strap that came with my watch, just as advertised, I replaced it with nothing but a knife! : )"
5.0,Every thing was great
5.0,Bought it for my mom and she loved it.  Fun prints. One of the handles did come un-sewn after some use though.
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful. The color is bright and they are so sparkly. They look much more expensive than what I paid for them. The wire that goes through your pierced ear is not too thick. They go in nice and easy with no problem. These earrings are real amethyst and peridot. They hang nicely on the ear. They are small as pictured, but I wanted something small. I highly recommend these earrings. You won't be disappointed! This review was written by Darren's mom."
5.0,"Love these! Cute, stylish, and comfy!"
5.0,I like the ring a lot. I was hoping it would fit on my finger but it didn't fit on any of them so I am glad it came with a necklace.
5.0,Comfortable. Fits well. Not too heavy
5.0,Very nice quality! My son is rough on boots and these hold up very well!
5.0,I got this as a gift for a co-worker. Looks just like picture. Perfect size. No complaints.
5.0,Gift for granddaughter. It cute and looks nice on. Not sterling but has held up well and still looks good.
5.0,elastic on sides of shoe makes the shoe too loose
5.0,"I love this set! It‚Äôs super comfy! I am pregnant and got a size Medium and it worked for me. So cozy, I want to wear it everyday!"
5.0,"Looked great out of the box and just the right fit, after customizing it with my company logo was the envy of the office"
5.0,This spray works exactly as expected.
5.0,Great shirt in a tall size that is actually long enough for me!
5.0,Bought my size and it fits perfect. Super cute. Lightweight. Very pretty colors. Really glad I took a chance and purchased this.
5.0,Yes I like the bag very much
5.0,My husband got a kick out of it.  My husband is 6'4 and I'm 4'11. I purchased a XL when I should have gotten a XXL.
5.0,looks very expensive
5.0,colors are beautiful
5.0,"Fun and long lasting light.  Some of the elastics broke immediately, but still had lots to use."
5.0,"I get compliments on this dress all the time. I'm thin, but have a larger bust (34D). I wanted the dress to by a bit flowy and not hug my body, so I got a medium. I tie the belt tight and the top blouses over a bit, giving it a great shape."
5.0,I like them because ny daughter works in the hospital.
5.0,This is a nice bathing suit especially if you don‚Äôt want show everything off but look nice at the same time. Color is just as photo shows
5.0,It is so adorable! The glitter is circle and star shaped. My daughter loves it and so do I. Good quality and fits as expected.
5.0,Purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it.
5.0,These compression socks help with circulation and are not too tight.
5.0,i'd buy 10 of these
5.0,"So love them, so worth the money!"
5.0,Love this super cute necklace.
5.0,Amazing!! Way better than lularoe (which are a bit snug on my large legs.) These are so soft and comfy! I ordered 2 more pairs!
5.0,Big fan of these. I've struggled a lot with tragus piercings in the past because they are so tiny and it's hard to screw and unscrew them. The plastic back goes in easily and it's not super easy to get the front in because it's so tiny but definitely easier than ones that screw it. Also like that the clear back is more discrete and won't tarnish.
5.0,"I bought these for my husband, as he deals with plantar fasciitis and his feet are always cold. These work wonders! He has been very pleased and they seem to help. I read lots of reviews of other shoes and kept coming back to these. I am so glad I did and he is too. Thank you."
5.0,the top is probably my favorite bikini i have so cute the bottoms give a little more coverage than i like but they fit really good and feel so comfy
5.0,Great! Light weight & warm.
5.0,"This color was  not available in the store  near me. Our grandson has this in burgandy and blue, he lives in them. They are soft, wash well. Was very pleased that I could get him another color for Christmas."
5.0,Love the colors and how the dress fits!!
5.0,So far so good.  My daughter loves the color and style and it fit great.  Seems to be well made.
5.0,Item was a gift and was just as expected.
5.0,"Love, love, love this band. I've been rocking the scrunchie bands but decided to give this one a shot and I'm looking at buying some more! Feels great, fits my tiny wrist, and looks sooooo cute! Woukd definitely buy again!"
5.0,Bought for granddaughter. She Loves it. Fit perfect. Material nice and soft & thick. Would recommend! Butterfly very cute on front and not cheaply put on. Very nice!!
5.0,Such a great skirt and conversation piece. Cannot wait to wear!
5.0,Great for holiday wear
5.0,"I love these socks!  They don't ""run"" and are strong enough to be washed over and over.  The bottoms are super soft. I have them in several shades and wear them to work every."
5.0,It really is gorgeous!!!
5.0,"I wanted a set of simple pearl earrings to wear to a company party, and these fit the bill. They are simple, yet elegant.<br /><br />The earrings each have one small freshwater pearl set in sterling silver. Since I prefer silver toned jewelry, they were just what I was looking for. They are well constructed, easy to wear, and can be dressed up or dressed down.  I received a ton of compliments when I wore them."
5.0,they look good
5.0,"These are really good gloves if you need something that protects your hands from abrasions hot metal from desert sun.  They offer little protection from cold temps but do help against wind.  Once they get wet, your hands are instantly wet.  That's not a big problem in the heat but in the cold, you'll need something else.  However, even when wet, they still work on touch screens.  It maybe possible to use some sort of water resistant spray by applying several coats<br />Pros:  They do fit like a second-skin and they give you great dexterity and ability to manipulate fine adjustments.  You can put your hand in jeans pockets with these on and not realize you have these on.  These gloves have no bulk!  Plus the ability to manipulate touch screens!<br />Cons: Very little protection against low (&lt;45 degrees) and certainly freezing temps.  No ability to be water resistant."
5.0,"These hoops are perfect to wear together or separately. The sterling silver is very pretty, I only wish they came in larger sizes!"
5.0,Perfect and genuine glasses.
5.0,My favorite kids sunglasses! I have two toddlers and have been buying from this brand since their newborn age. Now im at the size 4+ for my oldest and 2+ for youngest. They just never brake. The only reason i change them for is when the lenses get old or when they becoming small in size. The super flexible material they made of is just the best thing. Non of the other brands we tried before or just tried on in the store have that flexibility. And of course the best thing about it they have Polarized lenses. To me its a win win for everything i need in sunglasses for my kids :)<br />Thank you!
5.0,"This is the perfect size! Bought for travel but ended up using it every day.  Adjustable strap, zippered outside pockets for keys and phone and inside is spacious enough to carry all essentials.  Grey is a great neutral cooler that looks great with any outfit."
5.0,amazing dupe! says cartier INSIDE!
5.0,My boyfriend loves it and it's just as pictured!
5.0,Very nice looks great on me very sturdy best quality
5.0,It's so cute and durable! Fits my metro TAP card perfectly and I love that it's locally handmade.
5.0,"Very pretty, sturdy and well made."
5.0,"The shipping took forever,but they came ! High quality material for sure plus super lightweight. I wear them in my ear, and don't even feel them. Great product other than the shipping."
5.0,Great product. Arrived quickly.
5.0,Bought for my tween and she loves this!
5.0,"Nice top for working out when do not want to just wear sports bra.<br />The amazon ad has it grouped with other tops which include the sports bra, this one  does NOT include bra, so was a little disappointed but for the price it is still a value.<br />Runs smaller than expected and is a little tight when the back is tied together but fabric has a lot of give.  If you want more room when tied, get a larger size."
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality necklace at a great price. Love it!"
5.0,"Great color and fit, would definitely purchase again."
5.0,Is a daily cap<br />Happy about my choice
5.0,Very good !!!!
5.0,always getting compliments on it when I whip it out!:)
5.0,Nice suit.  I think an Asian feel but stepping outside the box.
5.0,My son loves this necklace.  It was a good choice.  The chain is heavy enough for him.
5.0,"Just got my order and it is actually better than I expected! I haven't tried it on my niece yet, but I will post a picture of her in it when I do.<br /> Some facts:<br /> Bottom was a little wrinkled but I fluffed it out and will fluff it out some more until it is extra poofy like I want.<br />The Ivory is a little lighter than I expected, as my Ivory wedding dress is darker than this (using as flower girl dress), but it will still go beautiful with my colors.<br />The top portion of the dress is actually a better quality material than expected. (Well all of it is good quality).<br />The sash is pretty and comes unattached. But you just have to tie it around the waist when you put the dress on.<br />Lastly, I am really pleased that there is a satin slip underneath the bottom tulle. I had initially spotted this dress on Etsy and the sellers required you to buy the slip separately for $20, so this was definitely a plus.<br /><br />After looking at tons of online tulle dresses I'm glad I found this one on Amazon, because I was able to get it quickly in case I needed to return it (prime 2-day- it actually arrived at noon!)<br /><br />I'd say this was a good purchase and the company delivered what I wanted. (And I'm picky!!))"
5.0,These are he only metals that mu grand daughter can wear.
5.0,I have been wearing this necklace every day for about 3 months and it is still as shiny as the first day I purchased. Great quality for such a low price.
5.0,Hubby and I both love them.  Thanks.  Fuzzy and warm!
5.0,"Excellent, sturdy boots."
5.0,I'm in love with my new PJs. is very comfortable to sleep and for long TV nights too.
5.0,"LOVE them!!!! They keep out the light and are easy to see out of, even in blazing sunlight"
5.0,I get so many compliments on these earrings! They are so light that I forget I'm wearing them. Definitely recommend these.
5.0,"these are perfect! the lenses are as big as i was hoping theyd be and as far as i can tell theyre pretty sturdy too. i also have a slim nose and a slim face so i was worried they wouldnt fit right, but they actually fit nicely with a little bit of easy adjusting. thank you!"
5.0,"Man you don't realize how much these matter until you don't have one anymore lol. I was using Scotch tape as a stopgap measure but these were a perfect replacement. I have a Timex Ironman from maybe 5 years ago or so and it fits perfectly. Well it was a bit of a tight squeeze at first but you kind of want that, because now after a little time it's the perfect level of tightness. And the additional tools were necessary, so it was good that they were included."
5.0,adds color to my watch collection
5.0,Spacious and durable bag.  Holds a lot and nice looking
5.0,Great product! I'm Navuly and wear it with my type 3s and it's perfect
5.0,Love it! Love the fit and the color. I would recommend this jacket
5.0,Great swim cover. Nice quality of the material.
5.0,Used the cleaner on my diamond ring and earrings for the first use. The jewelry came out sparkling and the white gold band was shiny. I like using natural products. The cleaner does not have any odor and has to be less abrasive on fine jewelry. HAD
5.0,"Great quality.  I've been a swim instructor for over 40 years. I understand good and not so good swim goggles! This is a company you can trust to order goggles online. Outstanding company service. They have many great options for swim goggles no matter the age, fit, or purpose. I highly recommend them. Their reach out customer service is beyond all expectations. And if you are tipping your toes in the water for the first time, or if you have a little one doing the same, sometimes having goggles that fit and function are a comfort."
5.0,"These were a little bit bigger than I had expected, but my son has grown quickly so it didn't take long before he was sporting them! They are adorable and he gets so many compliments on his schnazzy pants!"
5.0,I used these to ask my girlfriends to be my bridesmaids. They loved them! And they said yes!!
5.0,"I disagree with some of the other reviews that these pants are not meant for large kids. My son is 115lbs in grade 2, and these pants fit him great. It's true that the tag does not say Husky, but they fit well (and even a little lose) when we tried them on. We've had a pair for about two months, and we like them so much that we bought a second pair of the black (and another of the grey). Some husky pants are particularly puffy in the hips when my son wears them, but these are not. Perhaps husky boys have different weigh distribution, and these might be less good for kids with lots of weigh in the hips: I'm just trying to understand why others don't think they fit husky. By the wat, we like the black better than the grey since the grey got stained knees pretty quickly when playing in the dirt."
5.0,"I bought one of these to try, before ordering 30 for the members of my Burning Man camp as a super special gift.  It is literally dangerous to be out there at night, without lights.  I am tired of everyone buying, gifting, and using cheap plastic blinky things that work for a night or two, and then become trash.  I was on a hunt for items that will be sturdy and last a long time in a harsh environment, with replaceable batteries, and that throw good light.  I am so, so, so happy that I found these!  They are super sturdy, and I'm certain they will last several years out there, and the customization was the icing on the cake!  (Especially for the price).  They are easy to use, lightweight and comfortable, solid and stay on, and they are super bright.  Two things that I found in gifting them to 30 people... 1) several people had trouble figuring out how to get them off.  Pay attention when you put them on.  Than being said, I just stuck a finger under the large power-source, and pulled it towards me while pushing my wrist away.  I guess it felt to others that they might break the bracelet.  You won't!  They're super solid!  And I love that once you know how to put them on and off, you can totally do it by yourself; no need for help from others.  2) There were two super big guys in my camp.  The bracelets didn't quite fit around their wrists.  They fit everyone else like a dream.  And because they're solid and clip-able, the two that they didn't fit just hooked them onto their outfits or their backpacks and still used them to light up at night; no biggie.  Neither of these things were problems for me, I just wanted to give a heads up to others.<br /><br />I, and everyone that I gave them to are so, so happy with them!  If you are interested, you should get them.  If you are on the fence, don't question - get them!  I'm definitely going to be ordering more!  Several people that I gave them to and others that saw them asked for the information to order some of their own.  They're fantastic!!!  Thank you, Glowmaker!!!!!"
5.0,"Super cute shoes! Great quality and they look adorable on him. The Velcro fastens well and he can't take them off.<br /><br />I got these squeaky shoes because my son is.. A toe walker! Ahh! As an Occupational Therapist, I'm trying to nip this in the bottom early. So far, he loves to hear the shoes squeak and is walking normally on his heels! Yay! May need to order the next size soon as he grows. Thanks!!"
5.0,"The stiletto helps me guide fabric to the needle while keeping my fingers at a safe distance.  Believe me, you don‚Äôt want to get complacent about that! I like the ‚Äúpressing tool‚Äù as well, my fingers can get sore after a run of ‚Äúfinger pressing.‚Äù Also, it‚Äôs just the right length for me.  I‚Äôd say I have medium size hands, those with small hands may disagree.  Obviously, with it‚Äôs fine point, not recommended for use by children.  I also have The Purple Thing, I use both tools in different situations.  I was initially worried about redundancy when I ordered Annie‚Äôs Stiletto, but I like having both of these tools."
5.0,"I have a large melon. It is hard to find any sunglasses, especially for riding. I saw these and thought ""Great, oversized motorcycle sunglasses, just what I was looking for"". When I opened the package I nearly laughed out loud (not LOL, I'm not a teenager). These glasses are BIG. Like, bigger than you think they would be or could be. Almost comical - BUT - they are comfortable and have held up well so far. Less chance of getting a bug in the eye as these could pass for goggles in a pinch, like if you were forced to jump out of a plane. You know, the crazy things that happen on a Tuesday. But I would buy these again if I ever lose them. But it would be hard to lose them. EXACTLY AS IT IS DESCRIBED. Small/skinny heads need not apply."
5.0,This blouse is a perfect addition to my work wardrobe.  It can be made to fit perfectly because of the belt and the stretchy fabric. The fabric is a little thicker than other Patty Boutik wrap blouses so it actually looks better.  I'm definitely ordering the other colors.
5.0,"I got these in gold for a Chong (as in Cheech and Chong) costume, and they were perfect! Fit nicely, super light weight, and looked the part!"
5.0,Excelente calidad! Es mejor que en la foto. Mi hijo le encanto
5.0,Excellent fit not to big. I recommend getting a size up if you don‚Äôt want it form fitting.

5.0,A+ and the shopping was extremely fast.
5.0,"I am so glad I got this, it is so pretty! Perfect for my baking and all. Easy to clean and so soft."
5.0,"Very good shoes. Comfortable, stylish, durable, super lite. I don't think there is any negative aspect for this shoes. I would recommend this for all the people.<br /><br />Since the size runs bit low sometimes, I would suggest you guys to buy these shoes from a seller who accepts free returns that's ways you will not save some money."
5.0,"Love this bracelet, this is my honest review, and it is made sturdy and fits perfect. The beads are not large at all and it looks beautiful on. I'm very happy with my purchase! You can't choose wrong with this one!"
5.0,They are true to size and very comfortable
5.0,Excellent product recommended to 100%
5.0,"While this is an amazingly inexpensive, durable and reliable watch, it has been used by some as a timer for IEDs. There are people being held in Guantanamo based on possession of one of these watches.<br /><br />[...]."
5.0,Most comfortable sandals ever.
5.0,"Stocking stuffer for my husband, I wrote and I love you note on it and he loved it :) he was very impressed"

5.0,"Good relation price quality, looks amazing"
5.0,"Love these earrings, can't beat the price!"
5.0,"Such a cute, easy dress. The slit gives it some sex appeal but it‚Äôs not over the top."
5.0,I bought these for my daughter's twirling uniform. They held up all season without runs.
5.0,Very classy! Heads turn at this dress! Too many compliments just from wearing this dress :).
5.0,My wife loved this shirt.  It fit as expected and came quickly. Priced well and material was not cheap.
5.0,"Love these earrings. They are light, comfortable to wear, and a beautiful turquoise color.  They came in a nice box, very giftable. This company makes a lot of really fun jewelry, takes me back to the 70s."
5.0,"Yesterday I had left a one star rating since I did not receive the converters even though delivery was confirmed. However, today they appeared in my mailbox...a week after confirmed delivery. My guess the package went to neighbor? So I am returning here to rate/review the product....good product! It does as it states in description."
5.0,These tights fit my daughter perfect. She wore them outside to play and they held up. She is a tomboy so it's nice to find tights that are pretty and girly but hold up through play time. I'm very pleased with the quality of these tights. They are very soft and she said they were very comfortable. I will definitely be buying these tights again in the near future.<br /><br />I received this item free for my honest unbiased review.
5.0,Realmente son 100% UV y no se cae f√°cilmente al Ni√±o
5.0,So so so soft and coZy. Will keep you warm. Worth the hype! The grey is a pretty light grey
5.0,I was actually looking for a larger purse but this was so cute that I was willing to pare down if necessary. Better construction and details than expected. I get compliments daily.
5.0,Great fit for my baby girl. Adorable bows. üòä
5.0,Got a small and fit as expected .
5.0,This was an anniversary gift to my boyfriend. I wanted to get him a dressy yet casual watch for him to wear at work without me breaking the bank.  He is getting compliments on it constantly. Gold and silver allows him to wear it with anything.<br />Had to remove to links to size down. No kit in box for that so it was a pain but not unmanageable.
5.0,"These pjs are amazing. Finally a flannel pant that is long enough!  I‚Äôm a size 10, 5‚Äô9‚Äù, ordered a medium tall and they are so cozy and perfect. Length is great and no shrinkage problem with regular washing and drying."
5.0,Beautiful! I got so many compliments when wearing this dress!! Very comfortable !
5.0,"I ordered the 2.0 and 3.5 strength glasses.  I use the 2.0 for reading, especially when print is small.  I use the 3.5 for threading a beading needle, which is IMPOSSIBLE to do without these glasses.  Almost as important as the glasses themselves is the case.  It easily fits in a purse and because it is so study, it protects the glasses better than just a cloth case.  No cons to this product.  The fit is comfortable and they are study, well made."
5.0,"I am 140 pounds I bought the medium in grey, I love everything about this dress<br />Its soft  flowy  looks so expensive will buy more in different colours. Ladies buy it it's so comfortable ."
5.0,"It's an online size large, not an in-store large. If anything, they run big but comfortable. Recommended."
5.0,"I really like this casual dress. The material is a heavy tee shirt fabric. I am 5'6&#34;, 160lbs. I ordered XXL because these dresses usually run small. It is a little big, but with the waist tie, it is fine. I comes v rarely below the knee.  I haven't washed it yet, but I think I will leave it wet and hang to dry so it will retain the length. It's perfect for summer.<br />I just ordered another one in black in XL."
5.0,Love these tops! I use them to sleep in and they help me not get so hot and sweaty when I sleep.
5.0,Very comfortable and worked great in the sun. I usually get a sunburn but this shirt was great protection. Wore it for 11 hours in a water park and wet or dry it was very comfortable.
5.0,"For the money, you can‚Äôt get a better timekeeping watch than a SEIKO!"
5.0,I have used these headbands twice and they have done an awesome job at keeping my sweat from running down my face.<br /><br />I really put the headband to the test when I did a 20 minute HIIT workout. I have what I think is a larger sized head and the headband did not budge until I went to remove it before getting into the shower.
5.0,Love the the feel and fit of this
5.0,Warm product
5.0,I got lots of compliments on this very beautiful shirt. It‚Äôs very comfortable and easy to care for.
5.0,"Great quality aprons.  The fabric is sturdy, but not rough.  This is exactly the apron we were looking for."
5.0,Great swim suit! Great value for money and seems to be good quality. Been using it for few weeks.
5.0,"These tights were great for Halloween. Size 2/4 kept her 3 year old legs warm all night, no complaining. So glad to find the color.  I  think they will fit her through the winter and spring for cold outings as well."
5.0,Very pretty. Looks expensive.
5.0,Very nice and we'll done keychain.
5.0,"This is a great little dress.  It fit perfectly, seemed well made and you can‚Äôt beat the price."
5.0,Very warm and have a good feel to them. Non slip.
5.0,I love these earrings. Great quality!!!!
5.0,"ADORABLE and so VERY comfortable!!! I have been wearing these all day, every day since I got them and don't even realize I'm wearing sandals. I wear a size 8 shoe, ordered a size 7.5 and they fit perfectly. The straps do feel a little on the loose side, but not loose like they are going to fall off at all. That looseness I believe is a good thing because by the end of the day, my feet swelling some, they don't feel tight and restrictive. Love these and already ordered more in different colors!!!"
5.0,This was another item needed for the school play. The student loved it and it fit the character perfectly. WOW!
5.0,"Totally awesome for the price. I may need to replace some of the straps eventually as I expect wearout from the thin leather, but the quilting looks like it will last. The process for asking for a different color is awkward but SOUVENIRINDIA is prompt, and is totally willing to work with requests."
5.0,The material is comfortable and soft. Fits perfect.
5.0,They look good. Good readers.
5.0,This sweater fits perfectly and is very flattering. I like the texture a lot. It is not itchy or scratchy which is the best thing ever! I have dressed it up with black slacks and heels and I've dress it down with blue jeans and some sneakers. Both looked very good. It has held up well so far!
5.0,Always satisfied with my orders.  Keep up the great work üëäüèøüòú
5.0,This set is very nice. It‚Äôs a little thin but great softness. Very comfortable of good material. Non shrinking and the zipper works great!
5.0,"This dress is so cute, soft, and comfortable that I‚Äôve already ordered 2 more and will buy one more every single paycheck. I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôm in love with them."
5.0,"Here earrings are bomb! They look so expensive and stylish. I cannot believe how good they look for such a low price. Not too small and not too big, just right, these are a must!"
5.0,Gorgeous and very sparkly!
5.0,This bracelet turned out to be very beautiful.  For the price I was very satisfied.
5.0,Order  one size up
5.0,Loved it thanks so much! Perfect fit and not to big or to small definitely would buy more
5.0,"Thank you so much for my Wonderful Mickey Mouse üê≠ bags. I‚Äôm a Huge Disney fan girl here (Beauty & the Beast 1st, then little Baby GroGu & anything ‚ÄúCoCo.‚Äù) and I Love pretty much any & everything that has to do with Desiland ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Oops ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è did I say Desiland again? Desiree‚Äô is my birth name & my Family nickname is Desi so see what I‚Äôve been saying for years, ‚ÄúDesiland‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ Hey, Ya never know üòâüòâüòâ I normally use reusable bags when I go to the market or just plain ole shopping üõç and a while back I said, What am I doing here Buying these silly plastic bags for $.10 cents each, so I started buying reusable bags. So I started purchasing the different Disney bags from the Disney stores. My daughter started my off with a reusable ‚ÄúUp‚Äù bag and I‚Äôve been buying Disney reusable bags ever since. I keep getting comments on all of my different Disney bags and no sooner I brought these into use yesterday (08/03/2021) I was complimented on how Cute my bags were & told them to go to Amazon. If your a reusable bag user like myself on a constant basis, buy extras. I change mine out every now and again so they won‚Äôt start to rip. They‚Äôre not meant for real heavy objects, but they hold up well."
5.0,Bought a large & exchanged for a medium‚Äîbig difference! Almost too small. But super cute and different. Easy to dress up!
5.0,"My husband is allergic to cheap metals, and has had a rash for over a year from his old belt. After only a week wearing his Alice and Elmer‚Äôs belt with surgical grade steel, his rash is starting to clear up. He‚Äôs not on any medications or anything! Just that one change has made all the difference!"
5.0,"Everyday watch, looks good and I'm very satisfied. It was also the best price and I did a lot of looking fir this particular watch."
5.0,"I really like this belt, and it comes in a very nice box if you are giving it as a gift."
5.0,Received product as described.
5.0,"I am so glad that I waited for this pattern to come back in stock! I love the fun Galaxy print, and these are the same high quality leggings that I have come to expect from Leggings Depot. They fit great, and are securely sewn.<br /><br />I am almost 5'8&#34; tall, and wear a solid size 18 jeans (or a 16 from places with ridiculous vanity sizing, like Rue 21 or Old Navy.) I carry my weight pretty evenly. These plus size leggings are a perfect size for me, and the pattern does not get distorted or sheer from being pulled too tightly. I think that anyone over a size 20, or anyone who caries all of their weight in one area (stomach or hips/butt)  would probably be more comfortable in the next size up (search for &#34;Leggings Depot 3X 4X&#34;), just to have some extra breathing room.<br /><br />If you tug very hard at the seams, you can see small pinholes where the stitching is. This is not uncommon with most knit fabric, and is only really noticeable because the pattern is printed on white fabric and the white shows in the tiny holes when you pull on the seams. It does not show at all when I wear them, because they fit me. I could see someone having problems with seams ripping if they were wearing the wrong size and putting a lot of extra stress on the stitching.<br /><br />I have ordered many pairs of leggings from Leggings Depot, and only one came in the wrong size. I thought that there was something wrong with the leggings, because they clearly were not plus sized, but the I looked at the tags. They were the wrong size leggings. Nothing was wrong, I just didn't get the size that I had ordered. Now, before I open the package, I make sure that it says &#34;plus&#34; on the label, and everything is perfect. To be fair, I have had sizing issues with LLR leggings, where Tall&Curvy size can be inches smaller or larger, depending on the pair, and they are a huge pain to exchange. At least these leggings can be easily exchanged through Amazon.<br /><br />I have had no problems with pilling or leggings wearing out prematurely. I wash all of my leggings by hand, in cold water, and hang them to dry."
5.0,Fits as expected.  The material is a super soft thin material.  Not so thin as to be see through.  It is surprisingly warm considering the thinner material.  Looks great on and washed up nicely.  No shrinking.
5.0,"Absolutely I love this belt, it‚Äôs comfortable, fits perfectly and the size is perfect. I am using it for the last couple of days. I could feel it working and I hope it‚Äôs help me lose weight. This product's color is beautiful. It is comfortable when I walk and running. I enjoy it so far."
5.0,As described... work great...
5.0,"Well made, cozy and love the pockets!"
5.0,This is probably the third of fourth time I‚Äôve ordered these glasses. Not because I‚Äôve worn them out or broken them but because I like them so much and don‚Äôt want to be without if I lose them. I have yet to break a pair and when I had bought some readers from a large box store I broke them with regularity. The glare reduction does seem to work as I use untreated glasses at work and find myself getting my personal glasses when I need any computer work to be done. I prefer the blue accented glasses over the red as I find them more appealing and if I could get 2 of the blue at a time I‚Äôd buy more and f them at a time. I really feel that for a fairly inexpensive pair of reading glasses these are excellent. As long as these are available I‚Äôll be buying more
5.0,"Gave this to a friend at the funeral home after her mom had died, and she was touched by the gesture. Very delicate and pretty"
5.0,"Comfortable, I wear around the house.  Its kinda nice to just be in a night gown that is cute and I can wear and is long enough to cover me up so the modesty is there."

5.0,Bought this for teenage age son. He loves it and works great when running through the woods playing Bambi
5.0,The insignia on the hat is for WW2 army air core. The best of the best!!
5.0,"Blouse is beautiful, nice materials, sturdy.  You need to either use a camisole underneath or a nice and sexy braw because the central panel is lace. I ordered an XL I am  5'4"" and 155 lb with a broad back and bulky arms and do not feel binded.  Have not washed it. Will be getting it in other colors."
5.0,Easy to install. Great product for the money. I would recommend to anyone..There are 2 different grooves for the wire rings to adjust tension.
5.0,This the perfect travel body pillow. Bought this for my boyfriend to use when we travel. It's easy to blow up and easy to get the air out just by rolling the pillow back up. The travel bag helps to protect the pillow when it is in our luggage.
5.0,I love the sandal.
5.0,I purchased this for my 3 year old niece for gymnastics! Not skin tight nor overly baggy. Perfect fit!
5.0,bought this as a fidget for my 12 year old daughter and happily it is very cute and well-made. Great purchase!
5.0,"This is my second pair of these cycling gloves, because I like them that much. I've had the first pair for over a year, and they have stood the test of time and use. They are lightweight, durable, easy on-off and nicely padded, so just what I would want. They're cute, too! I would buy them again."
5.0,"They look great, feel good, and are reasonably priced. I have long legs so I really appreciate the 32in inseam. My only complaint is I wish they came in more colors!!!"
5.0,"So pretty!! Took a little adjusting to get it to lay right, but once I got it, it was great. Got many compliments."

5.0,"Our son just got his brown belt, and he'll be SO excited to receive this beautiful belt holder as a surprise for Christmas!  It arrived quickly and it's beautiful.  Thanks!"
5.0,Great costume item! Was shipped wisely  and wasn‚Äôt creased. Fits well!
5.0,It's not to small not to big its very pretty
5.0,Tough to beat for $12!  Better quality than I expected.
5.0,"I love this sweater! It's warm enough to wear  on a cool day & keeps me nice & cozy in the house, when it's chilly."
5.0,It doesn‚Äôt shrink after washing. It‚Äôs my go to hoodie.
5.0,"I am extremely happy with my tail.  I got it on time and it is just as described.  It is good quality, very soft and large. Very happy with this purchase. (:"
5.0,I originally bought this watch in black and received so many compliments that I had to buy it and brown/rose gold combo.For the price you are not going to get a better watch. So happy with this purchase.
5.0,I looked at a lot of websites trying to find a reasonably-priced watch with a &#34;minimalist&#34; design. This was by far the best value.
5.0,Love the unicorn design.
5.0,"I like it,had some nice compliments about it."
5.0,"It is an great necklace for the price. I have bought this in nearly every color. The shipping is not very fast, but I anticipated that."
5.0,It was package for shipping was great. No damage at all
5.0,Perfect add for your Sport-Tek hooded sweatshirt.  Lots of color choices and quality is very nice!  See my review on Sport-Tek Men's Lace Up Pullover Hooded Sweatshirt.
5.0,"First, I want to say that if you're ordering, consider getting a size larger then you need which is what I did for my son and he said it was a comfortable fit (aka Yeah Mom they feel fine with minimal eye rolling). I needed to replace his underwear for2 reasons, 1. teens grow quickly and 2. they lose things. Like pairs of underwear and socks. After much pondering of how underwear could disappear (later to discover socks and underwear in random places, here and there around the house, I was almost convinced we had little gnomes hiding things). I concluded that he needed a pack that had several pairs. And a lesson in putting important clothing items in the laundry basket. It needed to be at an affordable price and though these underwear had no reviews, I liked the price and the amount that came with them and took the plunge.  8 pairs in solid colors of burgundy, black, white, blue and grey. The pictures show the last clean pair of 2XL underwear. He wears a smaller size but because underwear like this typically run a little small, I ordered up and he hasn't complained.  I'm happy to report that most pairs are still accounted for in our household.<br /><br />You get 8 pairs in this super value pack for around 20 bucks.  If you love luxury underwear then you're probably not going to love these but if you want a bulk package for a low price, order a size up and give them a shot. Great for teenagers too."
5.0,Love the vintage pattern. Fits true to size..soft and comfortable.  Fastest shipping from an Amazon merchant in a long time!
5.0,"The top fit perfectly, the bottoms were two inches too large but I was able to fix that easily with bobbie pins - just folding the back part over itself and since the skirt already has creases it just looked like another wave. No one was able to tell it was pinned in the back! The top and skirt material are above that cheap shiny material you're use to for a costume at this price. Very nice overall!"
5.0,My grandson love his suit.  It looked realistic.
5.0,"Love the jacket , lightweight, looks good, keep you warm and dry"
5.0,"Great tank. Not as long as pictured, which worked out even better in my case."
5.0,At first I fall in love with the light green one but it was not in stock so I ordered the blue one. I don‚Äôt normally wear blue but is a cute blue and what I like the most is the brown buttons. It fits great and is the right size. I am 215 and size 1X and it was great fit for me in the size L-XLarge.
5.0,"Great hoodie, I recommend it.  Not to warm, and the size was accurate."
5.0,This dress surprised me! I didn't expect it to have such a great flattering shape on curvy girls but the seams around the &#34;belt&#34; are really placed in a good spot to make your waist look tiny. I will have to pin the neckline to keep my bra from showing - it's a lot of cleavage if you're a 34 DD like me!
5.0,"Still looks good as new after half a year of use. The 10+ card holders are especially handy, and the separate zipper compartment is useful for keeping cash (with a smaller zipper inside for coins)"
5.0,Exactly as described! Very comfortable.
5.0,Such  great sweatshirt!
5.0,Love these yoga pants!  I'm 5'8&#34; and have slightly long legs for my height. These are a perfect length!  I did go up one size based on other reviewers and the fit is perfect. Especially because my legs are not as big as my waist- other pants are often too baggy in the hips/legs but these fit great. The flare of the leg is not too wide like some other yoga pants.
5.0,"Great all around belts, no metal, so airport security no problem."
5.0,Lots of compliments and I took stunning pictures with it.
5.0,I love it!! Its very dainty and so cute!!!
5.0,"Love these earrings!  Just one small complaint, the posts on both earrings were bent while going through the mail.  The sender didn't wrap the earrings with some padding, just put them in a oversize plastic bag.  Oh well, I straighten the post and the earrings look lovely on me!  Go for it ladies!  Want something different then get these and make a fashion statement!  I hope my review helps you to make a decision."
5.0,Like the fit adjustable with easy pin tool that came with it. Looks alot more expensive than it is . Just plain nice.
5.0,Great necklace. My wife loves it.
5.0,It's nice and long which is a plus for me now I can wear these to work and when I bend over to get a pallet my underwear won't show haha. Overall great deal for 3 plus there was an extra shirt in there as well so bonus for me.
5.0,Beautiful coat for a great price! Fit is true to size. I ordered the red with the white fur hood. The fur is thick and plush. Highly recommend. I will probably order another color.
5.0,I absolutely love this piece!!! I wore it for a derby themed MS benefit and received many compliments. Just the right size and fir perfectly. I liked that I could adjust where the fascinator stayed on the headband so that I could put it at the exact angle I wanted and once I had it on it just stayed. Also seems to be pretty durable I will save it and definitely wear it again!!!
5.0,"Purse is great, has a good organization for my needs."
5.0,Super comfy! Love the color
5.0,My 9 year old daughter just had her ears pierced. She is looking for earrings to try. These earrings are quite tiny and super cute. They go with her tiny ears very well. I assume these are great with teenagers. They don't dangle. Price is great for two pairs.
5.0,Super comfortable around my face and ears. Washed several times and hasn't damaged the mask in the least. Plus super cute pitty on the front!
5.0,Perfect spacers for a larger chain. Arrived super fast.
5.0,Yes very comfortable easy adjustability to fit machine washable excellent product and great price
5.0,Affordable and fits as expected.
5.0,Gorgeous on my ankle.
5.0,This strap was beautiful but the gold metal was yellow looking. Loved the strap just not the hardware
5.0,"The shirt arrived quickly, and is a little more fitted than I expected, but I still can see it becoming one of my favorite shirts!  Long, soft and comfy..... feels like a nightgown!"
5.0,"Love this dress! Super comfortable yet a beautiful dress - for a dress that has a pretty high cut and is wrapped around, it's very easy to move around in without having to worry about showing too much leg. The neck part goes pretty low though - so definitely need something to hide your cleavage. The fabric is good quality and the print is super cute, can't wait to wear this outside. It does run pretty long though (I'm 5'5'') so will have to shorten the hem myself."
5.0,These are really made well
5.0,Quality item with great detail.  Perfect for pandora bracelet.
5.0,Loves these. I wear regular prescription glasses and have for over 40 years. This is the first pair of clip on glasses I have ever had. They fit nice. Metal not plastic nose clip piece. Very dark. They flip up too ha!
5.0,My mom loved it. Thanks!
5.0,I gave this to my son as a gift. He really likes it.
5.0,I love this product its really funny to just have ot on my backpack because it looks out of place on a minecraft backpack but its really durable and it's giftable to a kid/teenager.
5.0,"I love the look of pearls. This one is reminiscent of glamorous celebrities of the 1950's and 60's.  Very classy and very affordable!  Please give this company a try, I anticipate the arrival of every piece of jewelry I have ordered from them and am always rewarded with jewelry I'm proud to wear.  Lots of compliments come my way when I add Qiyun.z to whatever I'm wearing - these go very well with a dress or with jeans and a jean jacket!  Unexpected addition to casual wear will get lots of notice!"
5.0,The perfect cute outfit for Valentine's Day pictures. I love to dress my kids up and cute outfits for all the holidays and take pictures for them to have as memories when they're older. This dress is high quality and fits great. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,Sturdy and durable. I waited through winter. Shes used these boots for 2 months amd these are still in great shape. Fit a bit big but its easier to get on that way and room to grow so we dont mind that they fit a tad big
5.0,The color is also vibrant and shiny. Fit so flattering. Totally impressed!
5.0,Very cute and comfortable! I want one in every color they have.
5.0,Love the duck earrings.
5.0,"Great value, adjustable fits well"
5.0,My husband is a big 'ol boy so finding shirts for him is not easy to say the least. I found these and at a great price and decided to order them for him. They fit him well and are made of 100% USA made material. You can't get much better than that. He has to have the cotton to keep him from breaking out so he was very please with this! I will be ordering more as he seems to be going through them with his work. I love the colors - hoping you come out with a package with more colors to choose from!
5.0,"I LOVE the print, colors are vibrant and very pretty. Seriously not understanding why people are having so many problems getting the strap on their glasses. As you can see the arms on my glasses are quite large and I had no issues AT ALL getting them on. Strap is lightweight and fits comfortably and doesn‚Äôt bother my ears. Not sure if they float yet, will update my review after they‚Äôve been used."
5.0,great product  great price
5.0,I am 5‚Äô1 145 and I got the small. It fits perfectly. I cannot believe how soft this dress is. I already bought another color with short sleeves. Love love love.
5.0,Nice and substantial for a keyring but scratches easily
5.0,It works like I needed with the two ends and easy to separate.<br />I have not used long enough to rate durability and sturdiness.
5.0,This was gifted and the recipient just loves it. It is a perfect fit and the finish is flawless and smooth.
5.0,So cute!  Love this skirt
5.0,Shiny & lightweight
5.0,Wish there is other color option.
5.0,My girlfriend looks gorgeous in this dress. It's now my favorite. Never would have expected it to look as good as it did with only paying lil over ten bucks for it.
5.0,That is so useful  for a gifted
5.0,This my new favorite watch! It is cute and colorful. The wristband fits perfectly. I have small wrists so I have a hard time getting a watch or bracelets. This one is perfect for me. I may order one in each color!
5.0,"Very lightweight and comfortable, true to size. Looks great with school uniform."
5.0,"Awesome! When you get a stone like labradorite, it‚Äôs usually something you want to hand pick because you want to make sure you get pretty, iridescent stones. I took a chance knowing that I could get some dull, non-shiny stones.... but to my surprise, both bracelets were awesome and full of beautiful stones. My only complaint is that I ordered two of the same bracelet so the sizes would match and they each were different size stones."
5.0,This jacket fit perfectly and is very well made.  I just completed a two day ride where temperatures ranged from the low 60's up to the mid 90's and by using the removable liners I was comfortable all the time.  I wore the jacket with no liners installed from 80 to 95 degrees and it worked great.  I am 6'5&#34; tall and weigh 235 pounds. I have long arms (37&#34; sleeve) and the XL Tall size fits me perfectly.
5.0,"Perfect it , however, i purchase the wrong one had to return it. To purchase the corrected one."
5.0,Love this shirt. Ordered one and after wearing it once ordered every color they have plus another black one so I can hem the sleeves back and make it short sleeved.  I'm 5'0 and 200 lbs and the XL fit perfectly.
5.0,They are super cute. I love them
5.0,"Super cute for my teenage daughter, for great, nice quality."
5.0,bought these for my daughter to match her school uniform. she loves them we will buy again
5.0,"Comfortable, adjustable, works as described. Would purchase again if it were available in more colors."
5.0,Really cute and cooling to wear over top of bikini. Very happy with the fitting
5.0,Very high quality glasses. Sturdy frames and very clear lenses. Much higher quality than glasses I've paid more than twice as much for.
5.0,LOVE this bracelet!
5.0,Definitely order a size larger than normal. Fits great and pairs well with leggings and skinny jeans. Perfect for disguising my post-baby tummy.
5.0,It is made good. Looks good and my son loves it!
5.0,"This is one classy moccasin!  It looks good and feels wonderful on.  Everything about it is well done and extremely high quality.  The leather is soft and supple, lining is perfect, the innersole is cushy-comfy, stitching is immaculately done, and the outer sole is wonderful.  There's no slips or slides with this moccasin no matter what you're walking on.  I wear a heavy sock in this shoe so the toe box felt a little snug at first, but it conformed as I'd hoped and is now a perfect fit.  I'm extremely pleased with these and expect to have many comfortable years with them."
5.0,Nice shorts. Not baggy boxers. Like the cotton blend. I think some of the negative reviews are comparing these to the 100% knit version. I like the cotton blends. Best of both worlds. Loose fit without the extra material to bunch up.
5.0,"This is my favorite blouse at the moment, so unfortunately I wear it a lot. After six months use I have to wear it with a camisole, as it stretches quite thin and you can see undergarments through it. If they start making this in a sturdier, thicker fabric I will order more."
5.0,"So pretty, I would have paid double in a store. They are so elegant. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day."
5.0,"Best high-$ socks made. Minus33's micro-weight, full cushions have a noticeably different lightweight feel on the foot. It's maybe counterintuitive, but they're ideal hot summer black leather shoe socks.<br /><br />Did my homework on the sock sizing. The XL is snug on my take-it-to-the-bank 10.5 US foot. An L would have been small. An XXL could have worked too.<br /><br />Better than expected. Enjoy!"
5.0,let me start by saying that it is so difficult to find sunglasses that fits my facial structure. I have very high cheek bones and this Aviator fits perfectly on my face.
5.0,"I wore this to my aunties 50th birthday party. I received a plethora of compliments. The dress is form fitting, but not tight, it was actually quite stretchy. You can dance all night and not feel uncomfortable!"
5.0,These are precious and comfortable. I will say the fabric does get caught easily while I‚Äôm working but other than that I love them.
5.0,"Excellent quality. Daughter loved it, fits great. She‚Äôs 8 and wears size 10, length goes to her ankles."
5.0,Great sunglasses. Love the fit and polarized lenses. Cleaning cloth and case is an added bonus. Thank you.
5.0,"They work, plus they are fashionably trendy!"
5.0,"The perfect, loungy wear-around-the house or to the beach dress."
5.0,"I like this cap, it‚Äôs a good fit, it kept my head warm during the winter."
5.0,I got a lot of compliments on this shirt! Love the uniqueness of it!!
5.0,Great! Love this bag for my workout gear.
5.0,"Looks beautiful, excellent construction."
5.0,"good fit, color is pretty good. these compliment the shape fairly well."
5.0,"These work great.  I wish my blinds had actually come with these initially or that I would have found these earlier, cause they are awesome.  I had been using bungies wrapped around the posts and the blinds would usually pop out with a good gust of wind.  Now they don't move at all."
5.0,"Quality construction, comfortable and cute!"
5.0,Fits well and arrived on time
5.0,"I love all my Sofibella tennis wear including skirts, leggings, tops, etc. They all have nice high quality material, quality produced and they fit very nice to flatter my body. Thank you Sofibella, I am a lifelong customer!"
5.0,"Very nice hat, loved it and fit me good and I have a big head."
5.0,I'm absolutely satisfied with this shoe! Fits perfect and looks just like the photo. Yay!
5.0,Love it so comfortable on my legs.
5.0,"Wow, this fit like a glove.  It moved with my body, the fabric was great.  I cannot wait to wear this around Disney World."
5.0,"I really like this top and I think I'm going to enjoy owning and wearing it, just tried it on haven't worn it yet just got it today.."
5.0,Beautiful dress. Very sexy but not so sexy you can‚Äôt wear it to work. Flattering and comfortable.
5.0,"Fits well. May be a hair on the smaller end of the size, but you get better support that way anyway."
5.0,These are even more gorgeous in person than the picture! I'm in love with them!! They were delivered right on time and I am very happy with the product. I wish I could show them off more lol.
5.0,Worked perfect for my costume!
5.0,"Our little toddler looks adorable in this soft brown stylish outfit. The shirt is made up of three coordinating fabrics sewn together on angles. The matching brown shorts have a rope tie that is decorative only because they are held up by a 1"" elastic waistband. These clothes fit as expected and the cotton is very comfortable. He looks so cute wearing these."
5.0,Wasn't the color I needed. Thought it was light like the picture turns out to be darker
5.0,My husband loves the tie and I love the way it looks on him
5.0,This band fits perfectly on the watch and is very comfortable on my arm. It is very durable and has brought my watch back to life!
5.0,Great graphics and very soft and comfy.
5.0,great product - great quality
5.0,Super cute and soft. It fit perfectly. Definitely recommend
5.0,"The band is made of good quality leather (thick, soft, smooth with natural shine, etc.) and priced reasonably. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Love it!  It‚Äôs perfect for my COVID-19 hair!üòú
5.0,"Other than the smell they leave this hold up to everything else. Hubby says they are warm, work with touch screen, and stay dry. If you can stand the smell or wash it a couple times or ten üòÇ then you'll be good."
5.0,"Nice quality, good coverage and the adjustable straps are great."
5.0,My daughter and I both have a pair. We love them as they are flattering and hide any cellulite...They are comfortable to workout in or just hang out in. Great tights!
5.0,Great buy every thing is exactly as in the pic still mad I didn't get my free necklace tho
5.0,These are so cute ! I absolutely love them
5.0,Fits perfectly! Love that you can dress it up or wear with jeans! Will be ordering more colors.
5.0,Great material and stitching
5.0,My nephew loves his shirts.<br />Thank you
5.0,Never buying a women's wallet again. This is exactly what I need.
5.0,I didn't like using what solution to clean my silver if it drips on something especially if you have marble or Corian countertops you can eat through them. However the polishing cloth is a perfect solution does a great job.
5.0,Sleek and stylish. Reasonably prices. Comfortable fit.
5.0,Bought for a good friend of mine.  She loves all the color and can be worn with whatever color you wear.
5.0,I am really sad that this unavailable. I only buy the U.I. Station reds sunglasses they are my favorite.  It really upset me that the red was binging discontinued. I would have brought several pairs.
5.0,I really do like it very much I wish you guys carry more just like it in the future maybe better
5.0,Great gift for men
5.0,"Ordered these for my son, he says they fit great and are comfortable. 5 stars<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Our little girl absolutely loves these! She is all into jewelry and these are perfect for her!
5.0,VERY CUTE and fun boots.<br />Fit perfect
5.0,"I normally wear a size 34W but decided to take a chance and ordered these in size 33 US or XL from the manufacturer's country. Please see the attached pictures for measurements. The reason being is that I did not want these to look too baggy below due to to tooth-pick legs size :). Fortunately, everything turns out really well with the waist band being elastic, very stretchy so I still have a couple more inches to expand out to after a huge meal :). This cargo shorts do come with a button instead of a hook on the waist. The main zipper is mostly plastic, very easy to zip or un-zip without getting stuck on the fabric. The zipper puller is metal so that should last for the quite sometimes. The two top side pockets are deep enough to keep my valuable items from falling out. The two side cargo pockets are a little bigger than the two pockets on the back by the way, all four of these pockets do have a button on the flap to secure items in each pocket, such as phones and wallets for examples. The little 7th pocket on the right leg with a zipper and a long tassel :). at the zipper puller is a really nice touch and stand out elegantly :). The other nice thing and also one of my favorite things on these shorts are the little side plastic quick to release buckles on the elastic hem draw string. Together with the little zipper pocket above, they made this cargo pants really appealing, at least to me anyway :). Being 100% cotton it comes with some wrinkles as expected but I don't think that will be a problem being cargo shorts. The dark grey color fabric is a perfect match for these type of capris cargo shorts as well, From the color to the fabric, the pockets and the design, there is not much to dislike about this pair of shorts really. Very durable and well made, professionally sewn and comfortable to wear as well."
5.0,Normally wear a small but ordered a medium and it was the perfect fit!
5.0,"Great product fast shipping, my son loves them thank you!"
5.0,I like it nice and comfy and good quality
5.0,Excelente... cubrio las espectativas

5.0,These are by far some of my favorite crop tanks that I‚Äôve ordered from anywhere. I grab for these more than others. Stretch is nice and no seam pulling after washing several times. They stay in place and don‚Äôt roll on me either.

5.0,Theses MCM GLASSES  ARE AMAZING!! WILL BE MAKING ANOTHER  PURCHASE VERY SOON.
5.0,"Bought for air travel to Europe. Very comfortable. I broke my ankle and had to travel with boot. The cinch up feature was perfect. I have trouble finding pants that are long enough, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù these are perfect. A little pricey but you get what you pay for."

5.0,"Received this cute onesie a week ago and I've been wanting to review it but my nephew (for whom i ordered it) wasn't home. I finally got to put it on him and i cant help but gush how adorable it looks on him!! I ordered a 3 months because it was the smallest size, so it obviously was a little large for my nephew, now 1.5 months old. The material is great, not thin and filmsy at all! I love how the buttons run across the body, which gives easier access to diaper changing or anything else! The design is adorable, and i feel like he will wear it till a long time. Its conveniently full sleeved and full bottom, which makes it comfortable even for winter wear. I absolutely love this onesie and would definitely recommend it!!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review."
5.0,Love them! Baby boys looks adorable in them! Great for the summer.
5.0,Most unusual find - gives my backyard a look like no other!
5.0,Pocket Square and cuff links are just added bonus.  Love this Tie.  One of my favorites now.
5.0,I got this bead a couple of weeks ago to start my new Pandora bracelet. The bead is plastic but you can't tell by looking at it. So far it has shown no signs of scratching or tarnishing where the bracelet goes through. The little fish is orange on a blue background with clear bubbles and green sea grass. I love it.
5.0,I've used the mask throughout the holiday season and have gotten great comments and smiles from everyone that sees it!
5.0,"I actually feel good about myself in this swimsuit! I didn't know it was possible to feel confident in swimwear. The quality is really good and, if possible, the swimsuit is even cuter in person. I am very curvy with 48&#34; hips, a 28&#34; waist, and a 38C bra size. I was concerned the size 48 might be too tight in the rear, but it fits perfectly. Also, I am 5'7&#34; and typically find store brand one pieces to be too short in the torso, but this one is just right. I love it so much I just ordered the red one!"
5.0,Light weight and perfect for covering my hands at bedtime when I put a thick layer of lotion on my chapped hands. Next morning soft and hydrated.
5.0,"Loved the colors, material and fit was great..."
5.0,For the price of this swimsuit you are really getting a good buy! It's a good quality suit with great stitching...mine is slightly small but its definitely because I should've ordered a different size lol thats my fault. great suit though.
5.0,Love this! Perfect for my Halloween costume.
5.0,"I bought two! I washed it when it first came in, and haven't taken it off yet. Comfortable, great fabric too. It's not too heavy on me, Stretches with me, and I love the various colors. Ordering another one."
5.0,Grandson loves it!very satisfied
5.0,"This is a beautiful necklace set, it's small and dainty but still manages to look beautiful and expensive. It well made and the quality of the pendent is perfect. My cousin fell in love with this when I gave it to her for her birthday. I have one similar to this and she is always telling how beautiful it is, so I got her this one and I kind of like hers better then mine. Love all the details on the pendent."
5.0,Save your luggage.
5.0,"I like that it allows you to adjust the snap until it is just enough to wake you up,  but not enough to hurt you.  Additionally, if you need to, you can adjust it easily.  It is the best sleep aid that I have ever purchased."
5.0,"This is the second dress I have bought in this style. I would like the bodice piece to go lower, but I get tons of compliments when I wear it. I am 5'10&#34; and weigh 170 lbs.  I purchased the large. It fits perfectly."
5.0,"I like the allover fit, and the flexibility of the material when I move."
5.0,One of my favorite sweaters. I get lots of compliments at work. I only caution that it pulls easily
5.0,"This dress is so comfy I could wear it all the time. I gave it a 5 because of the comfort. I purchased it a little bigger because of the reviews, I should have only went up one size not 2, so that is on me but I will not be returning it!!"
5.0,"Simple electronic watch, no frills, cheap, works well for little kid's first watch, has all the basic functions - time, date, alarm, stopwatch, is waterproof in the shower. Backlit display."
5.0,Like the texture of the bag.
5.0,Good quality and very cute! Happy with my purchase :)

5.0,Very nice. Made a great gift.
5.0,Great item. Works. Well worth it
5.0,"Adorable. It‚Äôs so cute. It‚Äôs a little smaller than I expect;  my 1 year old probably won‚Äôt be able to wear the medium size after this winter. Nonetheless, I love it and it was perfect for our outdoor family photos."
5.0,My daughter asked for this for Christmas and she loves it.
5.0,Love this purse!!  Plenty of room but not to big!!!
5.0,Absolutely stunning! Wore this to my sisters baby shower and I was getting compliment after compliment!!
5.0,"My goodness it is beautiful. It is actually very high quality soft cotton, much prettier in detail than the photo shows. I have been looking for a not-boring long nightgown that wasnt over $100- this is it. Buying a second color."
5.0,"Although they took them almost a month and a half to get to me, these earrings are very pretty! They are a very good quality and look beautiful on!"
5.0,This hat is exactly what I was looking for. It is sturdy and good quality. I like the soft stretch band that helps with a comfortable fit.
5.0,"I have not washed it yet...but so far I really like the way that the white stripes on the black background are slimming and flattering.  the fabric is not too thin.  It is lined.  I usually wear a size 4 (5', 115 lbs) but I ordered the large and I like the way it comfortably fits.  Falls just below the knee.  I rarely write a review but the only review for this product thus far was not the same as my experience."
5.0,Nice looking - soles are sturdy
5.0,This was a gift for my grand daughter. She liked it and it fits great.
5.0,These pants are great!!! Fit as expected and so comfortable.

5.0,"I love these! I bought them to wear as a bridesmaid and will be wearing them with all my dresses. I'm 5'4"", 175lbs with most of my weight in my stomach and hips. These made my figure so flattering and I didn't have to be self-conscience about my stomach. I wasn't left tugging on them because the boning keeps them from rolling down. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Good morning. I haven‚Äôt used them yet. I‚Äôm using them New Years Eve. My friend used hers and she love them. She mixed them with water beads
5.0,Item came quick and is built with quality. Came with all tools necessary to change over to your current watch. Added this strap to a Casio f91w and this strap made it stand out. Will buy again
5.0,"I love them! I ordered a size up and they are so comfortable and very flattering! I'm 5'7 and the 32in length is just right to not be highwaters when I sit down but I can wear them with sandals.They even have small front pockets for a lipstick, gum or keys and I normally don't like pockets cause I think they make your hips look bigger. These don't. I'll get another pair."
5.0,Perfect it came on time and my girlfriend love it
5.0,I am indeed awesome so these socks tell the truth
5.0,Wore this to an Indian wedding. Looks expensive and I got a lot of compliments.

5.0,They fit perfectly and are very comfortable!
5.0,"I got these as a gift for my husband for valentines, so he hasn't seen them yet. However I also got the girl version, so I know how great they are. It comes packaged in a beautiful box, & the product looks great. Only thing I didn't like was that this pair had a weird smell to them. Hoping it fades off before I gift them to my husband."

5.0,I like it! I wish the print was larger - or more color than just the words.  Fits great - doesn't fade.
5.0,"This necklace and earring set are awesome! Exactly what I was looking for. I love the movie Trick or Treat and I work at Spirit Halloween so I love having different clothes and matching jewelry.

5.0,Such an adorable outifit we bought this for back to school and it was perfect!

5.0,"My son is 10yo, 107lbs and around 5 feet tall. Very muscular and considered a big boy (not chubby at all). I bought the XL and it fits great. Does not run down, even when playing basketball. Comfortable. He loves it"
5.0,"Affordable, really cute. Quality is better than expected. I'm 5' 115 lbs and usually a size 0-2 but i read the reviews and ordered a size up and it fits perfect! my new favorite jacket!"
5.0,"Make sure you convert from centimeters to inches and you cannot go wrong.  This is a very beautiful and functional scarf ring.  Thick wraps and scarves will not work with this ring.  However I have many 100% silk, lightweight scarves and this holds them securely where I put it and stays all day.  Very good looking item as well.  I got the silver tone but the rose gold tone would be a winner too."
5.0,I bought this shirt to wear to An Evening with Chevy Chase event.  It's soft & comfortable and fits well!  I ordered a small which is my normal size!
5.0,Got this for my 9 year old granddaughter.  It glows in the dark and she wears it often.  Very stylish.

5.0,This is a very sturd yet soft and comfi bra....I'm definitely buying other colours it just gorgeous...
5.0,Great peice and loving the price! It looks much more expensive.  I haven't worn it long enough to comment on whether or not it tarnishes.

5.0,Love these! So comfortable. Great for wearing around the house all evening before bed.
5.0,"Good quality material, very cute and sexy with side detail that gives a little peep show of your waistline at the sides. Like that I can wear with flared bottoms of all kinds. Like it and bought it in white as well.  Bought medium and I wear a sz  small in US for T shirts and dresses being a dress sz 6."
5.0,Suuuuper comfy and fit true to size. I'm usually an 8 or 8.5 and I got an 8.5. I have worn these all day and they don't give me any problems. Definitely worth buying!

5.0,Very nice watch. So it is big and does not feet boys under 10.

5.0,"I love it, it goes with everything in my wardrobe"
5.0,So far this bag has been great!  We‚Äôve only had it for a couple of weeks but sand/dirt doesn‚Äôt seem to collect in the bag and it‚Äôs large enough to hold all the stuff we need at the beach or pool for a family of 5.  Seems to have sturdy handles and they are holding up so far.  I like that it‚Äôs neutral as well; my husband doesn‚Äôt mind using it when he takes the kids even without me.
5.0,I have this to my mom for Christmas and she loves it. It looks very nice and is in good shape so far.
5.0,I love the product. It fits perfectly. Just need to wait until the fall to wear it.

5.0,Bright color no fading if wash in colors.
5.0,"Few things. I am a 34dd. I purchased the large. It is TIGHT! Let me assure you though, if you wiggle enough it goes on!! NO BOUNCING AT ALL IN THIS!! I highly recommend and plan to buy more. Even though it is a very tight fit I will purchase the same size as it is still very comfortable!"

5.0,Look greate

5.0,"I absolutely love this pull over shirt. I will wear it alone when it's warm and with a shirt underneath when it's colder, so a perfect piece to wear all year round! I also love the color. I own a lot of Nike's products in this color and they do not disappoint! I also get very many compliment's on the shirt. I have recommended this to a few of my runner friends and they also only have great things to say about it. The fit is as expected and does not shrink at all. I recommend this 100%!"
5.0,Vibrant color and really works well on a rainy day. Not too heavy and the hideaway hood is a nice touch. Definitely am impressed with the jacket
5.0,I bought a bag for each of my grandchildren.  We are so blessed.  They loved them.  I am getting some more for friends.  A truely different gift that truely keeps on giving.  A great library bag.
5.0,"This belt is way better than I thought it would be. I like not having a buckle at my belly button. No more constantly pulling my pants up when I'm walking around, even with a conventional belt on. This is made with good quality and I highly recommend it. I bought a pack of six and I will buy more, I've already given away 2 to my adult kids."

5.0,My daughter is addicted to watching Harry Potter recently. She is clamoring for me to buy her a cloak every day. I read it online for a long time and bought this one. The quality is very good. There is no smell. It doesn't feel uncomfortable to wear. The important thing is that its support design is good. You can sit at will without being affected
5.0,My grandson is 10 and I got him this hoodie for Christmas. He loves it. In fact I need to tell him to take it off before bed because he wants to sleep in it.  Lol. It's thin and comfortable. Soft and durable.  The colors are vibrant. You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"Daughter loved it! Durable, quality product!"
5.0,"I absolutely love these! They're my forth pair of olive loafers (I'm obsessed, I know). The leather on these is super soft and flexible.  All the stitching is hardy as well.  I can wear these for hours on end while standing and now experience any pain.  However, if you need arch support, I would suggest using insoles as might not be the best for you right out of the box.  I'm very pleased with the quality of these shoes, and will continue to buy them in different colors until I have them all :)"
5.0,"Fast shipping, good quality and decent price!"

5.0,"Arrived exactly as pictured, and at &#60; $18 this is a great buy!"
5.0,"We ordered this set for a theatre performance.  The skirt (in particular), looked great and fairly realistic.  My daughter was @ 5'4"" ... and it seemed a little shorter than we had hoped for (but it depends on what you need).  You'll need shorts or something underneath of it."
5.0,If you're looking for something a little cheeky and sexy BUY THIS SWIMSUIT. I've always struggled with swimsuits not being flattering enough but this one is PERFECT.
5.0,Comfy causal dress. Light weight but not see through.
5.0,I like the color and the softness of the material.
5.0,"Great skirt--thick, versatile, well-made, great fit!"
5.0,I got this to try and free up some space inside my closet. Set up was stupid easy. The hooks are easy to adjust and so far just one is holding 5 larger tote size handbags and two smaller bags as well.
5.0,"perfection! will definitely order more !  I'm a long-term diabetic with circulatory problems.  Generally, tall socks with bands of any kind hurt by mid-day.  I am amazed since these socks energize the legs for the entire day with NO pain, NO swelling, and NO indentions where the bands fit.  I highly recommend!!!"
5.0,"At first I was unsure about ordering these, but I am very glad I did. The fabric is a silky beautiful satin adorned with gorgeous flowers. There is ample room, but not to the extent that they are too large. The sizing is spot on. I ordered these for my bad hair days and they are just perfect for that. They are stylish and can be worn many different ways. What more could I ask? They also were reasonably priced. I am pleased with my purchase."
5.0,Was even better than we expected. Great bang for our buck.
5.0,"Well made, attractive, positive comments made, and would by again from this manufacturer"
5.0,Came quickly during the Christmas rush. Loved it!
5.0,Very soft and comfortable for the price

5.0,This product was true to size and the picture/description was accurate. It‚Äôs not the most luxurious of fabrics but will work for what I need it for.
5.0,"This was a totally unexpected Christmas gift for my 16 year old. When it arrived, we placed it under the Christmas tree. On Christmas morning the teenager opened it and the FUN and LAUGHTER began!!! Oh my, it was such a fun product and well made too. Looks like, in the near future, we will be purchasing the rest of the collection: Zebra, Brown Horse, etc!!! This would make a really interesting family group picture!<br />Well made. Smells a bit at first, but it airs out well. A definite fun factor find!"
5.0,My girlfriend gets complements all the time on them. Even her mother likes them.
5.0,I got this for my wedding absolutely love it
5.0,"Looking for sexy thigh highs that ACTUALLY stay put? Arent we all. But seriously, buy these and you wont be disappointed. I'm 5'8 and always had a hard time finding thigh highs that werent actually knee highs. They roll up to a point where they became crotch highs, but works well - if they do slide down while walking, they're still high enough. Take the time to make sure the elastic is secure to your thigh at the top, and you wont have an issue.<br /><br />In terms of cleaning, would recommend air drying them once out of the gentle washing cycle. I made the mistake of putting them in the dryer, they werent ripped or anything but the elastic seemed to wear off a bit. Sir drying is the way to go."
5.0,This is a great product for Fantasy football players.
5.0,"They're beautiful. Perfect size, exactly what I wanted. The etchings are visible, like the picture, at least on the pair I received. The hooks are overly large but I just trimmed them down shorter, easy fix."
5.0,Bought these for both my daughters as easter dresses they were very cute and they received lots of compliments. Would recommend
5.0,I have size of XS so the coat perfectly fit even on top of a big winter jacket.<br />I'm happy with it.
5.0,"Although there were long delivery delays due to customs, my order finally arrived and the quality of the product is top notch! I ordered XL shirts, I'm 160 lbs, 5'10"" atheletic build and they fit like a glove. I use them for outdoors work as they keep the sun and dirt off my skin plus the wicking material keeps me cool while I sweat. The customer serivce was prompt and they took care of any issues. Will order again no matter how long it takes."
5.0,"Love the watch. Easy on, easy off!"
5.0,Perfect hat for my 16 month old daughter and will be for years to come with room to grow into it. Blocks sun and stays on.
5.0,Fits very well love them
5.0,My daughter is very sensitive to fit. Most shorts I've tried to buy are either too tight in the waist or seat. She also does not like to wear pants at her natural waist. These worked perfectly. She was very happy when she tried them on and loves to wear them.
5.0,They all looked great can‚Äôt wait to wear them to school. Also a really great deal
5.0,"The pink is a very pretty dusty rose. I wear that one the most. It fits my Gear S2 well, was easy to install, and doesn't show any signs of wear after wearing it daily for the past 3 months. I actually think the material is nicer than the band that came with the watch."
5.0,I really loved this bracelet it is more prettier in person very gorgeous I will be ordering more for gifts
5.0,I enjoy these earrings. I actually purchased so I could leabe them in for weeks at a time. Perfect!

5.0,"I absolutely loooooove these stylish, futuristic shades, not too many future themed shades come close to this cool looking design and is perfect for the outdoors under the sun. It also complements my swagger in clothing, however, these are not to be worn indoors unless you want to be blinded by darkness. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,"The necklaces are cute. Like the other reviewer said, it‚Äôs great that there are boy friendly styles. The stretch cord is nice. It‚Äôs black when cold then turns blue, green orange as it warms."
5.0,true to size and very cute swimsuit! love the top

5.0,"They came a day early which was nice I, tried em on they go right up to my knees just as excpected.. :)"
5.0,This is a mask we order for graduation party after graduation on May 20th...It is very pretty and is a back up for the Prom also on this Friday
5.0,The color did not fade after I washed it. The bill kept its form. Good quality
5.0,Super cute as described
5.0,Adore my ring.  Only thing I wish the name on the left was closer in.  . Engraving was great.
5.0,Girlfriend gets compliments on it all the time.
5.0,Adorable - just as expected !
5.0,"PERFECT! Beautiful and very well made. I received the sage one in the mail, tried it on, and immediately ordered one in black and one in navy."
5.0,these are great just to be able to pull them up when you need them
5.0,pretty and cool and soft and light.
5.0,Very cute but runs big!
5.0,"Lovely long make a perfect wrap head covering, nice price"
5.0,"Love how it's adjustable.  Only &#34;complaint&#34; is that it does seem to slide out of the desired position a little too easily; therefore, I have almost unknowingly lost it a few times.  Luckily, I noticed before it was lost forever!  Just make some kind of minor &#34;alteration&#34; to keep it in snuggly in your desired position to fit your wrist.  Still a great item!"
5.0,Very soft! Great socks!
5.0,I had a pretty plain gown on for a special evening. This really helped make it &#34;pop.&#34;
5.0,"Good fit, confortable."
5.0,Super cute necklace!!! Received lots of compliments too!
5.0,Love these compared to the traditional squeeze clamps.
5.0,"I don‚Äôt usually review items, but I simply had to!  I Love it! Very soft, sooo cute and looks great with skinny jean and boots!  I ordered 2 sizes up based on the reviews and it‚Äôs huge!! But it‚Äôs what I wanted anyway, so it worked out great either way.  If you want a more fitted look, I would order based on your measurements, but if you want it like it‚Äôs photographed, go larger.  It does have a bit of a robe look, but everyone is wearing Sherpa and it‚Äôs so warm and has a cardi look when oversized.  I ordered the pink and I‚Äôm very impressed with the soft color and variations of shade.  I did not notice any shedding like some reviews and it didn‚Äôt clog my dryer vent when I prewashed it.  It handles laundering quite well and was even fluffier after I dried it...so I‚Äôm thoroughly impressed."
5.0,"I really like that it's easy to adjust. I don't really like the filter insert, makes it hard for me to breathe. But I just took it out and it was alote better without it."
5.0,Fit great! Excellent gift
5.0,"These earrings are perfect!<br />They are double sided,<br /> arrived on time (if not earlier then expected)<br />And the seller also sent me a gifted pair of earrings as well!<br />You can't beat it!<br />Very satisfied buyer<br />Will purchase from seller again<br />(Penny in review pictures for size scale)"
5.0,"As a huge Sailor Moon fan, I had to have this purse. It goes great with most any outfit, and is, as my sister referred to it, &#34;subtly nerdy&#34;. Whenever I encounter another Moonie, I get tons of compliments. It seems built pretty sturdy, and has held up really well over the few months I've had it. Definitely recommend."
5.0,"I bought these for my 5 month old grandson, they were just a little to big but he will grow in to them."
5.0,I like the shirt. My only complaint is that it could be a little longer but I will definitely still wear it. I would buy it again.
5.0,"We love this apron! I wish that it could come monogramed, but it can be added later."
5.0,I have some hiking boots that need this product. Those boots must be 20 years old and I love them still. They have held up like you wouldn't believe. I am going to spray them well with this so that the suede doesn't get wet. I will also be using on my suede bags.
5.0,"I love the fabric. Nice and stretchy. Fabric is thin but not see through. I'm 5'5 140lb 36C. I ordered a Medium. Its a little bit big on me, but I like it. It's about an inch above my knees. Hope I helped"
5.0,Fits perfectly. Comfortable. Lots of compliments every time I‚Äôve worn this dress. Great for curves.
5.0,"Love these!  I wear them everyday.  I have had shin splints ever since I was in high school; I put on a pair of these and thought &#34;What kind of sorcery is this?!&#34;.  My lower legs felt better within minutes.  I own about 6 pair now so I always have some clean and ready to wear,"
5.0,I received this beautiful name necklace in the mail much more quickly then I thought. It is stunning. I highly recommend this Disney inspired necklace. Communication with the seller was excellent.<br />Will definitely purchase from this seller again
5.0,"inelastic as it says, very nice quality, but I hd no trouble wrapping around my wrist either -- pleased with my purchase"
5.0,"Excelente producto , se ve de buena calidad , buen espacio interior"
5.0,I simply love everything about my credit card holder
5.0,Great item for the winter. I love it.
5.0,Perfect for career day
5.0,"Heavy belt that everyone asks about, very well made, one item that looks better in person than on screen!"
5.0,"I needed an apron that was comfortable, durable, and a bit fancy for when we are able to go back to hosting dinner and Halloween parties once this pandemic is under control.  I‚Äôm always in the kitchen so I go through aprons rather quickly. For size reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 160lbs and I felt very confident in this apron. I would definitely recommend this product. If they had more colors with this theme I would definitely buy more."
5.0,The picture talks for the item it fits perfectly
5.0,I get soooo many compliments on these. Love them.
5.0,"i love it ,it looks just like the picture, and it is holds so much."
5.0,"I gave a 2 star review for my order because although the sunglasses were fine, the case had a defective latch (magnetic). However, the company contacted me and wanted to make sure I was satisfied and made sure I was.<br /><br />I guess an occasional defective sunglasses case can happen with any company - difference here is these guys really care enough to guarantee you complete satisfaction - I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5.0,The fabric is very soft and comfortable and washes well. I have bought a number of these tops over the years and this one is larger than the previous ones but still wearable. Maybe it will shrink up a bit with more washing and drying.
5.0,Great price and comfort her pajamas However these do run very small so I typically wear a large and return them for a 2X and they were perfect. I also washed and dried them and they came out very nice and they are very comfortable.
5.0,"Perfect fit. Somewhat stretchy, perfect length as well. Very comfortable and flattering."
5.0,I liked this hoodie. Not heavy and feels nice on.
5.0,Comfortable and cool...so good I had to buy 4 more pairs as gifts
5.0,These are the cutest leggings I have ever bought. I am not much of a leggings person but was looking for comfortable pants to wear with my boots.  These nailed it! They look great with sweaters and tonic tops even if you are a bit more on the curvy side. I wear a size 12 pant and have a 34' inseam and these fit perfectly.
5.0,"The band is a bit short compared to the original bands that you get with the Fitbit blaze. The blaze fits in the little holder thing that it's supposed to. My wrist isn't that fat either. The band has plenty of holes but I can only get it to go to the second hole with my wrist, whereas I can get the original Fitbit blaze band to go to the seventh hole. There were no sizes that I could pick from before ordering either. So you can only get one size."
5.0,"I want another, so comfortable and sexy!"
5.0,I really love this dress. It fits like a glove and I bought it for my best friends wedding. It really hugs my figure pretty well and is long enough for my size. I am a size 3X and so it is hard to find a cute dress that was cheap. For about 30 dollars this dress was a steal!  I still wear this dress after the wedding for church cause I like it so much.
5.0,"Sharp tie clips. I love that i can color coordinate to my tie or shirt. Comes in nice box. Seem durable and not easy to bend. Great colors in the selection.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I did receive this item at a discounted price for my truthful and honest review. The words of this review are my own and the reduced cost of the item did impact my review. If you found my review beneficial, please feel free to let me know by marking so below.."
5.0,"Strongly recommend (especially for petite buyers)! The price to quality ratio is splendid and the olive color is exactly what I wanted and true to picture. I am 5'2 and 100 lbs for reference and I always wear my blouses in a French tuck. Finding petite shirts can be difficult and in colors I prefer. I am a huge fan of the Eddie Bauer Mountain Ripstop button down shirts but since they were determined to only have pastels this spring (not my cup of tea) while I am traveling for work, and in dire need of a couple spare shirts, I got this one. After wearing it, immediately ordered one in dark Navy. This shirt has a nice feminine fit but is sturdy in material. Honestly could not be better for the price and would love the seller to produce the same shirt in a poly/sweat wicking blend. My only complaint is that I just received my dark Navy shirt and the collar is about about a half inch longer than my green one. Hoping to contact the seller and see if it is worth exchanging (it looks rather odd) . Nonetheless I understand QA/QC development and hopefully them knowing can help correct continuity."
5.0,Such a cute shirt for such a great price! Love to wear it and you can wear it with anything!!
5.0,Love these boots. Super nice quality.
5.0,"Comfy, flattering and super hot pants!"
5.0,"Liked the cap, fits good and has great quality"
5.0,"Lovely pajamas, well made and very soft fabric, however I prefer a much looser fit for sleep things and these fit just snug enough to be uncomfortable to me. Someone else may like it as a true fit. So will return for the X-large size. Too good to pass up. These are really nice. Could do without the extra accessories though."
5.0,I loved this costume. If was comfortable and roomy.
5.0,"Good, as expected...."
5.0,Good quality for price. Beautiful.
5.0,"Recomiendo lavar y planchar primero de forma delicada porque vienen en un empaque sellado al vac√≠o, se ve que son muy vers√°tiles, buena opci√≥n econ√≥mica"
5.0,"Smooth, stretchy, comfy, flattering, but fits tight. I recommend one size larger for a fit that looks like the model's."
5.0,This is a perfect little gift for someone. It's beautiful and elegant. Bridesmaid gifts or flower girl gift. Or even a stocking stuffer
5.0,Love this dress.  Will order another!
5.0,"Finally.... quality, USA, (and my home state) made socks!  I wear a women's size 10, so I LOVE the XL, comfortably fitting size socks. I'm trying to get a pair in every color, but after a year or so... finding that some colors just don't come in XL. I've bought these for my family and friends (with smaller feet) as gifts and they too... LOVE THEM! Great boot socks!"
5.0,My dad loves this!! I gave it to him for my wedding and he cried like a baby :-)
5.0,I  have been wearing Giorgio Brutini shoes for years. Obviously when a deal like this one comes alone I will jump on it. Love the boots
5.0,I love this dress and it looks great! I think the material is really nice! So happy that I got this!!
5.0,"Bought this as it's a modest dress to wear to a prom I'm helping to chaperone. This is SO slimming and elongating for me, as well as flattering to my curves. I'm 5'3, 160~ pounds, and the large I bought was true to size."
5.0,Got this for my husband for Christmas because he is a bowler and he likes it.
5.0,"Let me start off by stating I'm 5'6&#34; and 175lbs. I ordered the XL because my sole intention was to wear this over hoodies for a cute layered look and I also kept in mind denim jackets have a reputation for not stretching that well.<br />However, this jacket has a really good stretch to which is amazing cause it makes it so comfy and  I was worried it would be too tight in the arms. I'm really glad I got the XL though since I am wearing it over hoodies. If I was wearing it like a normal person the Large would probably be more than fitting if not the medium even if you're wanting to wear it tight and accentuate your waist. I think how stretchy it is really helps conform to your body.<br />Also for any further reference about fitting like comparing my sizing to yours if we're similar...my bust is 37inches, waist 27, hips 40/41, I usually wear medium size tops from Victoria's Secret and their hoodies in a large(popular store I could think of that most people would be familiar with sizing).<br /><br />My picture I show wearing it with a pink hoodie and then I show it with me wearing a red shirt. It wears a little big with just my shirts but again that's because I purposely bought it bigger. If you're my size I would definitely be getting a medium or large."
5.0,very good quality. package arrived in just a few days and I had used regular shipping.
5.0,the package came within 2days nice size  i love it i wear it everyday.
5.0,I wanted something that had old testament and new testament.  This is perfect and not too big.  I am really tough on my stuff and I am surprised this has stood up to the punishment.
5.0,These are super cute and they come in mini packages! They don‚Äôt hurt your ears what so ever and they are a good size not to small or to big! I recommend I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this one deserves it
5.0,High quality leather and good fit. Normally buy 1/2 size down in Bushacres
5.0,Came quickly. Easy to set and Easy to read but most of all easy to clean.

5.0,Very comfortable on the shoulders and long enough
5.0,Paz Creations are unbelievable quality and workmanship. Love these earrings
5.0,I have ordered this for my wife.  It is just not an amazing look.  It has a lot of meaning within the bracket!  Besides for her wedding set her second most favorite piece of jewelry in the past 14 years!
5.0,"I'm usually just a label snob when it comes to sunglasses. Was leaving for Mexico and got a bunch from this brand because they were so cheap I thought if I lost them, it wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm absolutely obsessed with this pair! Good quiality and unique. People are constantly asking where they can get a pair!"
5.0,"Works great, got this for my son."
5.0,These are so cute and I love the colors. There are too many pink ones for my tastes--we use tan and green the most. They are well constructed. No glue showing and they've held up for 4 months so far
5.0,These are pretty and make nice filler beads for my bracelet. They match the colored beads I have already. Nice.
5.0,Great quality and look amazing with skirts and pants. The size and the wide of bet are the perfect to enhance outfits.  Reb color is vibrant and you can switch it to the black side.  This belt is a must.
5.0,My wife decided to go on my phone when I was in the shower and purchase this on my Amazon account. It fits as expected and she seems to be happy with it. I‚Äôm happy when it‚Äôs off that‚Äôs all I can say about it.
5.0,"Very cute. Well made and it fits great, but is super tight. Just an FYI. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 130 lbs. Very tight around the neck."

5.0,"For a pretty small price, you can have several bracelets for yourself, and then a number to give away to friends who also want to let the world know that they are fully vaccinated."
5.0,I love them so much and this will help me with my pet age regression you can bend and them and shape them when they come they are a little more thinner than expected but I still love them and they were amazing thank you definitely get these and the tail is really cool too I love it
5.0,Loveeeeee these! So cute :)
5.0,"I bought these socks specifically to use on a 14 hour flight with a cruising altitude of 36,000 ft. The last time I took a similar flight I swear I could feel the vains in my legs jumping a mile high. When it came time for this trip, I was determined to prevent that discomfort. After comparing a lot of compression socks, I finally settled on these and am so glad I did. They kept the vains in my legs happy and my feet warm. I was worried about the compression being too tight and itchy but turns out I had nothing to worry about. I put them right before the plane took off and never thought about them again til after I walked off the plane at my destination 14 hours later. For such a great price, and the fact that they did exactly what they were supposed while being comfortable, these compression socks are a fantastic purchase."
5.0,"Fits as expected & really impressive how they included 2 spare beads and an internal band! Hard to believe this was all only $10!? Overall super pleased, Awesome product for the money !"
5.0,Halloween costume. Very good quality. Worth the money
5.0,These are very stylish..and super cute. Great value for the price. Hope they last. Orange ones are great! Bought 2 other colors cause I love the style.
5.0,I love these ties! I needed some for work. These are long enough. And they fit nicely. The colors are true to the pictures!
5.0,Super cute! Good quality too!
5.0,"The material is soft,  and I am tall.... it's long in the torso area,  perfect in bust area.. I'm DD.<br />Highly recommend this seller!!"
5.0,Great looking band for my Fitbit blaze and you can't beat the price.
5.0,Very nice and good fit
5.0,I LOVE IT! FITS WELL...DESIGN AND COLOURS SO SEXY! WILL BUY AGAIN.
5.0,This dress is very soft and beautiful. It‚Äôs slightly longer than expected but I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4 so most things are slightly long on me. The bust fits perfect and is very flattering
5.0,"Be sure to prewash/presoak before using to get rid of excessive die, but excellent quality!"
5.0,This dress is beautiful and the quality of a $100 dress from ModCloth! I love it. The fabric has a very luxurious feel and the cut is very flattering!
5.0,Wonderful product! It ever comes with the matching cover which I didn‚Äôt realize. Only drawback is there weren‚Äôt instructions. I already knew what to do as I have already replaced one band on a different fitbit.
5.0,Bought it as a gift and recipient loved it.<br />The packaging was also so nice!
5.0,Love these pants! SO COMFY!
5.0,the fit is great and very comfy.
5.0,Very cool bracelets!
5.0,"Christmas present for my son, he loved it!"
5.0,"I'm very happy with this purchase.  I had a giant wallet prior to this.  It takes a little getting used to tri-folding your bills, but once you get used to that, it's no big deal."
5.0,Gave as a gift and the recipient loved them!
5.0,So cute. My brother loved them
5.0,I usually buy UnderArmour underwear but they have started making them thinner so I thought I‚Äôd give these a try. I love them!! Already reordered a few more colors!!!!
5.0,I added these to bracelets that I bought at wholesale price to sell at a holiday festival.  They arrived to be just as described and the bracelets sold great.
5.0,"I have small wrists and have always gravitated toward metal watch bands as leather always looked off with the end of a leather strap flying off the side of the watch. This band has changed my outlook and has me looking at other products in the Swiss Reimagined line.<br /><br />PROS: Quick Release strap is incredibly easy and doesn't catch at all<br />Well built and looks great with a perfect balance between casual and dress (perfect for office and running errands)<br />Leather is durable (I've gotten it soaked, covered in soil, spilled on and it still looks new<br />Doesn't absorb odors, whether its cologne on the wrist or sweat from a heavy workout the strap still smells like fresh leather which is a HUGE upshot for longevity<br /><br />CONS: I wish they offered a short version strap for us smaller wrist folk<br /><br />I great watch that looks like it should have a $40 price point, that works in most situations thanks to the rich chocolate color dark leather and cream colored stitching."
5.0,I was surprised to see how many pieces came in this package. I was NOT disappointed!
5.0,worked perfectly for me. Needed elastic laces for high top sneakers and this fit the bill.
5.0,"These socks are great! When they arrived, I thought they were way too big for my little ones feet, but they have stayed on for two days (don‚Äôt judge, he‚Äôs clean!) without stretching or falling off! That‚Äôs a major win for me! My baby is 10 months and wears a size 2 shoe. He is not chunky at all. I would buy again."
5.0,"First off, wish they would stop combining multiple styles within one listing! It makes it so hard to tell if others are reviewing the same style you're considering. I ordered one of the printed dresses that ties at the back of the neck.<br />I am 5'3"" 145lbs with 37-29-40 measurements. I tend toward an 8 or a 10 and usually order medium. The chart suggested medium, but I read other reviews that seemed it was roomy enough of a cut that I could size down so I wouldn't have to worry about it being too long on my short self. I am pretty sure if I followed the size chart that it would have been too large for me so I'm rating that it runs a little large. Sizing down gives me a perfect fit though, flattering, flowy but not billowing or overwhelming at all on my short frame. I didn't ever think I'd find a pretty maxi dress for a 5'3"" person but this is it. Fabric is light and a little crepey, will rumple badly in my suitcase but I love it enough that I'll even iron it on vacation. The blue and green tropical leaf print is so pretty. Very very happy with the purchase"
5.0,"These were true to size, comfortable and have held up well to washing.  Perfect for daily wear."
5.0,Great deal for the price and will purchase again!
5.0,Our daughter loves DC! she loves the shirt. Fits as expected. Just a tip: I would turn the shirt inside out when drying it  as you would any tshirt.
5.0,"I've been using this purse for almost 2 months, and I love it! I would definitely buy it again."
5.0,"I usually wear a med or large in leggings, but after reading everyone‚Äôs review I was afraid and sized up two sizes to XXl. They are tight but could be tighter. Loved them. So ordered another and sized down. I would recommend you size up 1 size from your Norma legging size. Don‚Äôt go by weight chart it‚Äôs exaggerated. I just had vein injection and need to wear compression. These are so much better that the thigh high ones that pinch my thighs and leave a dent under my cloths. You can just throw on a cute top and wear these to work. Totally opaque. My teenage daughter loves them on me and is considering buying just to have."
5.0,"I love them. The earrings are not heavy, are good quality for the price, and i received a sweet thank you note from the seller when I opened up the package. :) The only comment i have is that the cuff piece can be a little irritating if you have sensitive ears but other than that they look really nice."
5.0,I love this hat! I purchased it for my college sorority friend as a Christmas gift! She loved it!!!! :)
5.0,I bought this for my sibling and I. As gifts the bracket fits well ...
5.0,I was very pleased with this jacket. I got a size large because they didn‚Äôt have my size and it fits very well... not to big. Definitely recommend buying.
5.0,"So many compliments on this cute, comfortable and casual dress. Perfect for a day in the office or if you just want to be cute on a weekend. I ordered a medium (5'4&#34;, 140lbs, 34dd) and it fit perfectly.  I also loved that it has a drawstring because that makes it super flattering. I also like the material- soft and light but opaque.  I wish they had more colors."
5.0,They were just what I was looking for!
5.0,great summer robe.  fit as expected.  arrived quickly
5.0,I ordered this for my teenage daughter for school. She wears uniforms at her school.  It fits her perfectly and it arrived way before the expected arrival date.
5.0,Inexpensive. Very comfortable. True to size chart.
5.0,Very cute! They're neutral colors so they go with a lot of things. They are also stretchy so there's some leeway if you gain/lose weight.
5.0,I‚Äôve been looking for a raw reasonably priced Ruby for 7years and the Ruby is descently sized...it‚Äôs not small
5.0,Very cute!  Bought as a gift and is holding up well.

5.0,Great quality and very durable. My son loves them. He gets lots of compliments when he wears them. Shipping was fast and they were packed well.
5.0,They are perfect...  would like same the went further up the leg for winter however ! ! !
5.0,Glasses are a very nice quality.  They are pretty darkly shaded to block a lot of sun...but I guess that is the point.  I like the gunmetal color and the sprin hinges.  They dont feel heavy on my face at all.
5.0,"Very comfy, great quality‚Ä¶A little pricey however you do get what you pay for and that‚Äôs a quality product."
5.0,Absolutely in love with these pants! I want every color! 160 5'7 order a medium! Jlo booty and smaller waist! Fit great!!!!! Holds you in forsure don't slip off and don't show SWEAT!

5.0,Absolutely love it!  It is so lightweight and NOT scratchy! It's so warm I could wear a tank top under it and still be warm.  So glad I got it in two colors!
5.0,"This is my favorite fleece ever, went back to get more and they were no longer offered.  So soft, warm and washes up great.  Will be watching for them to come back"
5.0,The orange is a bit more of a mustard yellow but it‚Äôs still extremely cute. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it out I love the fit and look. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and usually a size 4. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs perfect.
5.0,This is sexy and fits just like the picture shows. I have a long torso and lots of times jumpers/rompers dont fit me. But this is long enough from shoulder to the crotch part. Fits well! I highly recommend
5.0,Like the fit!
5.0,Love these! Not tight like leggings but similar feel.
5.0,"The craftsmanship is exquisite. The minute they start making them with amber lenses, I'm buying a second pair."
5.0,"Excelente calidad , hermosos colores"
5.0,"These Heels Above high Heel Protectors are a genius little invention! I like to take pictures, but sometimes it's muddy outside and the heels of my clients sink into the wet dirt which makes their shoes look terrible for a picture. I kept these in my camera case and waited for an opportunity. Just yesterday we were walking to our location and I remembered I had them. I took them out and had my client slip them on. She was really impressed with just the idea of them. She slipped them on and we walked to our desired location. She kept them on during most of the photos because it was grassy. For a few pictures she took them off because she didn't want them to show. Great product! It definitely does it's job and keeps your shoes clean.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."

5.0,"Perfect tee for owners of this majestic breed, they often get a bad name, just as snakes...mine happens to be a service companion. The tee is nice and soft and clear printing. I'll be lookng for more funny sayings related to this breed!"
5.0,"I bought these hedgehog mittens for my wife to wear on her school bus.  My wife and all the school kids love them and ask about them.

5.0,"So what all bigger girls wanna know....hows it fit?<br />Let me start by saying that I LOVE THIS SET!!!! I thought that maybe it would be t shirt thickness...its not. It's not as thick as a fleece or flannel, but thicker than a t. The fabric is soft,...even after washing. OH and washing....I hate to put anything in the dryer got fear it will shrink. I always need ""more"" room, not less. I fluctuate between a 16/18...sometimes 20 depending upon the cut. In shirts a womens xxl....but a basic t shirt that is unisex I wear XL/XXL. So I bought the XXL in this set and hoped for the best. The arms always get me....because I have phat arms. This set fits loose! So I decided to give it the dryer test...no shrinkage! Theres actually room to spare. This isn't a Chinese XXL (if you've ordered online before ya know what I'm talking about ;) .) I think I'm gonna order the XL next to see...when i do I'll update this review."
5.0,Love it! It looks just like the picture and is as promised!
5.0,"I love these!! A must buy, super colorful and perfect fit on my face. You really cant go wrong with this brand. I ordered another pair before and couldn't be happier!  Can't wait to take to Miami!"
5.0,This was a gift. My sister is in California and the stress level is high currently . Not able work etc. She loves it. Just a reminder she's not alone.
5.0,It was fun wearing this shirt to the 80's party.  Worked out perfectly.
5.0,"they are weak plastic. but for 10bucks or so.. its ok, just be careful with them and they look very fresh. I never liked spending too much on glasses anyway bc I always lose them or break them, so these are perfect bc they look nice and I don't have to feel bad when I break them hahaha... I would say just don't give it as a gift to someone you may wanna impress bc they will be able to tell its cheap."

5.0,Fit great and comfortable. Granddaughter very picky and she loves them
5.0,Great hat..Different design and my husband loves it..
5.0,"Love this awesome cute canvas cross-body shoulder bag. The dual design allows me to carry it as a tote or attach longer straps to wear on my shoulder. Durable canvas shell with lots of compartments/ pockets and spacious. This is meant to be a smaller messenger bag to carry books, stationery and other items, not a laptop bag so don't try to stuff one in there. I loved this bag so much, I ordered it in a different color too! I absolutely the love the retro (comic/ anime) appeal look!"
5.0,"I got this to wear with Pirate Garb at a Rennaisance Faire. It worked great, and was much less expensive than buying the same thing on-site at the faire. The quality was much better than I expected for the cost."
5.0,I wore these for my wedding day. They were absolutely perfect! Such a great price for wedding shoes with a pop! Highly recommend!<br /><br />As an added note I did not where the flower clip on mine. Instead my Maid of Honor wore it clipped in her hair. Instead I had shoe clips that matched one I had sewn on to make the sweetheart neckline. It went very well together.
5.0,Absolutely love this purse. Everything i wanted
5.0,Nice Nike Comfortable Shirt !!! It‚Äôs worth every penny and very good for the price. Fits perfectly
5.0,it's pretty comfortable I ordered one size bigger then what I usually wear

5.0,Awesome product and fit great over tennis shoes. Would purchase the product again. If wearing motorcycle boots may want to move a size up for easy slip on.
5.0,"I got exactly what i wanted in this scarf. The color is perfect, the material is soft and easy to wash and iron. Great value and cost."

5.0,"I have a similar but crop sweater from Belle Poque and this one is not as soft. It has the same embroidery though. It is realllly cute.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 130 lbs, 32F and ordered the navy one in size S. It fits me well besides being a bit stretched on the breasts. I‚Äôm keeping it, it‚Äôll probably be my fav this winter due to the cute cherries.<br /><br />The quality of this sweater‚Äôs fabric is the same as Amazon Essential Sweater. Yes, I‚Äôd order a few more if they had other designs (lemons?). The back has no embroidery."
5.0,"I love these, they're super cheap but last quite awhile compared to other cheap nose studs I've purchased in the past."
5.0,Great gift for my God daughter
5.0,Fit very nice as expected. Nice material. Snug but not tight
5.0,Love Helikon products. Great worn underneath their other coats.
5.0,Recently had radiation treatments and this product really helps keep sun off of my neck and very comfortable I would recommend to anyone for protection.
5.0,"This robe was as described...the color is deep navy and did not bleach out in the first wash.  It is light and comfy, so as stated a good travel robe to pack.  My partner is a size L and after washing it did not seem shrink noticeably and still fit well."
5.0,Fun and cuteness for a  Mommy'chef
5.0,Appreciated
5.0,Much higher quality than I expected!
5.0,"These fit my custom watch frame perfectly.  They feel pretty sturdy, unlike some of the other options I evaluated.  I needed one simple problem solved, and these little guys were perfect."
5.0,The long sleeves and the hood with a drawstring really keep you dry.
5.0,"Nice watch, my son wears this quite often. .."
5.0,"I‚Äôm a D cup and these bras work perfect for running, spin class, or any other cardio.. very comfy too."
5.0,"Very good product, as expected.<br />I find myself using it less than I thought, but that is not the product's fault."
5.0,Great duffel! Exactly what I needed for a weekend trip.
5.0,"Pockets!!!!!<br />Seriously fits perfectly, falls to a perfect length and did I mention POCKETS?!?"
5.0,These are pajamas. No way would you wear them out. That being said I love them! They are perfect for a weekend morning of laying around. They are soft and super comfy. I'm 5'6&#34; and 180 lbs. I bought an XXXL when I would normally buy a XXL because I've learned my lesson for foreign clothes. It fits just right. I really like all the color choices. They can be thrown in the washer and dryer which I appreciate. I got them in a very timely manner. I would definitely recommend them.
5.0,Super cute and light weight!! I bought this for holiday photos. It is so stylish and doesnt break the bank!
5.0,Comfortable and cute for VEGAS!!! I have two dresses in this style and they‚Äôre fun to wear on special occasions.
5.0,One of the best purchases online for my LO. It‚Äôs a perfect fit. My LO is small for  she one so based my purchase off other reviews which helped a lot. We got her 6-12mo.
5.0,This is really comfortable and stretchy! I was worried it might be a little big but it fits perfectly and I love the color.
5.0,Very pretty and just as described!
5.0,"I purchased this bra because I was looking for something with more side coverage and lift. This bra does all that, it is a little on the small side but fits well, I bought a couple of Victoria Secret bras but they would ride up in the front when I sat down and looked really awkward. This bra doesn't do that. It is low in the front so if you want to wear things with a v neck the bra doesn't show. It is very pretty and has 6 crystal in the front. The straps stay in place and do not slip down your shoulders which is something I also have a hard time finding in a bra. It has a wide 4 closure band in the back for better stability and doesn't ride up your back. The bra is made of strong quality material and has not stretched out at all like most bras do over time. All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone considering purchasing it [[ASIN:B00WHDXH6W PanDaDa Womens Thick Cup Push up Bra Deep V Massage Concentrated Adjustable Bra]]"
5.0,Good looking shirt. Fits true to size
5.0,True to size and comfortable. Elastic doesn't cut in to your skin.
5.0,"The material used to make this bag is incredibly strong and somewhat stiff lol. It was kind of hard opening and getting things in the first few times, but now it's broken in. Very happy with my purchase. This bag is probably going to be the longest lasting I've ever owned. Definitely recommend."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my best friend for Christmas and she absolutely loved them! They are a little heavy on the ears but the look of them makes up for it all, great product!"
5.0,Every thing is ok look nice and good
5.0,De acuerdo con el tama√±o
5.0,"A little short but it fits well and with some tights, this will be perfect."
5.0,My husband is both big and tall and this is the only brand dress shirt on Amazon that fits him well. We have ordered it in 3 colors and he loves them all. The fabric is not cheap and flimsy either. It irons well and holds up also.
5.0,This dress is great.  I wore it to a 20s theme party and won best dressed. It arrived on time and in appropriate sized packaging (not an oversized cardboard box).  I recommend this item.
5.0,"Perfect dress! I bought this for the presidental inaugural ball. It fits perfectly, there was more detailing than I expected. Threw out the night I had many compliments. I'm 5'6, wear a 36C, size 5 jeans, and med. In tops. I order a size 6, and had 4 inch heels on. I didn't need it altered. The train is long, but I loved it! The next ball I go u will definitely be using this company again!!!!"
5.0,"Quality product, looks and feels nice. Sizing runs a little small so I sized up."
5.0,"Expect a compliment when wearing this dress!  I usually wear it with a long black knitted cardigan and black boots and the rest is history. I'm 5' 3"" with hips and a small waist and it accentuates both. It falls just below my knees.  Great look for work. Love Love love this dress!"
5.0,"This is perfect for dance class.  All the stores had super expensive leotards but this one was priced just right and had a great variety of colors to choose from too.  Fits well, no tags on the back (which is very important to my 4 year old)  My daughter is wearing a 4t and some 5t's and this fit perfect with no sagging in the rear or gaping in the front.  Will be sticking with Capezio products!"
5.0,These sunglasses are not cheap made and come with a little baggie so they dont get scratched! Both 2 different styles and am very pleased with them both!! They are very affordable and they ship to you very quickly!! Highly recommended üôÇüëçüòä
5.0,"It's crepe, not chiffon. Personally, I like crepe better."
5.0,So cute and really great quality. I wore them for a Tropical Retro themed birthday party in Miami and got lots of compliments!
5.0,"Ordered the pink blue and green package and they fit perfectly.  I LOVE the pink as its a bright one, almost neon. I just ordered another 3 pack!"
5.0,I purchased this as a birthday gift for my niece.  It is really cute and functional.  I can‚Äôt wait to gift her with this!
5.0,Bought them as a gift for my niece. She has not taken them off since.
5.0,Love this belt.  I have three in different colors
5.0,"For context: I'm 5'4"", 110 lbs, 32D. My measurements are 31-23-32 in inches (80-58-83 in cm), so I am a bit on the petite side.<br /><br />I really like these camis! They feel a little thin and seem like they wrinkle like crazy, but they‚Äôre incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. They‚Äôre so feather-light that they almost seem to float over my body. I think they‚Äôd look really good to layer under a cardigan or something, which is the way that I‚Äôm planning to wear them. Definitely going to steam the wrinkles out of them first, as they look a bit unkempt right out of the package. That‚Äôs not the fault of the product though; that‚Äôs just how these sorts of fabrics behave. Just as a general note, make sure you‚Äôre up for the upkeep when you purchase clothing items like this!<br /><br />The neckline is pretty flattering and the back has a little bit of elastic. There‚Äôs no additional fabric inside over the breast area that way a lot of camis have, but that hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me thus far. Highly recommend the purchase here!"
5.0,The striped cover up is beautiful and is a comfortable fit.
5.0,It fit perfect! I wore this for my birthday and got lots of compliments
5.0,Soft leather & the rivets don't hurt!
5.0,I loved these glasses
5.0,Great value fits as expected
5.0,I love the back that you don't have a hole in the belt that is specific to your waist size. I use these belts everyday and love it.
5.0,Happy with the comfort of these things. They are not too tight but feel comfortable.
5.0,These are great though I wish they had some other colors. They are nice & warm - help with circulation and are comfy.  I will be buying some more to keep for next year's winter vacation.
5.0,Very soft & warm. My daughter loves them and wants to wear them all the time
5.0,They are great! Perfect!
5.0,Loved it. Fit with some room on top I usually can't buy large it's to tight across my chest. But this too had room it was not clung to my body  would order every color if the color looks good on me
5.0,Absolutely beautiful watch. A great fake with such great quality
5.0,It fell just above the knee. It's cool material for this summer heat is wonderful. I couldn't bear the price of $24.00 for this. Well worth it plus the bonus of upf is great.
5.0,Absolutely love this! Fits really well and is a beautiful print :)
5.0,"Awesome belt! Real leather, thick, and strong with a nice strong buckle. Great for men or women"
5.0,"Nice quality shirt, good fit, fast shipping before christmas!"
5.0,"Love the belt.  Excellent look, high quality.  Works great.  I appreciate this design that  hides the loose end of the belt -- no flapping around, stays out of the way, looks neater.<br />BUT:  I wear 32-waist pants, and the 32-36 belt is barely long enough.  Be sure to get a size long enough."
5.0,"This shirt is so soft, lightweight and comfortable. The vibrant colors are very festive. I will definitely buy the Alvish brand again."
5.0,"What a great deal, love these earrings, all colors"
5.0,"Got this for my son for Christmas, and he loves it!"
5.0,Love the look and fit of this sweater.
5.0,Fit great and excellent quality...
5.0,"Fit well, very warm and stylish."
5.0,"Just as described,,have had on my phone for 4 months and no problems"
5.0,"Love this the dye top! It has a bit of stretch to it but not a lot and it's pretty soft...I was comfortable all day in it. I'm 5'10"" and 165lbs so I purchased a large.It's very form fitting but I do feel it's TTS."
5.0,"I love my earrings! They are so beautiful!! They sparkle so much and will not let you down. Easy to put in, they stay put without needing adjusting, and easy to take out. Plus they come in an adorable pink clam jewelry box üòä!"
5.0,Bought for gift. Super cute!
5.0,I ordered these gloves hoping for leather gloves that fit nice and keep my hands warm while biking in the cold. These gloves did the job perfectly and have the added bonus of being touch screen. The touch screen could be slightly better but overall fantastic gloves.
5.0,I‚Äôm normally a size large (36DD chest and 5‚Äô7‚Äù) fits as expected and is long enough and fitted without being tight. Soft fabric. I suspect the shirt needs to be washed in cold and inside out to hold the print. I have the pink color - it‚Äôs cute. Neck is not tight and I can see my 16‚Äù necklace.
5.0,"I love these pants, I need new work pants and with the pandemic I had to shop online. These are soft, they fit great and look great. I ordered the 30 inch inseam because I am on the shorter side (5'0"") and they were perfect, I didn't have to alter them at all! Definitely will order these again!"
5.0,"Love it, the inside is really soft!"
5.0,I can‚Äôt stand workout tops that are super tight and binding. This one is just right and gives great support without squishing every part of me  Definitely recommend
5.0,"This dress is very flattering; the pattern really helps to shrink the waist. It‚Äôs not too clingy and the fabric is a great summer weight. I have dressed it up with a little jacket for work and also worn it casual, with flip flops, while attending a summer festival."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:dd3cc7cae932f83713948cff6a50a1c5]] Literally it has the right amount of room I wanted for some sweatpants. I need room for my butt and these have breathing room! It‚Äôs very reflective for direct light but the material feels like it can sustain sweat so it‚Äôs everything I need and more. And pro tip , if you want to make the top a crop top , tuck the bottom into the undercuff of your bra to where it won‚Äôt untuck and move. Good luck ladies"
5.0,Fit perfect great color to match my skin tone.
5.0,My daughter is 3ft 3 inches...weighs 33 lbs. We bought the size 4 and it was too small so we returned them.  (She normally wears a 3T so these def run small)  We loved the quality of these jammies and my daughter is loco for coco so we ordered the 5.  They are great!  Long enough in the body and the sleeves.  Attached is a pic is of the size 5 shirt on her.
5.0,The fit is perfect! It is comfortable and keeps the girls in place during my high impact workout..
5.0,Got this for my sons dress up day and it was fun. A little hard to breathe cause it‚Äôs thick but he thought it was super funny
5.0,Very good product. Comfortable and matches with everything üòÅ
5.0,Amazing fit and excellent fabric! Love PattyBoutik!
5.0,this suit fits well and washes well. I do fitness challenges and used this suit for pictures and I really like the appeal the suit offers.
5.0,great! I got it for a gift
5.0,Absolutely amazing. I have a black and brown pair. And both those are great.
5.0,The fit and adjustable straps were perfect. I especially like the carbon filter and wash ability.
5.0,These are great earrings. I have several pairs and given many as gifts. They are very light weight and much prettier then the photos. Everyone I have given them to love them and they are made in CO so a bonus for me!
5.0,"I bought these because I have a pair of Costa Del Mar Permits with the large glass lenses. They are great glasses and optics but they are a little hefty and tend to fall down on my nose especially when walking. No amount of tweaking the frame kept these up on my nose and the traditional cord retainer seems a little much for the daily on and off use I put them through. The Reax works perfectly as I can either put them on without hooking them behind the ear or do two quick finger swipes and they are locked in behind the ear. Either way the glasses stay put and are still super comfortable. In fact they are more comfortable with the Croakies since you aren't subconsciously using your face muscles all the time to keep them from sliding down. I'm very pleased with this product and it's the only one of it's kind I've found. The Reax hasn't budged since I slide them on so for me it's been plug and play, and I'm super happy I can support a Jackson Hole company at the same time. If you have any issues with like mine I would definitely give them a try. I'll be picking up several more sets."
5.0,"I was just looking for a sturdy, every-day belt that was better than the so-called ""genuine leather"" belts I had always bought at box stores.  A buddy of mine told me about this brand so I took a gamble and got this belt.  Immediately after putting it on, I noticed a big difference.  So much more comfortable and securely holds your pants up without any give, bending or bowing of the belt.<br /><br />My only nit-pick would be the buckle.  The roller in the buckle jingles pretty loudly when you're putting your pants on/off.  Once you're buckled in, it is all quiet and secure.  You can change out the buckle thanks to the ""Chicago screws"" used to hold the belt together.  I tried replacing the buckle with a slider buckle that would latch the belt from the front, but due to the thickness of the belt, it was a little awkward to buckle in.  The buckle would also sit at a weird angle and not look very neat."
5.0,I have bought a few bracelets from this Brand and have been impressed with the quality.
5.0,Bought to give to homeless for a mission project.
5.0,Just the right size for my Fossil tri fold. The insert that came with it finally wore out. This has the right number of slots for my uses.
5.0,Enjoying the time savings. Works as advertised and makes my life easier. It's a Sekonic. I use it in a studio setting and works great. Wish it came with a plastic/rubber casing instead of the leather case.
5.0,I love how soft the material is. They are very comfortable and the fabric is cool.  I wear a med and they fit perfectly!
5.0,Great and actually comfortable to wear
5.0,Shirts are well made and a perfect fit. My grandson loves them. I waged them and their was no shrinkage or fading. I would purchase again.
5.0,Beautiful. Everyone loves it.
5.0,Omg I love this necklace. I ordered it for Dia de los Muertos event. It was perfect. I had many compliments. It‚Äôs not really heavy. I actually forgot I even had it on. Definitely recommend.
5.0,I like the product design the way they fit they‚Äôre comfortable and I have no regrets
5.0,Wore it more than once thru the season loved it. Seems durable. Machine washed more than once as well. All is well with this well made inexpensive blouse.
5.0,Perfect winter holiday scarf.
5.0,"This is a great automatic watch under $100. the bezel is very easy to turn not like some review I've read. My 6 yrs old daughter was able to do it with her little thumb and index fingers, however, the bezel does feel a bit flimsy. The time keeping is spot on. I've read some reviews saying that it's 5 seconds more or less. Well, unless you're a commando leader or a nuclear rocket launcher then that few seconds count. Most of us just take a quick glance to tell the time, and it's quite accurate since automatic movement is from Seiko. I don't like to gold band, too much of a pimp or Tony Sopranos gang, so I take the bling down a notch and switch it with my silicone band instead, beside the gold band is very difficult to take off.  The luminous is so so, you still can tell the time a few hours after the light is turned off.  If you want really good luminous watch, may I suggest Orient Mako or Seiko diver watches. Their luminous watches shine the whole night."
5.0,For my son. Woks just as described. Amazing for the price.
5.0,"Love this back pack. Perfect for my baby girl. Especially for when I just run to Walmart, I don‚Äôt have to take the big diaper bag."

5.0,Little snug if you have hair
5.0,"I'm 5'1, size 16, with 40G breasts, so i'm short, chubby, and curvy and i ADORE skater dresses.  This dress fits all of my curves while leaving room to maneuver in it.  It's not tight and not too flowy, fits just right. I ordered an XL and it fits like a dream: above the knee (about mid thigh), loose around my entire body and loose around my arms.  I'm definitely ordering more colors"

5.0,"Just received the Mala Prayer Beads in  the Smoky Quartz.  Love, Love, Love them. They are very much like the picture, except my larger barrel shaped bead is more on the rust side.  It has a nice weight, beads are smooth and shiny and it fits my 71/2 wrist just right (just enough room to move freely, but not too lose nor tight."
5.0,Very cute but every big
5.0,It was a birthday present for my grand daughter. She loved the gift very much.

5.0,First time customer from this company.Great quality tunnels that look just like the picture.Came beautifully packaged.I will purchase from this company again 5 stars
5.0,Good fit.  Good quality material.
5.0,"For less than $25, this necklace is very well made and attractive. Since it's plated I'm not sure if it will hold up to humidity over time, but I am hopeful it will. This would make a great gift for a mom or daughter. My wife and daughter both have August birthdays, so it was a perfect gift for my wife. I wish they also offered it in a silver colorway for the women who prefer silver over gold."

5.0,Cute bolero jacket.
5.0,Works well for all my daughters dance stuff
5.0,"I purchased this style of boot in 2014.  I just loved these ""super light"" boots.  They're lighter than slippers.  I work in the yard a lot during the winter and these boots made it so easy for me to get around in.  I'm looking for another pair!"
5.0,I love these shorts. They are super soft and comfortable. They are lose and not restraining at all. I ended up buying a second pair for my daughter.
5.0,The design and build quality of this product is top notch.  Compared to others at the same price point this comes with accessories that in others would cost extra. This is an excellent investment and I was debating on buying considering the fact I have carried a wallet for so long.  I'm definitely not disappointed in my purchase and I have also shown this to someone who has the Ridge wallet who says that mine is better.... I agree.
5.0,Great  bra very comfortable  the sizing  does run small  so order a size up. Love the bra !!  Great seller  will but more

5.0,"This is a very pretty pink dragonfly pendant/necklace. The colors are bright and shiny. This product comes in many different colors; all of which are very attractive. I get daily compliments on them as I can wear them with all my different colors/hues of clothing. The item came very well packaged. All of my purchases with this company have come on time with this one exception. However, when I wrote to the company to advise the item was late, I was pleasantly surprised that Amazon contacted me immediately and refunded my handling/shipping fees. I am extremely pleased with the speed and actions taken with this transaction. I recommend this company and Amazon to everyone."
5.0,Incredibly soft!!!

5.0,I don't think I can say much more so here's a haiku<br /><br />tiny joy con strap<br />can slide effortlessly on<br />dk smash is best
5.0,Great for decor.
5.0,This product is great. I love earrings and I am never able to find any pretty ones that don't make my ear lobes swell!<br /><br />These earrings are great because they come in multiple colors so I can switch them up and still be cute and elegant depending on the situation.<br /><br />A great feature is the screw on ball back. It's makes them all of the more comfortable with out having the pokey stabby feeling that some earrings give you when you don't take them out for bed.<br /><br />I also put a set on my 3 year old daughter and she hasn't lost them yet!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:847d4933201e3130a758a8308617dd3b]] I love it!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá∫

5.0,Was great for the price for my daughter to wear to the daddy daughter dance.
5.0,"This Bag is everything described here and more. Genuine leather, correct dimensions, beautiful blue hue and Great Quality!! The only con would be the shoulder strap that I'll probably never use. The zipper are nice and glide open and close smoothly. This bag is a steal for the price. So if you have been thinking about getting one then hesitate no more. üëç"
5.0,I like the ease of changing the wristband. My other band was a light color and I was going on a 5 day backpacking trip so. I wanted a darker color. It is soft and very comfortable.

5.0,It has stretched a bit over time.
5.0,"Love them, solid and look great."
5.0,These fit my 4 and 7 year old very well. Super sturdy and so far they have not scratched off the mirror finish. Very important to protect little eyes from sun damage. I work in eye care and 80% of damage occurs before the age of 18. The sun damages eyes just like it does to skin. Protect those beautiful crystal clear lenses inside their eyes!! UV protection yall!!!
5.0,"Lovely and delicate sterling silver arrow necklace.  It arrived promptly, was  beautifully package and perfect."
5.0,These replacement nose pads fit perfectly and were very easy to install.  Great product!
5.0,This pair was for my girlfriend she loves them.
5.0,"This is really a well-made bracelet. I like its weight and style.<br /><br />This bracelet comes without any snaps and is intended to be used with snaps. A snap is a  decorative button that snaps onto the face of this bracelet. Without a snap, this bracelet does look ok, but it is definitely enhanced with a snap.<br /><br />I also bought &#34;Souarts Mixed Random Snap Button Jewelry Charms&#34; on Amazon for $8. It's a pack of ten snaps and they work great with this bracelet.<br /><br />It is very adjustable. A toggle pin fits into multiple loops located at the end of the bracelet. I found no trouble finding the size I wanted for my wrist.<br /><br />I purchased this bracelet at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Nice quality shirt. Love Montgomery Gentry.

5.0,Nice gloves fits perfect
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT, THE FIT IS WONDERFUL IM 5'2 42DDD I ORDERED A XL..THE LENGTH IS WONDERFUL IT COMES OFF THE SHOULDER JUST RIGHT..."
5.0,I call impractical shoes like this &#34;movie theater&#34; shoes because you need to wear them where you'll be mostly sitting. üòÄ That said these are much more comfortable than most shoes like it. I could dance for at least a few songs in these! I took a chance based on reviews and price and love them! I am a big girl with big feet and was happy to find size 11!! üòÄüëç
5.0,Belt fit great and came as expected. Definitely worth the purchase

5.0,Para el reloj
5.0,The message is totally inspirational!
5.0,"The toe box was tight around my foot, but I wore them around the house for a week and now they're perfect!  I expected this because they are my second pair.  I bought my first pair at a TJMaxx store one day when the shoes I had on started to rub my heels too much.  I've never had a problem with rubbing or blisters with these.  They're so easy to wear and so sexy!  Believe it or not, they stay put comfortably and do not flip or flop.  This is my amazing everything shoe!  Just hold out for a week or so to break them in- you won't be disappointed."
5.0,I love the üëû but haven't really wond them yets.<br />Will be Tomorrow maybe...
5.0,"Good quality, fair price."
5.0,"These shoes are so cute and very comfortable.  I usually wear size 6-1/2, but when I ordered them this size, they were a little big.  They still look very nice with sun dresses or shorts.  I plan to buy them in a different color and size 6."
5.0,"This sweater is super cute, but most of all, it‚Äôs amazingly soft and comfortable. It‚Äôs not too hot and not too cold, it‚Äôs perfect. It holds up really well in the wash (just do it on delicates and don‚Äôt put it in the dryer). I also like that it doesn‚Äôt have any itchy tags so it truly is really comfortable. Overall, this sweater is perfect for fall weather!"

Great ventilation makes it easy to breath through, and the design also makes you look pretty cool wearing it. Fantastic product that fit about as expected."
5.0,"Bought this Versa 2 watchband set because I work out. so, I sweat and these woven cloth watchbands are comfortable, durable and washable."

5.0,Great hat!  Fits perfectly and doesn't feel or look cheap
5.0,"My young sister wanted a wolf like animal hood for christmas. It was hard to find what she was requesting so found this one on amazon and was delighted. Order it, came in time, and was wrapped for christmas. My sister unwrapped it and her face was full of excitement and was better than she requested. I even was please with it as well. I think it is better made than the ones i saw in the stores. She loved it and it looks so cute. Very soft/fluffy and the colors are just awesome looking."
5.0,I am a medium in most tops 34DD I got this in a large and it‚Äôs a good fit! I will probably order a medium next time these tops look great give good support and do not roll up. I have 2 already and will definitely order more!
5.0,was absolutely gorgeous and packaged beautifully- gave as a gift and she loved it
5.0,"I love theses socks! VERY comfortable. Fit is good and not too tight. I just hope they don‚Äôt shrink too much.<br />If they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll buy more."
5.0,Thanks for the nice deal
5.0,"One major problem for me:  They were too large; and, I was unable to wear them without their falling off. . .However, they are excellent sunglasses (though possible too &#34;dark&#34; for some persons' comfort). . ."
5.0,The purple was a little lighter than expected.  Beauitful dress for the price.  Received many compliments .  Would suggest to my friends.

5.0,All 4 aprons are very good quality and very pretty!! What a great deal these were! Thank you!!!
5.0,"This arrived in good shape in a timely fashion.  The color is perfect - the color of the sea.<br /><br />The image has some swirls - which I was hoping for - however mine is fairly solid with a satin finish.  Still lovely, but if that is important to you be aware.  This is a good fit for a small/medium bone structure.  If you have very big hands you may have an issue.  If so, it will make a great gift for a friend!"
5.0,"Is very pretty,very delicate and elegant."
5.0,Super soft material.. with it being soft I expected constant wedgies but that's not the case at all! The colors are also very nice! Might be getting another pack with different colors
5.0,"This purse is the cutest. I love it so much! The ruffles make it so unique and different and girly! The only negative I have to say is the inside lining of the purse is very ""loose"", it's almost like there is too much material and my items get lost in it. Otherwise it's PERFECT!!!!!"
5.0,"This shirt gives me so much confidence. You‚Äôll get so many compliments on it, it will almost get annoying."
5.0,Bought these for my parents in their mid fifties and they're in love. They take them everywhere.
5.0,"cute, perfect fit for my 2 year old"
5.0,Super comfortable and true to size! Normal bra size I wear a 38D and ordered a large which is great! Only thing I notice as a flaw is the white sports bra you can see the padding through the material but it's removanable and still has great structure.
5.0,Favorite shades! Good design. Comes with case which I appreciate and cleaning cloth.
5.0,I really like the color and texture.
5.0,"These are some of the most comfortable yoga pants ever. I highly recommend them. Besides comfort, they are attractive and stylish. Good job, Amazon, for carrying these - smart move."
5.0,Very beautiful and I love it.
5.0,"I used these for seed bead bracelets as gifts and everyone thought they were adorable! I think they work best with smaller beads, just my opinion :)"
5.0,"I didn't think that I would like this product. The sandals that I usually buy, I could not find. I was wrong. These sandals are the most comfortable  sandals that I have worn in a long time. Good buy for me. I would buy them again."
5.0,"Really nice feel to this one.  Fits as Lands End should, perfectly!"
5.0,I get lots of compliments on these boots! They are comfortable and durable. I highly recommend them; they are a great purchase!
5.0,"This big is just large enough to hold all my essentials plus a few extras. I bought it primarily to be the bag I use when I vacation because it can be used as both a shoulder bag or a crosdbody, and I've ended up using it all the time as an oversized wallet. I keep money and credit cards, a few pieces of makeup, a container with a few doses of prescriptions, a comb, keys, my larger sized Note 5 phone, and there's room to spare. I put it in my larger hobo purse when I'm out and about and if I go to the grocery store I just take this and leave the hobo in the car. It's lightweight and easy to carry.<br /><br />I love this so much I came back and ordered a 2nd in a different color. My lipstick opened in the first and made a huge mess. There were oily heavily pigmented stains everywhere, and I didn't notice it for days so it was really ground in. Then the new one arrived and I put the stained one aside for a week because I didn't know what to do with it but i didn't want to throw it away. It was still in good shape except for the staining, so I decided to liberally apply Dawn to the stain and hand wash it. It took 2 times, but every single stain stain came out. I really put this bag to the test, and it looks fantastic."
5.0,Love the baby shoes got the white and pink pairs both are a little big but my granddaughter will grow into them its ok
5.0,Bought this hat for my husband who just loves it! So incredibly warm!
5.0,Added to my bracelet. Perfect for me.
5.0,Super comfortable sweatshirt!
5.0,"My daughter is EXTREMELY allergic to any and all metal earrings.  I read a few reviews about these earrings because her ears wouldn't heal after having them pierced a second time.  Well, these worked perfectly.  Her ears don't hurt,  and she actually learned to take her earrings out which she couldn't and wouldn't do before because of fear and associated pain.--- Update as of 10/19, my daughter's ears got infected and her holes closed.  The earrings worked great for 3 months but her allergies won in the end. Sigh."
5.0,"I read the size chart and ordered 1 size up. I usually wear a large (us dress size 10), but I got the XL and it's so perfect. It looks fantastic, fits me like a glove, is comfortable, and everyone I saw the night I wore it complimented me on my gorgeous dress."
5.0,"I'm a size 14 in jeans xl was perfect for me. So comfortable and it doesn't do that stretch out thing jeans do, where it's perfect out of the washe then it starts to sag. These are awesome!"
5.0,I love the quality of this product! It is well made and it holds up to my metal smithing/jewelry making. Thanks!!
5.0,Great fabrics and fits as expexted
5.0,"This tights are nice quality and are a good weight.  They're size 4-6x, but they fit my daughter who wears a size 3T perfectly and will likely fit her through size 4.  They are quite a bit smaller than other 4-6x tights we have that fit my daughter who wears a 6x-7.  So you may want to size up with these tights to ensure a good fit."
5.0,A quality hat delivered promptly
5.0,"I know these are made for soccer but I wear them with my cowboy boots.  I have a little too much ""heel slip"" in my boots and the rubber dots fix that!  I only wear these now instead of regular socks.  The added advantage is they are high enough on my leg that they stop any chafing from the top of the boot rubbing against my shin.  Great product - even though I don't wear them for what they are designed for!"
5.0,Loveeeee this top! A bit see through but nothing some nipple covers cant handle!
5.0,Really pretty you can wear it casual or dress it up! Have no negatives on this top.
5.0,"I've had some bad experiences with purchasing ties on Amazon but this was not one! The shipping was ridiculously slow, but worth the wsit! The quality is nice, and the tie is as pictured. I would definitely purchase again without hesitation."
5.0,"So, finding size 17 men's dress shoes that are nice looking and won't break the bank is almost impossible to do; but these shoes fit the bill!  They have nonslip grips and because they were ordered on Prime Wardrobe, I can try them without worrying about fit, and they fit true to size very comfortably."
5.0,Bought these to wear flying overseas. These are comfy and I ended up wearing them walking around on vacation. Thrilled to have something compression that isn't a knee- high.
5.0,She absolutely loves these! They are everyday wear.
5.0,They were really good for the price and very good quality true to the picture and true to the size I liked them a lot
5.0,Really comfortable and great touch screen compatibility! Great fit as well.
5.0,"Bright colors!  Washable!  The bags, themselves, are extremely lightweight; however, they are STRONG with ample room for lots of groceries!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
5.0,"always love their shirts and seller here compares pretty well with price to buy direct. For me in what i do daily this sure works well and my cats love the shirt as well as the others like it. thanks for that, was kinda the reason for it all but was not sure how it would feel. On human side even if you dont have cats it is just a way cool shirt.<br />Also all psychics or as you may see them psychos should own one grin. aka lol to usa eh"
5.0,Love it! Fits and looks great. I will buy from them again.
5.0,"I am super happy with these overalls. super comfy. I didn't know what size to order. I normally wear a Size 4 or sometimes a size 6, depending on the make of the clothes. i am 5'4 and about 130 lbs. I ordered a Medium and they fit just right. a bit loose, not tight , not form fitting and i wanted them loose. first pair I ordered through another seller, I had to return, they were too tight.<br />These r super comfy. And came in 2 days, ([prime), which I love. Some other sellers, don't provide 2 day shipping. Not sure why.<br />LOVE them. Thanks. :)"
5.0,Fit her perfectly and she looked great.
5.0,"I got this as an anniversary present for my wife.  It arrived on time and excellently packaged.  Even better, it looks awesome, my wife loves it.  Highly recommend."

5.0,Super cute bracelet.
5.0,I needed a small wallet and it is exactly what I needed.
5.0,Not meant for petite girls.
5.0,"We already have several packing cubes with some being able to compress. I got this pack for my camping close. I'm always tossing my stuff in a ruck and then scrounging around in the dark looking for my sleep wear. And with camping, space matters.<br />The set I received came in black rather than the teal that is shown. I would have been okay with either color. The zipper pulls are nice size. They move easily around the cubes. I had no problems getting my socks and tees loaded and pressed in.<br />I really like the window on the larger pack. I think the smaller pack would benefit from the same feature.<br />One thing that I did notice when using these packs is that the zippers make a considerable amount of noise. Maybe not a big deal now, but in the middle of the night, everything always seem louder. I would have like the zipper pulls to be coated in plastic. I may just have to do that myself with some plastidip.<br />Other than those minor observations, these things work great. If you were using these for travel, you might need a second set."
5.0,Nice tools
5.0,Stylish and Cheap.
5.0,"I like the triple fabric and it feel smooth and nice against my face. The adjustable nose piece and ear loops make it comfortable, even for long travel days. I like having the gold and silver option which pairs with my jewelry of the day."
5.0,So much nicer than I expected. Will be ordering another in a smaller size for my ring finger. I love it!!
5.0,It's amazing !! Simply...
5.0,fits nice and keeps you in place
5.0,The socks didn't slide down my leg.... I recommend these socks.
5.0,These never slid and the colors were muted/bright enough to match what i was wearing. They were comfortable as well! Im sad theyre no longer available I bought these so long ago I just came back to get more.
5.0,Loved the bracelets. Perfect addition to finish off our 1 yr anniversary with each other. It definitely made him smile so that was awesome.

5.0,My youngest son died and I came across this item.  Not sure what to expect but the day I got it I knew it was the best choice to carry a part of my son with me everyday for the rest of my life.  My nephew want some of my son's ashes and I ordered another for his favorite cousin to have with him as well.  The heart arrived before it was suppose to so a 10 on the shipping and a 10 on the quality and a 10 on the many choices to choose from.  Thank you  &#34;PERFECT MEMORIALS&#34; for helping me with my son.
5.0,Bought these for my three year old son. Fits a bit snug around the waste compared to others. Doesnt seem to bother him or leave marks on his waist so not a big issue. Looks wonderful and overall happy with this purchase!
5.0,Perfect over my sport top for jogging when it‚Äôs warm!
5.0,"They are very comfortable!!! Extremely comfortable!!! My only issue is that they are VERY narrow!! And I have a thin to medium size foot. So i would order &#34;E, EE or EEE&#34; the next time. Its almost like the width was designed for a thin woman's foot. My feet appear extremely swollen when I'm all laced up. But despite the swollen appearance...... My feet are soooo comfortable in these runners!!! So I'm not gonna hate!! I give them a rating of 5 stars for comfort :o))!!<br />Oh yeah..., I'd also order a half size larger!!! the little bit of extra room would have been perfect ;o))<br />Steve"
5.0,I ordered the salmon color and it's perfect! flowy and not too short (I'm 5'5 and size small).  The salmon color is a peachy pink and perfect for the summer!
5.0,"Very cute. Small, but strong."
5.0,"The dice are quality and just a bit of weight. Chain is a little short to dangle from my mirror, so I attached a zip tie and hair tie to them. Dangle just right. The glare from the sun is annoying, but well worth my overall asthethic happiness!"
5.0,Very soft and warm.  I can wear as a scarf or put over my head if needed.
5.0,I am a Peppers girl through and through. The only sunglasses I own and wear.

5.0,Great shoe thanks
5.0,Perfect for the glass eyes I make!
5.0,"I've had this in my ear for 5 months now. I was afraid the color may irritate me, but it doesn't. I have sensitive skin on a good day, so I recommend this if you want some spice in your daith!"
5.0,Esta muy bonita me quedo perfecta
5.0,This watch reminds me so much of my childhood. I wanted to get a cheap (&lt;$10) watch that I could use when travelling and to the gym and this fits the bill perfectly. Bonus! The watch also has a little side light which allows you to check it in the dark.
5.0,"Great, very pretty dress. I got a size small, 130 lbs, 5'2&#34; the only thing was the slit being high up. If you are going to a formal event I would pin it or sew it just in case it was to open while walking."
5.0,Very flattering and comfortable. Fit perfectly!
5.0,"I am so pleased that I did not buy the large dress. This is a modest dress! I will need it taken up on the top, but that is only because I am Tinkerbell figured! It is comfortable and well made!"
5.0,"The design and build quality is great.  It‚Äôs a little wide and too busy for my personal taste but it works well and comes exactly as described.  I personally like the black and silver look better than all this bling, but I mean each person‚Äôs taste in jewelry and accessories is different, so if you like this color scheme then go for it - it‚Äôs a decent watch band."
5.0,"Very nice cotton socks, wash up great!"
5.0,"I usually order a small in the loosely fitting tops, but based on recommendations made in the reviews I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly and looks great when I wear it with my mini pencil skirt. I'm 5'8&#34; and 145 lbs."
5.0,It‚Äôs a keychain alright.
5.0,"Easy to wear, washable numerous times without fading or fraying. Nice to display the MB logo."
5.0,"Super comfy material; it looked a bit pajama-ish upon taking it out of package, but looked super cute on."
5.0,The pants are very comfortable. Fits as expected
5.0,I liked the size especially!  It's probably an. inch or so long but just enough for me! Beautifully made.
5.0,"Great fit, feels nice and of great quality. It's been washed several times and hasnt changed color or size or showed signs of wear. Great purchase"
5.0,Well made...very nice! A staple accessory for me.
5.0,"I was skeptical about the product but once it came in and on time I should add, I had my son try it on and it works perfectly! Amazing product can‚Äôt wait for him to use at my daughters fifteenth birthday."
5.0,"I love these nose studs! For 10 different colored pairs, the price is really cheap in my opinion and the quality of the studs are very well made. The studs were safely delivered with no damage. They were sealed in a plastic baggy inside a box which was inside a small ziploc bag and shipped in a bubble envelope. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Beautiful. Just a bit snug around the waist for me. I still wore it zipped down a bit and got mega compliments. Wish it came in an XL and other patterns.
5.0,They fit great feel good fast shipping cheap price. Can't go wrong

5.0,"My 4 grandson is a big fan of Hulk Smash. He absolutely loves this jacket. It‚Äôs not thick enough to wear as a coat, but more like a perfect sweatshirt to go over a shirt on a cool day/night."
5.0,This is an old style belt now back to update your style.  I had this belt back in the 70's and now it was old and dusty and rusty and<br />I was so pleased to see amazon had this belt now I can put the old belt to rest .  My new belt was sent on time and package well. I like to thank the seller for carring this style belt. History does repeat its self  in fashion.

5.0,"Very nice colors, my wife loves it."
5.0,Mi bonito y a muy buen precio de acuerdo a la calidad. Casi lo pierdo porque el mensajero lo dej√≥ tirado junto a otros paquetes en la entrada del edificio y un vecino me lo rescat√≥ casi por milagro. Espero me traiga milagros tambi√©n por su forma de llegar a mi.
5.0,Gorgeous came beautifully packaged

5.0,My son loved the shirt although it seemed somewhat small on him.
5.0,Excelente! ! ! üëçüëçüëèüëè
5.0,"Nice classic classy dress. Great value. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 120 pounds and ordered the Medium. Fits perfectly.<br />Bought it for a summer wedding reception but it is a bit heavy for the season but definitely still keeping this beautiful dress for a fall, winter or spring event.<br />I am 50+ and it is a very flattering dress. Bought the black but considering ordering the green velvet for the holiday season.<br />It fits me perfectly but if over 130 lbs. would order a large."
5.0,"I really like them . They were too large before washing, but it said they shrink. After washing they fit better. I'm a 14, I bought XL. I would get the large next time."
5.0,"I purchased this shirt for a friend who wears an XL.  I ordered an XL, but it appeared small when I got it.  I wear a M, and it fit perfect.  When ordering, order a larger size.  Love this shirt!"
5.0,"Color brillante muy lindo, debe colocar pantal√≥n debajo ya que tiene aberturas."

5.0,Good legnth for Nike SB shoes
5.0,Extremely comfortable. I have them in 2 different colors
5.0,Feel great.  Does great job at moisture wicking.
5.0,Great designs.
5.0,Have never seen earrings shaped like a necktie before‚Ä¶very unusual.  Lightweight and delicate.  The mix of different shades of blue is pleasing and attractive.  Well made. The three panels on each earring add additional interest as they move.  They came with attached backings on the ear wires‚Ä¶a welcome feature for those who frequently lose earrings when they work their way loose and fall out.  Makes a nice gift.
5.0,I love my new keychain!
5.0,Great shirt at great price
5.0,"This dress fits wonderfully, is extremely comfortable and flows very nicely! Great dress for just about any occasion! They should offer this in many more floral prints, etc - excellent dress for the price!"
5.0,Perfect for my 4 year olds Dinosaur party!
5.0,"I wear pearls every day to work; I like this necklace, pearls are small but bright and the clasp is steady."
5.0,My April birthstone is so shiny and sparkley!  I love the little stars on this too.  I am very pleased with how pretty this bracelet is!
5.0,I am in LOVE with this shoe! I got a size 9 and it is true to size - I'm an 8.5 in closed heels and a 9 in heeled sandals. The shoe is very well made and you can see from the pictures in my review how much care they took to protect the shoe and gems while it shipped. I bought these shoes to wear with a red dress I bought from Amazon but ended up returning. I decided to still keep the shoes because they are just so beautiful. They included extra rubber for the heel and a couple extra small rhinestones. The heel is about 5 inches but they are quite easy to walk in and as comfortable as a 5 inch heel could be. I imagine I could wear these for 1 maybe 2 hours before my feet start to get sore which is great in my opinion. Amazing amazing shoe and only $40!!! A must buy!
5.0,Works like a mask. üò∑
5.0,"These are cute little studs and for the price they can't be beat.  I purchased a 4 mm earrings, and each one looks about the perfect size for a child's ears.  The colors are distinctive and each item is individually packaged.  These are being purchased as a gift, so I don't know how they will be for hypoallergenic issues, but I'm sure the little girls mom will let me know. I will update my review if they have trouble.<br /><br /> You can see from the pictures, that each a set of earrings is individually packaged. This could be good for giftgiving because people may think you're spending more for them, but it might be strange because they're separated so much.  You would have to look at the photos and decide if that's something you want showing up on someone's doorstep.<br /><br /> On an aside, these came in a small velvet bag. This has the potential to be good for gifting, but the paint was worn off the bag which made it look a little secondhand. I'm not sure I would want to give that as a gift to someone. Now, since this review is for the earrings and not the packaging I didn't market down for that, but I do think it's worth mentioning."
5.0,I really like this watch. Very easy to adjust the band to my wrist size. I like the low profile sleekness of its design.
5.0,as advertised! fast delivery!
5.0,The button down shirt was thinner than expected but perfect for summer. It is lightweight and the colors contrast each other well.<br /><br />The shirt fit is standard size even after washing multiple times. I had no issues with the stitching/quality and overall it is a good shirt to add to my collection.
5.0,Got it for my gf for Christmas. Fit her perfect and said it was very comfortable and soft.
5.0,I just put these on and absolutely love them!  The material is excellent quality.
5.0,"These Lou Keith women's leggings are one of the most comfortable pair of leggings that I own.  They're black and have the ripped look down the leg's.  They're easy to put on and wash and dry well.  No, fading has occurred as of yet.  They're in fashion right now and can be a great staple in your wardrobe.  They are in mine.  I can pair them with so many things that I get to wear them a lot. Made of good quality material and for a amazing price.  My favorite outfit with them is my leopard print shoes and white long sleeve shirt with leopard sleeves.  They look amazing all together."
5.0,"love this! arrived a little messy from the glow stuff being all over, but it rubbed off and shined up nicely. It's a delicate pretty necklace, with a special kick when the lights go out lol"
5.0,So cute!!  Love it!!
5.0,I love this fabric.  These pajamas immediately became my favorites.  And I love the fact that they ALMOST look like an outfit!  I don't feel weird wearing these outside to get my dog when she decides she doesn't want to come in. Better this than my robe!  These are great for lounging around the house or spending hours in my craft room.  I bought another pair already!
5.0,Love it absolutely perfect!!
5.0,I bought these to make dusting easier and they‚Äôre fantastic! I just toss them in the wash and they come out perfectly clean and soft. They‚Äôre good for baseboards
5.0,Very long. I am 5‚Äô 5‚Äù and it is very long on me.
5.0,Love the fit! Oh
5.0,"Cool item for the price, very satisfied"
5.0,"Love the straight leg Jag Jeans, wish the boot cut came in short length too."
5.0,Very nice to keep pictures or credit cards in.
5.0,"Love it!  This was on a special deal, so I only paid $49 for it.  The C alone is worth that.  I put it on my chain because the chain it came on was too thin and flimsy."
5.0,the iteams were just beautiful
5.0,Wear them every day<br />I own three pairs<br />I'll own more soon<br />Omg
5.0,These are wonderful glasses! I got then for my terezi cosplay as did many others. My only concern is that the fact that its purple ruins the concept i got then anyway however. I dont mind at all!
5.0,Beautiful watch with a good price!
5.0,"Loved the pink! I wore this on a trip to Panama and loved it so much I ordered another one in another color for my trip to the DR LOL. It's super cute, comfortable and sexy. I modified it a little by cutting the front stitch that holds it ""closed"". I also didn't like the open billowing look on the sleeves, so I tied and tucked them in and Viola! I was ready baby LOL.<br />For reference I'm 5ft 3in, weigh 142 and have an athletic build. A small fit me perfectly."
5.0,Beautiful closely knit material flows much better than the netting-type super lightweight material you find in big box fabric stores. The edging is also professionally done and looks great. The comb is plastic but this is still a great value.
5.0,"Very nice, more dressy than I thought they were but good to have."
5.0,these actually fit my foot - I wear a size 6.5 and usually the heel on socks winds up on my ankle - not these - they fit perfect and provide support the is sufficient so my legs feel great at the end of a shift.
5.0,Nicely fit!
5.0,Just as pictured. I LOVE the saying and pinky swear is fantastic added touch.Shipping was much faster then expected. I cant wait for my daughter to open on her 16th birthday!  She has ABSOLUTELY no idea she is getting a car. Times are tough but family all came together to bless her w much deserved gift
5.0,"Granddaughter who is ill, loves these and wears them all of the time.  They are very well made and wash up nicely.  Thank you.  I will buy more of these in the future.. Recommended."
5.0,"Cute little necklace.  Lightly constructed (not bulky or heavy), seems fine for the price."
5.0,Super cute! Good quality and my daughter loves it!
5.0,They are adorable! They are snug though. So size up. The material is also very thin but not see through.
5.0,This is a great showed scrub for males.  Best knew I found
5.0,Easy to ware and a Fell good on
5.0,"This year's Christmas Family portrait theme was 1960s 70s ""HOME SWEET HOME""  Son wears a men's medium sized up and bought a large. Great cardigan beautiful thick very warm. It's a really good bye for the price. Lol these pictures are meant to be ironic."
5.0,I have purchased these pants before because they fit me perfectly.  Love the pattern and color.
5.0,Nice worth the price.
5.0,Nice quality product. Fits well. Recommend this item.
5.0,"Love these boots, pants definitely do not match but love these."
5.0,Great product and price. Makes my rides in the rain and cold almost enjoyable. Actually they are. I love to ride and now I love to ride in any weather. The 3 pack lets me choose the best lens for the weather and light. Try these out. You'll love them. Get some for your kids too.
5.0,"Love love love!!!!! I am 5‚Äô3, 110 lbs and I bought a small and it fits perfectly. Not too baggy or too tight-perfect. I have only worn it once and received so many compliments! I bought the kimono in grey. Quality is great as well. Love it!!!"
5.0,Got this for a Ren Faire and it works amazing
5.0,"For the price, no complaints. Comparable to some much more expensive jerseys that I have bought."
5.0,"Great goggles, they are very sturdy came in an awesome packaging , great to carry in your swimming bag. They are anti-fog and has UVA protection what is a plus. They are exactly as they advertise. They are comfortable to wear, are waterproof and shockproof as pointed by other reviewer. Excellent clarity under water, lovely design ! They are an A+<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item free of charge for reviewing purposes however all opinions expressed in my review are my own, unbiased and truthful."
5.0,"The material is very soft and comfortable. I am 5'6"", 130 lbs so I ordered a medium and although the bottoms are a bit long, I prefer that over too short. I'm not sure if the description mentions it or not but there are also good sized pockets in the bottoms."
5.0,I only wish the product was a bit cheaper in price.  I would buy several of these.  Sturdy.  I also wish it held more cards.
5.0,"I love this dress, I love the sleeves I love the fit and I love the material!!!"
5.0,I love these! They are now my favorite!
5.0,Just as expected also got it early
5.0,Great to pin onto my bag or jacket when I travel - just in case.
5.0,I love Vera Bradley. It is my favorite brand. This lanyard is amazing quality.
5.0,Was suggested I buy a small but I'm so glad I went ahead and bought the medium! It's snug. I love the beautiful color very pretty dress wearing it to my sons wedding and his fianc√© approves!
5.0,These socks were bought for my granddaughter.  They are soft and fit well.
5.0,Love it! It's everything and more then what they said it would be...:-)
5.0,This has been very handy for me as I am a nurse and travel from home to home at times it allows me to have easy access and holds even extra stuff that I throw in there that I think I'm going to toss back out LOL
5.0,I use these compression sleeves to protect my arms from UV rays. I tried it yesterday for the first time and it provided the relief my old arms needed from the hot Texas sun!
5.0,Gloves are super soft and stylish at the same time! Highly recommend!!! A+
5.0,awesome look with leggings and heels - may buy another for spring
5.0,beautiful dress its heavy but it was perfect for my christmas dinner.
5.0,Very very small but in a cute elegant way. I like it. It‚Äôs not too in your face. It‚Äôs perfect to wear for a nice event.
5.0,Love it! It looks just like the what is in the photo. Very elegant looking
5.0,My kid absolutely loves it. Fits just like all the other masks. Even came with little in certs that I could not fit it (but works just as fine without).
5.0,Love the quality & fit as expected bc I ordered one sz up
5.0,"I bought them for my dad and he loves them, very light i recommend that in this style you go for a size less than your regular one."
5.0,"It was very easy to write the name on the tags, we used ball point pens.  The tags held up very well on the flight, with the exception of my grandaughter's.  We should have checked her tags as she is not very mechanical orientated. It may be that for some people a simpler locking mechanism for the chain may work better."
5.0,Great fit and soft material!
5.0,"When I first tried this on it was a bit tight, but after a couple of wears it became more comfortable. Today it was 39 ‚ÑÉ with 10 mile per hour winds and it kept me warm while I was out shopping. I like that it is feminine and sleek in design with a snug hood. It's &#34;my day off and I'm looking cute&#34; jacket!"
5.0,Great in size and comfortable
5.0,Lovely sparkly sweater!
5.0,A little too tight for a man bigger than 10.5 shoe size.  But the style was worth stretching them to fit me.
5.0,"Best masks I have found! Very thick so I feel like I‚Äôm extra protected. Easy to wash, line dry, large enough for my husband‚Äôs fat head and can be made small enough for my smaller head. Will definitely buy more of these"
5.0,"Super Cute Retro Sunglasses. Included is a storage bag and lens wipe, perfect for protecting the lenses when stowing in a bag or purse.<br /><br />I selected the green frame with gray lenses. Dark lenses are important to me, as I always feel as if the light, colorful lenses open up my eyes and allow more light in. Instant headache and eyestrain. The gray lenses are dark lenses. Perfect.<br /><br />Continuous plastic, no pesky nose pieces or bling that get caught on my hair when wearing the sunglasses on my head in low light environs.<br /><br />Sturdy and attractive, in a super cute retro shape that frames my face nicely. Keep in mind for those who are used to oversized sunglasses, these frame are narrow, so while they work well when facing direct sunlight, in a super sunny area, light will filtrate from the sides and the top.<br /><br />I adore the color and shape of the frame, very pleased with the darkened lenses, a great way to dress up an outfit while protecting your eyes from sunlight."
5.0,"These are so beautiful and go with brown, blue or gray clothing. Good experience with seller."
5.0,"Again, another one of my favorites.  These tend to slide of the face a bit, so bend the handles a little for a tighter fit."
5.0,"This dress fit perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù  125 lbs 33-26-36. I bought an x-small. This dress is very comfortable, doesn‚Äôt wrinkle and travelled well in my luggage. It has nice thick fabric and is a bit stretchy"
5.0,Nice band. Fit as the original and it give to your watch a great look.
5.0,Awesome sunnies. Very happy with my purchase :)
5.0,"Like other reviewers, I am tired of ordering, allegedly all cotton socks, to discover they have spandex in them. On first opening, they didn‚Äôt feel like 100% cotton but after washing, they softened up considerably. I think there is a elastase in the top to keep them from falling down, but so far it is not bothering me. I am very sensitive to latex and this is not that. I‚Äôm very satisfied with them."
5.0,"Like , timepiece"
5.0,Wife loved it. Complinents on it.
5.0,Who couldn‚Äôt like this it‚Äôs cute and sassy exactly what my teenager wanted.
5.0,Great shorts and fit
5.0,Comoda y muy linda
5.0,This is a beautiful garment that I will use in formal situations. It's as comfortable as it is beautiful.
5.0,"I little big, but great design."
5.0,My brother loves soccer and seeing him excited by this gift made me happy. Good for keys and cards.
5.0,works well because most kits do not have a 16 so awesome buy
5.0,"Backs of these earrings are great.  Liked so well that when I lost one, I reordered. Very comfortable, even if you forget to take out before bed and sleep in them."
5.0,These pretty buttons made my blazer look very expensive.  Thanks for an excellent product.
5.0,This was a gift. She loved it.
5.0,They don‚Äôt slip and go well with any style flats.
5.0,Love this shirt. We ordered the white one as well. Fits great. Looks great. Athletic looking fit.
5.0,"love the shirt but ordered too large fits larger than expected so order smaller than think. very comfy, will buy again in right size"
5.0,"My husband loves his and wears it all the time, he literally never takes it off. He wanted something that wasn't flashy; he was very clear about that! It's a great product made with great quality. Looks very classy. If it ever ""wears out"" I will order another one for him."
5.0,Nice shirt fits well. Grandson loves this shirt.
5.0,Me gusta este vestido es suave y fresco y se ve muy bien puesto la tela es un poco transparente pero esta bien lo recomiendo
5.0,"This is a very pretty Pandora charm and a great addition to my first bracelet, which is now full with silver charms and black beads. This a delightful balance to the happy anniversary heart that my husband recently gave me. Love it! I have a lot of different Pandora heart charms on my basic bracelet, and this one is the most unique-looking."
5.0,My grandson wanted this watch after a friend in school let him wear his.  I was shocked to see this at this amazing price.  The quality and wearability is unmatched
5.0,"Absolutely love this suit! Offers great coverage while still looking stylish and flattering. And for the price - such a bargain. I bought it in 2XL (10-12) and XL (8-10) as I wasn't sure - curvy 5ft 8, 36 bust and 43 hips | In H&M - I wear a size 12-14 (L/XL) in bottoms and size 10 (M) in tops.<br />The XL (8-10) fit perfect. The 2XL was ok but didn't feel snug enough - felt a little baggy in the mid-section and lose in the cups BUT it still looked good. It did fit fine around the bottom and thighs but I feel like any sudden movements (jumping into the pool, being hit by a wave) could lead to a wardrobe malfunction. Hope this helps - tried to give as much detail on sizing as possible."
5.0,Very good quality guitar strap. Highly recommended !!
5.0,"I couldn't believe the price of this scarf!!! I bought this one and the dark blue one as well.  They got to me so fast.  They are coven cotton and very comfortable.  Also, they are quite long so that you can do just about anything, style wise with them.  No regrets on ordering this whatsoever.  What are you waiting for???  How can you not get more.  At the price...they are nice &#34;fillers&#34; for gifts and/or as wrapping for a gift.  There...I just gave you a couple of killer ideas to use these for.  Order it!!  LOL"
5.0,"Love it, the color, material, size, compartments, shoulder handle"
5.0,I love this so much!!!!! It is adorable came very early I want to buy a ton of them xD
5.0,"A great watch, great price.  It's been awhile since I had this model, lately been getting something with a little bigger face and number display.  Thought this might be a little too small and ""toyish"".  But that's not the case, it looks fine.  And I appreciate the smaller profile, as it doesn't interfere with shirt sleeve cuffs like other watches can, and it's so light you hardly notice it.  And when the band eventually cracks and breaks, as they always eventually do, watch replacement similar in price to a new band."
5.0,"....Because some reviews weren't great, but it arrived packed well, in excellent condition.  Resin is sturdy & all features show up well."
5.0,I thought it looked really small when I got it but it fits my 4 year old perfectly.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Looks expensive! Perfect light weight jacket.
5.0,"Color, size, style, comfort, all fantastic. The fabric is perfect for hot sticky summer days."
5.0,"Love it. I bought this so I could wear my watch comfortably at night to monitor my sleep. This band is neither tight nor loose, I can‚Äôt even feel it. I love it. Seems to be great quality and color. Definitely buy if you are on the fence."
5.0,Very sleek and stylish
5.0,"The bows are really well made and super cute! There are a TON of them, and they look like they are just the right size!"
5.0,Nice length üëå
5.0,This is a super cute set and runs true to size
5.0,This dress is perfect!! The color is as pictured and is beautiful.  I ordered a medium and I am 5‚Äô0 and 145 and it fits great.
5.0,"fun watch, keeps good time"
5.0,"Great pin, wife loved it!!"
5.0,My mom loves the necklace I got her for Mother‚Äôs Day!
5.0,"I love these organizers, I have quite a few in different colors to help organize all the little nooks and crannies. Shipping was as expected"
5.0,This strap is amazing and for the sub ten buck price its proportionally the best strap i ever bought. It has real white thread stitching which was a pleasant surprise. The mat finish is cool. Most importantly the buckle doesnt dig into my skin unlike some other straps I've tried.<br />It looks absolutely gorgeous on my blue oreint mako.
5.0,Love this dress. I just ordered another. Feels like a jersey t-shirt. Drapes nicely.
5.0,These earrings are very elegant looking.  What I like best about them they are lightweight and do not hurt your ears by the end of the day. Would recommend.
5.0,"Our baseball-playing son wears this Athletic Arm Sleeve every time he plays ball! The sleeve lightly compresses the muscles, tendons, etc to allow for a higher throwing velocity without the risk of injury to his arm. His claims aren't without merit or I wouldn't be seeing pro players of all sports also wearing the same product! I highly recommend the Sports Farm Athletic Sleeve to anyone who worries about injury from overuse."
5.0,Perfect fit for all my kids 8-16
5.0,"These are wonderful, fit great and super warm in the cold."
5.0,It's a nice key ring with a nice verse on it. My daughter liked it.
5.0,The pigtails are so sweet.  Bought for my granddaughter for her birthday along with other things.  Just can't help myself.
5.0,"This bra is super comfortable and provides good support with full breast coverage. The material is soft and feels nice on the skin. Comes with padding, but this can be removed. The straps can be adjusted for more or less support. In addition to nursing - this definitely could be used as an everyday t-shirt bra or even a sleep bra. So happy to receive this at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,Very nice product and beautiful for the money
5.0,Very comfortable & pretty dress!
5.0,"These glasses are super cute! I haven‚Äôt gotten to wearing them often, but they look great. The frame feels thick and sturdy, but obviously I‚Äôd be careful with how you handle them. The hinges feel nice and secure but I like keeping my things safe as possible, and especially since it‚Äôs new. It comes with a small draw string bag perfect for keeping them safe, however there‚Äôs no little cloth to wipe down the glasses with. If you‚Äôve already got one, great! But if not, i‚Äôve used my shirt when it got smudged and it seemed to work fine. Obviously a cloth made for the purpose of clearing smudges would probably work better though. Great purchase and super cute! :-))"
5.0,Beautiful color and well made.
5.0,Super cute dress. Fits as expected.  super comfy
5.0,I really like the jersey. It fit like I was hoping. I dont like the cuffs. I like to pull my long sleeves up and these dont give at all. Nice shirt. Glad I got it.. .
5.0,Love them! Inexpensive but don't look cheap. I enjoy wearing them.<br />Update: These are my favorite earrings. I wear them more than any other earrings I have.
5.0,"The pair of bracelets comes to you in a surprisingly nice velveteen bag that makes opening your Amazon box a more delightful experience. Inside the gift bag, the bracelets that arrive are a pair of masculine leather strap bracelets that most men (who wear this kind of jewelry) will find appealing. The clasps are especially nice given that most of leather bands of this type use a string tightening mechanism that generally unravels over time. These should hold tight for years."
5.0,"Love it, this is a great Sun garden hat, it fits perfect & the brim is a good size. Thank you."
5.0,They are really nice.  Everyone loved them. Had a Harry Potter themed baby shower and they looked great. Thank you
5.0,these bracelets came fast and are great quality I wear them as anklets because they are a bit large I love how not one is the same pattern as any other üíñ
5.0,Nice fit  great for the price
5.0,"Simplemente me encanto y enseguida compre uno mas , ajusta muy bien tiene un buen soporte en el abdomen"
5.0,I love their versatility. I've used it to tie a headband or as a hairtye at the end of my braid. I've also used it to tie my hair into a ponytail. They're soft and easy to tie or untie. They also look super cute.
5.0,love it very comfortable and nice material.
5.0,"Love the fit, comfy n warm"
5.0,great hat nice hat love the color fits great looks great the way it should.
5.0,"Good size bag, ample room to fit everything I need for an evening out and my phone.  The sequins shed a bit but there are so many on there it wasn't a problem.  Can't beat the price."
5.0,Awesome! Thank you
5.0,"These are FABULOUS!! Thick, warm, and cute patterns!"
5.0,"My son wear a small it‚Äôs a little big but, was expecting it, since adidas normally run that way. Otherwise great my son didn‚Äôt get a whole in it the first day."
5.0,"I like them! High waisted, color is nice. Squat proof. So far, so good!"
5.0,Two words: buy it! I love this watch!
5.0,"Was concerned a medium weeps be too small but it fit perfect. I'm 5'4 169lbs, very hippy lol. Great suit"
5.0,"I'm always sceptical about items online, but I must say >This mask is a good durable plastic that definitely fits well!! Made a great touch to my costume :)"
5.0,The charm is an excellent addition to the rest of the charm family I have on my bracelet.
5.0,"I love this fleece. Easy to layer, but warm enough to wear alone. Soft, comfy, loose-ish fit."
5.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 145 Lbs. The medium fits perfectly. It falls just below the knee which is what I wanted to keep my thighs warm. It would be plenty warm from 10 degrees to 35 degrees depending on how cold affects you. I usually just wear a light short sleeve shirt under it, but there's room for layering if needed. Two nice large zipped pockets. The hood snaps up at the neck which keeps the hood snug. Zipper plus snaps front. The quality and workmanship are excellent, especially for the price."
5.0,Very nice necklace and just what I was looking for. I gave it as a Christmas gift and the recipient loves it and wears it all the time. Very nice quality
5.0,"Love this, great price would make a great gift"
5.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my 8 yo daughter. As expected, it was too big for her tiny wrist. She wears it around her ankle and loves the style. The magnet clasp is strong, and the materials seem durable. Most of the inexpensive jewelry that I get for her breaks within a day or two because she is very active. She's on day four of non - stop wear, and it still looks brand new. This is the equivalent of a year for normal person wear lol. I'm really happy with this purchase."
5.0,Wore on New Years Eve in New Orleans. Was cute and got compliments!
5.0,"Arrived so fast, I thought it was another item that I ordered before this brush. Does the job and would recommend to the next person."
5.0,"This top is very nice. It is breathable and lightweight. The material is not see through either.<br /><br />This top can easily be dressed up or down. You can wear it off the shoulder or as a short sleeve top. As for the sizing, it is true to size."
5.0,It fit as expected.  Normal size fitting.  Nice screenwriting and licensed Stranger Things t -shirt.
5.0,My 16yr old wants form fitting polos for work. She is 5‚Äô7 150 36DD and the medium fit exactly the way she wanted it. Looks great!
5.0,It keeps me warm they look great and the color is as expected (it's more like a beige than white). A beige is what I wanted.I'm I bought these.The item fits awesome with my boots and skinny jeans.
5.0,"These have beautiful colors and very sturdy, much sturdier than the ones I bought at the hardware store!"
5.0,Great fit..... jus tried it on haven't worked out in it yet
5.0,"I like everything about it,  good for the money."

5.0,Very happy with my purchase and seller!  Will purchase from seller again.
5.0,Wow!  What a great price for some cool looking frames! These sunglasses were really comfortable and I think I might get more for gifts! :)
5.0,I would definitely not describe these pants as sweatpants. More along the lines of casual pants/slacks.<br />The fabric is not linen. However they are very comfortable and true to size. For someone who is only five five the length on these were perfect. The waste is stretchy and they are adorable with a white T-shirt and black flip-flops. Or would look great with heels and a nice black top.
5.0,Super cute and comfortable pajamas! I got a size large and I am typically between a 10 to 12 (US).
5.0,Love these glasses and I get so many compliments on how cute the frames are!
5.0,"Purchased these sunglasses for a newly aged teenager. Worth the low cost! Green frame is sturdy, Blue/purple/green lens tint is cool. Came with a fabric draw-string pouch. Could be for male or female any age.  As an adult, it took me back to the 90's style."
5.0,"This jeans is very nice, the quality is very good and it is also my perfect fit ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ù‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,"Got the XL & it fits like other size L I have (I'm 5'8&#34; & 115 lbs), long enough in the sleeves & to cover my bum. The color is more red than &#34;wine&#34; -<br /> I was hoping for a more burgundy color, but still a lovely color. The knit is light (feels almost like cotton knit), but substantial enough to feel like a sweater & hangs well."
5.0,Lovely!  I just wish it came with instructions as to how to put it on your ear.  (Not a normal clip)
5.0,"Great pj..100% cotton, soft...only issue it runs small..i ordered the 3T for my 2 yr old..fits snug perfect"
5.0,Perfect fit. Not too tight or too loose. Wore it for a Halloween half marathon and I was getting compliments from everyone. Thanks!
5.0,Very dainty very pretty little earrings going to buy another set in a different design
5.0,Well I will start off saying if I write a review 9 times out of 10 its a good one! I absolutely love this dress and thus dress absolutely loved me! My husband was having a bad day on the phone and when I walked in the room with this dress on he was like wooh!!! You look so beautiful! Look like a little doll! Its a flare slightly stiff but its ok. Iron it inside out will be best. It said it will fade when you wash it so I did not get it dirty to wash it I work at my desk and I don't get up so I will have its beauty a little longer!
5.0,quality product and a reasonable price
5.0,I‚Äôm a shorter person so I struggled with the legs being a little long for me. Otherwise it fit really well and was nice for trick or treating in the cold with my daughter.
5.0,"I loved this dirndl! I was going to Germany for a party, it was requested we dress in traditional German attire. The dress was light weight, which was perfect for a very warm afternoon (yes, even in September). It fit as expected, I loved the apron that came with it and the colors were perfect. When in Germany, I checked prices at the Galleria Kaufhof, which is a chain over there, and their prices were at least $20 more. Very satisfied with my purchase!"
5.0,Beautiful. Love it more than I expected. I'm gonna buy additional colors!!!!
5.0,"These are absolutely adorable!  Equally cute with a dress as with jeans, there is a pair for every outfit.  They aren't heavy, and even after several hours of wearing they didn't irritate my ears.  I plan to order another set to add to Christmas gift bags!"
5.0,Fits as expected. Came with some threads hanging out but not bad considering the price.
5.0,"Ademas de la calidad de la proteccion, te permite tener una imagen super diferente del entorno por su color amarillo, la recomiendo.."
5.0,Dries fast.  Works good.  Not best cushion but for showers is fine.  A lot of cushion would make it dry slow
5.0,Daughter and DIL both loved this gift! Very nice quality!
5.0,"Fits perfect, cooler, perfect for my job, I‚Äôm a groomer"
5.0,"When I first open them up I thought they were scrubs for a second. But I try them on and I really like them. These are kind of like dupes for the Lululemon joggers. They fit really nicely I got an extra small and I am 5,3 for reference"
5.0,"I love love love this hoodie blanket. This is so soft and warm. It replaces my old snuggie that was a felt like material. This was so surprisingly soft that I don't ever want to crawl back out if it!! The teal Zebra color is very vibrant and beautiful.  It looks very beachy. My only regret is ordering the regular adult size instead of the extra long. Don't hesitate, buy this right now!!"
5.0,These work fantastic at keeping you cool. I work outdoors in Florida heat and these are exactly what I needed. Will be buying more.
5.0,I wore these hiking the volcano on Hawaii. they are durable enough to wear for hiking socks and look fantastic!
5.0,Very good quality. My son loves it. Runs true to size.
5.0,Really like these slippers.  Would order them again.
5.0,Perfect.great quality print and durable shirt.
5.0,I was a little disppointed with the fact that there's just a tiny part of flexibile rubber on the end of the applicator (which is hard to realize in the pic) but at the same time I always use mine for relaxers and you don't want the whole rubber part covered with product. These are perfect!
5.0,I love Shwings. They might not actually make you run faster but you certainly feel that way. ;)
5.0,Love this ! Super comfy
5.0,Very nice Item for the Hummingbird lover in your Family.
5.0,"Stunning. These are simple yet classy emerald studs. Have been wearing to work to make dresses pop. Can be for casual outfits or just going out. Versatile, and stylish"

5.0,They are stunning! Got lots of compliments.
5.0,"Lovely fit and is great with leggings. I wear a 16/18 and I bought an XL. It's not at all tight. I might even be able to get away with a L, but I didn't want to chance it. It's really pretty and flowy. I've bought two... one red and one blue. The material is very light, but I always wear thin tanks / camisoles under my shirts (I don't wear a bra), so it didn't bother me in the least. The light fabric is great for hot days."
5.0,Cute and protective.
5.0,A little bit tight around my neck and arms but it‚Äôs alright
5.0,LOVE these frames. My prescription glasses broke beyond repair. Was ecstatic to locate the same designer frames on Amazon. My optometrist was able to swap out the lenses.  What a deal!
5.0,Very lovely dress with distinctive contrast colors that will create a &#34;wow&#34; factor.  Pay attention to the size chart from vendor because it is exactly like they described.  Would recommend this dress to others.
5.0,Love that you get most commly use colors in a pack of 3
5.0,"When I travel, I try do be as minimal as possible.  The Game and Watch systems are great with tactile buttons and old-school feel versus playing a game on the iPhone.  This case is a great compliment to the Game and Watch and is just about as minimal as the G&W itself.  It's great protection on the go and hides a double-sided secret.  Worth it!"
5.0,I normally wear small or medium but I got a large and it fit well. Good quality top. I'm pleased with the purchase
5.0,"easy to ware, can sleep in them and not worry about them coming off, the backs hold great. this would be  great gift item"
5.0,"The lil outfit was soo cute! My only complaint is that it ran really small. I ordered 3T thinking that would be big enough, which it wasn‚Äôt. The 3T looked more for maybe 24months-2T. It wasn‚Äôt gonna fit the lil one I bought it for. So if you order maybe size up one to two sizes.<br /><br />I however was able to get a refund for my purchase which was great."
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Follow sizing chart and you should be fine.
5.0,Great for great price!
5.0,Actually ordered another 2 pair because that's how much I like them. Nicely made and nice material.

5.0,Lots for the price you pay. Good quality.
5.0,Such a treasure to dig through and find amazing little pieces. Detail on pieces is great
5.0,my girlfriend liked the panties but they were not the colors as shown and would like to order more only of they are assorted colors and not the same 3 colors. would have kept them of they were like the pictures as shown by amazon.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife. She loved it and wasted no time to install all of you cards pictures and money in her new wallet. She was so happy with her Buxton Heiress Clutch, shde asked me to order another one in different color."
5.0,I finally found some over-the-calf socks that actually fit the way they are supposed to...or better.. the way they advertise size. I have ruined so many pairs just trying to put them on. My feet are size 12 1/2-13...and socks that say they cover this size as a maximum size...DO NOT. These folks make a larger size sock that FITS!! YAY! They are so very comfortable and wear well too!! Amen!
5.0,Beautiful dress! Comfortable and sexy! True to size!
5.0,I‚Äôm obsessed with this skirt! It‚Äôs incredibly flattering abs love the string adjustment!

5.0,"My husband has Sasquatch size feet and finding him footwear that fits properly and looks good can be tricky. These boots turned out to be a great pick.<br /><br />The size 13 actually is a size 13 and fits him perfectly. He said once he added his inserts, the boots were extremely comfortable. He's been wearing them daily for a week now is very happy. I think they look good on him."

5.0,"Good quality for the price, but the insoles of the shoes are not very good. Anyone who buys these shoes should get better insoles if they expect to  be able to stay on their feet all day. They fit as expected. The color, however, is much darker than expected. I bought they grey colored ones, and they looked like charcoal."
5.0,Light weight great for son at school
5.0,"Thick and well made glove, made in the USA!"
5.0,This is a nice fall sweater. It‚Äôs light and it‚Äôs cute! Stretchy but not flimsy. Wash and hang it dry. The tye dye navy and white looks like the picture and colors are very nice.

5.0,"Great watch, my husband really loves it."
5.0,The design on this mask is amazing I love it!

I hate shopping for clothes for myself at department stores  and shopping for clothes for my girlfriend isn't much funner so I saw this and decided to get it. She's about 5'2&#34;, weighs 122 and the fit was right on. She normally wears a size 8. I ordered the medium. This dress looks very sexy! Perfect for a night out to a high class restaurant or event."

5.0,"This by far is my favorite purse ever!! It is the perfect size. Love the strap length for the crossbody.

The dress was fancier than I expected it would be. Just very pretty. I ended up wearing another dress for this occasion but kept this one in the hopes that I get a chance to wear it one day."
5.0,"Pros:<br />-really small,<br />Fits my wrist perfectly.<br />-pretty color<br />-a large, thick bangle for a small bangle<br />-cute gift box<br /><br />cons:<br />-I Suspect this might not be jade, but it is a pleasant stone.<br /><br />I really like this jade bangle bracelet. It's different for me because it's very thick and small. I usually have been gifted not so thick jade bracelets because they were my wrist size. I did not require lotions or anything to slip on, but I have a really small wrist. It does not slip off. It's the perfect fit. I find it to be pleasant but because of the vague wording &#34;natural jade&#34; I'm not sure it's actual jade.<br /><br />I attached photos to show how the item I received appears. It's a light green with quite a bit of white. It's pretty opaque, but I can see through it in very very very bright light shined on it."
5.0,"Perfect, will order these again!"

5.0,Personal preference
5.0,Love this ring it is comfortable and very pretty. Lots of compliments
5.0,"I am ALWAYS scared of ordering clothes, costumes or pretty much anything from online. I thought this was going to be cheap when I got it but it was anything but cheap. This was such good quality and it was pretty thick so its good if your wearing it during a cold day. The only issue I had was that the white part of the cape kept falling back and choking me. Easy fix though all I did was safety pin it to my crown and then I had 0 problems. Its a little long, but I am only 5""1 so I had to cut some of mine but it was again so easy. Loved this costume definitely worth the money, honestly I'm kind of surprised its not more expensive."
5.0,"I bought this for my daugther because this is her father fraternity. It's well made,  the price was perfect but it fits too tightly.  It arrived really and it's beautiful."

5.0,Beautifullllll...very pretty and high quality
5.0,"The band looks great and its the only type of watch band my wife will wear, so I dropped the money on this band which just came out for apple watch. It is very well but and looks great if a stretch watch band is what you like I recommend spending the money and getting this watch band."
5.0,I love it. Very pretty
5.0,Love these skirts for throwing as a casual or dressy outfit. Waist fits snug so if you want the skirt to be a bit longer I‚Äôd size up

5.0,I didn't expect an item this inexpensive would be as amazing as it was. XS fits my chunky little 1 year old perfectly for her party
5.0,Just the size I wanted
5.0,This sweater is so comfy. Fits perfect. I ordered a large and usually wear an XL. I ordered the lavender and white and love the soft color.
5.0,I wore it this morning at the the indoor pool. Exact fit and it was light did not weigh me down. No chills either. Hope it dries quickly.
5.0,I needed an outfit for a murder mystery party where I was playing a fortune teller.

5.0,Awesome quality and great price. The color is true to the photo as well. Would recommend
5.0,Very nice quality and came in perfect condition.
5.0,"Hard to get on at first, and you cannot wear socks with the product unless the socks are very thin.  Comfortable and keeps my feet warm when I am wearing them.  Glad I bought the Booties."
5.0,"Whenever i bought this product i took a tiny risk of it not being what i expected, it only had 1 review which was 5 stars but just because one person bought it and liked it, to me didn't mean i would.. Just got this bag in today, and I LOVE it!!! So glad i spent the extra couple of dollars, and invested in a nice bag to start EMT school with.. It's VERY spacious, and has PLENTY of pockets for all of you're gear! I def recommend this item!! Did i mention the color is exactly as it is in the picture? AWESOME!!!!"
5.0,nice...especially for the money.
5.0,So my son previously had an R2D2 backpack and when it broke he wanted another one. I turned to Amazon because it wasn‚Äôt September. This was is great quality. (Way better than his previous one that we brought from the super store.) I really am happy with this purchase. I can tell it‚Äôs going to hold up for years.
5.0,no instructions which is a shame.  but once measured against my other belts they seemed to be the same size so all I had to do was to attach the buckle.  Not flimsy at all. Both colors are useful.  Not sure how difficult it would be to cut the belts shorter before putting the buckle on but the second part was rather easy.  very pleased with this product.
5.0,My 13 year old loved it
5.0,"Bought for my succubus halloween costume and it completely made the look! The straps got a little uncomfortable after awhile, so I would take them off periodically. I love them so much!"
5.0,These are great! I absolutely love them. The quality is great and for the price!! Will be buying more!
5.0,I've ordered gloves from other sellers that didn't fit worth a crap.  These actually fit my small/medium hands comfortably and look really good. Will be getting more.
5.0,"It looks amazing, the clock works just fine and actually is bigger than I though! It's totally worth its price."
5.0,I like the color and the design
5.0,Was just as advertised. Very pleased with the product. It is a very good deal for four ties.
5.0,"I loved it and it wasn't supposed to be here till the 17th of this month to my happiness it was here 14 days early!!!! Its individual bracelets so you can mix and match with what yo have or with the black one I also ordered I am going to wear them to show some originality which is hard in this small town. sadly we are here in this bloody,town fashion wise in the 1900 lol"
5.0,"I have been busying Relic purses for awhile now. They are always durable and zipper never has problems. This purse was on sale and has been great. I use as a crossbody so I don't have to hang onto the purse when out. I can hold my phone, cards, keys, comb, lip balm, tissues in it. The side pocket part is okay. I don't care for that part, but the color matches my winter coat."
5.0,BUY THEM NEOW
5.0,Well printed and looks just as described. The pigment of the ink is really nice on this particular poster as the red really pops. Love it!
5.0,It show bright color. I wear it for winter weather.
5.0,This dress is very classy and elegant. Would be perfect for the office or for a nice wedding. It fits a little bit larger than true to size but I like the extra material and the fact it isn‚Äôt so tight. Overall I am very happy with my purchase
5.0,"Very nice looking watch.<br />I have a small wrist, but this bracelet watch still fits perfectly.<br />I've had it about 3 months now.<br />No problems."
5.0,I love this band. I love the way it reflects the light. It is beautiful.
5.0,"does not look cheap, in fact looks better than in the pictures"
5.0,Material yuck
5.0,"The material is very nice, the colors are wonderful, and they are well made. Unlike some of the other reviews I have not had an issue with seams ripping. I wash them in a lingerie bag and do not put them in the dryer. I purchased the brief so I could try them as I have many pairs of the hi-cut bikini of the same brand. I am a male who has been wearing panties for a long time and I have to say these are some of my favorites. I really love the way they look and feel. My wife likes me in them as well. Ladies if you like satin panties you owe it to yourselves to try these. And guys if you are thinking about changing from the ugly and uncomfortable men underwear, you should try this brand."
5.0,Slouchy but not too much. My favorite beanie. Brought it to Iceland.  Not scratchy at all.
5.0,CUTE ON
5.0,The ratings themselves were small and nit very detailed.
5.0,This is the perfect lightweight hooded jacket that I needed for those rainy summer days. Fit is great!
5.0,My daugther like it very much
5.0,"(Excuse the puppy kisses on the mirror.) I was absolutely blown away by the quality of this dress. Thick material, secure enclosures, sturdy fastener. Rich color and fits perfectly. I ordered a size small. I love this dress and feel so incredibly confident in it. I would order every single color for $8!"
5.0,This top is really great for work.  It has soft lace trim around the neckline that is not too revealing.  The fit overall is very professional but still looks elegant.  Overall this is an excellent purchase for the Price<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fit is very good and true to size<br />- Soft material that is comfortable to wear<br />- Lace is not too revealing on the neck and also feel soft<br />- Inside tags do not pinch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Buttons are white
5.0,Proud to wear this mama shirt
5.0,Perfect for kids or very small woman!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"When I purchased this cap I didn‚Äôt think I would use the buttons at all, I was wrong. The buttons will save your ears after a long shift!"
5.0,Super cute. Although it‚Äôs rather large...I ties a smal knot in the chain and use the clasp on the other side of the knot to tighten it up
5.0,Love it! Absolutely beautiful and not too heavy on the wrist!
5.0,Bought these for my son who is still learning to tie his shoes. These work so well! They stretch just enough to put shoes on and haven't stretched out beyond use. Love them!
5.0,Love this hat! It's really warm and so soft on the inside and fits perfectly! I would definitely buy this again but with how well it's made doubt I'd need to!
5.0,Easier than most to get on and your legs feel comfortable in them.
5.0,"Very Thick and Twice as wide as normal sweatbands, Just ordered another package of 12."
5.0,"It's a nice, deep hat. I hate hats that feel like they don't come down far enough on my head. This one fits well and is well made. USA!"

5.0,Bought for my boyfriend and I think it is a beautiful piece. The scent is not overwhelming which is nice.
5.0,"Basketball practice to cheer practice, these are great."
5.0,"I had this same shirt from another company and I had worn it so much over the years, it went from black to grey; so it was finally time to replace the shirt and I bought this one from Impact.  The graphic is very good quality and the shirt is excellent.  It fits good and the material is soft.  For the price, this is a shirt worth getting to spread the love of T.Rex - Get It On!"
5.0,My husband loves it! Especially the Stanley T-shirt
5.0,Warmest coat I have ever bought.  Runs alil big. I got  large and I still have alot of room
5.0,Love the bracelet! Is a good reminder to NEVER stop fighting the disease.
5.0,"Boot was a little snug at first, but now broken in it is a little loose on the heel. I don't mind because I wear thicker cotton socks withthem for winter. They are quite heavy in weight with a very durable sole and thick heel with about 2.5 inch lift and which is good for people in need of a boost. Have a rugged look and feel and harness ring is thick steel. Really enjoying them so far and they are warm with the lining."
5.0,My wife lost a pair at Disney World this past summer and is the reason we ordered these. She ordered the exact same pair she had actually she ordered three pair because they are her favorite sunglasses she has found over the last 10 years they fit her well they're comfortable to wear all day and she loves the Texas flag on the side.
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous skirt. True to size and very comfortable on the waist. I'm a size 8-10, 5ft 7.5 &#34; tall and approximately 152lbs. I got the 10 and it's perfect. Might post a pic when I get dressed up :)"
5.0,"This is my third pair of these. I‚Äôve order both the medium and large and depending on my activity both will work for me. I‚Äôm typically a size 8, and lean towards the large."

5.0,It looks exactly like the picture
5.0,Cool looking and good for makeup wearers
5.0,"To expensive,  coating didn't last long"
5.0,I live it & it works awesomely!
5.0,"This is the best dress EVER!! I got it for a beach vacation but I‚Äôm currently going to order more! It is so soft, fits so nicely, and is just long enough to make me feel cute :-) For reference I‚Äôm usually an L/XL 5‚Äô9 with a 34D bust"
5.0,Good belt. Nice colors!
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic! I received all the colors as shown in the picture. They look and wear small but if you stretch them it's perfect.  There is a slight odor, but let them hang and the door will go away. LOVE LIVE LOVE them."
5.0,Perfect for storage of art supplies for me. I can see the contents.
5.0,The size was right on. Quality material
5.0,My mom is a petite 5' lady and this fit her frame perfectly! Looks super cute! Fast shipping!
5.0,"Needed these for a trip to the Pacific Northwest (temps ranging from 45-60 degrees). Wore under a variety of skinny jeans and leggings all day and worked perfectly. No bulk added. Forgot I was wearing them after awhile. I am 130 lbs, 5'7&#34; and these were the perfect length. I wear a size 6-8 in jeans because I have large, athletic thighs, but I have a size 2-4 waist. Hope that sizing info helps as I always have issues finding pants that fit - but the medium fit perfectly."
5.0,"Striking watch numbers are easy to see. I love the bracelet style, you can't always find them."
5.0,Great sunglasses. Fun retro style. Excellent value.
5.0,"These shoes are fantastic, if you put a pad in them.  One I put a pad in, I was able to wear them all day in the yard.  They have been a life-saver as I do landscaping projects around the yard."
5.0,"Very nice, Just make sure you get the right size."
5.0,These gloves are super cute!
5.0,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE! Only complaint is that they're made of the softer material, so they bend out of shape easy. My daughter absolutely loves them. I am going to buy 3 more in different colors! Definitely recommend!"
5.0,"I ordered these for my daughter after reading the reviews. And we were pleasantly surprised! It arrived in two days, which was right in time for a gathering she wanted to attend. It looks great and no once can tell that it's not made of metal."
5.0,"Easy to put on, looks great!"
5.0,"Was unsure how good the quality of these pants would be but the price convinced me to give them a try. I am so surprised how great these are! The fabric feels nice and they are very comfortable to wear.<br />I am 5‚Äô11 and slim and I got a size Small, 34 inseam and the fit is perfect for me."
5.0,Beautiful but I can't get it in easy at all lol
5.0,"Me encantan estas sandalias, a mi hijo le gustan, se ven muy bien en sus pies y son muy c√≥modas para el"
5.0,It fits perfectly and it looks so cute! :)
5.0,I have been looking all over for a hinged hoop earring to wear in my cartilage. I have been wearing mine for a few weeks now. I don't ever take it out. I wear it in the shower and pool. It hasn't tarnished. I am very happy with my new earrings. They came sooner then expected. I would order again.
5.0,I love my sweater.
5.0,These are very nice biking shorts they‚Äôve got pockets on both sides they are nice and light weight they hold my cell phone very nice there is no extra padding underneath or on the bottom like some bike shorts so if you‚Äôre looking for the padded ones you will not like these however I would wear these running or jogging or doing other various activities I really like them and would highly recommend them I feel they are very reasonably priced and would get again I got a size medium I am 130 pounds and 5‚Äô3‚Äù tall and they fit great I could‚Äôve probably even got away with a small
5.0,"The reviews were informative in choosing my size, and I ordered a Medium. I am 5'5&#34;, with 34Ds and a 29&#34; waistline. This skirt is perfect, probably one of my favorite clothing items at this point. It fits perfectly around my waist but has an elastic waist band in the back for some give (so it can get over thighs and butt just fine). This skirt is a nice length for me, as I have long legs and often find skirts appearing too short to be acceptable or professional, but this skirt falls just as it appears on the model! I got the yellow and am quite pleased with its vibrance. It has already gotten many compliments and it's a durable material. The design is just as pictured. Love it."
5.0,very feminine & flattering.
5.0,The unique shape of the pearls is very eye-catching!!  Perfect with other gold chains!!
5.0,I really love this dress fits well
5.0,Great fit.<br />Stiff good feeling boot.
5.0,"Comfortable, soft fabric.  Sleeves are actually long enough, which is always an issue for me since I am tall.  I am 5'10, 155lbs, ordered a size large to play it safe.  Could have gone down one size, but this will allow for layering.  The hoodie strings aren't even, but that's no big deal, they can easily be trimmed and knotted."
5.0,This skirt is exactly what we needed for my daughter's steampunk themed birthday party.  It fit true to size and I think it is an excellent value for the price.
5.0,"Great quality, fits perfect...love that we can tighten it so he doesn't lose it in the wind."
5.0,Great gloves for the snow.  Waterproof and windproof.  Excellent deal

5.0,Both ease of use and thickness.
5.0,Got it for a gift. Seems to be nice material and way cute!
5.0,"My 7 & 10 year old were surprised by our trip to Disney.  Imagine their surprise again when a few days into the trip (while waiting in a horrific line  for characters) i pulled out a lanyard covered in glittering pins!  I had pre-sorted (some duplicates but thats ok by me!) and I even held a few back in my pocket for a little surprise here and there through our week.  Was very exciting.  I understand pin trading is extremely important to many people, and since these pins are most likely &#34;Designer Inspired&#34; we took to trading amongst ourselves and with a few cast members - nothing too crazy.  The kids were instantly too attached to them anyway to be interested in trading much!"
5.0,"These sunglasses are AMAZING!! They are big which is something I like and yes they are super tinted but I like that no one can see my eyes, keeping the haters out."
5.0,So comfortable and way better than expected. Looks like the picture! Please get black back in stock!
5.0,"HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT SO FAR.  PRODUCT QUALITY GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR PRICE.<br />SO GLAD REPLACEMENT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS.  I CAN AND WILL BUY OTHER COLORS.<br />NO TROUBLE INSTALLING, AND IT LOOKS GREAT.  VERY PLEASED."
5.0,I have a hard time finding bands that fit.  These bands (I bought 5) are easy to wear and they look nice.  The different colors are fun like wearing a new watch every time.
5.0,"Very comfortable, and fits as described."
5.0,"I LOVE this bag! Better quality than the ThirtyOne brand! It is so big! Perfect for my MacBook pro 13&#34; and anything else. It's big enough I could use it as an overnight bag. This bag is going to serve me as a nursing clinical bag while in school and will plan to use it at my nursing job after graduating. This bag is so perfect that when I eventually have my own kids, this bag would make the ideal diaper bag! I love it. LOVE IT."
5.0,I love the color of the tie dye on this shirt and very lightweight for winter.
5.0,"Smaller than I thought, but great to stack or to keep separate!!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5232124efb0716229b16b6ba642d04aa]] Absolutely love this band and protective casing! Great quality and beautiful color. Want to buy more!!
5.0,"I got the 8-14 size and all three of my kids love these (ages 13, 11 and 7).  They are pretty thin so I'm not sure how effective they are virus-wise but the fit and feel is preferred by my kids to any of the other masks we have."
5.0,Just got this no issues no allergies good to go
5.0,"I like the different ways you can wear it. I don't use the cover much, but maybe will now that it's getting colder."
5.0,"Good fit, stretchy and warm."
5.0,Trendy and fun find
5.0,"I had never seen goggles that go on like these ones, but we LOVE them! They adjust easily so our family can share them if we need to and they are much nicer to put on for those of us who hate trying to pull on regular ones over our hair!!"
5.0,Get one size up if you want it to fit comfortable with no shape wear and get your true size if you want it tight (sexy tight ). I only know because I have 2. The first one I got in gold I got a 2x which is 1 size bigger than I normally wear. The 2x is comfortable and I didn't need shapewear which was a relief. It hugged my curves just right when I wore it. The second one I got is the red one that I wore to a wedding in a 1x. I had to wear my super shaper underneath but I loved it it was super sexy! It depends on the fit you want. This is a great dress for many occasions.
5.0,Received many compliments. This was my pick from many other drape dresses I‚Äôve ordered from amazon!

I can‚Äôt offer an opinion on the quality since I‚Äôm wearing it for the first time, but I truly hope it lasts. Either way, I would absolutely buy it again!"
5.0,look great and are comfortable. lots of compliments
5.0,"i love these oversized sunglasses. They fit great on my head without falling off and they block out so much sun but leave my vision crystal clear. I forget sometimes that I am even wearing them at all.<br />I've caught my daughter trying to sneak off with them twice.<br />They are made of plastic but not cheaply.<br />I love that they are polarized, good polarized glasses are hard to come buy.<br />They come with a nice carrying case, a carrying bag and a wipe for the lenses!<br />I absolutely love these!<br /><br />*i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review*"
