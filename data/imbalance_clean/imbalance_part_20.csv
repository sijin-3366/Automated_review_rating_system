5.0,I love them. They are fun and super comfy!
5.0,"Adorable tote that sends a great message! I've received many compliments with this tote & I can actually fit a full size binder & book in it. I wasn't expecting it to be able to fit school gear, but it does & I'm pleasantly surprised. Great quality!!!!"
5.0,Lovely Fan .It was just what I wanted.Thanks.
5.0,Nice look only had it s few days
5.0,I love this little cloth for minor cleaning of things in my store.  The inside has some kind of polish in it.  The outside is great for rubbing off tarnish.
5.0,"Excellent backings, I entrusted my diamond earrings to them"
5.0,"Super cute hoodie love the colors. Fitted not baggy, love it!"
5.0,"I bought these to wear for my wedding shower.  They are worth every penny.  They are made very well, and you’d never guess they are so inexpensive."
5.0,I love this charm. So classic and chic. Package was cute as well. My item got lost in the mail and waited 2weeks after expected delivery to get my charm. It was worth the wait.
5.0,"This is a cute shirt.  My husband, a hunter and a beer drinker, also finds it humorous.  The fit is right on, the screen print is excellent quality.  The shirt color is accurate and we are very pleased with the shirt.  I would definitely recommend Shirt Invaders for screen printed materials, and will absolutely consider them for any future purchases.<br /><br />I will update as to how it performs after going through the wash, but it fit great, and did not stretch out or become loose during regular wear.<br /><br />I have received this product at a discount, not free, in exchange for my honest review and opinion."

5.0,I liked these capris so much I purchased 2 different pairs. I do recommend these
5.0,I really like the box. Its has a real nice design on it and you can put your jewelry in it or money or whatever.
5.0,Prettier in person!! ;-) Gorgeous lil bracelet!
5.0,"Very soft and feels nice when when I wear it.  I've tried others, but I always have to send them back because the photos of each are not clear or sharp.  Very discouraging to think I'm buying the perfect top or shoes  and finding that they are very different from the photos and I'm forced to send them back.  Not for this shrug.  It positively is what I wanted.  I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"A little hard to remove the backing, but once I got it off it works great!"
5.0,Purchased for husband. Loves it. Good quality sturdy. Would definitely buy again
5.0,"The PERFECT Minimalist Wallet<br />The slimmest wallet that holds 8 cards, plenty of cash, with a snap closure that's long enough to snap and close when the wallet is full. The leather is soft so the coin zip slightly stretches to hold many coins.  Very happy with this wallet."
5.0,Love the 2 pockets.  This is my third pair of Baleaf yoga pants.
5.0,"I LOVE this ring!! I wanted a silicone ring to wear while biking and swimming. It’s perfect. Fits great, comfortable, and I love that I can change the bands to match my outfit and mood."
5.0,"I like this belt and it was as nice as I expected.  I bought them for my bridesmaids . However,  it took a  couple weeks  to arrive.  So be sure you have time to wait if you order."
5.0,Bought them not for head band.  I have a lot hair. Those bands just for tight hair up or make bun without catch it. Love them.
5.0,So cute with the little pockets! I'm 112 5'7 I got the small. An xs would be better but the straps allow you to adjust as needed! Great material
5.0,My son requested these and love them.
5.0,Perfect for my 80s party. Everyone wore it!!
5.0,DOTS is still one of my favorite KDramas. I love these socks.
5.0,"Love the material, the color and the fit.  I would buy again, again."
5.0,Received the coat on April 26th (ordered on the 19 April) pretty good as it came from Pakistan. I ordered the X-large (chest size 46 as are my suit jackets) and it fits perfectly. It appears to be well made and I really like the look.
5.0,"I was very surprised at the thickness of the material. Fits amazingly, I went based off my bust size which is a 2x and I'm shocked I could have even gone a size down 1x. Though I do like the flowy-ness of this dress. Definitely will be buying more of this dress..."
5.0,Great idea.  Gives ability to tighten or loosen discretely at any time.
5.0,Outstandingly comfortable. Beat the heck out of my old ones.
5.0,"I The material is thinner than expected, they are nice"
5.0,Great gift for guys.
5.0,Lo ordene para regalo de mi hija
5.0,"Great quality, SUPER cute. Exactly whaf i expected. Runs *slightly* big. When i tied the straps it created a gap in the back of the dress. But it stays up and fits nicely. Headband was a nice addition.Happy with this purchase"
5.0,"This was a present for my boyfriend, he loves it! His cards were getting bent in his old wallet, no problems with this money clip! He's had it since Christmas and has had no issues, still looks great."

5.0,Love the wide waist band
5.0,"I bought this hoodie for my nephew, he loves it! Won't take it off...."
5.0,These are great!  I am going to hang them from the chandelier in my closet!
5.0,I absolutely love it! It looks even better in person and it is every bit as described by the seller. Well worth the price.
5.0,Good thickness.
5.0,This runs ex sm i bought a large and should of bought a ex large but it fits i weigh 140 and I'm 5'2 This robber is GORJISSSS the color amazing the style beautiful if you have big breasts like mine we are in trouble but i will find a way to make it work or just get extra large you must have !!!!!!
5.0,I was impressed from the start with the quality. The appearance is great. I would buy it again without hesitation.
5.0,"I was looking for aquamarine earrings, and these were really pretty.  I like the leverback earrings, and they weren't too long or heavy.  They were just the size I was looking for, and the stones are really beautiful. I have an aquamarine ring that was my grandmother's, and these went so well with it.  I wore it for my son's wedding."
5.0,"Intention is to carry this when we go someplace that you need tickets scanned. Worked great since it fits a water bottle, a thin pencil-case type zipper wallet, soft eye glass case, Kleenex, pen, small hard candy, Iphone 10X with a case. Comfortable to dance and wear cross-body. Strap is soft and very long (I'm 5'1""). The plastic is pliable and seems strong and clear.  I also attach a carabiner for my mask and hand sanitizer."
5.0,Love this dress. Wore it for my birthday. Classy & sexy. Fits true to size and material is great.
5.0,My Beautiful granddaughter had picture day at day care and she was just so beautiful. I got a new phone and I wanted to upload her passport photo. It is so funny and cute. Thank you.

5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it and wears it every single day!
5.0,Super cute anklet and great price. I wore it all weekend in a water park and was really expecting it to break or turn green but it did not. It can be adjusted for a better fit. Love it!
5.0,Love this  coat. And it even has a hood! Just not for winter weather.
5.0,"First watch I've ever owned. Looks nice, arrived functioning, and in its own case. Love the brown leather band, and the dark face of the watch in the rose gold. The gold color isn't too shiny or eye catching, which is perfect for me. I just wanted a nice looking watch, and this fit the bill."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4125afc74d71fc45cd0f5c905293f16d]] **I got a discount for this product, but my review is that of my own free will. I was not influenced by anyone in any way nor obligated to write a review. This is my personal opinion of this product. I am simply sharing with you what I personally think of this product. If you have any questions, please comment below and I will answer as soon as I can.<br /><br />ordered and received: BLUE<br /><br />This luggage shows in CM, not inches. It says in the description that it measures: 35x23x57 CM which is approximately 13.77&quot;x9.05&quot;x22.44&quot; in inches. This suitcase appears to be strong and is very light weight. I was surprised at how lightweight it is. You can use this suitcase as a carry-on, on your flight. After rolling the suitcase around every day to test it out, I found that the wheels are supportive and durable. It features a spacious main compartment with full interior lining.<br /><br />You can carry this suitcase by hand or use the featured handle. Great for traveling. I'm going to Taiwan for a month and this will come in handy. It features a shell that absorbs the impact and flexes back into shape and an aluminum telescopic handle system with push-button locking for easy maneuverability. This suitcase also features a fixed combination lock offers extra protection for your treasured belongings. There is an instructions card attached to the suitcase. I noticed a keyhole, but no key came with it, though. It seems to be well balanced. There are four easy glide double wheels that provide a 360-degree easy-pivot mobility. There is ample room inside with zippered compartments to keep your belongings well organized.<br /><br />I'm not sure on price point as I did research to see what else was out there on the market and pricing and from what I can tell, the price is about right for the quality of the suitcase.<br /><br />PROS:<br />All-Purpose<br />Adjustable Handlebar<br />Lightweight<br /><br />CONS:<br />none that I can see<br /><br />OVERALL:  I really like this suitcase. It's a good quality product."
5.0,Love this top!  Super comfy and doesn't wrinkle hardly at all.  It's on the larger side and even though I usually wear a large top and medium bottom I could easily do a medium in the top.  Fabric is very flowy and soft.
5.0,Awesome.  Helps stop me from moving in a way that will hurt my back.  Way for comfortable than the big bulky back brace I was wearing.
5.0,"It was easier to make a list of pros and cons for a review so here they are:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- very stylish and unisex<br />- they come in a reusable cloth bag (good for storage, on the go)<br />- patterns are varied, so it's easy to remember what is dirty and clean<br />- contoured to fit over your shoulder and around your neck<br />- triple layered for extra absorption (*see tag and bag: pattern side = 100% organic cotton, back = terry cloth, but I don't know what the 3rd layer is)<br />- terry cloth has some texture so it won't slide off your shoulder, but it's very soft, which is nice if you're wearing something sleeveless<br />- both sides are very soft<br />- comes with 5 cloths<br /><br />Cons:<br />- contour fits your neck but provides less coverage (not really a con, but could be a personal preference for someone.)"
5.0,"It is on a thicker side of silk, though great quality."
5.0,"Muy bonito, sin problemas."
5.0,"This watch is a gift for my son to replace a broken Timex. He just opened it and is in awe! It is very lightweight and fits his fairly large wrist well, there are extra holes available in the strap. We both love the detailing and the infinity symbol. The leather strap has no scratches as I noted in some other reviews.<br />I actually want one for myself and know of someone else who would love this as a gift."
5.0,"It was gift, she loves them"
5.0,"First time know that there is this kind of garden gloves, very useful and convenient."
5.0,makes fireworks even more spectacular.
5.0,"Dress fits small, I got a large and a medium and they are practically the same size and length. Disappointed."
5.0,Love this product. ❤
5.0,Comfy fits well
5.0,So cute! Quality fabric. Would purchase again!
5.0,"I bought these for my 5 year old grandson. He chooses to wear these over his sneakers, because they’re easy to put on and comfortable.  I like them because they can get wet/ waterproof.  Perfect summer shoe/Sandler. Appear durable too!  I would definitely recommend!"
5.0,"I ordered up a size per feedback, and I love it!"
5.0,"This is a very cute dress.  The arms fit a bit tight, but everything else was true to fit."
5.0,"These are really good quality, cute earrings. I have sensitive ears and I was able to use these in both of my cartridge piercings without any irritation. You get so many pairs for a great price!"
5.0,"This dress speaks for itself, definitely a head turner for sure! The top is lace & it is see through so if your not into wearing stuff like that then you’ll want to wear something underneath. Depending on your bust size you can get a good fit by pulling the skirt lower/higher or you can kinda pull the back of the neck into a knot for a tighter more secure fit. I found that pulling the lace further apart makes the bust look better. And the back is wide open. The skirt is faux leather in front & stretchy material in the back, so you’ve got a little room to breath. I thought this dress was extremely comfortable, especially considering there isn’t much to it. You definitely feel over exposed but it’s also kinda fun & liberating. I am SO happy with this purchase, I absolutely LOVE this dress - SO unique. Great product, good condition, fast shipping! If you found my review helpful, I would appreciate you clicking yes - thanks!!!"
5.0,I love these! They always fit great and are comfortable.

5.0,Second bra I bought from them. Got the black before. I got the yellow color this time. Fits true to size. I am an xs in clothes and bought a small in these. Medium is too big. The color of this yellow however is greener than pictured.

5.0,Thank you . Excellent quality
5.0,I love these. They are the perfect size for my blouse.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1c6cb112c60932b51f4ff8b5f31e6600]] I’ve paid more for less quality! This band has some weight to it and the quality is much better than others that I’ve paid more for. It fits perfect and doesn’t spin around my wrist. Stays in place nicely.
5.0,"Bigger than the picture looked to me, but still beautiful"

5.0,"I was little worry because was not review about this item and was the cheapest of all that I looked in Amazon, but I couldn't afford to pay more so I take my chances, and I'm happy that I did.  Is amazing the fabric that is made, super soft jacket and fits perfectly. I order small, Im 5,2 feets and weight 149 pounds, it was pretty nice. Definitely will buy again.<br /><br />Estaba algo preocupada porque no habían reviews de este artículo y era el más barato de todos los que vi en Amazon, pero la verdad no podía pagar más así que tome mis riesgos y estoy feliz de haberlo hecho. La tela es increíble, la chaqueta es super suave  y me quedó perfecta. Ordene pequeña, mido 1.61 mts y peso unas 149 libras, el largo es excelente y cierra muy bien."
5.0,Perfect for my family trip to Disney
5.0,Are you looking for the perfect wizarding outfit? Try this cape. It’s absolutely purple and silk. Perfect for your shamans cave or wizard circle. Bye.
5.0,When I ordered these I thought they were going to be similar to sweat pants but was very relieved to find out they definitely aren’t. They’re thin and very light and extremely comfortable. I love that the tie on the top is actually useful and not for decorations. They’re very breathable and I’d love to order 10 more! Highly recommend!
5.0,SO soft!
5.0,The polarized lens are good. The right lens was a little tight to put on but it fit.<br /><br />No complaints here
5.0,"Wow as soon as I opened my package I was thrilled at how sick it looks! Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a bifold wallet! Not only is it tight cause it has a rebel crest on it but I love the way it (low key) stands out. If anyone buys this product because of my review, May the force be with you. And if not then you belong on the dark side don’t talk to me."
5.0,My 9 yo is into mermaids so the mermaid carry case is perfect for her.
5.0,"Dress is really pretty and fits well.  My only issue is that the bust area can be a bit revealing depending on what bra you wear/ your bust size (but I just fix that with some fashion tape).  I am a 34B.  The &#34;belt&#34; is a bit long, but you can wrap it in different ways to create a unique accent look."
5.0,I like it my only question is where to buy filters for this mask ? Thanks<br />Likewise do I still need to have N95 as an added protection when I wear this
5.0,Love this top.  Well made and color is true to pic

5.0,Ordering 2 sizes to big seems to have done the trick.  It is fine now.
5.0,"This robe is SO beautiful. The color is so rich and gorgeous, it is a very comfortable robe as well. The fit is very good. A tad bit on the short side, but nothing scandalous. The lace makes it look longer, but when you wear it, it feels much shorter. It is very feminine and elegant. I bought it to wear while getting ready on my upcoming wedding day, and it matches my wedding color really well."
5.0,"Fit nicely, absorbend."
5.0,"Love this scarf shawl, the fabric is nice, soft, classy, classic This will make a great Christmas gift for your lady. Perfect for your mother, MIL, SIL, coworkers, you don't know what to give. love it! Definitely exudes a luxurious Hermès vibe!"
5.0,"Comfortable, fits perfectly  and price exceptionable as I paid much higher for another moccasin and this one is I think a better product."
5.0,This skirt is super cute! I am 5'10&#34; and it fit below the knew and on my natural waist.  The material was awesome and there is a short liner underneath.  I will buy a lot more of these skirts.
5.0,My daughter wore this for a semi-formal event and she looked amazing.  The corset lace back ensures a perfect fit.

5.0,"There wasn't anything that I didn't like about these cargo pants. I love the way they looked on my husband. He is really enjoying them. He has decided that they will be his go to pants to relax in sound the house, but they were originally purchased for vacation. Im just happy that he is enjoying the pants."
5.0,I like the way they look and feel on my face. Truly polarized and light weight. Mine came with a pouch and a nice case. Great use for my fishing trips!
5.0,"34B, wide-ish shoulders - I loved this dress, and it was nice enough to wear to a wedding. The seams and over all quality was good. Only thing I noticed, but didn’t mind, was the cut around the arms was a little wider than I expected. See pic"
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for her fathers ashes.  She lost her first one in a horrific car accident she was in.  I love this one and she does too.  I love the saying and the design.
5.0,LOVED THEM ! BETTER THAN I EXPECTED ! THANK YOU !
5.0,"One of my cameras has tiny shackles for wrist straps only. These work badly with winter gloves, so I decided to attach a spare neck strap. Except none of my straps would fit the small shackles meant for a wrist strap. The wide ring fit the strap perfectly & for short money.<br /><br />Let's hope they're durable."
5.0,"For the price, this was surprisingly cute. The bottoms hot in that weird spot just below the belly button, where I would have rather had it come up a bit higher. Other than that, great suit."

5.0,"I love that these don’t have a draw string. They feel like a hybrid legging/jogger. They fit just above my belly button and make me feel so slim. The material is thick enough to not show dimples, while also being super soft. I bought a medium. I’m 5’4, about 135 pounds and athletically built.  I couldn’t construct a more perfect pant."
5.0,"I wear almost every day not sure how it holds up with water but I take it off and put it back on each day. Love it, so pretty."
5.0,"Can't beat the price, fits great. I also go the matching shorts which I loved as well great light weight workout gear."

5.0,Great fit. Wife loves it. Wears it to shinedown shows.
5.0,Love the color and fit. A+

5.0,Best thing ever and the cheapest I have ever seen
5.0,"I loved this dress. I liked the deep pockets and that you couldn't tell they were even there. Skirt went past my knees, was comfortable. A little loose in the waist. I would but again in another color."

5.0,Love the variety and duribility of these tie clips.
5.0,"My granddaughter luvs her boots, adorable"
5.0,Loooovvvee
5.0,These are my favorite leggings and I now have 4 pair! They are buttery soft which was exactly what I was looking for! I am 5”0 so the high waist comes us extra high but I have this problem with all pants. I definitely recommend trying these amazing leggings!
5.0,"I SO appreciate all the reviews with pictures! It really helped to see the dress on ""real people"", and I am so GLAD I bought it! I received SO many complements. I wore it to a gala for The Exodus Road, an organization that frees Women and children and even men from the sex slave trade and modern slavery! (The work they do is amazing!) The fact that this dress looked perfect for the event at the inexpensive price was awesome! Its very comfy and I love the fit and shape. It has just enough stretch to make it comfortable. Also it covers a post ""baby belly"" and ""ate too much"" so it was great for wearing to the dinner!"
5.0,"It's lovely, I recommend it. Look good and stay shiny."
5.0,"Wore during pregnancy, it's very comfortable and cute. I got it in my regular size."
5.0,"Nice fit, colors stay vibrant even after washing. Love it!"
5.0,"These are fine. They are bigger than I thought they were but that's on me. I didn't have a ruler. It didn't work for my cartilage piercings like I wanted, but I put them in my bottom hole and they are good. I do know now I don't like the little round ball backs. I can hardly grip then to twist them off. But that's me and my fat fingers not the product. 😉"
5.0,products are as described.
5.0,"I love the butterflys, an it's soooooo comfortable."
5.0,"Great belt. It holds my pants up just like leather, but without all the murder."

5.0,This shirt was amazing! The material was nice. It zipped on the side. Definitely recommend this shirt!
5.0,"These are my favorite footie pajamas. They are soft, warm and roomy.  They are really comfortable."

5.0,Looking good I'm happy ☺️
5.0,"These are the best leggings I have found to date...the material is thick, yet breathable. The waistband is comfortable and doesn’t create the muffin top some leggings tend to do. They are just the right length (I am 5’7” 180lbs and 6 weeks postpartum, I bought a large) I now own 3 pairs and they are my go to leggings!!"
5.0,Matches photo exactly what you see is what you get well made the quality material is of A+. Fit my wife perfectly.☆☆☆☆☆

5.0,"I use these gloves for cleaning, baking, cooking. A great all around glove for doing everything where you need to protect your hands or protect against germs, viruses, etc."
5.0,Really cute! I’m 5’7” 125 lbs and the small fits great.
5.0,"Let me say that I am so happy with my purchase. This shirt is thin enough to not overheat me but not see thru, perfect length for leggings, so comfortable and a great price! It doesn't poof in ways that accent my hips nor does it cling to me in a way of putting all my imperfections on display. I think I'll probably be buying this in other colors! I did go up a size from my normal size and I'm glad I did so I can wear it with leggings."
5.0,May not fit on a large head
5.0,I purchased the short sleeve dress with green top. The colors are vibrant and come across very beautifully. I received a lot of compliments. I ordered a large. I am 5’2 and 155lbs
5.0,So soft and flexible. Should fit anyone very stretchy. I think u could wear as a shirt but very warm like a coat. Very nice. I like it.

5.0,Got is for a costume/Cosplay and it was perfect!!
5.0,These are nicely constructed high quality cotton socks. They're thick enough to last.  Highly recommended.

5.0,Put them away
5.0,Love this!! Good quality and super cute. Fits perfect!
5.0,"17 years I’ve been waiting for this dress!!! This is THE. DRESS!!! Fulfill your childhood dreams and get this beauty!! It fits well and looks sexy as hell! I’ve worn it a few times and I’ve gotten so many compliments! Especially from fellow women who grew up with 13 Going on 30, and they’re just like “No. Way!!”<br /><br />Yes way!!! Make your inner child happy and get this dress! Show her you’re 30, flirty, and thriving now! Just like she always dreamed you’d be!"
5.0,I’m not a huge person to leave reviews but wow these things are great!!!! Lifts like a few inches!!! I’m only like a b/c cup but I love them and I’ll probably replace my normal bras with them during the summer!!!!
5.0,a little snug around my neck but it was good
5.0,I can't wait to wear it. Super cute and fashionable
5.0,Love these!! Get lots of compliments ☺
5.0,"Good bracelets, keep stretchy quality and don't get worn out. I really like them!!"

5.0,Really nice in person great functionality for the price
5.0,EU is my favourite joggers.

5.0,Won't be breaking off or anything. Cute.
5.0,"Soft , perfect length & fitting"
5.0,"As pictured,  material might be a little warm in the summer. I will have to wear leggings with it because if not....uh oh. It's short on me, I'm 5 6 ish, and curvy."
5.0,These sandals are very comfortable and helped alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. They fit perfectly. The foot bed feels like gel and the arch support is wonderful. They are not too wide but you have room on each side of your foot. Highly recommended if you have foot or heel pain and are looking for shoes that will alleviate your pain.
5.0,Nice shirt and quick shipping.
5.0,Very nice well done product
5.0,Size was close but alittle big
5.0,Super fast shipping..  it looks amazing and can't wait to give it to her as a Christmas gift
5.0,Very comfortable and cute!!
5.0,Haven't worn but very pretty
5.0,"Very comfortable, wore this to my cousins wedding but also a great look for a salsa night or fancy date."
5.0,"Love, love, love this beanie! One thing that was very surprising is that it is authentically from Ireland.  I assume that 99.9% of everything from Amazon comes from China, and this hat is actually made and ships directly from Ireland.  They should tout that a bit more in the description.  Anyway, I know my son will love this hat for Christmas as a reminder of out trip to the Emerald Isle."
5.0,"LOVE the look of these, and I got two for $15?? Can't get better."
5.0,fits perfect on wife.  would buy more body suit like this.
5.0,I Absolutely love this Dress.💝💝💝I lost 70lbs and Iam amazed how my Clothes Fit...😊
5.0,"Smooth hard plastic.<br />Silver butterflies encased over a vibrant color.<br />I got 2, blue and yellow.<br />They're not designer-fashion elegant but they are very cute."
5.0,"Did not expect to get so attached to this Chinese knock-off.  Hand winding is a fun bonus.  It must be a big mainspring, because it winds more like I'd imagine a hefty pocket watch would."
5.0,"This is the best winter hat!  It’s 100% wool and very well made.  It fits well and works well under most hooded jackets.  It’s very warm and exactly like the ones the Army issued back in the 90s.  Great hat, at a great price.  You won’t be disappointed."
5.0,"Very cute and great size, sides can be folded down and still looks and works well."
5.0,"This strapless bra is one of the better ones I’ve ever tried. I received the 2X large, and found that it fit like an XL which is what I normally wear. The pad forms are thick and shape nicely with no bumps. The elastic above and below holds everything in place nicely. The top does not roll down during movement. The bra doesn’t shimmy down when raising your arms either."
5.0,Awesome quality dress. I'm 5ft 8&#34;..it was floor length on me.
5.0,I was looking for undershirts that didn’t get loose and baggy after wearing for a while.<br />These work.<br />My wife dislikes the texture but I’m fine with it.
5.0,"The purse is well structured and exactly what it says it is.  It comfortably fit everything I carry, and has multiple compartments.  It does not stink, just a very faint smell of leather which I love.  The shoulder strap is not long enough to be a shoulder strap for me, but that is ok because I won't use that part anyway.<br />The reasons I did not give it a 5 star are the facts that-  It's a little pricey for what you get.<br />And instead of black, they sent me an ox-blood color that I don't even see listed.<br />Mind you- I will not be returning it, because the ox-blood color is really pretty. And I don't do returns very well-  that is on me.  But I would think that you should get what you order first time out.<br />I&#34;m pretty harsh in my rating -  but when you are looking forward to something, you've paid good money for it, and it comes and is not exactly what you ordered- then you have to deal with returning the item .. It's definitely a point killer for me.<br /><br />NEW NOTE:  This company really cares about helping you out.  I had originally given 3 Stars more so because the color was wrong.  But I absolutely love the purse.  It is beautifully made, high quality and the color, they really should play up on this color, I may have picked it anyway instead of black.  The  company CONTACTED ME and is making things right immediately.  That is true customer service."
5.0,I've gotten these panties 3 times. The first time I bought it. I got my normal medium size. And they were so huge. Had to give them to my sister. But the quality was so good that I've gotten a small for myself and a large for my mom. Love how comfy they are. Would recommend.
5.0,I am in love with this cut and brand . As an educator that is 5’10 and weighs about 198. This dresses are PERFECT! I am struggle to find max dresses long enough but this line is perfect
5.0,We got this in yellow.<br />Really beautiful.  I am impressed with the quality.  It is a thicker bathing cap than I was expecting.<br />It has lovely raised flowers all throughout.  It feels nice when worn.  It keeps the water out completely and did not cause any head pain when wearing it like some of these can.<br />I am very happy with this cap.<br />I love to wear this while swimming as my hair is very susceptible to overdrying from the chlorine.<br />I did receive a discount on this item for my honest and unbiased opinion.
5.0,"Demasiado lindos, tal cual se muestra en la imagen!"
5.0,"I LOVE my Pikle! It's my 2nd one & ive given them to my daughter & daughters in law as gifts! I keep 1 in the glove compartment of my car & have used it many times. Mine had the sewing kit, Kleenex, hand-sanitizer, clippers & tweezers, mirror with floss..stain remover & more!"
5.0,This is an amazing coat for the price. I’ve been wanting a similar one that is over $200. If you want to put any kind of chunky knot under it size up. I bought my typical size small and it fits perfectly however I will not be able to get a chunky knot under it. It’s warm for the price. I live in a very cold climate and have worn this on days when the temp has been in the teens (f). Is the coat the warmest? No-but you get what you pay for. I got it for the pattern. I would say a perfect coat for 30’s.
5.0,The earrings and necklace are beautiful.  I bought them for my daughter who absolutely loves them
5.0,Perfect and good timming.
5.0,"good band very durable, nylon band is a hundred times more comfortable than the ones that come with the watch, can wear it snug and it doesn't leave imprints like the silicon one does."

5.0,"I absolutely love this hat, totally cute and I love that I can still wear my high ponytail while shading my eyes 😍😍😍😍"

5.0,"Loved the watch, exactly as ordered so many compliments!!"
5.0,Love this dress. Am 5’9 190lbs and bought an XL then returned for a L. The fit is really great. It’s a forgiving cut and the dress itself is very comfortable. I wore it for a Mardi Gras event and the purple was perfect. It was not too short for a function and I was very comfortable. I may get another in black.
5.0,love it it's the perfect size and really good quality

5.0,"Was just as described and pictured, and shipped/arrived fast' an incredible value for the price!"
5.0,"Once I k new details of how it  is made, I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,"These socks are awesome! Super soft and thick and I love that they are so long! Great colors! These will be great for colder weather. I have washed AND dried these and so far have had no issues. Other reviewers noted that they fell apart in the dryer but I did not have that problem. Also keep in mind everyone has a different dryer and if yours is old or worn, it could possibly cause holes in your garments. I have a high efficiency washer/dryer and have had absolutely no problem. Definitely recommend these socks to other moms!"
5.0,"Love these! Brought them on a snowboarding trip to wear in the cabin. So comfy and the waistband is seamless on the front and just a little elastic on the back, to keep them from sliding down. Very flattering. I got the black in a Large. I am 170 and I probably could have sized down but I wanted to be safe. I have bad luck with online pants fitting. Size down for a more fitted look or stay true to size and be comfy as heck!"
5.0,"complete coverage on face, pretty and I can breathe easier"
5.0,"We heat our house with wood, and have been through all kinds of firewood bags that don't last.  This is heavy duty, built to last. Holds a huge load and doesn't leave dust all over.  You'll never buy another bag for firewood."

5.0,I wear bifocals and don't always want to wear my contacts when running errands so I needed an affordable option to allow me to still wear my glasses while driving. I made sure to get the correct size and shape that fit my oval shaped bifocals and Voila! I can fashionably block the sun with these clip on shades! I fiind it easier to clip them on while wearing my bifocals versus trying to clip them on while holding my glasses. I loved the quick shipping and the price was right! Highly recommend these to anyone wanting to be able to wear prescription glasses in the sun!
5.0,This is my first pair and they are AWESOME! I Wear an 11 and they fit perfectly. So so comfortable like walking on a pillow. Please make more styles that doesn't go between the toes.  So glad I found them.

5.0,It is a very heavy chain and well worth the price!
5.0,Great cold weather gear.  Attractive and very comfortable.  I did have to exchange for a larger size however.
5.0,"Super cute for a one-piece suit! Holds my 34DDs up nicely & securely, despite not being adjustable, which is awesome! Torso is a bit large, but I have a short torso, so this would be good for a tall person as well as average.  I’ve gotten a ton of compliments!"

5.0,Love this turkey suit!
5.0,"This is a nice, lined, cotton, turned-up stingy-brim pork-pie hat in black. It appears well made and gets shipped speedily and well packed. It comes in two sizes, S/M and L/XL. The sizes run large. I usually take a L but for this hat I needed a S/M, which still was a bit large. The company was very helpful on the size issue. Classy hat, I like it like that."

5.0,I was a little scared to buy this dress but don’t hesitate! Do get a size under what you normally get because this dress is stretchy and fits so nice! I’m a blingy girl though so I have to add a lot to the dress! (Belt wise)
5.0,I get an xl in most things so I was surprised the large fit me. But I had to risk it because the dress is so beautiful. It really is lovely and now a favorite of my clothes.

5.0,"good service, on time, quality product"
5.0,These little things are amazing. Perfect for those of us in-between-ers where we need bifocals but don’t have the RX until the next exam. Life savers!!
5.0,Love the glasses. Too cute.
5.0,"I've had it for almost a year now. I have only one &#34;problem&#34; with it, the posts are too close to fit a cigarette between them unless you pinch the end. It still works wonders but it was a bit annoying when I still smoked. Still though I'm glad I got it! The battery lasted a week with extreme use (4-5 times a day plus me playing with it), and even after dropping it several times it only has a slight gouge on the bottom. Built to last and that is what it does."
5.0,"These were amazing! So comfortable also! Never slipped off, I was shocked! Definitely a good purchase!"

5.0,Has a good T-shirt material instead of that thin itchy stuff.
5.0,The product runs a little small
5.0,Fast delivery! Well packaged! My apple watch 4 nike+ 44mm fits perfect! Would love if it was fully enclosed but nonetheless the product is still very protective! HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the price!
5.0,My only complaint is that there is a size or two missing from the pack and the silicone is made very cheap. Very thin material and double flared. Making it very hard to wear. Everything else seems to be in check.
5.0,"This review is for all my fellow RN's and anyone who is working 12+ shifts. These socks are awesome. After about 8 hours of working my feet start to hurt and I have this pain under the arch of my foot and no matter what shoes I wear I always have this pain. So, I decided to give these socks a try and let me tell you!, my feet were not hurting until the end of my shift (which wasn't as bad as my usual pain) and overrall my feet felt great throughout my shift. Give these babies a try and you won't regret it!"
5.0,Great product. I love the quality and the overall look. Super nice packaging and great customer service.
5.0,Excellent case.  Though if your charger has a think end it may not fit.

5.0,"Birthday gifts for my grandsons,  they love them!"
5.0,"This is a great shirt. I wish I had it in every color. The neck is a little wide, but the rest of hit hugs nicely. From the other reviews I knew this would be just a long T-shirt, but the design and my curves makes it fit perfectly."
5.0,"I wasn’t expecting much from this top but it ended up being SUPER cute! I’ve even washed it twice and it hasn’t fallen apart. For the price, I thought for sure it’d be a one and done but I was wrong… and I’m so happy."
5.0,These gloves are basic knit gloves. I bought them to go with some beanies for the winter. I love the color of the red. It’s very bright in person. The are thinner tho so I wouldn’t use these to shovel snow or anything. I would buy thicker ones for that.
5.0,Very nice 👌 she loves it and it's great quality and will be perfect her trip to Florida

5.0,Needed longer athletic shoe laces.  The length was exactly as advertised.  The quality of the lace is as good as laces that come with new shoes.  There were two sets of laces in the package - and though that is not uncommon - that is a nice value added to the purchase.
5.0,I’m 5’8” and 180 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits how I expected. I wanted it a bit roomy in the tummy section. It’s super cute and good quality! And the shoulder detail is so cute! Got lots of compliments when I wore it.
5.0,I love this bag! It's really bright and gets you in the mood to workout!
5.0,"This is a beautiful necklace. I gave this to my daughter as a gift. she loves different jewelry. this made her happy, she love the vintage look as I do . She also wears a lot of key necklaces, this one gave a little Bling to her other key necklaces. I would recommend this to any one that likes this new style of jewelry"
5.0,Very different - shiny and beautiful - easy to put on.
5.0,Love this! Purchased for a game but it would go so well with a costume. It’s a smaller necklace. It doesn’t look fake or cheaply made either. Very happy with the purchase!
5.0,Absolutely perfect.  Fit and color are spot on.
5.0,Good for cooler mornings. Fit as expected.
5.0,"I actually bought these to wear under my scrubs, and since I like my under scrubs to fit tight these worked great. I wouldn’t describe this as a true compression shirt though, just form fitting. It is also thin so it may not keep you warm if that’s what you’re looking for."
5.0,Like the way it fit and felt
5.0,Just needed a little cushion for my knees while dancing and these did the job.  If you want thicker knee padding then these are not it.
5.0,The inside of this hat is extremely soft!  The size is a great fit for my 1 year old and the different color options means I can match with any outfit.
5.0,Beautiful work! Thank you
5.0,A little bigger than I thought which is perfect it fits my Samsung 8 plus phone and let's meet carry everything I need downsizing from a very large purse perfect
5.0,"All I know is doing our field exercise when it was 3 degrees outside would’ve been a BITCH without these gloves. I’ve owned some gloves in my days but lemme tell you, none like these ones. Windproof, water resistant, WARM, these things do it all. Almost caught them on fire during the field exercise, so I can confidently say they aren’t fire proof. But overall, 10/10, look no further, these things are amazing at keepin ya mits warm."
5.0,This is one of my absolute favorite skirts. It really makes a statement.
5.0,Beautiful earrings! Really looking forward to wearing them. Thanks!
5.0,Love these every time i buy them! Real quarts and amethyst! Beautiful pieces!
5.0,"So perfect - solved my problem.  My husband has sleep apnea and needs a collection of pillows to sleep well.  One of those is a big wedge pillow (24&#34; x 24&#34; x 12&#34;).  He needed to take his pillows on a trip by airplane, and was wondering how he was going to deal with his pillows.  They fit perfectly in this bag.  It was easy to check the bag (too big for a carryon), and it was easy to carry it around.  It seems to have held up well so far.  I can imagine other uses for this bag - it might be great for transporting laundry, it could be great for storing blankets and comforters."
5.0,"Now no one has to ask where the bathroom is! When I have parties, it's a bit painful to have to explain to folks as they walk down the hall that the bathroom is directly down the hall. They always want to open my office door. Now I can say, you can't miss the one with the toilet sign on it. When they return, they usually chuckle at the signage.<br /><br />This went on smoothly, with no problems at all."
5.0,Me gustó la calidad
5.0,"The title says it all. This is, BY FAR, the best replica belt WWEShop sells. Its heavy and the plates are THICK. The ONLY downfall is the crappy strap but I will have it re-leathered soon."
5.0,"Thought it wouldn't look as inexpensive as it does, but the price was cheap. Item is fine."
5.0,"This jumpsuit made my two year old granddaughter’s day! She’s 2 and a half and this said size 2-3 on amazon. When I got it (in 2 days and I’m not a prime member) it said size “first grade”. Huh? It’s definitely big for her, and she’s petite....but it’s good enough for her to have fun in for that great price. Unicorns and sparkly fabric...what more could a girl ask for!"
5.0,"I bought this for vacation. Worked perfectly, carried just enough. It expands which is very helpful..."
5.0,This has been a very useful tool in my sewing room!
5.0,"Love these shoes!! They fit perfectly. I wear an 8 1/2, which is what I ordered. Love the Blowfish brand!  I will order more of these in different styles/colors."
5.0,Very nice size and light weight. Thank you.
5.0,"Hat was a bit too small but I made a few adjustments to make it fit! And the costume was hard to put on, but the cosplay had great quality and came with everything in the picture!"
5.0,"I love these dresses. I mostly wear them around the house but they are so comfortable. I have purchased 5 so far in multiple designs and colors. Would highly recommend them. They are very attractive. Great summer dresses. I'm 5'5-1/2"" and they come below my ankles. The waist is stretchy so it is very comfortable as well. I'm small chested but the bustline fits well without being too baggy. I have sewn some attractive buttons at the cleavage so it's not so low cut as I am very modest. I have also used some attractive pins for the same purpose."
5.0,Best watch maded. Any thing else ego.
5.0,i love them but so much smaller than i imagine them to be
5.0,"Love these! Bought 1 pair to try them out, then ended up buying 2 more pair."
5.0,"I purchased these originally at Walmart, however, when my granddaughter out grew them and kept trying to put them on her feet I needed to find them. Thank you for having her size and keeping her happy!"
5.0,I love them! They don't cut off circulation at knee and they don't fall down!
5.0,I got this for my daughter who wanted her own purse. It’s very cute and it seems sturdy. The only thing is that it’s a little small so fitting a kid’s wallet in it is difficult.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:933ec003cad8b58bdd15a8f944265c1a]] Very Well Made and Silky Smooth Plus Size Tankini.  See video for full review and measurements.
5.0,High quality material and so fun! I wore mine to a potluck!
5.0,"I bought as present for my son, he really liked. Heavy duty and well made. Fits well and  all designs are pretty. My son loved it"
5.0,Dress runs a little smaller then I expected so I went up a size and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Product fit well. I loved the color and how soft the fabric felt. It was a great blouse at a great price!!
5.0,The material was a little cheap feeling but it was what I expected as far as size. Very comfortable
5.0,Wonderful fast service and great tropical pattern.
5.0,I love the size and shape
5.0,Love this dress . Very flattering and a beautiful color . I’m only 5 feet tall and the length is a little long but still flattering
5.0,My grandson very happy with this product
5.0,"This scarf is beautiful. It's colors allow me to wear it with lots of different wardrobe items; and the design allows me to change the look just by folding it or twisting it differently. People keep asking, ""another new scarf?"". Lightweight enough for summer wear. Great price."
5.0,"Bought as a gift. Five months later it had held up several washes and wears well each time. My husband loves it. Nice soft fabric and nice silk screen print, not a iron-on. Love that!"
5.0,The nike tech was a great price that I couldn't pass by. The item came on time and it was exactly what I ordered.
5.0,Works really well. Very comfortable. Jus a little larger than expected. I usually wear size M women US size. My husband wears it lol
5.0,"I had set my expectations very low so I wouldn't be disappointed, boy was I wrong. The pendants are very nice, the runes are all correct and I received all 24 runes. Amazing truly amazing."
5.0,Nice fit great for mowing lawn and going to beach. Hat stays on doesn't blow off with wind and it's cool to wear
5.0,"Love it. Classic look, nice pin that stays in place the way it’s supposed to. It drives me nuts when pins spin all over the place. It’s a nice size, too. Big enough that it’s easy to identify without being overly large. Looks lovely on my lanyard. It arrived ahead of schedule, too."
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves this hoodie, material is thin and very picky, if you order do not place in the dryer after washing it will shrink. Overall a very good item!"
5.0,"These are my new favorite pants. I’m 5’7, 140. The length is perfect. The pants are soft and flowy. I bought the white. They aren’t see through. I just ordered the black."
5.0,How fun to add a greyhound plate frame to my already GREYT license plate! We love our adopted greyhounds. Thank you!
5.0,It fit great and looked amazing too! It has gone through a good amount of wear and tear and still looks good. It’s also soft and I would recommend getting it.
5.0,Fabric is thick and well made. Great quality for price. My son loves it!
5.0,Works & looks great.
5.0,Nice fabric and a great option for a midsize tote.
5.0,"At a larger size, the cups are not padded, but they do give nice shape.  The seamless cups are perfect for t-shirts.  The clasp was daunting at first, as it requires two hands, but I quickly adjusted.<br /><br />No, this bra is not the most beautiful nursing bra out there, but it fits a wide range of sizes, gets the girls supported nicely, and my 3 bras have lasted 3 years!<br /><br />The underwire is very far back under the arm to help prevent plugged ducts.  Nice wide shoulder elastic straps.<br /><br />I highly recommend Elomi bras.<br /><br />(As a side note, I went to Nordstrom and was fitted properly for this maker of bra, then came to Amazon and bought 2 more in the same size and style for significantly less money.  If you cannot go get professionally measured, you absolutely should measure at home and use their sizing chart.  We all know how manufacturers vary size to size!  The right size bra actually helped reduce my shoulder and back pain.)"
5.0,Like the fit and the logo without all the scrambled eggs on the bill.
5.0,I didn’t realize I was buying all 10. I kept a few for myself and gave others as gifts.
5.0,"I love them.  I wear a 7 wide, orderd a medium and they are perfect.  Not sure if you're foot is much bigger that they would fit.  Like I said...I love them!"
5.0,"Great, I only wish the top if the purse was the same width as the bottom.  It's slightly narrower, makes it a little harder to put things inside.  And it's look a little more sleek if the straps weren't so wide. But good experience buying a purse online.  I'll be buying more in the future"
5.0,This is an absolutely gorgeous ring that is well worth the price. I am really happy with the quality of it.
5.0,Made better than I expected it to be! Comfortable and looks good too !
5.0,Sparkles as well in real life as in the pictures.
5.0,"Looks just as it does in the picture. I usually wear large hats but I also have very think hair, still, nice & floppy, if that's your thang! Ships from China, so be patient I received mine within Two weeks. The price is nice too, so you can't go wrong"
5.0,LOOKS GREAT FITS GREAT!
5.0,My son loved this mask! The lights were a plus. It definitely makes for a good present.
5.0,"Great shirt for summer riding with an excellent price, purchased a second one!!!"
5.0,Great socks! Fit is great. I live in Alaska and these are very comfortable in winter boots or regular shoes. Great price also since these generally run $10-12 more in my area.
5.0,Good pair of gloves. It covers the wrists very well. The touch screen ability actually works well!<br /><br />Run slightly larger in size than expected.
5.0,"I bought these for my son for Crew, first day he had them, the temperature dropped to about 50 degrees in March with high winds, he said his feet were warm and dry when everyone else was complaining about how cold and wet their socks had gotten.  Totally worth the price!"
5.0,My son lived it.
5.0,Looks exactly like the photos. Nice set for a holiday party!
5.0,beautiful and well done
5.0,No complaints! Good glasses!
5.0,"Quality material, fit your face perfectly."
5.0,Fit perfect and he loved the hat!! #threekinout
5.0,"Very soft and comfy. I don’t actually wear these in public, just for lazing around the house. I’m 6’5” and I was a little concerned they’d be too short. To my surprise they fit great. I’d say a 34 inseam or so."
5.0,Received today. Thoughtful packaging. Feels and appears to be great quality. Budget friendly. I have lost so many designer glasses that these are a steal! I love the shape and size for my full face. I weight 165. Will be buying more!
5.0,Love them! True to its image and quality.
5.0,i've been wearing this bracelet since i received it an hour ago. it sits next to a watch with a leather strap on my wrist and looks fabulous. it doesn't slide around because of the adjustable end.
5.0,"Love this hat. Keeps me cool since a majority of the cap is white, and the dark bill is perfect for keeping the sun off my face."
5.0,My grandson loves his new slippers. He doesn’t take them off.
5.0,These pants are super comfortable.  The elastic in the waist make them great fitting.  Also very light
5.0,Beautiful shoe.
5.0,Well made and very soft cotton fabric. Darling on.
5.0,I've always worn Sheer Energy - they're a strong nylon which look great because they are nicely fitted.  I'm a 5'1 slender person<br />which makes it difficult to find a nylon that fits perfectly and looks natural.  Love Love Love L'eggs
5.0,"This ring looks badass. After exercising, my fingers swelled up and I thought it was stuck on for a while. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the size can be slightly adjusted up or down as it is not fully connected. Just be careful not to over flex when adjusting. Few millimeters should be ok."
5.0,"An excellent blend of price, performance, size, durability, portability. The spinner wheels didn't let us down as we ended up walking around 3 Kilometers total with the luggage traveling to different hotels through a large city and taking the baggage on several trains. The bags held up well to a long round trip flight and protected their cargo. The TSA locks worked perfectly and added an additional level of security especially when staying in hotels and traveling with bags on trains. The outer finish does scuff, but for me that's not an issue as I value what is in the bags and that the contents stays there and is not damaged. The luggage performed flawlessly."
5.0,I live in the Midwest and we recently had a real cold week (below12 degrees) and this coat kept me very comfortable.
5.0,I work for door dash. I love these because the bottom is sturdy and it holds a lot more than the delivery bags provided.
5.0,These are beautiful I sent them to my daughter and my son-in-law and I sent the ninety five filters that they have placed in between the layers and they use them as actual masks.
5.0,"Great quality! lovely coin, good conversation piece or just a great addition to a collection."
5.0,She definitely loved the pendant. Got here nice and quickly and came packaged quite well and safely so absolutely nothing happened to it. Thanks a lot!
5.0,PERFECT AS I EXPECTED
5.0,Beautiful!! I'm pleased
5.0,Seems to be well made and is cute just like in the picture.  I'm a plus size girl and the adjustable straps allow it to fit great! Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"i love it, it is on my bracelet. good transaction."
5.0,I love this bra!  Super soft and comfortable
5.0,"I like the way it fits i am ususally a small size but I have big boobs so I decided to buy medium, it’s not tight it fits good and is very comfortable I like the quality :)"
5.0,"Great little clock! Much like one I used to have. Well made, fast shipping! Thanks!"
5.0,"Someone gave me a pair of these socks several years ago and they still look and feel great.  I love the carefully mismatched patterns!  I bought myself a couple of pairs and have gifted them as well.  They don’t cut into my skin, they stay up, and they are cozy!  I think they are dryer safe, but I always hang them up to dry and they have stayed in great condition."
5.0,I ordered this for all the past masters in my lodge. They love it. The grand master of South Carolina is in my lodge and he loves it. Hopefully one day I can get me one.
5.0,"I got these over a year ago, color is still good and still cute! To bad they are not available any more! Would purchase again!"
5.0,This charm is adorable and shows up very well inside my large floating locket.  I have gotten complements.  Well worth the tiny price!
5.0,"It looks great, fit perfect, wears great"
5.0,wife loved the jade elephant
5.0,"I love my new pants. They are very comfortable and light, perfect for the fall season. I like this style because it looks like a skirt. As a reference, I am 5'3 tall and 145 lbs. As a transgender woman, I don't have hips, but my waist is 28in. I chose the size small and fits perfectly. These pants also come with an elastic waist. If you are 25- or 32-inches waist, they will fit you. I highly recommend this product...!!!"
5.0,"Very well made, nice bright colors . It has a little padding at the ""little girl bra part"" which give a nice comfort."
5.0,"Very good value.  I wear these for cross country skiing under ski pants.  They are very comfortable and regulate temperature well.  I am tall and thin (6'2&#34;, 175 lb) and the Large size is a snug, comfortable fit.  The top is plenty long.  The bottoms are a bit short (not down to my ankles) but fine with longer socks."
5.0,"Love the string thong. Very simple and no complications. The only bad side is the pouch, I feel it a bit small or my junk. Don't know if it's the size of the pouch but feels a bit tight. Overall, I think it's good, just need to get a bigger size. I'm a 30 waist and I bought a large/medium size. Maybe I'm going to go up a size."
5.0,"This one is the best color quality looking and not See through , is the best looking color , I order more colors and the white was not quality and was looking cheep , but this one is the best quality and color is real nice the the fabric is quality"
5.0,The material es excellent.<br /><br />Coukd use a better zipper but its ok
5.0,Love this dress.....I am 5'2'' and this dress was not too long like other dresses.  The color and fit was perfect.  Wore it on date night downtown Savannah and was complemented by several strangers. I would absolutely recommend this dress and would consider buying again in a different color.
5.0,Light works great
5.0,Para actividades regulares en tiendas y centros comerciales.
5.0,Beautiful earrings different shape  as al<br /> Swarovski’s

5.0,Love them I was running in the snow with these boots and no snow came inside
5.0,"I thought it was cute when I bought it, but love love love it after wearing it!!!"
5.0,"I just received this clutch today and couldn't be more happy! It's beautifully put together and looks just like the picture. It comes with a few extra pearls and shoulder strap. It's the perfect size - big enough for a smartphone, a few cards, perhaps a lipstick or compact & keys. This will be the perfect accessory to my evening/cocktail dresses: classic while also bringing a touch of whimsy. She is vers, y'all!"
5.0,"Daughter used it for a 2 weeks European trip, carrying her Surface Pro all over the places.  The size of the bag is just right for the laptop plus some documentations and misc small items."
5.0,"1st of all I can't believe how quickly the socks got here. 2nd, I love how soft and I'll soft and breathable they are.  Very cute presentation as well and I loved the color selection."

5.0,"This is a beautiful, comfortable dress. I received complements."
5.0,"I bought these to add to my prize box at work.  The lights are actually really bright.  Kids love them, but they are slightly big for some of their fingers.  They provide lots of enjoyment and the batteries last a decent amount of time for the price.  I would definitely recommend them."
5.0,Love this hat! Was delivered as promised and $6 less than at the store!
5.0,"This shirt is perfect for officewear and very flattering. The material is nice enough and it’s comfortable, but looks dressy. I came back and bought the black and maroon as well."
5.0,Great product. Nice price.
5.0,"I wrote a review for Amazon already singing its praise.  But I am literally wearing this particular sweater today in 22 degree weather.  I have received compliments and it is very comfortable.  I cannot ask for more than that.  Obviously, it is warm as well."
5.0,"Comfort material, when in motion or at rest love this face covering and symbol .thanks"
5.0,"These sports bras are great, comfortable and make working out possible without pain. It reduces bounce to a tolerable level, but doesn't completely eliminate it, there is a small amount of bounce in stuff like jumping jacks,Your mileage may vary depending on body type."
5.0,"Bought for my fiancé, they are great and good to have backups!"
5.0,"Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! These socks are soft, warm and fit better than other wool socks we've tried. These fit snugly, but comfortably, around the calf, and the band at the top is snug enough to actually hold these socks up. They are the perfect boot length too!<br />The care instructions are simple and they are machine washable! Yes!<br />There is price printed right in the design of the packaging, and it says $24.95 for the pack of two. Talk about getting a great deal on these! The seller's price is an amazing value!<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. My words and opinions are my own, and in no way influenced by the seller."

5.0,"Good quality material, good size<br />Overall very much pleased with this backpack"
5.0,The inside is lined with a very nice soft material that makes this dress feel more expensive than it is. True to size and not too short!
5.0,Is very soft and fits comfortable!!!
5.0,I love it. It’s comfortable to wear. It’s exactly as advertised! I didn’t expect it to be as good as it is!
5.0,"This mask was surprisingly high quality.<br /><br />It is a full paper Mache mask with flat black coating and black glitter accents.<br /><br />It came with some small blemishes, which stood out white, but were easily covered up by a black grease pen (Common to any makeup kit). A sharpie marker could also work.<br /><br />Held up to a night vigorous dancing without sweat becoming a problem.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5.0,"The earrings are great quality and for the price, couldn't beat it.  Arrived on time."
5.0,Love it fits perfectly... I love hearts so this went well with the rest of my earrings
5.0,"My husbands' grandmother has dementia. She lives next door and loves walking to our house to get away from the memories each day. She can remember to put on a sweater, but remembering a coat is impossible for her. We got her this because it is nice and warm and she won't trip over it like she would a blanket. She hangs it by her door just like she did her sweater and she stays plenty warm in the cold morning air. Perfect gift. And it is soft and cozy."
5.0,I wore this to an evening function that had a diamond theme at my kids' school.  I thought it was very attractive and loved that it wasn't too bulky.  It made me feel elegant.  I plan to wear it again to a wedding.
5.0,"Really beautiful, i want it in red too"
5.0,"Nice quality, fits perfect, better than expected overall!"
5.0,Looks just like the picture! Very comfortable and stretchy. I ordered a size small but typically I am a medium anywhere else. A bit see through. This dress can also be found on Shein.com
5.0,I LOVE these shoes!  I wear them all day when I'm at home and as soon as I come home from work they go on my feet.  Extreemly comfy!
5.0,"These are amazing quality for the price! They are both soft an durable, not to mention cheap."
5.0,"Warm, well made,  and they look classy."
5.0,Love this. Holds a multitude and yet stays slim and easy to access.
5.0,This mask is made of quality material that stands up to gentle washing by hand.  I mistakenly wasted some clear nail polish on mine which ruined it; but loved it so much that I ordered another.  The fit is perfect as it is snug yet does not prevent you from breathing easily.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"I liked these, but I have reddish hair.  I don't know if it would work for other people who don't."
5.0,Fun glasses - these are over-sized and the shape is cool. These glasses are really cute on with combat boots and cargo pants and a beanie hat or a cap. These look expensive and they are well made. Great addition to any accessory collection.
5.0,I wasn't sure about this boot jack. It takes up less space it's easy to use and gets the job done. That's all I really could ask for.
5.0,Pretty and petite earrings with the filigree look! I really like these earrings and recommnend them to anyone who is looking for the antique/vintage kind of jewelry!
5.0,I'm a tennis player and I play all year round.  During the summer I use it for sun and during the winter when I play indoors it keeps my hair out of my face!  You can't even feel like you have it on...light as a feather.  I rinse it off and its dry and ready to go in 20 min.  I have them in many colors and I also use it at the beach...super comfy!!
5.0,Good fit quantity seems ok<br />However the price is great
5.0,"I bought these for my nieces new hubby and he loved them! They fit him perfectly! He wears a 36 & I bought that exact size. Only negative is the fact it doesn’t have a liner. He just wore underwear with them, which he said he usually does anyway. I also bought my nieces “Bride” swimsuit on Amazon, they were so cute!"
5.0,Loved it.  I get many compliments!
5.0,I actually ordered a size down from what I normally wear and they still fit great.
5.0,"Buy a half dozen of these cheap sunglasses, and you will never lose the expensive ones again. It has nothing to do with the quality of these glasses, they're fine.. it's just an unwritten Law of Life."
5.0,Keep me warm at work
5.0,Fits perfectly! True to size and excellent material.
5.0,I already had a pair of blue to wear with a jacket. Very warm.
5.0,"Ready for winter, waiting for my other order ( beige) pants."
5.0,Loved this dress! Wore it for Christmas after just having a baby and it was comfortable and looked great
5.0,Once they came in the mail my 4 year old put them on and wouldn’t take them off. She’s tall for her age but they still come come up pretty high. My husband claims they look like stripper boots; I don’t agree with that though.
5.0,my girl was happy
5.0,It’s awesome belt
5.0,It's the perfect weight material! Very comfortable and extremely flattering tunic! Love it!
5.0,I’m both for my mom (size xxl) and it was very good and she likes it.
5.0,Absolutely dainty and so beautiful
5.0,"This dress is so flattering! It is body hugging, but I think that’s obvious from the picture and if that’s what you’re looking for, it’s a win. Seemed true to size for me (I got a small), not see through and isn’t a super thin fabric. I got the blue and the color is just as pictured and so pretty!"
5.0,beautiful belt that came with some cute gifts
5.0,"I love silver and rose gold. This is an awesome set, especially for the price. It looks way more expensive and fits loosely as I prefer."
5.0,Really comfortable and best for workout. Best for the price
5.0,Son loved this tie for Winterball.

5.0,"I bought the GRID-IT for vacation and for college.  For a girl, I take a lot of electronics, cords, power bricks, etc. with me.  The grips on the Organizer is very stiff and sturdy. If you shake it around the stuff actually stays on the organizer, which is great.  Very good product for any college students or people that travel!"
5.0,This dress is beautiful and comfortable but if you're short and don't know how to cut off excess length and hem stretchy material you should think twice. I had to cut off at least 2 inches. I wish they had a petite sizing as well.
5.0,This band is really smooth and comfortable.  It looks great and I like that I can adjust it whenever I want a tighter or looser fit.  After a couple of months of constant use it shows no sign of wear.
5.0,"I loved LOVED this dress! It’s my Best Buy so far!<br />I got many compliments at the wedding I wore it too. I was 7 months pregnant but the way it flowed on me made me look skinny! Or at least that’s how I felt! Haha In my opinion, it runs smaller than the size. When I purschased it I was a size 12/14. I bought a size 16. However 4 months later when I wore it it still fit. The material did not feel cheap to me. I’d like to buy it in a different color in the future."
5.0,I got this set of gloves and I love them. Easy to put on and take off. They didn't roll back down my arms while wearing them. Stayed in place. Colors are bright.
5.0,Much more comfortable than expected and I love the look. Having 3 ways to chinch up the fit made them fit my foot better than most. I recommend them
5.0,Quality & Comfort. Its exactly what I expected from adidas.
5.0,This is my second purchase. I can't leave them around or they will disappear.

5.0,I wear a medium and I have a nice sized &#34;package &#34; and it feels very comfortable. I suggest washing it before use because it frays a bit. After my first wash no more fraying.
5.0,"I was really unsure about these shoes when I purchased them. I read the reviews and started to get worried they wouldn't fit my 4.5 year old. My daughter has pretty big feet for her age. She wears a size 11.5-12 toddler shoes. I sized up because of the reviews. Size 13 fit her perfectly with a little bit room for growth, maybe an extra 6 months or so. But they are perfect for what we have planned for our daughter. A secret princess cruise!"
5.0,"Cute, stylish, good quality material. My 6 year old loves it because it is more “grown up” than her other swimsuits. She loves the straps back and ties on the bottoms."
5.0,Buena calidad y presentación
5.0,Just worth the buy perfect
5.0,This is easily the best workout set I’ve ever owned. 100% worth the money. I’m in between sizes so I bought one set in a small and one in a medium and they both fit wonderfully so it depends how much compression you like.
5.0,I love the way these are made but it says they are stainless steel and the reviews say they tarnish . Stainless does NOT tarnish so what's the problem? Are they lying in the description? Would love an answer because these are perfectly styled.
5.0,Bracelet arrived as scheduled and looks very nice. Quality packaging in both interior gift box and exterior protective box. I decorated exterior box for gifting too.
5.0,Love it so much!!! Buying more

5.0,"Strong but stiff, very versatile, great value"
5.0,".these rings are gorgeous,  they look expensive.  fit perfect."

5.0,Great lanyard. Stretchy and non scratchy like most.
5.0,"Great slider shorts, would recommend over exalt, empire, and dye sliders. The padding isn't too hard where it feels stiff and slows you down but isn't too soft where it doesn't make a difference."
5.0,my lady friend wore this neckless with a designer dress and it looked as if it belonged in the same class.
5.0,"It fit perfect! I usually order a medium but to be safe I ordered a large, and am very pleased."
5.0,Chunky toddler thighs and knee highs... what's not to love
5.0,This dress is perfect for hot summer days when you want to maximize comfort but still look put together!  Very easy foundation garment to build on.  Got two colors so far this year....lol

5.0,"Great customer service! great product, fast shipping. i got these for my boyfriend he really likes them. says the top hurts. but he still wears them with no problems! will order again for sure!"
5.0,"It’s nothing that I do not like. I gave it to my 12 year old as a gift and he wears it everyday. I’m not sure if it’s worn in the shower but the quality is very nice. The weight is not too heavy, not too lightweight. I recommend this product"
5.0,"I saw this dress in a Buzzfeed article about the best dresses on Amazon. It is indeed one of the best dresses on Amazon! I love it so much I bought 2! The fit is great, fabric soft, pockets perfect and it’s great alone or with leggings!!"
5.0,"True to size and to quote the wife ""that jacket was awesome!"""
5.0,The best shirt stays I've ever purchased or used.
5.0,They worked fine. I was a little concerned when they arrived that we might cut ourselves on the edge of the metal. However we had no problems removing and reinserting the information card.
5.0,I'm surprised by how cute and good quality the skirt is. I just got it and tried it on and it fit perfect! I was nervous that it might fit too long since I'm 5 feet and about 160 lbs. I bought a large and will be wearing it right around my waist/under my bust. I love that it has elastic on the back and also a zipper. I will say that the lines aren't white how I expected it to be in the picture. the lines are gold but still looks really nice. It also has a slip into it and the wool doesn't feel itchy.
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves sloths and this was a fantastic birthday gift for her. It fits very nicely on my 10 year old. She's been wearing it for a few months and it's been holding up very nicely. She never takes it off!
5.0,"Best wallet I've had in numerous years I will love every compartment and I love the color!<br />Thank you,<br />Julie Mintzer"
5.0,"I expected an inexpensive bra to maybe be a little rough or not quite fit right, but this bra is perfect. It fits exactly as I expected, and it's so soft and comfortable! I'm definitely gonna buy all the colors! Highly recommended!"
5.0,"This Tshirt is just what I need for our Woodstock party. The fit is perfect, generous, and long enough to cover ..."
5.0,Such a cute little wallet. My 5 year old is STILL obsessed with Thomas and since we are starting to do the whole allowance thing I wanted to get him a wallet. This is a nice compact size that is perfect for him to put in his wallet when we go to the store. Great find!
5.0,"I bought one of these from a clearance rack last year, and I eventually decided that I needed more than one of these in my bra collection. I call this one &#34;My magic bra.&#34; It gives excellent shape, looks amazing under clothes, is extremely comfortable, and does not give any side or back fat. I hate shopping for bras, so once I find one that works, I feel like I need to buy a few. I wish they were not so expensive, but as I got one on sale I sort of split the cost in my mind to justify the purchase. I also realized that you can only get quality bras by spending a bit of $$. The fabric is silky smooth. I have one in pink and one in black. The sides of the pink do get discolored over time."
5.0,"I love my bathing suit, I have had two kids within the last 3 years so I have the mommy belly right now, and it is super cute with great material."
5.0,Love this on my Fitbit Blaze! Will be getting other colors!

5.0,These earrings are so pretty and fit perfectly. I absolutely love them. They came individually wrapped and in a blue velvet bag.

5.0,It was better quality than I expected. But I would size down tends to run big.
5.0,Perfect for the beach. Nice dangling pieces and are the perfect weight. Feels comfortable.
5.0,I bought these without knowing anything about them.  Aftervwearing them for a few days I can say that these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They bear shoes that cost rwo or three times more hands down. I'll be back for more
5.0,"Absolutely love this purse.  Soft, durable, attractive, straps to carry and straps to carry on shoulder. Plenty of pockets, zippered areas. More than enough space. I highlt recommend this product. Nice quality and classy."

5.0,So soft and warm. Fits exactly as expected.
5.0,It fits our rockabilly style perfectly!
5.0,"Bought this based on the excellent reviews- and yes!! Great purchase.<br />Fabric is heavy enough to lay nicely and not cling.<br />Length is a little short for work IMHO, but could swing it with tights and flats. Change to heels or boots and you’re ready for date night.<br />5’6” 160# wear a 10 in tops and a 12 in pants.<br />Large fit great, but if I was looking for a more body in look, medium would fit."
5.0,Easy to use great clips not too.long for adults  so helps with mask to keep it close when I remove it in the car or when I am outdoors so I do not stuff it in my pocket<br />Allows it to be handy

5.0,Perfect size if you don't want to carry suitcases on vacation.
5.0,Just what was needed to complete an outfit
5.0,Everything I was hoping for. The craftsmanship is fantastic and the materials are of great quality!

5.0,The glasses stopped my eyes hurting bad from my new gavita 1700e all white leds.  They work perfectly where my old glasses utterly failed me.  If you have the new all white led lights you must have these or you will regret it fast.  Buy them now without hesitating if you got the new all white leds.  I wish I had got mine sooner.
5.0,Love the length and it fits just like I wanted it to
5.0,"Not only is the hat good quality (love the ventilation and the shape of the bill),  but FlyBoyToys went online to pull up our tail # and even stylized the colors of the plane on the hat to reflect what our plane looks like. Now THAT is proactive customer service!!!<br /><br />I ordered this for my husband, who was very happy with it, and will now order one for me. I'm also referring this supplier to our Bellanca forum members.<br /><br />Don't you just love it when you run across a company who thinks about working hard to give you a great product?"
5.0,Bought my normal size. It’s beautiful. Casual enough to wear for errands but also formal enough for a wedding. It’s amazing!!!! The belt is definitely needed bc without it you look like you’re in a sack lol but when sinched in it looks amazing.

5.0,"Took these to raves, and b day parties. Really cool. Took for ever to get. Shipping was very slow."
5.0,Very pretty. I am a little concerned that the glass loop that the thread goes through may break if I'm not very careful.
5.0,Another gift for my Granddaughter and she loves it
5.0,Well made and a very comfortable product. Fit as expected
5.0,Great shoes from Italian Shoemakers
5.0,"Great buy, helped with some difficult tiny watches that were easy to open but it very difficult to close."
5.0,"I saw this cap and thought it looked like a cute hat to have on hand for one of the guys in our household.  I did not expect to get attacked, however.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS HAT LIKE?<br />This hat is a great PERFECT newsboy cap.  It has a knit outside which is hard to see in the photo.  The top inset is wide ribbed heavy duty knit and the sides are regular heavy knit.  They are made from part poly part wool, almost half of each.  The lining is woven, however.  That is a gray tweed sort of color- charcoal and dark gray herringbone type coloring.  That lines the cap, and the inner band and the visor.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS HAT LOOK?<br />Well, when I opened the package, I heard a scream from across the room, ""OMG A PERFECT NEWSBOY CAP"".  I was then attacked by my daughter who swiped the hat, put it on and said, ""I am wearing this today"" and I just got it back about a week later.  It really is a cool looking hat.  Perfect proportions too.  My guys will never get a crack at this, because I think my daughter has laid claim to it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WEAR?<br />The only problem that my daughter has expressed is that the front bank tends to itch a bit from the wool fabric.  The lining is about half and half wool poly too but it does seem to bug her a bit.  It does not bother her enough not to wear it, however.  I personally have had a similar experience, but I didn't find it bothered me enough not to wear it yet.<br />I am just sewing a cotton piece of bias tape on the front and it will be fine.<br /><br />WARM?<br />This is a great warm hat for non-windy days of fall, winter, and spring.<br /><br />FIT<br />This fits up to 22 inch head from our experience in our house.<br /><br />WASHING?<br />Hand wash, air dry is recommended.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For an unusual newsboy cap that is warm, fits well, and is really attractive, this is a good choice.  Those sensitive to wool could have some irritation problem due to front band.  It is easily taken care of by sewing in cotton bias tape in the front like we did.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  I really like this hat.  Our daughter has laid claim- but you already knew that.  *grin*"
5.0,"Love this dress, I’m so happy with my purchase."
5.0,I ordered these finger lights along with punching balloons as party favors for my daughters bday party earlier this year.  They were both a big hit!  So I'm ordering more for my son's bday party.  You can't go wrong with these!<br /><br />I was also thinking of handing these finger lights out for Halloween this year instead of candy.
5.0,Thanks Amazon for replacing these slippers. The previous ones....the Velcro didn't stick.......and these do.<br />:)

5.0,SUPER cute!!! My daughter loves the dinosaurs on the dress.  We’ve received so many compliments on it! The fit is as expected— she’s super tall for her age so a little short— but still SO cute.  Great quality for the price!

5.0,I love these shoes - I have a professional job and when I am not wearing heels they give me that &#34;cool&#34; look I want.  They are very fun for a loafer and who doesn't love COACH?
5.0,"Just what my wife has been looking for!! Have purchased 3 sets, 1  for  my wife's friend as she also loved them!!!"
5.0,Gorgeous color and texture feels like silk. Very beautiful design and also elegant looking. I love this sweater. Great buy.
5.0,I love this dress. The quality is great. It's very classy and fits really well! I'm 5'1&#34; and 130 lbs. The small fit me perfectly.
5.0,I use them for when I work out under my work out clothes and they are the best. A good fit.
5.0,Great quality and fit.  Wear it for golf as well as work.
5.0,"Bought these as a solution for what to wear under an orthopedic boot. The wearer has a broken tibia and was issued a Velcro boot as his casting solution (for several months) These have been the perfect underboot wear. They wash and dry in the dryer very well, have not fallen apart and fit a a large 230lb, 5’10” man to above the knee so the can be rolled over at the top. Highly recommend for this purpose. The hospital did not have a long term solution for under the boot that they sent us home with, this sock has been perfect."
5.0,Cute color fine
5.0,"My kids (both boys)  love this sweatshirt.  They wear the same size, so they share it.  The print is gorgeous, and it looks great on them.  They get lots of compliments on it.<br /><br />In our experience, the sizing recommendations from other reviewers might have been a little off.  We ordered an adult medium (even though my sons usually wear adult smalls) based on the reviews.  The medium is actually rather big on them.  I'd say that it fits the way that I would expect a regular medium to fit them.  It's not a big deal, since it will fit them longer and it still looks fine on them.  I'd rather have it fit them too big than too small.  No regrets.  They're growing like weeds."
5.0,What beautiful button pins. I love them. Thank you so much for sending them to me!
5.0,It fits perfectly and was a great price. I wish there were more color options!
5.0,"The shirt dress fitted a little too big. But, I love the dress look. Thank you."
5.0,"This dress looks great on.  I'm 5'1, 126 lbs. I ordered a 10P.  It fits just the way I like it.  Not clingy, but not too loose.  The collar is really pretty.  I'm very happy with it."
5.0,For the price of this bathing suit it fits perfectly and looks great. I'm 5'6&#34; and weight 155lbs. I bought the 12 and it fit perfect.
5.0,"Could not be more satisfied. First purchase was defective. Company reacted immediately and shipped replacement, no hassle, no charge. Could not recommend product, service and company more highly. Thank you Poetic."
5.0,"The material is so soft against my skin, I love it!"
5.0,Muy bonita tela
5.0,"I decided to purchase this product as it would be a sufficient face mask but also serve purpose as a headband protect my neck in the sun.<br /><br />The product is exactly what I thought and is comfortable.  I recommend this as its essentially a bandanna with more uses.<br /><br />Editing this slightly but keeping the same 5 stars.  After using these for a bit and washing them, I noticed they have become slightly tighter around the face (assuming they shrunk a little), specifically just the nose, but overall im still a fan of these."
5.0,The charms are exactly what I expected. They are small enough to fit on the charm bracelets I make. They are made with a gold plated backing to give the charms some depth. Will definitely order some more.
5.0,Very cool and design is on both sides ! Bonus !
5.0,"Beautiful dress with a classic feel. The material is a little stretchy. The only thing I did not  like was the lapels are not firm enough to stay up, so I folded then over and nobody knew the difference. The pink is brighter in person than what showed in my picture. It's a great all purpose dress. I'm 5'9&#34; and 170lbs, I got a large and was a perfect fit"
5.0,"This is a nice sweater and I want to get the black one. It's a little large though so, I'll be getting a size smaller for the black one."
5.0,While big and statement making these earrings are easy to wear all day long without pain from heaviness.
5.0,Fits a good variety of tools that I use while traveling in my Land Cruiser. I can throw it in back and nothing rattles. Pairs nicely with the tool wrap.
5.0,the band hold up and is brilliant.

5.0,This was part of a birthday gift costume and fits great.
5.0,"i love this top, light and nice fitting"
5.0,I have this hat in beige and orange (it's more of a coral). I get compliments on this hat every time I wear it! It is the perfect fashionable hat to throw on when you don't want to mess with your hair! It's light weight and comfortable. This is my &#34;go to&#34; hat. No longer do I wear my baseball caps!
5.0,"Pretty. Good value, fast shipping."
5.0,I always struggled putting some of my bracelets on but not any longer!  This bracelet mate makes it a snap to put on bracelets.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5.0,Great assortment. Never have to spend anymore money on eye brow jewelry again.
5.0,I love these yoga pants!!  They are SO soft and comfortable!
5.0,Now that we are on lock down due to COVID-19 I had to pick up my Fitbit  Blaze again to make sure that I keep moving while working from home. I absolutely love this band. My husband removed about six links so that it can fit my wrist. It's lightweight and perfect to transition to dress up or down.
5.0,Awesome quality and fit!
5.0,I bought this pair of shorts for my son. He completely love them and he’s very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Gave this as a gift to my girlfriend and she was very impressed with the quality and comfort while wearing it.  Perfect for Bellatrix costumes on a budget!
5.0,Im size 10 jeggings at AE and a Lg on top
5.0,"The lens on the sunglasses are blue reflective, and it doesn't allow light to penetrate. Really good quality sunglasses, but a little too wide for my face."

5.0,It is a nice dress. It runs smaller than expected but not too small.
5.0,"Our little one loves everything Paw Patrol! This jewelry set is perfect, exactly as described, sparkley and just the right sizes!"
5.0,"Span the 'buying clothing on Amazon' roulette wheel, with no clue as to whether what would turn up would be genuine or a fake. It tends to be a 50 / 50 chance these days, but the genuine article arrived. Bought it in a rush, at the very last minute before a trip abroad, and pinned all my hopes on it being a nicely structured, warmish, waterproof jacket perfect for unpredictable weather. It was. Fits really nicely, without being too slim fit for my slightly misshapen middle aged body. Online measurements matched up with what arrived, and it's a good deal more stylish and structured than the images suggest, and perhaps from what you'd expect from a soft shell coat. Probably not suitable for winter, but perfect for a chilly Spring trip with a load of wind, and occasional driving, horizontal rain. Repelled the water without a problem. No leaks on any seams. Cut out the wind. It breathes too, so it doesn't turn into a condensation soaked greenhouse. Decent pockets on the outside. None inside. Light for luggage, and can't think of a bad thing to say about it. For a last minute buy, it came up trumps."
5.0,Love it.  It is the perfect length to make my shorter necklaces that I wear in summer longer for winter time when I wear sweaters and turtlenecks.  Very dainty and a fine gauge chain.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I use these in the field with my reading glasses while doing wildlife photography.
5.0,I ordered a large I’m 5 7 and 180 lbs it fit tight but there’s enough fabric to hide stomach imperfections. Super good buy!
5.0,"5 star cuz of price, quality and brightness of colors. I wear a suit and tie everyday for work. Ties take a beating. These are great ties for everyday use. They are definitely MUCH better then any $11 tie I have seen anywhere. They have a nice thick soft feel. I can see them costing twice the price. But they are inexpensive ties. Even so I will buy many more and get use out of them."
5.0,Very good product just as advertised
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, heavy enough, bright and shiny so it stands out with whatever pendant I what to wear it with. Good buy!"
5.0,Bought for my husband. He's even sexier now rocking these awesome headbands! Works great keeping his hair of his face while keeping cool.
5.0,I bought this Spider-Man suit for my 5 year old grandson and he loved it the fitting was perfect for him and it looks nice on him what else could you ask for.
5.0,I’m 5’5 127lbs and fit this small very well.<br />It’s worth the money and thinking to get another one. Recommended
5.0,She hasn't taken it off since I gave it to her.
5.0,Love these! Last through a baseball season and middle school
5.0,"Great! Purchased to use as a face mask and it does the job, even on a large head. I wasn’t sure if I needed to purchase a larger size than these, but these work great. They are thin, so breathability is good. They seem well put together, don’t feel cheap or like they will fall apart. Great value!"
5.0,"Nice bowtie. Easy to tie, I have a degenerate  disease  in my hands and I was able to tie this bowtie. Well made. Attractive looking."
5.0,I use this as toiletries/make up container box for traveling. Very sturdy and does not change the shape even if its<br />packed tightly. Good quality.
5.0,"Depending on your curves and your weight, you should get the large or extra large. Beautiful dress though."
5.0,"These are as green as the image shows.<br /><br />I grow orchids under a LED grow lights, which are a very bright pink, and these glasses allow me to check on them without turning off the lights.<br />I can't imagine wearing them outside of this scenario, as the green is very, very intense."
5.0,"Each bag holds a lot, great quality heavy duty material that won't have to be replaced for a long time. Excellent buy!"
5.0,Good quality chronograph watch. Dial is visible and build quality is awesome; specifically for this price.
5.0,Very impressed so far. I've kept it wound for over a week now and the time is still correct. Easy 5 stars (Assuming it keeps ticking).<br /><br />I actually was looking for a watch band when I  found this. It was so cheap I figured I would buy it as kind of an experiment.<br /><br />Its lighter than I expected.<br /><br />The band is a bit cheaper than it looks (there is a better leather watch band that a lot of the more expensive watches use that looks just like this).<br /><br />The second hand doesnt stop ticking when changing the time like my other mechanical watches.<br /><br />Worked so well I decided to give it to my nephew. Figured the movement might interest a kid.
5.0,Bright beautiful pink just like picture. Received a compliment the first time I wore it.
5.0,"Wow!!! VERY NICE, SIMPLE. Perfect for an<br />elegant statement"
5.0,This dress is perfect. Stretchy and comfortable.  Fits perfectly.
5.0,Theses are very good and very easy to set up they have no problems at all. I would highly recommend theses and one thing I found out it make sure the brand remote matches your old one.because I got the wrong one at first but they both work great but when do have right brand it doesn't work right. Great  purchase
5.0,Great arch support!  And I LOVE the rounded toe. Just overall comfort from the moment I put them on. No “wearing in” period. Plan on buying more colors.
5.0,perfect size and met expectations and beyond
5.0,Was exactly what I wanted. I got this for my Tragus and my Monroe And it fits both perfectly. Definitely worth it.
5.0,Ant find a anywhere else. So unique and beautiful! But for short full legs not so good looking on. Better for longer less thick legs. Had to give them away even though I adored them
5.0,This helps work up a sweat like you won't believe. Very durable as well
5.0,works well so far. looks awesome and durable
5.0,Great fit and look! I just used them for first time to the gym.Soft and comfortable. You will be happy to get them😀
5.0,It's MUCH longer then I thought it'd be but I love how this it feels. Might even buy more. It is def bigger and I probably should've sized up but I'll just alter it myself.
5.0,"really soft material, sheer and lovely."
5.0,Wow came before time. I love them thank you. They are as the pictures from the seller.
5.0,"christmas gift, so beautiful and great price."
5.0,"It is a gift for my daughter. She loves it very much as it has pretty delicate design and not too showy. It looks like a music note symbol but if you look closer, it is a little snake starting at you. I can even see the glare from its eyes .That is a little surprise to people around her when she wears it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this necklace to young ladies. But if you want people to know you are as bad and wild as a snake, try another one from Amazon. Perhaps Chuvora can make a bigger version for man ;)<br /><br />The shipping is super fast. Totally happy with this deal. ;)"
5.0,"I love this. It is very pretty, but beware, it's small. It barely fits on the wrist.<br />My writs is 7 inches with the tape pulled tight. Anything bigger than 7 inches and it wont fit.<br /><br />Thank You"
5.0,"Good fit, nice product"
5.0,Beautiful! I wear it every day and it is beautiful.

5.0,"I work 12 hour shifts and with these on, I have leg pain. Also being short and having them fit correct is also a plus!"
5.0,It is beautiful just I imagined it. I’ll send you a picture when she wears it.
5.0,I bought this sweater for my husband at Costco a few years ago & he loved it & lives in it. I was excited to find the exact sweater on Amazon so bought him a 2nd one so he’ll always have a clean sweater nearby.

5.0,The slippers are soft and cute.  The arch is nice support and they feel comfortable.<br />The price is great and they appear well enough made to hold up for a while.
5.0,Very comfortable but really long
5.0,Great product amazing

5.0,Good tummy control with smooth slimming fit
5.0,Really nice sandals. I bought these for my grandson. They are adorable sandals.
5.0,"I ordered this in a plus size. and found it to be true to size. The length falls just to the hip but is not as long as a tunic. It is comfortable, flattering and perfect for late summer and office casual setting. I ordered the black, liked it, ordered the dark red, and just ordered the dark green. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Excellent quality! Very happy with purchase... Made in Germany and not China... Couldn't be happier with this hat!

5.0,Very cute! I love the variety!
5.0,"Love this swimsuit! The silhouette is very flattering. I have a smaller chest and the triangle top works very well. The bottom has just enough coverage while being mom appropriate. I am 5’4 and 140 lbs, size 8 fit perfect."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, great material"
5.0,Changeable to match all my work outfits...Good to give as gifts
5.0,Fits my 15 inch MacBook Pro plus a few books and sunglasses. Perfect for the writerly self.
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for my friend's son. He had just started driving.<br />He love it. Very quick delivery.
5.0,Bought them for my son he loves them says it's like little pillows for his feet
5.0,"I fell in love with this dress.  It fits every curve of my 5 '5&#34; 240 pound frame.  Should have gotten a 2x because it was a little loose.  I like my clothes to fit like a glove, plus I lost about 18 pounds because I was sick. Came from China so I thought to get the 3x since their clothes run small."
5.0,"Here is how these compare to what I have tried in the past.<br />Fit: exactly how I expected it to be, Color: exactly as shown.<br />Breathability: I would say on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest amount I would rate these as a 2 as there is a mesh vent on the side of the leg but the main material is barely breathable.<br />Weight: These are incredibly light. I packed them on a weekend hiking trip and they didn't take any room compared to some other mesh shorts.<br />Noise: These do make more noise, but it wasn't an issue for me on a hike.<br />Water resistance: I would say these are somewhat water phobic meaning water is likely to roll off than get absorbed like mesh. If you get them wet and touch them the fabric does soak so they aren't resistant, but do dry quickly.<br />Pockets: I like the deep pockets they have on each side, but there is no small key zipper pocket like I have on other shorts.<br />Durability: the material is so light you would think it's not durable so I tried tearing it at the bottom with my fingers and was not successful so I would say they are much more durable than I thought they would be. I would say maybe 7 out of 10. A 10 would be a lot heavier though so it's a balance.<br /><br />I would say the only real downside I noticed to these shorts is that they did tend to stick to the back of my thighs when I sat in my car. If you are looking for breathable and quiet shorts I would stick with a mesh material. If you want something ultra light, water phobic, and with a fast dry time then these are what you want."
5.0,Trendy pretty. Next to my solid gold couldn't tell the difference.
5.0,Softness and good cushioninh
5.0,Really cute and lots to choose from.

5.0,"If you want a high-end belt at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with the brand. I have both a brown and a black belt and both are practically works of leather art. The craftmanship is outstanding.<br />This belt also comes in a classy little bag, so if you need an idea for a present for a guy, this will make him feel as if you got him something uber-special.<br /><br />All in all, I can't say enough good things about this belt, this company, and the products the sell."
5.0,"love this dress for the price, I am over 50, but my daughter picked this dress for me, and I love the way it fits and looks, it is just as the picture looks, I am usually a size Med, but we ordered a Large, and it fits perfect, so up your size by one notch. For the price you can't beat this dress."

5.0,Nice shades!
5.0,These horns are amazing! The fit is perfect and they are comfortable to wear. They look so cool!
5.0,I ordered this bathing suit in the Navy and in the Red. I am returning the red because it's actually a neon pink and clashes with my skin tone. The Navy though is Wonderful! It makes me look so much smaller and the fit was the absolute best! I will buy again someday for sure. Just not in red because it's pink
5.0,Love these gloves for my 5 year old! Super cute and well made.
5.0,This is adorable and is perfect for our boat. It’s easy to rinse off and is made of durable material. The cute dog pattern is an added plus!

5.0,Absoutley perfect! Cant wait until Mardi gras!
5.0,I'm allergic to most metals so after I got it pierced I had to change the bar to stop it from being irritated. The pop of color is so cute and the bar fits comfortably.

5.0,"best bang for your buck ,  well designed nice comfort and design, I normally don't write reviews but this thing is worth it!"
5.0,Nice blouse. Machine wash and comes out of the dryer wrinkle free on a low heat. The buttons are a little hard to fasten but once buttoned it's easy to slip it over my head so no need to button every time. I have ordered in a few colors. It's a very feminine and flattering and I have been looking for a while. Sometimes clothing from Amazon is disappointing but I am quite satisfied.
5.0,I've been wearing these for a week or so now.  These flip flops are super comfortable.  They also have pretty good traction... overall a great value and a must have...
5.0,"Great value, quality and look!"
5.0,Nice product if they sent the right size
5.0,Soft and great durability.
5.0,"Amazing. Gotta love Daryl !!! Great fit. Perfect. True to size. Great length to wear with leggings/jeggings. I'm 5'6&#34; medium build, ordered a M in case of shrinkage after wash. Some reviews say it looks small but it's stretchy but firming and very flattering to the figure. I have 3 of these now, the black and the sliced up long sleeves.  Please make more colours before they kill off Daryl on WD! Can you make with other characters like Glen, Carol , Michonne please."
5.0,I have been on a quest to find an alternative to knee highs .  I can’t wear shoes without socks as it feels uncomfortable to me but knee highs roll down or are too tight.  Thin ankle socks sometimes feel too tight for me as well so when I decided to try these I was very pleasantly surprised.  They are nice and thin so fit well inside my shoes and are durable enough they will hole up well after washing.  Very happy to have found these so I placed a second order
5.0,I walk alot to work to commute on a train to get to work everyday and the heels are not to high and they have a rubber textured bottom sole. They are so comfortable too!  I bought 3 colors and I love them all! What a good price too!
5.0,Loved them!  They are great for kayaking on the lake - dry out fast!
5.0,My husband was a competitive swimmer and wanted Speedo goggles.  I got him these for Father's Day because of the high rating.  He loves them.  They don't leak at all and they are slightly tinted from the inside and totally reflective from the outside.  Come with ear plugs and nose plug.
5.0,Fits my Fitbit perfectly. Easy to get on and comfortable.  I’m confident it will protect my device.
5.0,Arrived on time and was perfect for prom❤️
5.0,I like it its very comfortable
5.0,These shoulder pads are the perfect size.  I have small rounded shoulders which make shoulder pads a &#34;must&#34; for my wardrobe.  I come back to these every time.  I have ordered the black and nude.  I live these and will continue to order in the future.
5.0,Arrived fast. Soft and comfortable. Great casual wear. Like the color.
5.0,"Well made, detailed"
5.0,"This is just adorable. Camouflaging for mommy tummy. Light, airy, and a fun bright floral pattern. It is strethy so it is not a hard wear. Look effortlessly summer pretty. Can be worn out with friends or just comfy around the house. I will get more. The price is more than fair. I'm almost 5'7"" and it comes to almost my ankle."
5.0,This is perfect for my daughter's 1st Communion! Great quality and great price! Highly recommend!
5.0,I get compliments every time I wear the shirt.
5.0,Beautiful clothing set!
5.0,Beautifel blouse at very reasonable price.
5.0,"i can't give a bad review, it was my fault i bought the wrong size, should have read the description better. had i wanted a kids hoodie this would have been GREAT! looks cool, nice thick material would definitely be nice and warm. i'll definitely be replacing the one i bought with one of the right size."
5.0,"Great quality and they are really cute, I love these!"
5.0,Very nice ear rings.
5.0,"Bought as a gift, my mother loves it!"
5.0,These are great and I wear them all the time.  They don't trigger a reaction for my allergy to metals to react to.
5.0,"I love these pants, they look very tiny out of the package and you really have to do some wiggling to get them on, but they look great. They are comfy enough to wear around the house and cute enough to wear out. I love spanx legging I own four pairs and would recommend that anyone who likes leggings buy this brand.<br />I'm a size 14/15 in pants and bought a large in these."
5.0,This hat is very well made ~ my only complaint is that it must have been folded up for quite a long time because it took quite effort to get the creases out!
5.0,"Totally a great purchase for “farm” day at work! Great quality for $30 overalls! Update- the quality seemed great, however one of the clasps broke the second I sat in my car. I had to put a rubber band around it to hold it in place for the day. I got a lot of compliments but I ended up returning the item."
5.0,"I love the dress but when I tried it on, it was way too narrow in the waist for me"
5.0,I love this shirt. Really like the material. Very soft and comfortable for me.
5.0,Love it! Great piece!
5.0,"I bought this dress for work and it is absolutely adorable. I got so many compliments from co-workers and customers alike. It's classy and comfortable and super flattering. It does get wrinkled so a little bit of ironing might be needed. I'm a 36C, size 12 pants, with a tiny waist so I went with a medium and it's perfect."
5.0,These are unbelievable! Can’t wait to get more. Well worth the price!
5.0,I love them and have ordered more.
5.0,So cute! I call these the momofuku glasses because they look like lucky peaches. Great at blocking out the sun with style
5.0,"I wanted a straight-forward, inexpensive time piece. This is just fine: it has date and day function, and can switch to 24 hr mode. EZ 2 read display, and also easy to set up on delivery. I like that it is light and thin. I will say that the light doesn't illuminate the dial very well, but I'm giving it five stars anyway, for it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is."
5.0,I bought these to celebrate the one year anniversary of my bypass surgery. They are really cute. The compression is slightly less than the Dr. Motion compression socks I wear most of the time.
5.0,I had no idea these (because I didn't read) that only one came in each pack. So I ordered one off Wish and came to Amazon to find the matching coordinate. I was soooo scared it wasn't going to come before my trip. But to my surprise it came!!! I am so happy. Had to get some of that 6000 glue to secure one of the stone but who cares!! I have a whole set for my trip....So just remember to order 2 :)
5.0,"love this dress, get tons of compliments"
5.0,Very efficient and fast.  Necklace and Keychain were even better in oerson.
5.0,"Well made, beautiful, arrived on time, and both were white, which was just fine!"
5.0,These fit perfect and are even softer and more comfy than expected
5.0,"I was sent these sunglasses to evaluate, and I am impressed with them! They're very light, but the frames feel very strong. One downside for me is the width of the frames. I don't know if it's normal for aviator sunglasses to be on the narrow side, but they don't cover my face well. By crude measurement, they are about an inch more narrow than my other pairs of sunglasses. They fit my wife's face pretty well though, so she plans to wear them while driving. Speaking of driving glasses, I bought another pair from this company that I love for using in lower light conditions. I'll provide a link if you're interested: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015GTR656 I'll be fair and say that the frames could use a redesign. I love how light they are, but it does affect durability. I was cleaning the lenses the other day and one of the lenses popped off. I reattached it with a little dab of superglue and you would never be able to tell, but it's worth pointing out. That said, I still wouldn't hesitate to buy them again. They have just been fantastic to have after the sun goes down."
5.0,"Aside from wondering how I am going to take care of a fabric boot instead of leather I absolutely love these boots.  They run pretty true to size I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 and got the 7 1/2, it is just a tad big in the foot area but I have bigger calves and they JUST fit, if I had gotten the 7's I don't think my calves would have fit.  So much for tucking boots in!!  But they are super cute and seem to be super comfortable.  The soles are also not slick which I really appreciate, I will not buy a shoe with a slick sole, as I have wiped out going down concrete stairs before.  I wish shoe makers would listen and put decent soles on everything.  Rocket Dog again has produced a nice item."
5.0,Had an issue with first shirt that arrived with stain. Seller contacted me very quickly and responded to correct issue. Received new shirt very promptly. Super cute shirt. Not see through at all. Nice quality and great price. I’m ordering other colors. Any issues with your order contact seller they will make it right!!!
5.0,"These are heavy almost feels like scuba material but they are not. Outer is nylon stretchy material,  Inner is nice and warm and lined with thick faux fur on the inside. They are really stretchy and perfect for extra cold days when you want to be comfy and wear leggings but don't want to freeze your buns off outside. The ankle area has an extended length knee layer. I'm not sure if it is for extra length or just the inside layer that the fur is attached to but it doesn't bother me. I would like a another size though be offered maybe for curvier girls so nice not all of us are 'one size'. Overall these are well made and would purchase more levels n the future. I received these as a sample."
5.0,"Great sweatshirt but I had to exchange it because the sizing runs very small.  Whatever size you think you need, go up one for sure."
5.0,"I love these packers, they adjust at the side extending to fit more in so they work well holding a few things or a lot. Robust, square and rectangular shape they hold anything from shirts to underwear, even shoes or pants keeping your suitcase neat and providing more efficiency to your packing. Each bag is sturdy canvas with a mesh top."
5.0,Great socks. Bought a bunch of these because the ones I bought at Express Men suck (no pun intended)...they slipped off your foot after a few washes...not these ones. These are resilient!!
5.0,"This is all lace, make sure you have something to wear under."
5.0,"You get what you expect - large comfortable sunglasses that will break overtime, I treat these as disposables that last 4-6 months or wheever I drop them on a hard surface, Usually buy a couple pair's that covers me for a year which I consider worth the investment at $15 a piece"
5.0,"I have been using these for a while now and they are awesome! They are sturdy, they are large so they hold a lot and they are holding up perfectly! People that work at the stores I shop in are constantly complimenting my bags saying they are the best ones they have seen."
5.0,worked on a cowboy hat
5.0,"great tights, they're actually gray AND black not solid gray"
5.0,"Great color, nice fabric and fit."
5.0,Got these for when I go to the grocery store. They work great! They’re very sturdy and hold a lot of groceries. Much bigger than I thought they would be. I love that I can fold them up really small and put them in their own little bag. Very convenient for small spaces. The designs are super cute.
5.0,I bought this dress for my Halloween costume.  I was bride of Frankenstein. I wanted a white dress I could wear again.  It fit well and I know I can wear this for other occasions.
5.0,Short for me but I'm 6'0. The dress fit pretty tight for its size and it's a little sheer but it's a great buy. Super sexy and worth the price.
5.0,"This Land's End cotton nightgown is luxuriously soft and comfortable. I love this! The sleeves are a bit too long, but considering the rest of the fit is perfect, I don't mind folding up the cuffs. The quality of the fabric, perfect stitching in all seams, and overall good workmanship are wonderful. It was a long search for me to even find an all cotton nightgown, and I appreciate that it was not ridiculously priced. Five stars, Land's End. Dec 2021"
5.0,Love these socks!!!  So comfortable and FUN.  I'm planning on ordering more!!
5.0,I ordered the large shirts because I’m bigger up top. They fit exactly as expected and look as pictures.
5.0,My sister loved it! Stylish  and trendy without breaking the  bank!
5.0,Great little wallet/phone holder.  Just what I was looking for.
5.0,Works for adults with busy outdoor hands  :-)
5.0,"I was concerned about the size, it is slightly bigger than a standard wallet, but I love it. It’s good quality and still fits in my back pockets just fine."
5.0,Gave it to my sister because the small was too big and she is like a medium
5.0,"Hoodie is very soft, well made, and true to color, I purchased the dark blue. There wasn't any loose stiching, or a weird smell from the product upon opening the package. Please with this purchase."
5.0,Very nice material. Really comfortable to wear. I think it's  a must to have at least four different colors.
5.0,I got this for my daughter and it is beautiful! Fits her perfectly and good quality for the price. Nice gift!
5.0,"This is a very nice vest.  I like the abundance of pockets.  It looks good.  Seems like quality production (zipper pull tabs, seams, etc).  I would buy it again.<br />Sizing is a little tricky, though some other reviews said it runs small.  Believe them.  It does.<br />I have a Little Donkey Andy jacket in a large that fits well.  Some wiggle room.  Bearing in mind that the vest runs small (for some), I estimated the wiggle room to be ample enough in the jacket that it would be OK for the same size in the vest.  Wrong.  I got a large in the vest and it is tighter than the jacket in the same size.  I should have got a XLarge.<br />Not enough to exchange, but enough to not eat a large meal while wearing, which is unlikely anyway. :)<br />All in all, I really like both my Little Donkey Andy purchases."
5.0,They fit great and looked beautiful.
5.0,No problem whit this product
5.0,Adorable. Daughter gets so much attention in these!
5.0,"Very nice, reasonably priced and enjoyed wearing them. thank you."
5.0,Easy to install and does well with what it is supposed to do
5.0,Love this ring . Perfect fit
5.0,My six year old loves this mask! I loce that it’s adjustable. It’s very comfortable. The design is very cool. My only complaint that it was brighter.
5.0,This was a Christmas present for my mom. She says it’s a great band that is really comfortable.
5.0,"My son loved this for Christmas! Very sporty, fun look to it!"
5.0,Oh. My. God. POCKETS. IN. A. DRESS.<br /><br />I know this isn't revolutionary but its the best invention ever. Seriously. This is what sold me on this dress. I bought an XL and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'5 and it hits just at my ankles. Its the perfect length. Not too long to where I'm going to trip on it and not too short to where I don't feel comfortable calling it a Maxi dress. The color is perfect too. The fabric is light and will be comfortable for summer.
5.0,i really like these sunglasses.....fit well and are super comfortable!
5.0,"After adjusting the ear cuff, which was rather simple and getting used to wearing it for a day, I'm loving the look and don't even know I have it on.  It's a great look and works with almost anything.  Love it!"
5.0,Love this shirt! So cute!
5.0,Very nice Leather material....love that new leather smell! Lots of functional pockets and very lightweight. The bag is made very strong and can hold my heavy full size laptop with no problems. Love it and would recommend to anyone need a great business bag.
5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVE these sunglasses.  They are very well made and comfy.  They are awsome. Fit better than any other pair of sunglasses I have.  Wish I could buy more.
5.0,I love my sandles. . They are very nice and are comfortable.
5.0,"Looks like photo, nice quality for the price I paid"
5.0,"As expected took a little bit to break in (5-6 miles), but outstanding function and quality out of the box. Next test is training in the upcoming months. Very impressed thus far."
5.0,Purchased a few different pearl kits for my niece and nephew and they loved them. They were so excited about opening up the shell to see which pearl they would get. It was a fun little project to keep the kids busy.
5.0,Dragon is always my FAVORITE!!!!
5.0,My husband absolutely loved this watch. It's lightweight and looks very expensive and unique.
5.0,"I love this dress, but it's a little short and I'm 5/4 1/2&#34;."
5.0,They fit as well as I expected. A few of the bigger rings are bigger sizes and I have smallish fingers. Ring finger (5) middle finger (6/7) and pointer (7) idk what size my thumb is
5.0,"Excelente inversion, buena calidad, cómodas y fiel al tamaño."
5.0,"These boots are comfortable from first wear. I love the look, the fit, and the style of the boots. They are fashionable and made of great quality. A must have for your winter wear!"
5.0,"I have had my lip pierced for about 3 years, after searching for the perfect fitting lip stud, I gave up. They were always , always too big/long - and when I would smile it would stick out. Which I didn't like.<br />Finally!!!...... These actually fit perfectly and are comfortable!! I have average sized lips for a female, not thin but not large.<br />I actually received 11 instead of 10 - only one repeat color - other 10 were true to what was shown above.<br />I haven't had any issues with them - and and very pleased! Nice quailty.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!<br /><br />Item was received at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review - that in no way affected my opinion."
5.0,"Needed this for my daughters Halloween costume.  It was reasonably priced,  arrived as promised and nice quality.  Worked beautifully."
5.0,"This is a great product, I'v had my ears pierced for over 50 years and I have trouble when I wear earrings they itch and burn but this takes care of that, no more itching or burning so yah I can ware earrings again."
5.0,I am in love with his hat! It is well made and the flowers on the inside really made it special!
5.0,"Very good, thick, nice colors - work well."
5.0,"These are gorgeous, can't wait to use them, and they seem to be of good quality."
5.0,"The brackets arrived well packaged. They are light, simple and a pretty orange color. They were a gift and the recipient didn’t remove them for a week."
5.0,I wasn’t sure what to expect for a $7.50 Wallet but I am blown away!! The zipper is smooth as butter. The color is amazing and the leather is beautiful. Definitely recommend this wallet!
5.0,Great sun protection. Stays on in the wind. Comfortable
5.0,"Exceptional belt. Using a ratchet based system, you get the perfect tightness. A regular belt can easily be too tight or too loose based on the belt holes. I bought this belt because the buckle was stainless steel, which I need with a nickle allergy. When the belt arrived, it was easy to cut to the right size, the way the belt is locked into the buckle, it won't pull out like other belts that are affixed with screw-in buckles. I hadn't noticed that it was a ratcheting buckle in the description and that ended up being the biggest surprise. It honestly fits perfectly. For $20, it's the best belt for your money."
5.0,"Bought these to wear with a renn costume for the upcoming renn season. I usually wear 10.5 men. order 13, because of the heel and toes, so I could put a cushion in the bottom, and they fit right on, they are comfortable to wear, only around the house right now, getting used to the platforms and height, should be a big hit with the rest of the gang,"
5.0,Fits as expected.Gerat for all seasons not too thin not too thick.
5.0,These model is perfect for hot weather running.
5.0,"Bought four so far, one for myself and the rest as gifts. Great product, very sturdy, fully adjustable for all sizes."
5.0,Simple and stylish at a great price!
5.0,So comfy! Like the warmest hug for ya feet! And cheap! Such a deal! Hope they hold up. Seem like they should.
5.0,Quick ship and cute robots
5.0,Son livianos y modelo muy elegante.
5.0,"Fit perfect!, normally I size S or M, I ordered S because I like a little loose - like the fabric- (iron needed)- but it's really a nice workout shirt. Comfortable shirt."
5.0,"Color is perfect pink! Size, I’m wearing M, could size down but I’d rather feel not so restricted when I move. Comfortable! Squat proof! And it has pads too!"
5.0,Those are the best shoes for babies who just start to walk. Very cute and good design. Well made. Easy to get on and off. Miki House is a Japanese brand that dedicated to making great shoes for little babies. Highly recommend!
5.0,Awesome product for cleaning nasty vacation rental hot tubs
5.0,I LOVE THESE. I want them in every color. Wish I could give 10 stars
5.0,Adorable and so cute and trendy
5.0,"Got this watch on a whim, but I'm very glad I did! I thought it was cute, reasonably priced, great for everyday all day wear. My favorite thing about this watch is that you can see the date, which is great if you need to date paperwork at work. It's comfortable and versatile, my only issue was that the resin bands can be a little stiff, but they soften (or mold to your wrist) with use. I think with good care, cracking of the screen is totally preventable. I have a hard time believing reviews that said the face cracked out of nowhere. I wouldn't wear if for anything high impact."
5.0,This robe is great and the quality was amazing! I bought a size small/medium in tan for my mom who is 5’0” 108 pounds. I washed it before she wore it and put in the dryer and it even came out wrinkle- free!
5.0,"I loveee this skirt! It’s so cute and fits well, very comfy with the elastic waist."
5.0,there are beautiful.
5.0,It's a really good product very useful! 😊
5.0,Awesome sunglasses! Son loves them and looks adorable. Quality is fantastic and lenses seem very nice.
5.0,excellent quality and price!!!
5.0,Very great gift for my mother! Good qaulity and beautiful.
5.0,I’m a small and I was worrying about the size but it was perfect. Nice crisp white and the gold was as shown in the pictures. I’m 5’3 so the length was good at mid thigh
5.0,Great item was priced good as well.
5.0,"I was hoping this was similar to other fanny packs I've had over the years - with a loose, deep front pocket - and was disappointed that it was not. However, the overall compact size for concealing under loose clothing is great. I feel much more secure now when traveling with large amounts of cash."
5.0,Sparkles<br />She loves it!
5.0,As described. Purchased as a gift and it was nice enough to give.
5.0,"Came in great condition and my friend says she loved them, fit well and nice and comfy! Also very cute and perfect for someone who loves owls. :)"
5.0,"Good product, was exactly as pictured. Fit my very petite 11 year old perfectly with room to fit up to an adult size 4/6. It went to her knees and would probably hit a couple of inches above the knees if you are a 5'4"" adult."
5.0,Love the dress! The material is very high quality and soft. My only complaint is at the armpit area it shows my bra and side boob... I wear a cardigan with it and that solves that.
5.0,"Ya, they fit fine , lenses are good too, and the price is right,, should have ordered two pairs  ,,, Adam"
5.0,Perfect. Even better than I expected. Great quality and perfect size.
5.0,I'm using it.
5.0,Grandson loved this hat.  Super warm for NY weather.
5.0,"While the product was indeed to small for myself, I really cannot be to upset because I also did not read carefully so that was my own fault. (Its for teens, not adults! My eyes decided not to see that)<br /><br /> The sweater although came in absolute excellent shape so I wont negate a star because of my bumbling. The sweater had no flaws, the design was perfect and goofy just how everyone likes it. And I gave it to my younger sibling who LOVES it!"
5.0,"My friend loved this, bought as a gift. The matching wallet fits inside but you'll only fit that and maybe a phone and some pens. I'd recommend using a coin purse with this. It's beautiful, good quality for price."
5.0,So cute! Perfect for my keys and well-made.
5.0,"Super cute, well-made shirt.  Love this.  Bought one for myself and one for a friend.  Great color and fit."
5.0,"I got the one for my son's new little truck and it is so beautiful.  I know it just is a piece of plastic, but the symbol ithe<br />GOD and his Angels represted for me and my love for my son.  I am terminally ill cancer and I need my touch on his truck and life and he can look at it and see my love for him to and GODS love we all need LOVE everyday a must Have item.  for or loved ones."
5.0,"I was worried that these might look really cheap, but they actually look really nice and costumey - in a good way."
5.0,"First and foremost, I know that Russell sweatshirts come a little on the big side...I am typically a XXL size but the XL fits very well and is even a little loose...and it is warm...I did a 40 minute walk and the temperature was in the low 40's...I was very comfortable...would buy another in a heartbeat..."
5.0,The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
5.0,I just received the glasses today and I was not disappointed.
5.0,Light breathable and fits great
5.0,Good hoodie good price
5.0,Didn't notice the size option the first time I ordered (to replace a broken band). Disappointment! Immediately ordered again. All is good!
5.0,"Arrived exactly as pictured and at &#60; $18, this is a tremendous purchase!"
5.0,"This is a great addition to your Italian charm bracelet, even if you aren't born in June!  However if you are a June baby, like myself, it's a clever way of showing that off without being too obvious ;)"
5.0,The seller sent the product almost immediately. I sent him a text message to the telephone number he provided on a card in the package. He promptly responded to my text and answered all of my questions. Others love my prayer shawl and  I have referred them to this seller. Thank you so much. Keep up the great work! :)
5.0,"I ordered one size up based on other reviews. I am not a small person and would normally have ordered an XL, therefore I ordered the XXL. (For those of you that like to be modest or try to always go with the smallest of your size.. I would say, order 2 sizes up, because I too can fit into a Large 😉.)<br />The next thing I think is important to share is to not judge it's size based on looks alone.. When I first took the product out of the package, it was very deceiving; At first glance I almost shipped it back because it looked tiny. (I had read a review that expressed the blouse must come in doll sizes, and at that moment I knew what they were speaking.) However, something told me to still 'try' to try it on. And I am so glad I did! This has easily become one of my favorite fancy/elegant blouses to wear. I am so fond of it that I have now ordered the other color it is available in. Such a great price for such a lovely piece. I am very pleased!"
5.0,This is the second one that I have bought.  Nice color!
5.0,My husband works in the oil field in extrememe south texas temperatures so I decided to try some of these.  They are fabulous.  I freeze them overnight and he can use 2 all day long.  He works 16 hour shifts and usually only needs one.  He keeps giving them away to his friends he likes them so much.
5.0,"These are the best fitting capri's I have ever bought! They are high enough in the waist so I am not constantly pulling them up. Fabric  is comfortable in hot weather but also not too thin. They are very well made, glad I bought 3 pairs.<br />I wear a 4 or 6 in pants, got a sm. They fit perfect!"
5.0,This is such a nice bracelet. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I usually wear M but ordered L because of some reviews. I'm glad I did;  I like for there to be enough material to overlap in front at the bottom.  It's super soft and it will be really warm in winter.<br />UPDATE, I find that this robe is actually too warm for me unless it's super cold out."
5.0,EXCELLENT customer service. Product as described. Timely shipment. Thank you!
5.0,La esperaba un poquitito mas larga pero bonita
5.0,Fits my Charge 4 perfect.  Super comfortable.
5.0,I loved that this dress had pockets!! Had lots of compliments!
5.0,"I purchased these to add into a ""spa"" stocking for all my christmas stockings to co workers..  They loved them..  I always use disposable slippers while traveling ( business weekly) so I dont have to walk on the flooring in hotel rooms.  Fit well and last!"
5.0,Ver flattering and beautiful prefect for spring and summer brunch or beach vacation
5.0,This tote is very sturdy and great for carrying wood in from out side. It's durable and has a strong handle. We are very glad we bought it.
5.0,This blouse is so cute and lite. Very flowy fabric. I wear it for different occasions and everyone loves it. The color is easy on the eyes. I feel very pretty when I wear it. I'm glad I bought it.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fit as expected!"
5.0,Perfect fit! Hubby will love this for Father's Day! :)
5.0,The bra I ordered was well made. It fit well and is very comfortable. I was extremely happy with this purchase.
5.0,My wife and daughter love them.
5.0,I loved the shoes and my daughter definitely loved the shoes. She wouldn’t wear her other sandals lol. But all in all shipping was amazing and the shoes was exactly what I expected. I’m definitely happy with this purchase and will be buying them in a bigger size for next year !
5.0,Bought for my mom. Loves them. Has every color.
5.0,"After I cleared and charged it, I don't wanna take it off. Its really comfortable, no pinching, and doesn't dangle too far. Friends have complimented it non-stop."
5.0,It came right away and was nicer than I thought it would be from the picture.
5.0,I love these because they dont show inside. The dimaonds are nice and small too. Great value.
5.0,Extremely classy if you wear the same color watch with this bracelet. I love fitted bracelets like this so much because my wrists are small.
5.0,"Again, look at sizing. The shirt comes down to just past the butt and is very plush soft all the way through including to the sleeves. Just what I was looking for. Thick and comfortable. Can even be tucked in if you do a bit of manuevering!"
5.0,"I have been flying quadcopter (drones are really only intended to mean automated quads, like the DJI Phantom etc). on and off for about 2 years.  Most of the quads I have owned and flown are toy grade quads with brushed motors (Syma X5C, Hubsan X4 L107, Latrax Alias etc.).  Anyone planning on buying their first quad should start with one of these toy grade brushed drones.  They fly nicely, particulary the Syma X5C, they are cheap and easy to fix when you break them (and you will!!!!).  Moreover, if hit someone or something with one of these toy quads, you are more likely to damage the drone than the person or property you hit.<br /><br />Once you have gotten comfortable with these toy grade drones, the MJX Bugs 3 is the perfect next step.  In some ways, it reminds me of the original Syma X5C without all the bells and whistles like altitude mode, headless mode etc (all of which retard your ability to master basic flight).  The Bugs 3 is quality quad with powerful brushless motors (more than 4x the power of a brushed toy quad), a very long lasting 2S battery (15-18 minute real world flight times) and it's very well built and put together with good quality components.  It has no frills---just basic controls with a high and low speed--always in stability mode.  It can do auto flips--llike the Syma X5C and other toy quads--but it doesn't have any other fancy stuff.  No altitude hold, no headless mode, no gps, no return to home etc.  This is a basic, powerful quad for someone that really wants to fly (not program some way points and press a emergency rth when they can't figure out what they are doing).  It can easily carry a gopro or similar action camera.  It's a gentle flyer, but if you punch the throttle and push it forward it is fast in high rates and very maneuverable for 310 sized quad.  If you upgrade the battery to a 3S it is surprisingly fast with lots of punch.  While the quad feels hobby grade, the controller is kind of cheap feeling.  Nevertheless, it gets the job done!!  It has really good range and actually has telemetry in the form of beeps that tell you if your battery is low or you're flying out of range (nice features).  Considering that this quad is priced in line with toy grade quads (what would have been mid-range toy grades only a couple of years ago), it's amazing what this quad delivers.<br /><br />WARNING:  THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD QUAD FOR A FIRST TIME FLYER!!!!  You need to know have a solid command of basic flight skills or this drone will get you into trouble.  It is fast enough that you will lose sight of it or lose orientation.  If you don't know how to bring the drone back, you will (AT BEST) lose the quad or, worse yet, hurt yourself, someone else or their property.  For a first timer, buy yourself a couple of Syma X5C's and once you master that, this is a perfect second quad."
5.0,"Love these shirts!  I bought them in a few colors, size small.  I wanted a few tops that are casual enough to wear whenever, but can also be dressed up.  I'm so happy these fit well too, I was getting so tired of shirts from Amazon being gigantic - I'm petite, and these are perfect."
5.0,Nice lunch bag for daughter.
5.0,Love the fit! Love the feel! For reference I'm a 36d chest
5.0,Super soft! Pretty comfy and the print is really beautiful. Great value!
5.0,"What I love most about this shirt is it’s an actual tshirt! Not one of those tight forming shirts, fits more like a unisex tshirt 😎<br /><br />Got so many compliments on the design! I had to buy another style and color! I’m definitely obsessed!"
5.0,"Took a chance that that SGW100 and 200 would use the same band and got lucky.<br /><br />You reuse the pins and outside metal brackets that the pins lock into.  Very easy to replace as you can see what you are doing as opposed to the more common inside the case arm mounts.<br /><br />It's also got smaller holes for the buckle than the original 200 band, which ripped at a hole, so I'm hoping this one lasts longer."
5.0,"This shirt is so comfortable and flattering! I really want to buy another one (or two) in different colors! I usually where a L but bought this as an XL. I probably could have gotten a L, the XL is a little baggy on me."
5.0,"Beautiful Organic Cotton and Fitted Tank Top. Comfy and Soft, perfect for my Yoga Practice"
5.0,I got this for my girl. It arrived in about a week. Sizing was accurate. Well made and she looks amazing in it. This is the style of dress to really show off a sexy girl around town.
5.0,"I got one of these similar bracelets as a gift for my sister several years ago and one of the bead balls broke. Rather than take it to the jewelers for a solder repair, I simply invested in another and surprised her with it.  She loves it and told me she wears it nearly every day.  I have one myself and it does look really nice with many styles of outfits and is very comfortable, too!"
5.0,"Really cute shirt, I got a lot of compliments. It’s a great piece to transition into the colder weather"
5.0,She loved it. LOL
5.0,"First of all, it's Star Wars. It's warm and comfy. The size is ok, I'm 5'6&#34;, about 120 lbs. and I ordered M and works pretty well for me, loose enough"
5.0,I love it its my favrot now
5.0,Best ring I have ever gotten. Definitely a must have! looks similar to a De Grisigono ring.
5.0,4 year old has been wearing these nonstop for a month and they have held up. Good shoe.
5.0,"I have this model in different colors. It's perfect, comfortable, true to size."
5.0,"This is a great starter kit for someone just getting in to piercings. Sizes are perfect, with a good selection to choose from."
5.0,not itchy.
5.0,Good quality and the sizing is right. Maybe using the silver color for the buckle makes it looking better.
5.0,Útiles y de algodón llegaron en buen estado
5.0,I like the color and the photo on amazon doesn’t do it justice.
5.0,Outstanding.  Best ship and pro I've ever had.  Made eBay look bad !
5.0,I like the shoes 😁 they look so good
5.0,My boyfriend loves it perfect for a simple Madrid jacket price awesome
5.0,I have sets of these socks that are 8 years old only replacing because I lost a mate. Never got a blister comfortable worth the money.
5.0,Perfect laces for my hiking boots! The bright orange gives otherwise ordinary blah boots a pop of color!!
5.0,This jacket  was the perfect gift for my little niece.  The jacket fits her like a glove and she looks good in it.  Very stylish and very retro looking but yet still fashionable and modern  and goes great with skinny jeans.
5.0,"I usually wear an 8 in pants so I bought these in the large and they fit perfectly. I agree with other reviewers who said the green is darker in person,  and in my opinion is much prettier than the green pictured. Haven’t washed them yet so I can’t comment on that but for the price, these are super cute and look much more expensive than they are."
5.0,"A gift, looked great"
5.0,I love the quality of this chain. The weight is nice along with the shine that is a sign of true value! I will order again soon.
5.0,I got this in a medium and it is big and long enough to wear legging with it. I am 5'6&#34; and about a 36b and the fit is close to how it fits on the model.
5.0,Dress is amazing! I’m wearing it for an engagement photo shoot. Can’t wait!
5.0,This shirt was so awesome. J bought it for a gift and he was very happy!

5.0,Soft & good quality.
5.0,"I really like the quality of these leggings. I just wore them hiking the other day and it was 40 degrees out. I was warm and was able to hike easily. These have a nice pocket in the back for small things, I wouldn't put my phone in it (as shown in the image online) as I think it would roll over on itself and sag, but it may work better for little things."
5.0,"This was a birthday gift for my teenaged nephew. He really liked this ring, it fit him perfectly. My sister and niece wants one now. It looks good."
5.0,"So cool and comfy, fabric feels like tshirt material but thick enough it's not see through. Perfect length for 5ft 6.5in height,longer  back hem stops well above ankles so no stepping on it and front covers my knees. The red is a pretty shade of red like the picture."
5.0,This literally broke when I was putting on! Do not waste your money on this please! Not trying to be a Karen but this was just upsetting.
5.0,These are pretty nice. Its alot cheaper then going to the mall and buying them.
5.0,"What I needed, nice"
5.0,Bought this for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. Material is quite good. A little larger than what i thought but still fits her reasonably well. Would recommend to a friend.

5.0,Hermosos como siempre
5.0,"I’m happy with the sweatshirt but I wasn’t pleased with the delivery, your delivery person decided to shove my package in my mailbox crushing my Christmas cards, I’m usually happy with the speedy delivery and the careful care with the packages, I hope in the future, the next delivery will be up to my satisfaction. Thank you."

5.0,I love these pants! Makes me feel like genie!

5.0,The skirt is  as described and very nice.
5.0,My wife wears these daily and they have been perfect for her. They give a stylish look without the stress of expensive jewelry.
5.0,"I LOVE the dress if I would’ve chosen a different color /-:<br /><br />It fits like a glove. I would suggest you order your normal size. I was nervous by all the other reviews so I order this one (leopard) in Medium and the pink (lilac) in small. They both fit but as you can see I am 8 months pregnant so one fits better than the other. The leopard is great if you have lump or bumbs or a prego belly button 😂. I’m obsessed w it, I like that I don’t have to wear undergarments lol. I think it’s classy but sexy! I am 5’8-36D-36” belly right now (normally 25”) and 38” bum. Pink is thin, you will see your belly button!! I think I’m slightly curvy. See photos."
5.0,"Lovely bracelet for my stepdaughter. The clasp is strong, the chain is good quality . The bracelet allows for adjusting the length to fit smaller wrists. A very nice gift with a  beautiful  sentiment in a pretty box."
5.0,Bought three pairs because of all the compliments. Had to get them for my girls too!
5.0,It looks like I bought it with the bag. Perfect match. Great quality
5.0,love the clasp on the bracelet
5.0,This size is just right.  It made for a perfect gift.  No complaints.
5.0,"I liked the way the dress looked  in the review photos and decided to take a chance...it is really pretty on...the bottom half has a bit of a sheen which I really like because it elevates the look, the top half is perfect and made of a soft material. Love this dress!"
5.0,"Fast shipment, great shirts, well worth the money"
5.0,I had this dress in the cream color and loved it so much I had to get it in blue!  Next black!
5.0,LOVE  it and fits perfectly!
5.0,Great with leggings!!!  Very light material.  Okay in Black but I wonder if it would be see through in other colors.  Have worn this several times and it washes well.
5.0,"The title line says it all.  These gloves are super thin, but large enough to fit most anyone's hand.  They are long enough to cover your wrists.  I have never had one tear while pulling it onto my hand.  A great COVID glove.  I dont think they would be a good gardening glove, but you could try.  At about 7c each, you have little to lose.  They are waterproof too.  And... use them to protect your hands when you color your grey hair."
5.0,I'm absolutely INLOVE with these! there my new favorite pair. Soo cute and comfortable.
5.0,"I love these. They look great, and they’re shiny. You just need to be careful when putting them off/on, because the little stars will slide off when the earring is open. Would recommend them."
5.0,Absolutely love this bag. Fits everything with ease.
5.0,"been wearing this bag every day since I received it, durable, simple and cute. decent storage as well. No issues since over an year"
5.0,Great bootie! It can be worn dressed up or down. Fits comfortably and true to size.
5.0,Bought this Tshirt for my boyfriend and he loves it!! Looks great on him too....fit as expected
5.0,"They are a little big on my 2year old shoe size 7, but she still wears them cause she likes them. Can't wait till they fit her."
5.0,Looks great and arrived two days before the anticipated date!
5.0,Wore it under my dress to a wedding and it fit amazingly and you could not tell I was wearing it
5.0,Love the wood look and it's easy to put on and take off.
5.0,"I usually wear size US 16 or XL. This dress was too tight in XL, so I exchanged for XXL, and it fits perfectly. This has a polished office look to it and pretty warm. Perfect for the winter. I got lots of complement on design, and am very happy with the price ($25)! A great bargain."
5.0,These are gorgeous pieces. I had purchased 3 different sets of jewelry for a formal event. The other 2 were returned because of damage and the weight of the earrings made them and impossible to wear. This set work perfectly and I look spectacular for my event and received many compliments.
5.0,Nice quality with good color selections that offer pocket for insertion of extra layer of filter that is replaceable.  Glad to have them.
5.0,"Bought as a gift and I liked it so much, I ordered another for a gift and also one for myself. I really like the large size so as you can actually see  it easily without straining your eye, or have to go too close to the wearer to admire how pretty it is. This was the only one with the largest size available and it turned out just fine. I also thought i might need a longer chain, but the 18&#34; was more than enough because the pendant hangs below the 18&#34; spot at the bottom of the chain endings.  As a very experienced jewelry collector, I give this one high marks."
5.0,Two words it's stunning beautiful little dress i usually wear size 4 thank God i went for the  size 6 fits me perfectly it's way more nicer than the picture .
5.0,"These are so, so adorable. Each pair, but one, seems of high quality... One came with a rogue string that has been unraveling the leg warmer. I clipped it and now it seems fine.  I use these in place of pants on my two month old.. Cloth diapers make her butt super big and pants always seem slightly too tight. The leg warmers work perfectly at keeping her legs nice and warm, plus in my opinion, they are much cuter than most of the pants out there. I will note that they are still a little big on her, however, I just fold them up once at the bottom and they stay on perfectly!"
5.0,"11/10 would buy again. I am a 34-36DDD and I bought the large. Fits wonderfully. I took out the padded insoles (there are holes in the top edge of the cup to do so), but they still hold me in well and are extremely comfy."
5.0,I'm 5'7 I'm so glad this dress reaches to the floor. It's so hard to find a maxi dress for me in a long length.
5.0,Good price and very cute and comfortable.
5.0,"I absolutely love this Neosan Bohemia Yellow cover up. The material is soft, flowy and dries quickly and the pattern is stunning. A huge plus is the drawstring tie for the perfect fit. I can't wait to get a few of the other patterns for the summer.<br />I received this at a discount for an honest review."
5.0,La utilize para mi nieta que empezó a pararse sola
5.0,"Nice T shirt! Quality material. You don’t always know what your gonna get on Amazon but this one, mine at least (!) is a winner. Just like Roger ❤️"

5.0,Made well holds my sweat great looking
5.0,"Very pretty and soft, love the materiel its made out of"
5.0,"Living in the desert southwest, we often have to wait until night time before it cools off enough to comfortably walk our three dogs outdoors.  These lights give us the security of being visible to approaching cars.  Some of our neighbors have commented on what a great idea they are.  The battery is easily replaceable.  Has three different lights: steady, slow blink and fast blink.  They also offer a little bit of visibility of what is in front of us."
5.0,"Great looking jacket, layers well under bulkier jackets for added warmth.  I typically wear a large to medium top (busty). The sleeves on this are WAY long.  I have no complaints about the jacket and am keeping it.  But had I known, I would have gotten a medium."
5.0,"Love these bags! Wasn’t expecting the taupe small leopard pouch to be so purple/pink, but still cute!"
5.0,Nice top If you like a lose top like me go one size up good quality and soft fabric
5.0,Excellent!! My son loves it.
5.0,Great quality and super fast shipping.
5.0,"Very pretty, but thought they would be smaller. Other than that very nice!"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b992d23379a3a58fb8d8c42faa507c2d]] The hoodie is just perfect! Not a scratch! The material feels so comfortable you wouldn't want to take it off, you won't regret having one."
5.0,Love this swimskirt. I ordered the white XL(large US size). It fits perfect. My waist is 29 inches and hips are 39 inches. Perfect length for takini tops. Will be getting this style in more colors.
5.0,Great! Love the color and all the pockets. Easy to keep organized and it holds a lot.
5.0,"This was a GREAT PURCHASE!!<br />We bought an extra small, for a thin, size 0-2 girl, size B chest, and the XS literally, zipped up to a PERFECT FIT.<br />The back 'is' sheer, so, you do need to consider bra options, that don't show.  We pinned her back bra straps into the side of the dress, and it worked perfect!  Spin - ability, is AMAZING!! WHILE STILL LEAVING A LAYER THAT is modest, that does 'not' lift, while all the tool and satin layers, lift, and spin!! a PERFECT semi-formal event dress, where dancing is going on!<br />COLOR was true to pic, and absolutely gorgeous!<br />VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRESS and may buy other colors in the future!!"
5.0,"Incredible cosplay, it does have the silk fabric as pictured which was so captivating and incredible for this costuming. Its just perfect for Ciel, the shorts were a little constricting at the bottoms but it was fine in all. It fit perfect and the service was great, defenitely defenitely get it! Great job Holran!"
5.0,I bought these for my 2 year old grandson.  Really nice boots and fit as expected.
5.0,"At time of purchase it suggested buying s size larger which I did. It's a little big in the straps and a little in the sides, but I can alter this.  Love the dress"
5.0,Easy to put on. Just like a regular watch band.
5.0,"First off, the $10 price tag was perfect. Bikinis are made of so little material, there's no reason to pay more than that. I'm basically flat chested so finding a bikini that compliments what little curvature I have is a task, most of mine are basically water sports bras because why even try. But the top is perfect, it's great quality the cups are thick and the material is thick and doesn't bunch up. Very sexy, my boyfriend can't wait to see me at the beach in it."
5.0,Perfect for saving toes from being scraped on pool and cool deck.
5.0,"Really very well made, sturdy and very fashionable!  Completely pleased with this item."
5.0,"Description is right on, as is the sizing"
5.0,"Satisfied customer, seamless online shopping experience!"
5.0,Great product. Got lots of great responses from people
5.0,I really like the shirt and customer service is awesome. But the shirt runs very small
5.0,"Love them, worked great especially for my trip, everything stayed in place"
5.0,Love the fit !  Comfy as wearing a par of pjs under your favorite tunic!  Don't hesitate to buy as the high waist does cover a problem area for many women.
5.0,I got this for my mom and she loves it! She had one complain about it... why I didn’t let her know about this product sooner.
5.0,great stylish bracelet at an awesome price
5.0,"So pretty, love it"
5.0,"Perfect fit, great colors, comfy."
5.0,Anyone who's a fan of Attack On Titan would love this.
5.0,They wee smaller than expected but cute none the less. The top hole was too small for my chain to attach to it so I got some circular links to help with that.
5.0,"Beautiful color, light and soft.  Fit very nicely.  Plan to purchase another color soon."
5.0,I'm so happy with costume. The skirt is amazing!! Worth the price.
5.0,"I have worn this pair of sunglasses for 1 week (50 hours) and am ready to leave my review.<br />Having a larger than normal head size I have always struggled finding sunglasses that fit comfortably during all day use. I typically buy inexpensive sunglasses expecting them to stretch and break. I have purchased sunglasses online listed as “Large” or “XL”. They are usually slightly wider than the typical size but not wide enough for me.<br /><br />After opening the box they were delivered in; right off the bat I new they were large enough. These sunglasses are WIDE and TALL! They are lightweight, polarized and stylish. I get complete protection from the sun with comfort. Two pair for $20 you cannot beat! If you have an extra large head or wide face you will not be disappointed with these sunglasses."
5.0,The image is exactly how the bag looks and feels! It looks great. Even the color is spot on. Perfect size for carrying a smart phone and a wallet. The loops for the purse are big enough to have a regular size belt go through them. It is soft and flexible. It is going to go so well with my costume for the Renaissance festival.
5.0,Fits as I thought the would.  They are very light
5.0,"Perfect for my little chef, love how the neck is adjustable."
5.0,"good quality. a little expensive, but suitable for the gays n theys."
5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by how elegantly designed this watch is. In fact, it is why it caught my attention.<br /><br />The Swarovski crystal accents sparkle vibrantly day or night, which truly adds a touch of stylish sophistication to any business suit or any tuxedo. In fact, Timex has successfully crafted an eye-catching watch that uses Swarovski crystal accents without looking garish.  Impressively, even with the gold on silver coloring, the modern, ridged face design, and the crystal accents, the watch does not look busy. It remains appealing and not gaudy as you would expect with watches that include so many detailed touches.<br /><br />This watch, like many Timex dress watches, dispels any idea that reliability and attractiveness cannot be affordable.<br />Timex's reputation as a reliable brand has stood the tests of time and, when you pair that reputation with this watch's high-quality appearance, there is no comparison. Truth be told this watch looks just as good, if not better than my higher priced watches.<br /><br />Not only that, this time piece also feels like a high-priced watch because of its weight. You will have no problem wearing this time piece confidently.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to buy this; you will be more than happy once you see it in person!  Be ready to receive compliment every time you wear it and to never lose a second of time.<br /><br />In my opinion, this watch pairs especially well with blue and lighter grey suits (although it looks nice with darker colors as well)."
5.0,Warm /soft and holds the heat really like it
5.0,"love it, awesome texture and fit"
5.0,These are really nice. It comes with posts for each band. They are so much more comfortable than the bands that come on the watch. They are really pretty too.

In fact, I’m going to purchase another necklace from the same company."

5.0,"These fit like a dream. This brand has become my go to sunglasses. After spending hundreds, if not thousands on sunglasses and losing or breaking them all over the years, I now have had 4 pairs of different Sojos. The bag they come with cleans and protects. They are great and I get lots of compliments."
5.0,"my daughter absolutely LOVES her trolls pjs! these fit similar to the tight pj sets you would find at WalMart or Target. her typical sizes are 2T pants and 3T shirts, so I get her 4T in pjs like these...the pants are a little long, but the shirts fit perfectly (this is normal for her as she has a long torso)"
5.0,"These were for my 7 year old daughter, but they are so soft and cozy I had to try one on. It fit without stretching it out, and still fit her perfectly. She loves the colors, and they look adorable on her. Very good quality, no issues whatsoever."

5.0,"So I love this costume!<br />I read the reviews before buying and realized I would need to get the largest size (XXL) in order for it to fit me.<br />I'm normally about a size 12US I'm 5'10.5 tall and 180lbs, about a DD bra.  The bra part was way too small but I plan to just use this as a skirt anyway.  Sorry for the poor quality pics but I tried! Lol"
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality material! Color is white linen. They fit my 16 x 16 pillow inserts like a glove. I am very happy with this purchase and will repurchase from this seller again."
5.0,Like it. Just the right size I have been looking for. Especially like the &#34;bag&#34; in &#34;bag&#34;. The detachable purse that comes with the purse.
5.0,Perfect Ty
5.0,"Well made, very easy to adjust if you lost weight. I wonder how long the indentations in the leather--against which the buckle holds--will last. Many nice designs."
5.0,"So pretty! Got here in two days (thanks, Prime!) and is exactly as described. I don't know why one reviewer said the three scarves she got had holes and were poorly made - mine is perfect. It did have two threads hanging down that I had to trim, but that seems to be the way things are made these days. This scarf is just fine and looks great with the baby pink sweater cardi and tank I have on today - already got one compliment on it. It's feminine, lacy perfection! I would not hesitate to give these scarves as gifts and probably will purchase a few more for exactly that purchase."
5.0,"Plastic luggage tags kept breaking off while in transit. These are durable leather and easy to take on/off and has window for address viewing. My relative is American attending a Canadian university, so it was a fun and practical gift for her."
5.0,"Sherpa hoodie fits oversized and is very soft. The quality feels nice. It is very warm. Definitely for the colder days. I like the drawstring on the bottom. You can tighten it to make it hug your hips more which is helpful since it is an oversized look. Definitely order your size. Fits true to size. I am 5""2 155 lbs. I ordered a size medium."
5.0,I love the shirt vet comfy but i should of gone down a size from whati am. But i still wear and really enjoy the shirt. Looks very pretty on. Deff worth the$$ i would buy that brand again deff!
5.0,My daughters love these glasses and wear them everywhere!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:650755fc5ce7667c75d5651eeff9ab5b]] It is a darker blue than I expected, but it is gorgeous! I was a little disappointed when I found a scratch on it, but it is still beautiful. The chain is also pretty sturdy."
5.0,So easy to use and comes in handy for some tricky bracelet's that you just can't latch
5.0,"I like my shoe stretcher, and these plugs work great for targeting specific spots needing to be stretched."
5.0,"We have a whole set now because we love them. Durable, light, and expandable!"
5.0,"The purse was just what I needed to have an approved purse to take into to an Arkansas Razorback vs Texas A&M game. Too bad we didn't win, maybe next year."
5.0,Great belt. I love d-ring belt. What I love most about the belt is the elasticity of it. It very comfortable and it never feels too tight. I'm glad I purchased it. Also the added bonus is you receive two. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
5.0,LOVE IT!  It fits as expected and looks super cute with skinny jeans and knee high boots.
5.0,Durable. Fits well. Colors are just as displayed.
5.0,I bought theme as a gift and they say they love them
5.0,This is better than I  expected.  It sparkles and I love the  rose gold.
5.0,Arrived early and fits great looks great. Great value for the money.
5.0,I love the length the color and the material
5.0,"SBL is the best company ever! The Messenger is better for guys, this comes across looking like a &#34;purse&#34; even in Large (for a 6'3&#34; for lineman in college football)"
5.0,"Perfect, very pleased"
5.0,I bought this as a gift and the reaction was awesome.
5.0,I gave as a gift.
5.0,"Love it, looks and fits great and is easy to handle"
5.0,"Beautiful, flattering dress. Fits true to size, glad that I got it."
5.0,"I love, love, love this dress!!!!  Hides tummy too!  :-)"
5.0,Good heavy sturdy shorts. Quick shipping
5.0,Love them!  Better than photos
5.0,"I have had wraps like this in the past. This one, by far, has been my favorite. The material is super soft, but my favorite part is the velcro. I have had issues in the past with the velcro clinging to everything. I would constantly have to put hair, strings, lin, etc. out of the velcro. This robe has velcro that doesn't have that issue at all! It has a very strong hold and isn't scratchy. I can't rave enough. I will be buying another one"
5.0,"This swimsuit is adorable. It’s made very well. Nice material, well worth the money. I would recommend."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3c4b88671ee44b953fbdf16bc47128]] Great watch band and fits perfectly
5.0,"This casual women's summer blouse is very pretty! I love the muted pink color too. It has spaghetti type straps. And no sleeves whatsoever. It fits loose and will look fantastic with slacks. There's a slight high low in the back and a criss-cross of fabric in the front. Very flowy and thin, soft fabric. Great for those hot summer nights!"
5.0,I loved it. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"Love these gloves for my middle school daughter. There made very nice to keep her hands warm, standard black to match all her outfits & has a dainty flower as an accent.<br />Best part it’s open for two fingers to text & still stay warm. Definitely recommend"
5.0,My mom bought two much more expensive beanies at the same time that I got this one and she was kinda mad that she liked mine better! It stays on tight but not so tight that it gives me a headache (which is easy to do). I especially like how baggy it is. I can pull my long heavy hair up into it without it falling out. I got this back in December (2015) and after 4 months it hasn't come apart in any way or even start to stretch so I've purchased two more in different colors!
5.0,"I bought this to have a spa day with my granddaughters. I bought XXL. Even though I am a L/XL usually, many kimonos are cut small, and do not fit as well as sizing up. I am 5 feet 5 inches and weigh 175. This was perfect, the belt closed it nicely. It’s a fun robe for bridesmaids to have hair or makeup done, or a spa party on a girls’ weekend.  Launders easily just rinsing in the sink. It’s thin, but not see through. Lots of fun colors, floral prints, so each person can have their own color. Makes for colorful photos of the party too."
5.0,We are very happy with our purchase and the kids have been splashing in the puddles with the recent rain.
5.0,Loved the first one I got had order another
5.0,"I'm 5'10, C-cup, and wear a size 12. This dress fits me perfectly. Would fit someone a little larger nicely too. I think it might be too big on someone smaller than a size 10, unless they want it to be very flowy. I'm quite tall, and it comes to my knee so I imagine that many may find it to be too long."
5.0,"Excellent fit and finish, waxed cotton canvas is an under utilized medium in today's world of nylon everything.  The flannel lining is breathable and soft.  Very light weight with a strong vibram sole."
5.0,"My son loves the mask, it's the only one in existence in our town.  It has adjustable ear pieces for comfortability."
5.0,"great accessory for an 80s costume, soft and comfortable to wear"
5.0,"I ordered the small for my FitBit Charge 2 and fits me perfectly.  I wear a 7"" bracelet.  Order a large if you wear larger size than a 7"".  I have used the large in past and that worked fine,  but I had extra length in band.  Since it is magnetic latch it was able to work for my smaller size. No problems and reasonable price."
5.0,"The Suasi Mens or Womens Sunglasses arrived in a very quick and timely matter and are awesome! They are sold online for what I believe to be a very reasonable price for the quality of the item. I was very pleased with the sunglasses themselves, the bag you get to store them, as well as the wipe you receive to clean them. The sunglasses are a good size and fit comfortably on my face as well as my husbands. They are a very sturdy weight and look very nice. Their style is very classy and the bamboo sides add a nice little bit of extra fun. The lenses themselves are great! The tinting adds a nice color when you are wearing them and blocks the sun great. Overall, I am very pleased with these glasses and the company! Great purchase!!<br /><br />Please keep in mind I did receive this item at a discount in return for my honest and helpful review."
5.0,Great cover up and even looks nice worn as a dress!
5.0,Amazing for the price. Love the springs that allow them to bend a little
5.0,I like the feel of these. The lining is thick and protects my sunglasses wonderfully.
5.0,"I loved this dress! It's breezy and flowy but not see-through at all! It was perfect for a Summer Garden party. It was a little low-cut in the front, but I wore a stretchy camisole underneath and it worked great."
5.0,"My niece wore these for our alice in wonderland halloween party. Shes only 7 and they held up very well, good quality and nice colors."
5.0,"I love these shorts! The last swims shorts I bought were not tight enough, air would get caught in them and make them balloon out awkwardly when I entered the water, I don't have to worry about that with these. I would prefer if they were slightly longer just for modesty's sake and they are very snug, but that doesn't bother me much, they're still comfortable and less revealing than a bikini bottom, so I call that a win. I would recommend getting one size larger than you think you need, but the material is very stretchy, so it's not a big deal. If you get ones that are too big it's not a problem either because it has ties at the waist and both legs to tighten it if necessary."
5.0,"Exactly what I expected :) Cute for work, date night and vacation!"
5.0,"For the price, you can't beat it! Good quality and fits as expected. I'm 5'2&#34; and 36-28-38 and the L fits really well. Use the seller's sizing guide not Amazon's and it'll be spot on. The fabric is thick enough to hide flaws. The style shows your shape while still being modest enough to wear to work. Great for fall. I love this dress!"
5.0,"Pretty, smart and very sturdy."
5.0,An ongoing buy for me.  Love this product.  It really works.
5.0,Loved this dress for Christmas! So many compliments! It feels thick too! Not cheap feeling.
5.0,"Bought for my son's 1940's theme wedding and it looks great.  Base is made of felt, so relatively inexpensive material used but still looks good."
5.0,Super soft and comfy. I dont usually like dresses but I love this one! Even has pockets.  I will be ordering more in different colors.
5.0,My daughter is in love 🤩
5.0,Gift for my husband he was a submarine sailorhe loved it!!
5.0,Nice quality.  My kids like it. Recommending to others....
5.0,This is a very good tie clip for the money.  It does a good job making it so your tie doesn't drag on the ground when you are at work.  People will think you paid a lot of money for this because of it's classic design
5.0,"Bought this on sale, am very impressed with how nice the hoodie fits and how comfortable it is.  The Twitch logos are pretty understated, making this a nice, low profile hoodie to walk around in."
5.0,"Great sun protection, light weight, and comfortable for beach days in Maui!"
5.0,the colour is close to real gold  got a lot of positive compliments
5.0,This hat fits great and has coverage for the back of my neck. I love it!
5.0,For the price this necklace is absolutely stunning. Beautiful and very eye catching.
5.0,beautiful fabric fits true to size
5.0,"This is a very well made shirt, and the material is nice and thick with no see through issues. Prefect basic t-shirt with a great figure flattering fit. I’m 5’5” and 111 lbs and I got the size small. I’m going to order it in more colors and I really like shirts by this seller. Thank you!"
5.0,"I usually wear an 8-8.5 (women’s) in shoes so I got an 8 and it’s too small, my heel falls off the back. So I am returning them and getting a 9 because other than the sizing issue, these are AMAZING. I usually wear Vionic’s shoes but these are soo much more comfortable."
5.0,Fits great. Very becoming!
5.0,"Fits perfect! I’m 5’3, 120 and the small fit perfect. Love the look of the body suit and super comfy."
5.0,The top is great and so flattering. The bottoms are small. Very thong like. If you are small they will look great on you. If you don’t mind showing some booty then go for it. I switched the bottoms out for a high waisted pair and was good to go. I’m saving the bottoms just in case I’m feeling sassy.
5.0,The necklace is so beautiful in person.  Just love wearing it.  I keep getting so many compliments.  I am so happy when I wear it.!
5.0,Adorable.  I need 3 of these 🤗
5.0,2nd pair husband has had and he loves them.
5.0,This cloth actually works really well..I was ready to give up on finding anything that really cleaned jewelry in a hurry.
5.0,It is a very
5.0,"Super cute, love it and looks adorable! High quality."
5.0,"Used this as a precaution while camping on cool nights. Our almost 3 year old refuses a blanket. It became *really cold* one night, luckily we got one comforter over our toddler. We layered her in a LS onesie, socks, thermal PJs, a footed fleece blanket sleeper and this wearable blanket. We had peace of mind knowing she would stay warm. And, she was able to remain mobile, slept soundly, and didn't scream to be freed from her layers.<br /><br />We will be using in the fall/winter at home now too. Wish I found this sooner!<br /><br />Highly recommend."
5.0,Great pair of glasses! Cheap and the look great
5.0,"They fit my 2-year-old very well, and he loves them. The case is nice as well."
5.0,Wouldn't it be cool if masons were among our ancestors.
5.0,"This strap looks wonderful and fits perfect, super satisfied!!"
5.0,for husband after foot surgery

5.0,"products came in record time, and was perfect for my halloween costume that i bought it for!"
5.0,Good quality. love the adjustable neck size with bead!
5.0,I purchased these for my mom and I. We love them.
5.0,"I seriously love this dress, I have been looking for some more work dresses and am very satisfied with this one. The fabric feels very light and think but is not sheer at all. When I wore it to work I got SOOO many compliments. And I am actually very surprised at the length as I am 5'8 and dresses are usually more like longer shirts on me - but not this one, I got it in medium!<br /><br />I also love the pattern on it, looks very unique"
5.0,It was what I was looking for and good price.  I just wore it once
5.0,Nice product  fit  great
5.0,"I like these earring, they are different and I’ve gotten a few compliments on them ;)"
5.0,used for outdoor yardwork
5.0,"Using these at an upcoming baby gender reveal party, the theme is&#34; Helmets or Hairbows&#34; , my son in law is obviously a fireman and my daughter that is expecting always wore harbored when she was little. These will be perfect for our &#34;team boy  guests&#34;. Hats are perfect, arrived in great condition, and shipment was super fast."
5.0,"I wear a lot of casual loafers and a lot of shorts, and I don't like sporting the socks with shorts look, so these are perfect.  They do not show at all when wearing either of my favorite loafers and keep my feet cooler and blister free.<br /><br />These are supposed to be size 6-10.  They fit quite nicely for a size 10 shoe; I would guess they might run a little large if you were a size 6."
5.0,"Love, wear it all the time!"
5.0,"These aprons and chefs hats are adorable. Well made, lovely colors. Got these for kids that are coming for Christmas cookie decorating party.<br />Very pleased. Would buy from Dapper & Doll again."
5.0,"I bought these for my younger sister...She is surprisingly picky about her socks.<br />I believe [it's] because she does not like how clingy [they] feel along &#34;the rims at the top.&#34;<br /><br />So, this was a 5-star, teal-and-white option. One that we couldn't find in stores. Thanks, Amazon.com!"
5.0,Purchased these for middle school age grandson into sports. He was very happy with the gift. Fits snugly.. he is very thin….
5.0,"The first time I wore these was a trip to NYC. The day was super rainy and I worried the shoes may fall apart as walked for blocks and blocks. A year later, these shoes look like new and feel as good as ever!"
5.0,Wife loves them~
5.0,Overall a great little top for the price
5.0,"Good looking, very secure. This is the first watch band I have ever had that was too big - and I love it! If you have big wrists, this is the band for you. Heavy weight with a solid clasp, and it looks great with my black stainless watch."
5.0,"First of all, the material is HEAVENLY. So soft, thin, and smooth. Although it's not waterproof, which I knew it wasnt, it was so worth it. The picture has it looking a bit more orange, but when I received it, it was more of a gold/yellow color. Perfect for the spring and fall, and even light enough for a summer night! Love it! Worth all the money I paid!!"
5.0,I love my ankle bracelet I get a lot of compliments on it and it stretches so comfortable
5.0,"Well pleased.<br />Fitness is good, fabric good and looks good!"
5.0,"Love these! I'm crazy clumsy and trip in the shower sometimes. These shoes have literally helped me not fall in the soapy tub. They fit perfectly, are true to size and really durable. The bottom has a nice grip and I appreciate it."
5.0,Just a perfect summer dress. Wish there was a winter version!
5.0,Beautiful material! Love it!
5.0,"I ordered 1X US per the size chart, but I could have gotten away with a large. 5'8 185lbs. Feels nice. Seems durable (held up fine for the night of airsoft). Would recommend"
5.0,LOVE LOVE this dress
5.0,"Great watch, I'm very happy with it."
5.0,"I bough these to go with an outfit for a concert we were going to. Super fun. I have a nickel allergy and am sensitive to heavy weighted earrings. These were comfortable all evening and did not make my ears feel hot , swollen or itchy. I’m so glad I purchased them. It was my first Amazon jewelry purchase and I had no regrets!"
5.0,love this set for the price
5.0,"I highly recommend this Louisville Cardinals mask. In fact, since I can’t sew and never will, I will be coming back for more of these masks."
5.0,"Charm was beautiful, very clean and well packed. I just wished it came in the Pandora hard box instead of the small flimsy box."
5.0,This item is worthy of five stars
5.0,Nicely made belt. Can adjust to different waist sizes. Very durable.
5.0,Very sturdy clasp and leather rope. The clasp does have a tendency to drift toward the front but it may be because my pendant isn't very heavy.<br />Update: I've had this now for almost 9 months wearing it every day. It's still holding up nicely.
5.0,Fits as expected and super cute! Colors look great.
5.0,Great Boot . Well made. Had to return. They are heavy on the feet.
5.0,Recently purchased this for my father as a small thank you gift.  He loved it and put it on his key ring immediately!  It arrived quickly and it was very shiny out of the box.
5.0,"These shorts are very cute. They are a little thin, but they are not see-through and don't look or feel cheap.<br /><br />They are a great length and they are very comfortable to wear. Because of the thinner material, they are perfect for hot summer days.<br /><br />The only thing I will note is that the button is a little flimsy, but I do not think it will come off easily. As for sizing, stick to your usual size."
5.0,Love my outfit and get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  I also bought three other colors.
5.0,love my cap
5.0,I love these gloves!  I had a pair for 3years that I used a lot. And ordered more so that my grandchildren could help me in the garden. I’m sure I will order again!
5.0,Elegant and flattering.
5.0,"I like everything about this product ,sizing ,style and color..."
5.0,These pajamas are so comfy. I love the detail on the back with the cross straps and the fact that they are a different color from the set itself. I purchased the gray set so my straps are white. Great attention to detail. I also purchased a size up just because I like my pj's a little baggier but the fit is true to size.
5.0,I ordered these for my son for a pair of high tops he had. He's only 5 and has muscle issues and can't tie his shoes yet. This was just a great way to give him the independence of putting on his own shoes. At first I was worried they were going to be too small but they stretch out perfectly and hold his feet in the shoes really well! They also look fantastic. I would 100% recommend these laces to any parent out there.
5.0,Got this set for my 2 year old for this winter and they arrived quickly and fit as expected. The inside is so soft and definitely seems to keep my little one's head and ears warm! Highly recommend.
5.0,Love it! It dangles a ton and I loved playing with it by the pool. It’s really cute and sparkly
5.0,Super cute and comfy. Is the right price for such good quality. I love it!
5.0,"GOT IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY , ITS JUST WHAT I WANTED, If it was a little bigger it would be perfect. It's Did come a little bent ( do to shipping I believe) but not that noticable , it's just so pretty and realistic you get caught in detail that's how I noticed."
5.0,Just lovely a nice medium size too
5.0,I would like to update my review<br /><br />I have several sundresses from MS Basics and I love them !<br />Unfortunately the dress with cherries the pockets were defective and abnormal and I bought a similar dress with lemons that fits great with normal pockets. I missed the return date by 1 day but fortunately Amazon took care of me and let me return<br />Thank you Amazon !
5.0,Was a gift to my Granddaughter and it was perfect and she loved it.
5.0,Shipped faster than expected!!! Arrived waaay before Christmas! It is just perfect and adorable.
5.0,I wear this anklet nonstop including in the pool. It’s held up beautifully. Highly recommend. The texture rolls so it doesn’t pinch or get hung up on clothes.
5.0,"Very good quality. I usually wear M, and I got a L, and it turned out to be big for me."
5.0,I’ve had my bracelet for two years and it’s held up very well. I absolutely love my bracelet and look forward to buying another one! The elastic has stretched out some but the stones are in perfect condition. I wear my bracelet everyday for the majority of the day. I’ve worked out and done yoga while wearing the bracelet with no issues.
5.0,"Looks just like the picture! Great quality; they are fairly thick, not cheap, practically-see-through material."
5.0,"With this mask, I can run out of dust, also can stop sweat, around the neck will not feel itchy, I like its style, I recommended it to my friends"
5.0,"Perfect size for cartilage hoop. I ordered the 20g 7mm and it fits snugly. Maybe could have gotten the 8mm for some more twirling room but I kind of like that it stays in place. I wanted something small, subtle and that doesn’t snag on towels or pillows. Just what I was looking for."
5.0,So gorgeous! My boyfriend loved the styles and the metal was flexible slightly so I could wear it over my glasses
5.0,"They measure 1.25"" and they are fun!  Sometimes my son and I wear the photos on our caps."
5.0,Very soft. Washes up well
5.0,Very cute and made surprisingly well for the price point!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! It is extremely comfortable and fits nicely. Only thing I don’t like about it is where the pockets are located and the depth of the product. The dress fits perfectly, but did buy a size smaller than I usually do. The material is perfect for spring weather. It is long so I do need to hold the dress while I walk so I don’t trip. For the price I paid I feel I got a good value & a well made dress."
5.0,These are super cute!  They're medium large and lightweight.
5.0,Super cute and goes with everything!
5.0,Great vest! Very true to fit and a perfect cover up over a strapless summer dress. This is very good quality and has held up well through washing and wearing.
5.0,I have a pair of Tony Lama Chocolat Lizards I bought back in 1992 but haven't worn for at least 15 years.  Bought this product to condition the leather before I put them on again for fear they might split or crack if not given a little TLC first. The product works very well and is easy to use.
5.0,I love this dress. It fits well.  If you look at the size and buy the right fit it is lovely.
5.0,"Great texture - super soft. Runs a little large, loose and comfy."
5.0,"I love these! My feet have been blistering from dancing so much, and these have saved the day!"
5.0,Love this ring. Good size
5.0,My mother LOVES these socks.
5.0,I really like this belt! It's lightweight but fits just right. It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing a belt. I like the fact there's no holes or buckles to contend with!
5.0,"The eyes on these are so easy to see out of and make it so much fun! My tiny humans did not appreciate how creepy they were but I sure did!! Hard plastic makes it hot and stuffy underneath, but for short times they’re perfect!"
5.0,"It was so warm and cozy, and the dog loved it too!"
5.0,Very nice dress socks. Fit is good. Bought them for a trip. Would buy again.
5.0,"Great fit, and nice classy look!"
5.0,"I love my new pjs.  I can mix and match with other black satin pjs variations for temperature and mood.  I have a very loving cat who sheds quite a bit so satin lounge wear is perfect to avoid the fuzzies.  Shutdown means staying home and playing with the kitty a whole lot more.  I don't wear anything else in the house.  Good quality, good fit, good price. Thank you, Im very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE pjs! My twin granddaughters loved them!
5.0,A mi hijo le encanta. Fue un regalo para el cumpleaños de mi hijo. Él se puso su reloj y me metió a la piscina por cinco horas. De verdad es a prueba de agua.
5.0,These pajamas are well made and very cute!
5.0,"To me, this is the best product of socks i have used so far, very comfy and fits nicely. worth 10 stars. (my second purchase)"
5.0,"Nice, sleeves are a good length and it was true to size. Got compliments. It's thin for hot summer wear."
5.0,"Love this short! Holds up nice, fits a little on the looser side. Nice quality material"
5.0,These shirts were for my mom that had shoulder surgery. I ordered them big so she could have plenty of room. She loved them. Easy to put on. It made her life so much easier after her surgery. Thank you so much
5.0,This dress is beautiful. I’m not sure why anyone have negative reviews. It’s very long and I’m 5’8 and would have to wear heals. It’s so beautiful in fact I might have to return it because it’s fancier than just a simple night out and I was looking for for a summer time look at a bbq. I have nothing bad to say and hate to return it 😢
5.0,So far I am really liking these glasses. I bought them for ever day wear. They came packaged very well. Nice case and protective sock. Very comfortable. I have very short hair so no issues with them pulling at it like another comment. I will consider buying a grey pair if these continue to hold up.
5.0,The Tesla 3D logo is eye catching.  It's become a conversational piece and the baseball cap is top quality.  Highly recommend
5.0,My husband loves this set of pj they fit much better than other brands I have brought.
5.0,I bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift.  It fits perfectly and looks great on him!  The detail on the cuffs gives it some extra style without going overboard.  It’s the second Robert graham shirt I’ve bought for my dad and he loves them!
5.0,"Excellent item, good quality"
5.0,Ordered this as a gift and it was too big.  Had to return it and reorder it.  Seller was super fast and had no problem with the return!  I ended up buying 2 more shirts from them because the service was great and the quality of the shirts is very nice.
5.0,"I love this belt!  It's ridiculously comfortable, very inexpensive and makes me look and feel so slim...  Instantly, every outfit fits better!"
5.0,I love my prayer shawl.  Quality is good also
5.0,"This mask is comfortable because of the behind the head strap that takes the strain off the ears.  It conforms to the face contours well and has a bendable nose bridge to prevent breathing onto your glasses and fogging them.  This is a mask you breathe through, not around.  I recommend it."
5.0,This necklace is just absolutely gorgeous the sparkle is stunning I’ve received many of compliments folks wanting to know where I bought this I said Kate Lynn on Amazon I am very pleased with my necklace 🥰🥰🥰
5.0,Most comfortable cardigans I own!
5.0,"It fits me perfectly, as it is very sctrechy. Warm, perfect for fall and winter time."
5.0,"These are absolutely incredible. Just what I was looking for to wear with my flats at work! I wear the Lucky Brand flats, and you cannot see the sock when wearing, which is perfect!"
5.0,"Very nice. I like the material, fits snuggly. Be mindful about what finished look you are aiming for.  I like a more relaxed look for wearing out, so I'll be ordering another a size larger.  This is excellent for wearing around the home. Definitely not complaining. The product is great."
5.0,Absolutely love this wallet!! My favorite wallet :) it has so many pockets to put everything in and it isn't bulky either
5.0,My friend suggested I buy this dress and I'm glad she did. I love this dress! I really like the weight of the fabric. It feels like a super comfy t-shirt but heavier so you don't  worry about it losing its shape. It is very long but I like that about it and I'll just wear it with heels.
5.0,Love it! Nothing like Jason and Freddy chilling at the camp enjoying a friendly vacation. This shirt is straight fire! Classic and fits just right. Will be wearing every chance I get.
5.0,"Wow i love the winter sweater.. It us the best made.. It fits me like glove. I love it so much.. It goes well with my laid back wear, nothing too fancy but just right. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy something that is just right for any occasion."
5.0,Wore this during a photoshoot. Fit was great and comfortable. It was not too sexy and professional.
5.0,Esta lindo muy buena calidad pero deberian hacer talla xs porque small es muy grande asi que si eres medium pidelo small

5.0,"I needed socks my toddler couldn't get off because it's a daily battle to keep them on.  These are cute and they stay on! Also, thin enough to wear with her shoes.  Just wish they sold larger sizes from 2-3T"
5.0,"I purchased this dress for my daughter in a size medium. She usually wears a women's size 4 and this dress was just a tad big on her, which I expected. She is in between a small and medium in size so this dress runs true to size. The colors are vibrant and true to the product photo. The neck comes down in a v but is not low cut. The dress is fitted at the waist with elastic. Even on a young girl this dress is complimentary. The material is not thin and is a little stretchy. I was given the opportunity to purchase this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of it. This dress is well made and can be worn casual or dressed up with the right earrings and necklace."
5.0,They are beautiful and delicate. My sister is obsessed with butterflies and this was a perfect gift for her. Well packed.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this coverup!  What a beautiful addition to my swim suit collection.  I feel the quality of this garment is very high - so much so that I wold be tempted to just wear it as an over garment over  tank top and wear it as an addition to my wardrobe and not just a beach coverup  I love the little pom pom detail along the edge as well.  They are very small and not overly noticeable at first glance so that's why I feel this could be worn just as a regular garment over jeans or leggings, etc.  I love this coverup and am very happy with it!"
5.0,"Wore this for my courthouse wedding and it was so appropriate, unique and beautiful ....! I received so many compliments on it. Couldn't have made a better choice!"
5.0,We got these sun glasses for the wife and she said they fit very well. They cover her glasses so they don't show. Great price for the product.

5.0,I like the color must and the fact that you can adjust it to the best fit for you!
5.0,Cute boots my daughter loves them

5.0,Very prompt delivery and easy to install. All tools provided
5.0,"I wanted this dress to wear to work as a maternity dress, as well as be able to wear it after I gave birth. I was a little put off when I received it because it is VERY thin. But once I tried it on, I had no issue with it. Of course you can't wear brightly colored underwear with it because you would see those, but if you kept everything neutral, it is actually a perfect summer/fall dress for south Texas. If I wouldn't be exclusively breastfeeding, I would be wearing it all of the time right now. The color is a beautiful soft pink. For work I wore it with a nice navy blue blazer. I didn't find any loose threads,, so it seems to be made very well. I actually plan to wear it in the winter with some tights, and a sweater. It will be a great year round piece."
5.0,Nice and quick shipping.
5.0,I'm not paying $800 for Gucci tights. Wore these on new years and they looked like the real deal. Really happy with these.

5.0,Very cute. I get a lot of complements.
5.0,"Packaging was nice so this would have been a nice gift. I bought this for myself though, and it was everything I expected. The tie is well-made and the clips were just what I needed compared to spending over $10 a clip from other sellers."
5.0,"This watch is beautiful and rugged.  Its probably even lightly water resistant as all parts seem tight. Keeps time pretty well, within a minute or two a day which is good for this price range."

5.0,I was going to return this as I wanted to wear it for golf and need pockets...the pockets are under the skirt part!  Something different but good to know ahead of time.  I plan to make it work!
5.0,"I Love these, they have been one of my favorite purchases in recent years. There are a couple of minor issues though. They are heavy so you need to use pins to hold them on, they do tangle and bump a lot of things so be careful how close your head gets to things and they don't store well so be prepared to have a safe place to put them where they won't get damaged."
5.0,I love the way they feel on your feet.  I run a lot and I noticed my feet don’t burn or hurt afterwards with these.  They are great for walking and any type exercise.  They literally hug your feet.
5.0,Great post op shirt for shoulder replacement. Easy to get on and off
5.0,Excelent quality. Beautifull
5.0,Just what I was looking for. I just wish they had variety of sizes instead of just two

5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, perfect under clothes or by itself."
5.0,"Cute, fits perfect, comfortable and soft, and my little loves them. Would absolutely order more."

5.0,"Well made. Very attractive ""classy"" case."
5.0,Absolutely love it. Received many compliments.
5.0,"These are built on Beefy-T's, making them thicker and more durable than most. The embroidery is tight, and the color does not run in the wash. Shrinkage is remarkably small considering this is all-cotton. It fit well even after 2 high-heat dryings. This is my second order of the same shirt, and now I think I want a few more. Good job, Ann Arbor Tees!"
5.0,Worked very well!!! Just a little elbow grease.
5.0,Great quality for the price.  Very sturdy.  Great pockets.  This is a keeper.

5.0,"Nice wallet, holds everything I need. Has three side pockets for like cash or other things, or in my case more cards. Holding up so far. Fits perfectly in my jeans back pocket."
5.0,"Great shirt overall great quality and material, fast shipping, I ordered a small hoping for a nice fitted tank top, I ended up with more of the athletic fitted tank I have to wear something underneath it to ensure nothing is hanging out otherwise I'd be dealing more than hugs."
5.0,"Bold Knights Templar ring, fitts well"
5.0,These pins are very pretty!
5.0,"My wife is a big fan of the show so we ordered this shirt. It didn't take too long to arrive. She loves it, I think it's a bit thin and see through, but maybe I am just being nit picky."
5.0,"Bought this partly as a cute joke because my manager always wears blue to work (not the same shade of course), but I really do love this top. Casual, very comfortable and still feminine."
5.0,"cool shirt, nice material"
5.0,Love this wrap.  It is warm and cozy. Would recommend it .

5.0,Made for a good gift
5.0,Versatile and comfortable👍👍❤

5.0,Great teacher gift and great price!
5.0,I love thus dress. It fits me perfectly and also love the color. yay
5.0,I got these glasses because I wanted some for bike rides. They will come in handy for when I'm out on the water fishing or just driving around too. With the five interchangeable lenses they are perfect for every occasion or weather.<br />When I got the glasses it came packaged in a small box about 5in +10in+ 2in. Inside the box was the carrying case. The case is hard plastic with a cool fabric design on the outside. Inside is black fabric. There is foam on the inside to to keep the glasses from sliding around. Each lens has its own slot cut in the foam to keep them seperate an from rubbing together. The case is held together by a good quality zipper. It also has a clip on the outside to clip it to a belt loop or backpack.<br />In the case there is five lens one is installed on the frame. There is a user manual that tells you how to attach an detach the lens when changing. A little bag to hold your glasses. An a cloth to clean the lens. An a string to put on the glasses that will sinch down to hold them tight on your head or hold them around your neck.<br />I really like the glasses an with the five lens can use them at night with the yellow lens that improve your visual contrast. The grey lens are good for bright sunny days. There uv protective an anti glare and block harmful light. The colorful lens are great for bright sunny days too an look cool an block harmful light too. The brown lens are more for over cast day. The clear lens has a hint of color reflection on the lens there more for riding in wind or rain.<br />The lens are easy to change hard part is not leaving finger prints on the lens when changing them. The frame is a little bulky but seems to hold up well. I really like these glasses and will be using them a lot in the future too.<br />Disclaimer I recieved these glasses for free or discount price for my honest unbiased review. My views of this product is my opinion an might vary from your opinion. I hope my opinion helps you. I would recommend these glasses they are a good price for what you get.
5.0,"absolutely LOVE this,  comfy,  right size.  need more of them !  A+++  fast ship too.  which ROCKED !!!  (again the step mom here  lol)"

5.0,"This is an amazing jacket, it's color and padding give the real feeling of wearing traditional leather while retaining a sense of warmth and comfort."
5.0,"Runs big but other than that it is super cute. It is meant to be a bit big but if you have a small head it's too big. Thick material, nice inner band, and nicely knit. Love it."
5.0,"Really cute, versatile dress. Gotta love being able to throw on one item and walk out the door. Very comfortable, soft material. Does not shrink after washing and colors remain bright. For reference I'm 5'6"" 190lbs"
5.0,Very well made.<br />Washed and dried with not problem.<br />Fabric is not as soft as expected .
5.0,"Have been purchasing this type of glasses for years. They are very light and comfortable, but that means they on the soft side so you have to be a bit careful. What I like about  EYE ZOOM is that the plastic part that sits on your nose, is screw in place and doesn't come off. The other brands making the same reading glasses keep that part in place by pressure and eventually they fall off."
5.0,It is beautiful …  I love it.
5.0,"I love dramatic, striking beach hats, and this one definitely doesn't disappoint. It looks very classy yet attention-grabbing. It holds the shape very well. The material is good-quality. I can't wait to wear it on my upcoming beach vacation."
5.0,"This thing is awesome! Nice big capacity for kayak trips, boat trips, camping, you name it! It's not see through so it doesn't get hot too fast. Large openings so you can easily fill it with ice, and it's nice for cleaning. I love this thing! It seals great too for no leaking when you're on the go. I kayak a lot so it's perfect for me. I'm very happy that I received this for so cheap. Less than two dollars thanks to an awesome promotional service! Would definitely buy another for the girlfriend!"
5.0,The necklace is an exquisite piece but the cord it came on was a bit flimsy so I replaced it with leather. All in all a wonderful purchase.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for; stays put during head-down yoga poses.
5.0,"This gown was perfect for my hospital visit whiile I gave birth. Every single nurse complimented me, the hospital cleaning lady and even my own mother who is nothing BUT critical of me."
5.0,Feels really nice and is cute! I love the backing!
5.0,The band arrived very quickly. I just love it!!
5.0,"5'4"", 150 lbs, ordered a M<br />I loved this dress, I wore it to a summer wedding and with a pair of heels it was the perfect length. Perfect amount of stretch, not too thin and it has POCKETS. Comes in lots of colors, can be dressed up or down. Excellent dress for the price."
5.0,"This was my first time using packing cubes on a trip. We had a large suitcase to pack for a trip to Europe. These cubes worked out great. I was able to fit three pairs of pants, two pairs of shorts, a dress and a jacket in the extra large one. I definitely recommend these for travel. It made it easy when we unpacked, as I kept my lingerie in one of the smaller ones."
5.0,"I work in a medical building and we have to have masks on at all times so I was happy to be able to purchase these for my Halloween Spirit week at work. The print is beautiful and vivid, I'd buy these again if I have to."

5.0,Love these leggings! They fit perfectly and hold everything in nice and tight.
5.0,Super cute! Thanks to all the other reviews I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and I'm glad I did. Fits perfect! I'm 5'1 130 lbs and went with a medium. It is short but not too short since I'm only 5'1
5.0,my biker loves these!
5.0,Well made. True to size. And hysterical.
5.0,I use these every morning to stir my coffee.  They work much better than the mini straws.  I wish they offered them in a white or black color versus beige.
5.0,"OK HERE IS THE THING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE THAT SHIRT I REALLY DO, BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY BIGGER SIZE, THAT'S THE ONLY ONE ISSUE, OTHER THAN THAT SELLER ARE HONEST COMPANY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU SO PLEASE QUALLITY IS GOOD SELLER IS GREAT IT'S JUST SIZE IS SMALLER THAN IT SAYS.<br /><br />I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMEND THIS COMPANY."
5.0,"Works really well for my 5 year old for swim team, doesn't seem to,complain about fogging or leaking goggles."
5.0,Increible!!<br />Excelente diseño y calidad.<br />Parece original de La Perla.

5.0,"Soft, good fit, for thin people . Quality ok"

5.0,Very nice sturdy and smooth earrings. I got the round disc one and the size is just right. Suitable for all occasions! Love!
5.0,"I think overall it is really nice. My almost 12 year old has loved Frozen since it came out. She has always tied a blanket around her shoulders to use as an Elsa cape. This will make her really happy. It is quite thin, but not so thin I worry about tearing easily. For the price, I am happy with it. First time I found a Frozen like cape that wasn't ridiculously expensive."
5.0,"Looks like a good quality shoe, as usual, from Nike. That's why I buy from them."

5.0,I love this dress. Perfect for a fall day with leggings or jeggins and some knee high boots. Material feels great. Size was perfect. Add a belt for fun and to show your shape. If it had pockets that would have been awesome.

5.0,"Purchased as a bridesmaid dress and it fits lovely.  Looks good for the price.  I am about 125 lbs, 5'2&#34;, 36D and a small fit well, falling about 2 inches above my knee.  Should look great dressed up or down in the future too!"
5.0,I fell in love with these workout pants. After reading the comments it stated to size up but they are true to size. I ordered a 1X and wish I hadn't too large.For reference I'm 220 5'3&#34; and wear a xl.

5.0,Nice product!!!!
5.0,This mask was beautiful. It fit well and felt comfortable on my face. I got many compliments and it looks great in pictures.
5.0,I always get compliments. Perfect crop top. Slightly see through.
5.0,Great hat. Great quality
5.0,"Nice quality! Fits as expected, didn't shrink when I washed it and the print is durable"
5.0,Very nice cuff links<br />Looking forward to wearing them
5.0,"Thrilled it came to my place in 3 days and on a holiday, this product looks like it will last a long time."
5.0,This skirt is perfect. Exactly what I ordered. I love the stretch and the elastic waistband in the back. The front split is not too high and the fringe at the bottom provides a stylish look.
5.0,Super cute but why isn’t there snaps at the crotch. Diaper changing kind of is a hassle but - it is well made and cute. Very original
5.0,I love them! They are pretty comfy too!
5.0,I really like the fit..glad I purchased more than one color.
5.0,I absolutely love it! ^^
5.0,"This has realy made wearing a mask more bearable. Helps you to breath better, and helps to keep my glasses from fogging up"
5.0,"nice quality, very cute"
5.0,They stay on!  All day!  I have size 10.5 feet and NO previous footie socks have stayed on.
5.0,Beautiful earrings! Very dainty and well priced.<br />They look like white gold!
5.0,"You guys this is so cute. The elastic waist part is generous with a functional drawstring. I had extra fabric in the tummy area, allowing me to tie the drawstring tight and then still have a ""draped"" look around the tummy and gut. Length is good and I'm 5'4""."
5.0,"Delivered on time , looks the way that I expected"
5.0,So far so good. It is a tiny wallet- can only hold about 8-10 cards. That's good for me since I tend to be a packrat but it's something for others to know. I haven't had any problem with it staying folded and it is SUPER slim so no bulk in my pocket.
5.0,"I have been a Brooks fan for many years, more specifically a big fan of the Pure line. I’ve been running in Pure Cadence shoes since the version 2 was released. I typically run 25-30 miles a week, and what I love about these shoes, is that it doesn’t feel like that much to my feet. They offer enough cushion to make long runs (10-14 miles) comfortable, yet they are very responsive and provide a good connection with the road. I love the no slip laces that come with these. Not one time have they ever come unlaced. Plenty of room in the toe box helps to alleviate blister that are common with distance runners, and the secure fit around my feet make them feel like an extension of my feet. I really do love everything about these shoes."
5.0,"I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy this. It makes a huge difference.  You still sweat, but your vest doesn't lay on your shirt anymore.  This lets air circulate between you and the vest.  I've had it for a few months and it's held up very well."
5.0,"I read all of the reviews before I ordered.  Because I did this I knew what size to order.  I wear between a 12-14 Misses and usually underwear size 8 (sized different than pants).  I ORDERED THE XXXL, which normally would be way to big. They arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I liked the colors.  The material felt nice.  I was looking for a boy short like the ones Hanes made before they changed the cut several years ago.  I tried these on and they were awesome.  I would call myself curvy.  That said the XXXL fit perfect.  The we're not too tight.  They are so comfortable.  They go down the legs a couple of inches which is what I was looking for.  They did not shrink when washed. I am getting ready to order more because I am not sure how long these will be on Amazon.<br /><br />CON: There is one con which was mentioned in another review.  I checked the tags on all of them and they all were tagged XXXL.  One pair was definately a size or two smaller.  I liked the underwear so much it was not worth taking a star off.  I'm losing weight so hopefully the odd ball one will fit better soon."
5.0,Excelente muy bien
5.0,This vest is soft and  fits well. It is just the right weight for use during the next few months.  It is well made.
5.0,I have three of these! Great fabric and fit!
5.0,Nice design and quality for the price!
5.0,So cute! Modest but fun. My husband even complimented me. ❤😉👍
5.0,"I initially purchased the gray pair. I loved the foot and look so much that I purchased three more pairs, all different colors. What I like: The fit. The materials. The short inseam. The styling. Great for leg days."
5.0,"I have never been able to find a bikini that is showed and fit my body type, the top is so so supportive and covers everything! The bottoms are also very cheeky and fit great and tight! Their very true to size and this is my new favorite bikini for sure! I got the purple and I've never been more happy."
5.0,I like the outfit. However I am a size ten and the extra large fit snug around my hips. It fits and I am happy with it.
5.0,They are so glomorous and unique. Also bought them as gift for my mom.
5.0,These are really nice in person. They look much more expensive than they were. They are the perfect addition to my collection because they're simple and can be worn with so much.
5.0,"The fabric is soft and fits well. Its casual, but can be dressed up. I luv this top!"
5.0,Sturdy yet lightweight; very chic
5.0,"My pink loving toddler LOVES this dress. I was afraid she would be irritated by the tulle skirt but she is fine with it; the dress, overall, is very soft and comfortable."
5.0,"They were exactly what I wanted. I had purchased a blue pair in store, and wanted another pair. The image and sizing is accurate. Excellent pricing. Great pants for under $20. I get a lot of compliments. Might look into buying more colors."
5.0,"Very pretty, fits well"
5.0,This shirt is gorgeous! The colors are vibrant and a very cute design. I ordered my normal size.
5.0,Very good leather with no blemishes.
5.0,comfortable .. light .. will protect my arms !
5.0,This has been my go to this summer! I have wore so much and it’s held up so well. I love it! It goes with so much and adds a lil flare to your wardrobe.
5.0,Holds up well even at -25 - -30 C
5.0,"Both my little one and I love this outfit.  (Pink and white bunny, Size 5T).  It is cute, comfortable, and soft.  It appears to be made well - all seams are complete and there are no loose threads.  It washes nicely and the skirt material has not unraveled or snagged after multiple washings.  We would recommend this outfit."
5.0,I  love ❤️ this jumpsuit. It is very comfortable. I am 4’ 11” weight is 123. So length is PERFECT 👌. I am ordering more colors. Price is affordable too.
5.0,I love them they are very cute and fit perfect
5.0,"This cap is much nicer than it looks like in the photo. I expected the buck design to look cheap, but, it doesn't. The buck design is nicely embroidered onto the cap. The colors used were really complimentary to the bright orange. I bought this for my stepdad who is an avid deer hunter for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. Also, I'm glad it works as a safety precaution too, by wearing orange on his head while hunting."
5.0,"I ordered a small and it fit perfectly (130lbs). Some times items made from this material are too tight in the chest (C), but I didn't have that problem with this dress. I really liked that there were real belt loops on the dress, not just two flimsy pieces of string to hold the belt in place. The colors were vibrant and beautiful. The material was light and cool.<br /> The only probably I had was that I needed to wear a dress slip with it. It's not extremely thin, but in the bright sun you would be able to see through it.<br />Overall though, I love it."
5.0,"Beautifully crafted, love this quality ring!"
5.0,"The dress is just amazingly amazing 🤩, the fabric is good, nothing happens to it after washed…<br />I definitely Recommend it<br />Just got a size L instead of M coz I wanted it a bit larger"
5.0,My husband loves it. Great quality
5.0,"Great lenses, fit perfectly, good optical clarity. Inside part of lense has a reflective coating that causes a small amount of blue light to reflect in your eyes with direct sunlight."
5.0,"I know I just got this yesterday, but I love this hoodie. It’s not thick so it makes for a nice shirt it’s a little see though (I might just be paranoid so if course I wore a tank top under it). I’m bigger so I was really iffy on the size and got the 4x and it has room in the front to be just a little baggy. I had so many compliments from wearing it that it is now probably my favorite."
5.0,Absolutely love this bag. I use it to carry my laptop and portfolio along with other items and it is great!
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Doesnt look cheap.
5.0,Dress looked great for flower girls in a wedding; fit was as expected per sizing chart. Excellent value for the price! All four girls loved the dress!
5.0,"The look, feel, and weight of the jacket is perfect for summer evenings: loose-fitting, soft, and light weight! The ""light blue"" is more of a periwinkle."
5.0,Total outdoor cafe feel.  Yes it’s a ridiculous price.  But with COVID and all the money you’re saving dining in......this baby makes you feel like every night is Cantina night.  Arriba!!!!! Enjoy and stay safe.
5.0,This wallet came in a really nice box and was wrapped in tissue paper.  Quite an impressive presentation for the price.  I'm thinking it would make a good gift for someone.  They'd think you spent a lot of money on it!  The wallet seems to be very well made and rugged although time is the true judge.  It is a little thicker than I like for carrying in my front pocket but that might be my fault for packing it full with all my stuff.  It easily held all the contents of my bi fold wallet.  The money clip is very nice with a strong magnet.  It held $100 in twentys plus some extra bills folded in half.  My last front pocket wallet had a spring clip that was difficult to load and unload and the corners of the spring clip eventually wore through the leather.  This one lays flat so it shouldn't be an issue.  I'm looking forward to breaking it in but I think it's going to be a keeper.
5.0,Really helps to breath better in the masks
5.0,"The package arrived on time, and everything was included! It is decent quality and I don't have anything to complain about at all! Each ear matches up with it's pair perfectly 💕"
5.0,"Love these headbands - they're super cute and fun! The best part is you can mix and match the bows with the headbands, so the options are limitless!"
5.0,Looked great very happy...
5.0,"5’5” 140 lbs. I initially ordered a medium and it was ginormous. So big that I returned and order the extra small. It is very loose everywhere except he top where it fits as an extra small should. I am<br />A full C also and the size xs was great for me even with a full padded bra on making me a full D. Great quality, shipped fast, would totally buy again."
5.0,"I am 5'9&#34; tall and usually wear a size 6/8, so I am between a true small and medium.  I was unsure how to gauge the size on this dress, especially in length.  Many reviewers stated to order two sizes up, and I looked at the sizing guide from the company, and ended up  ordering an XL, which is two sizes up from a medium.  I was mostly concerned with the length, though. And based on reviews, I fully expected it to be too short, especially to wear with heels.<br />The dress arrived in the two days as promised and it was perfect, lengthwise, even for my 5'11 daughter, who tried it on, too, but it was too big ( and she is about a size 12 and very large busted).  Definitely too big for me to be able to wear that night.  The fabric has a nice stretch to it and is incredibly comfortable, I ordered the blue, which also has a blue lining, and it really is beautiful...much more expensive looking.  I had a black tie event that night and it was perfect for it...except the size. There is a zipper on the upper part of the left side, but I didn't realize that and just slipped it over my head with no problem, as did my daughter.<br />I have a neighbor that is an amazing seamstress, and I ran the dress over to her.  She took it up almost 4 inches total and it was perfect!  She had to remove the zipper, which was fine.  I can still just put it over my head due to the stretch of the fabric.  Size-wise, I probably needed the medium, but now I also had the length I need!  The static cling issue is real, and it really did take almost a full can of anti-cling stuff to get rid of it, but it did, and I wore it that night.  I paid my neighbor almost twice her asking price for the alteration, I was so appreciative, and it was worth every penny.<br />This dress will travel well for cruises, and is appropriate for any formal function!  I was comfortable all evening, too.  Great buy!"
5.0,Super comfortable and looks great on!
5.0,Beautiful ring ... my girlfriend loved it! She knew Princess Diana's engagement ring was a Sapphire.
5.0,"I was so excited when they came today , thought it would of been some time next week ! The earrings are very pretty and feminine , delicate looking and different from what others may be wearing ! ( i like to be a bit diff frm every one else) lols any ways these earrings are just gorgeous and even the packing material was pretty :D mos def am ordering again from her  and check out her facebook page with a ton more of pretty earrings :D"
5.0,cutest thing ever. everyone asks where i got it.
5.0,"If I were two order it again I would order one size down, but I love it"
5.0,I love the fact that you can just flip them up and you can see with your regular glasses and flip them down if the sun gets too bright to where everything you can still see through your prescription glasses
5.0,"The dress is amazing! The color is vibrant and the dress is well made. It truly is a beautiful dress, hence the 5 star rating. However, if I could rate Amazon on this one order, I would give them 2 stars because they sent me the wrong size. I ordered a size 12 and they sent me a size 2.  My daughter was extremely disappointed, the sizes were not even close where we could make it work. The only good thing is, the dress was easy to return for a refund."
5.0,Bought these for party favors for my sons birthday party. I think the kids will love them. I recommend this item.
5.0,Very nicely made pants
5.0,"I love my dress!!! My boyfriend picked it out for me. I love polka dots! I will be getting some more dresses from you. Thanks, Kena Chaney 🐸😘"
5.0,"My 7 year old daughter wanted to be catwoman for Halloween but didn't want to wear a cheesy costume.  I found this mask on Amazon.com for a great low price, well worth the money!  It is an adult costume but rather tight for my face.  A little loose for my daughter's but no complaints what-so-ever.  It was a total hit at her school, everyone loved it.  Will be wearing this for another Halloween in the future!"
5.0,"This box/ chest is great! Worth every penny, its huge! The locks are a joke. If anyone wanted whats inside they could just take the whole thing anyway. They would keep small children out. My wife loves it, and so do I. Very well made, if you take care, it should stand the test of time. Reccomend it for every lady."
5.0,"They aren't lightweight, but they are absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend!!! The peace signs are my favorite!"
5.0,Quality and sexy !
5.0,Comfortable - perfect to relaxing at home
5.0,I bought these based on the positive reviews and I have not been disappointed. They are soft and stay in place. I’ve been very happy with my purchase. I will be making more in the future.
5.0,Appear to be well made. Great length and fit for my husky 4 foot 6 inch tall 103 pound 10 year old.
5.0,"Love the balls on the arms of these glasses. Hugs face without being painful. High quality, and cute!!!!"
5.0,"I got it for my wife and she love it,she said it is so warm,"
5.0,"I have several of these dresses but this one has POCKETS. These are deep pockets. I live in a very hot and humid climate, I love these dresses."
5.0,It has great tucking.  love it.  They are so cute.
5.0,"I made a sling out of Paracord, and wanted to use webbing to make it adjustable.  The Tri-Glide Slide was perfect for this.  I used 2 of the 1"" slides, and sewed the ends of the webbing so it was adjustable.  I was worried that it wouldn't hold it's position, but after I got it together I was very happy.  The adjusting slide moves up and down the webbing very easily, but it stays put.<br />Very well constructed, and good color.  I am very happy."
5.0,"holds together well after machine washing and drying, as well as in chlorine or salt waterl"
5.0,My 12 year old granddaughter loves this necklace! 🦋
5.0,"This review is for &#34;Drymax Hyper-Thin No-Show Running Socks, 2-Pack, Black, Small&#34; sold by MadAthlete and fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />I love these socks! So far I use them just for exercise, but I may get more for everyday use. The fit is great. They fit just as expected. As for the no-show aspect, I'm satisfied. They still show a little, but all no-show socks do for me. The material is very thin, just how I like socks! I can't speak to the longevity of the material though. I'll try to update after I've used them a while. The best thing about them is that they stay put! They don't slip down inside my shoe like other no-shows have.<br /><br />Very good purchase, definitely recommend!"
5.0,Perfect fit for my Versa Fitbit. I have received many compliments and inquiries about my new band. I absolutely love it and it does not irritate my skin.
5.0,"Loved them had to have them, they shipped quickly very satisfied"
5.0,It was the right size and cute. Wish they had more
5.0,Pretty cool glasses for the price
5.0,Just the right fit me with excellent quality material and the true rich colors. The price leaves no reason to complain and be pleasantly surprised. Ordering more soon!!
5.0,Wish it had longer straps so you could use it like a cross body bag.
5.0,"I love how these make my dresses look. They are super cute, easy to put on, and most importantly THEY STAY IN PLACE! I am very happy with these!"
5.0,Love the price for a lulu dupe. Holds up well when washing too!
5.0,Love the style of this shirt and it fit perfectly
5.0,My dad bought this for me in 2005. I loved it and lost it after a few days. Here I am today after 17 years to buy this after getting tired of expensive watches.
5.0,Love it. Made just for me
5.0,Perfect size purse
5.0,"It works really well.  I have heavy glasses that I wear for work that start to slide at times.  This is the only style of retainer that really works for me, and I have tried many. The larger tightener helps keep them from sliding as easily.  The part that attaches to the eyeglass rim also holds very tightly, even to a very small frame."
5.0,Fit is perfect material is durable pockets are wonderful
5.0,These are adorable! They fit very well. I wear a size 6.5-7. They seem to be made very well. Plus they arrived like 2 weeks before expected. I would definitely buy another pair.
5.0,Super cute. The vinyl material is easy to clean.
5.0,"Important details:<br />I am 5'1.5/2"" tall<br />I have an hourglass figure, with grown woman hips/curves.<br />I wear between a size 12 petite and 14 petite in pants currently depending on cut.<br /><br />I have been specifically searching for true jeans that are both stretchy and skinny *while*  being a modern cut/rise that doesn't bisect my torso. So so many jeans that are supposed to be tailored for womanly hips/curves, even in petite sizes have a rise that have come well above my belly button. Which if you are under 5'3"" you understand how horribly uncomfortable that is!<br /><br />These are my new favorite miracle jeans!!!<br /><br />They are thick, true jeans with the perfect amount of stretch! So unbelievably comfy, stay put and hold their shape perfectly. I work with young children and need jeans I can go-go-go in without worry - no gap or plumbers crack. They have FOUR FUNCTIONAL pockets!!! The low rise is a perfect moderate rise on me falling below my belly button but above the zone I personally deem immodest. Functional zipper and button too! They are much too long, but I knew that at purchase. They taper perfectly and can be cuffed for booties, easily hemmed, or seamlessly glide into tall boots.<br /><br />I am blown away! I've already ordered two more pairs. Pictures to come."
5.0,this dress is amazing! great for nursing
5.0,I appsolutly love these earrings I also have them in green very good buy
5.0,Bought these for my nephew who just became an RN. He loves the shoe and wears it f ou r those 12 hour shifts!
5.0,This pendant was just the right kinda heavy and the perfect size for the event in which I needed it for. All stones in tact. The pin was in the right place so the pendant didn’t tilt once put into place. Worth ever penny .
5.0,seems to be a very warm cover for my kids head.
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable. Long enough."
5.0,Felt the need to splurge on me for once and I am so glad I did! I love this robe! Not too heavy not too light it's perfect and so cozy!
5.0,"I love these mittens! Sophisticated, beautiful, very warm and super soft. These look awesome with my winter coat. They are well worth the price. Delivered sooner than promised. They are actually much more beautiful than in the pictures. They are a perfect fit, exactly as measurements described. They arrived with a satin ribbon, nicely packaged for a gift. I highly recommend these mittens, and I'm going to buy more as holiday gifts."
5.0,This band is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits perfectly on my Fossil smart watch.  I have very small wrists and my old Fossil band was too big even on the smallest hole.  This band fits much better on my childlike wrists.  Looks and feels great!
5.0,Nice hat to match my nice lanyard that matches my sweet Buick!
5.0,Well I bought this for a anniversary present for my girlfriend. When she opened it she loved it and switched to this one immediately. It seems to be well made coming from a guy who knows nothing about purses but it seemed quite small she had to switch her wallet. Other than that a perfect gift.
5.0,"I gave a 5 star because I love it & it fits very nice on me, but I noticed once I put it on or off my straps are coming undone from the back. That’s annoying, but other than that I love it the swimsuit"
5.0,"Love the fabric. so soft, comfy and can be casual or dressed up. Great addition to my wardrobe! I am going to by it in some different colors and want the same in short sleeve.  Love it!!!"
5.0,"The sock works wonders, can sit at my desk all day and still have an ankle when I get home."
5.0,Perfect fit and fabulous
5.0,"Great buy! Color, fit and material/design/ruffle are all high quality. I bought the size 3-5 for my 3 year olds. Perfect fit with room to grow."
5.0,"I needed a watch for the Army Basic Training and this watch was the best! It has a loud alarm and tells you the date, stop watch and glows in the dark when needed. It’s also small, so when getting smoked you won’t have a problem hurting your wrist!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:bd8cedbe57e234467f5bdb65eff219a7]] So I’m love with this pair of Sojos.  These are so light and comfortable I can barely tell I’m wearing Sunglasses.  I am a huge fan of the black in this style and the lens isn’t  too dark either. These don’t disappoint at all!
5.0,Beautiful top and quality was very nice and well packaged.
5.0,"I love these headbands :) I have a really small head so I was worried they wouldn't fit well, but they stay on great even when I am running or at the gym. They look really cute too! Never had a problem with these. Definitely looking to buy more :)"
5.0,"I never liked wearing boxer briefs, until I bought Hofish, 95% cotton, breathable! These boxes briefs are very comfortable, I don't even feel them on me when I wear pants over them, I love that they are short cut and seamless, they make my legs look bigger, and my ass stick out. Love these underwear, I will definitely replace all my boxers by Hans and fruit if the loom with Hofish!!!"
5.0,Great t- shirt. Ordered twice
5.0,Very nice boots. Looks great with jeans.
5.0,A relative that has ALS was needing this duster. She uses it to wear during the day as well as sleeping. It’s easy for her to get on because it has a snap front
5.0,It was larger than I expected.<br />I do like it.
5.0,Perfect height socks and they match with almost everything. Very pleased.
5.0,"When I bought these I really thought that I was expecting too much. I really didn't think that they would stay without slipping down just like every half sock. Well, they don't. They live up to be just what the product states it will do. When I buy again I will downsize as I ordered them to big because I thought they would run small.  I would rate these a 5 star product! 😁<br />,"
5.0,"a very good material,  it was nice . my son like it"
5.0,I like this dress. I paired it with a jacket however the off the shoulder look is nice too. Good material and very classy.<br />It fit as expected.
5.0,Good priced umbrella. Quality is good
5.0,Great sunglasses for the price.  Not heavy on the nose and dark enough for those really sunny days! :)
5.0,"Soft, colorful leg warmers that resemble the description. Love them!!"
5.0,Runs a little wide for a 3t but absolutely beautiful! We got this for our niece and the colors and design are so cute. It is soft and airy perfect for the spring or summer ! Very happy
5.0,"Wish they had more colors than white available in my size when I ordered, but I get compliments everytime I wear it. So happy for a cotton sweater! Nice and big and comfy and beautiful! And NO ACRYLIC anywhere! Yay!"
5.0,This Cross is beautiful. I really love it. I love  the style and the size of the cross. Good price.
5.0,A really nice jewelry set. The stones are even more beautiful than the pictures show in the ad. A terrific value and wonderful gift!
5.0,"Beautiful earrings look exactly as I expected. Can't beat the price, totally recommend!"
5.0,This is an amazing and awesome hat!
5.0,Great price. Fast delivery. Good quality for the money.
5.0,"My wife loves hers, seems well made. Only issue was I ordered a small and it was way too big, so we went to a watch repair place and had some links removed."
5.0,I was so happy find these on Amazon - I had them before and loved them.  Good quality.
5.0,love this fng boot!  i bought it in camel as well.  fits well.  i can walk in them!  comfortable.
5.0,"I haven't used them yet.  It is too warm now for a glove like this.  They are well made, fit the way I like them.  I won't know about the -30° thing until I wear them to blow snow this winter."
5.0,"My favorite feature of these eyeglass holders are the way they grip to the ear pieces.  They stay put so I don't have to worry about my glasses slipping out. They aren't as stretchy as some of the other styles,  but certainly long enough."
5.0,This is so cute and perfect
5.0,I like it.  It protects the coin well.
5.0,This cap it thick enough and it fits perfectly. It doesn’t slide or hold too tight. It’s very comfortable.
5.0,Order 2 sizes up for comfort after washing.
5.0,"This review is for 'Loritta Girls' Microfiber Footed Tight, Set of 2 S'<br />I ordered it for my daughter who has joined the summer dance classes. It fits very well on her. It is also very gentle on her skin. She feels very comfortable in those TIGHTS.<br />It supplements very well for the ballerina costume.<br /><br />Also it comes in a set of 2 different colors. Though the colors are basic white and black. I don't complain as they look good on her.<br /><br />Only thing that I'm afraid of is its longevity. It is very delicate so haven't washed it in machine. My wife wash them with hands so that it remains gentle and doesn't shrink.<br />Will update the review after a while again after some prolonged usage.<br /><br />For now, this set stands out for its price and the quality material."
5.0,The job looked it!!
5.0,Cute. A little big for my  18 month old but the smallest I could find. It came in great shape and has held up through classes and the wash. I think I accidentally dried out as well and it is still fine. I wouldn't put it through the dryer intentionally though.
5.0,Comfortable and fits well.  Colors are fun and nice
5.0,"I love this dress. My daughter says it looks like a costume, but I disagree. The fabric is soft and stretchy, very comfortable. The sleeves are plenty long and fit nicely around the wrist. I even got a compliment on the dress from a perfect stranger at the formal wedding I wore this for."
5.0,best braws ever
5.0,"Bought this as cover up for running and for upcoming triathlon. I LOVE it. Wore it over a pair of Sporti Tri shorts for a 3 mile run in 98 degree heat. It was comfortable, not hot, didn't get heavy with sweat. I will be buying more is these. I bought mediums and I'm 5'3 145#."
5.0,The prettiest of them all<br />I could say 100 at of 100<br />Beautiful Inexpensive dress beautiful detail<br />Second choice for my daughter and this was the first choice at first ended up purchasing this one and some other one I could say you won’t go wrong with the dress second my daughter did complain alittle itching everywhere overall I loved the dress
5.0,Nice shirt.  Good quality and looks great.
5.0,I absolutely love this . I have it on right now .
5.0,Great quality. A bit tight but over all great.
5.0,So pleased with the mask.<br />Well made.<br />Thank you for the quality of material used.
5.0,I got this same necklace in gold and I love this one just as much. It arrived so fast and I wear it almost everyday.
5.0,Great looking shirt; fit great!!
5.0,"The best thing about these socks is that they are 100% wool. There are no synthetic materials in these socks like 99.9% of the socks sold in the U.S., so those who are allergic can rest assured that they won't cause an allergic reaction. They do tend to run small, so buy a size larger. They will shrink in the dryer as well, so line or rack dry. Very thick and warm. Highly recommend."
5.0,My son absolutely loved this shirt!!!<br />Perfect fit and comfy!
5.0,I got it for my 2 year old it was kinda big but I let my 3 year old wear it was kinda shirt but it was great

5.0,I love everything about this watch nice and simple watch.

5.0,"Great prop for cosplay, good weight, feels and looks amazing."
5.0,Love the color. Fits well. Cute
5.0,"These are my favorite earrings!!! I have worn them for five months. Only taken them off to clean with alcohol! No itchy or irritation at all...which is amazing since I have very sensitive earlobes. Also, no discoloration or dullness! I want to buy more pairs but they are out of stock..eek! Hope you restock soon! My ears thank you 🤩🥰"
5.0,"The Red color is spot on to the photo and overall, the fit was great and quality decent for the price! I was not disappointed! The buttons don't tend to come undone with  really firm tug. They could be a little bigger, but once on my body, I have no issues."
5.0,Super cute colors!
5.0,"I love this so much, I immediately bought 2 more in other colors!  I just wanted something comfortable to wear around on the weekends that wasn't a sport bra.  Well, this fits well enough that I can actually wear it under &#34;real&#34; clothes, and to work.  And it's super pretty and flattering on!  I'm delighted with this bra!!"
5.0,I have a lot of watches. I just collect them over time. Very nice watch. One of my favorites.
5.0,The fabric and fit are great.

5.0,Very useful.  My grandson has not lost his mittens for awhile.
5.0,"I admit, my experiences with clothing from the Far East has been...frustrating.  It's either something where I have to buy something two sizes larger and MAYBE it'll fit me fine, or I get the product and it's far from what the listing here on Amazon seemed to suggest.<br /><br />So, with that skepticism in mind, I searched for a cardigan that wasn't too ""grandfatherly"" but rather more chic and comfortable and of all the many brands I looked at (and trust me, there are a LOT on Amazon), Coofandy was the one I kept coming back to.  For $22, I figured it wouldn't be too much of a hit in the wallet and if it was terrible, I could always return it.<br /><br />The minute I pulled it out of the sealed plastic envelope, I knew this was going to work just fine.  It's not too heavy, the color is neutral enough (I ordered grey) to match my work clothes and most importantly...it fit perfectly!<br /><br />Well...nearly.  The sleeves are a tad too long, but folding them back a little actually makes it look a bit more trendy, so I'm not mad at it. :)  It's the perfect thing for my office, which is often running the AC even in the middle of winter (our facilities manager doesn't like to put ""stress"" on the heating system so my office is called the ""Icebox"" in the winter months).  I wore it a couple of days ago and I got a lot of compliments on it, so I'm very pleased with my purchase.  I'm probably going to buy another one so I can keep one at work and at home.<br /><br />Coofandy folk -- I would love to see this in some more colors...hint hint. ;)"
5.0,"Bought normal size and the light compression feels great. We wash on delicate, cold water and hang dry. 5 months in and they are holding up great and I wear one every day. We've purchased 9 of these total. Very happy with this purchase."

5.0,Love the keychain. Very sturdy and practical
5.0,Fits just like a compression top. I thought I was going to be hot in this due to it being a bit thicker then I expected.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was really comfortable in it all day. I work in a medical office and they keep it cold. I wore these under my scrubs.  Glad I purchased them.
5.0,I love this beach blanket! It is big enough for 2 people to sit on and fabric is very soft. I took it for a week long beach trip and we did not have any washer or dryers in our condo. It dried very quickly and I was worried it would smell after 6 days on the beach sand but it did not have any odor at all. I would definetly recommend this product!
5.0,I love the fact that these don't poke my head and can stay in all the time.

5.0,"So I have had these boots for a few weeks now and I must say they are absolutely perfect! I was hesitant at first to get them because I'm a very picky person especially when it comes to shoes, but I have no complaints about these. I wear an 8.5 and got an 8.5 and they fit perfectly.

5.0,My son is seven years old and plays Little League baseball with a pitching machine and this product is just as stated it will protect his berries and he claims it to be a little uncomfortable but that’s something that just  something he will need to get used to because wearing an athletic supporter feels a little weird at any age.
5.0,"I love this hat, and that it is a veteran's hat that I (a woman) can feel ok with wearing. It's not a typical veteran hat. It's a good quality material with an embroidered, velcro closure on the back that gives it a higher quality feel."

5.0,"I have been using this watch model for over 20 years. It's great for timing sprint and distance intervals, even to the hundredth of a second. My last purchase lasted five years and I replaced it only because the strap broke (same as all the others). The watch was still keeping excellent time without a battery replacement."

5.0,"Loved the fit, the style and quality was great. My go-to shorts."

5.0,"This dress is super soft & falls very flatteringly.  The v neck is quite low, I pinned it for security!!  And it’s a little sheer, tho not a problem cos I wear slip shorts under it.  But the length, style & fit are spot on!  It’s cool on its own, and easy to layer w a blazer or sweater.  I’m 5’5”, 110 lbs, for reference, and ordered the small.  Very pleased!!"
5.0,Very sparkly and fit perfectly.
5.0,Love my outfit. It fits perfect

5.0,The recipient of this shoehorn was slightly overwhelmed with our gift and kissed IT.<br />The product if a very classy item for a classy guy or dad (or yourself !)<br />Most of us would never buy something like this for ourselves--too expensive--<br />and that is precisely why it's a great gift that will last a lifetime.
5.0,"I used to buy Hanes' Just My Size briefs, but in recent years they have changed the cut and material so they are uncomfortable and don't fit correctly. I've been trying different brands for months trying to find underwear that sits at my natural waist and doesn't have excess material in the butt. These are incredibly comfortable. They stretch to cling to your curves but don't bind at all. I'll be purchasing many more packs to ensure I don't run out if they're discontinued."

5.0,"My daugher loves these gloves, purchased them for my 18 year old daughter.  The glove fit good, but if you have large hands they many not fit well."
5.0,Outstanding. But I broke my Ankle and Tibia at the fight

5.0,Perfect dress. Very light and perfect for hot weather. Originally ordered a large but it was tight in the chest so I got an xl and it’s loose in the chest but it works just fine. Got tons of compliments on it when I wore it to a wedding.
5.0,"Beautiful suit, heavyweight material.  Ordered a size 4, I am 5'5&#34; and 110 lbs. and this suit fit perfect.  The top ties on, the cups are slightly padded, and the skirt hides a boy short bottom.  Initially I was disappointed upon opening the package as the midsection of the suit looked loose and puffy but once on it somehow works itself out.  Fast shipping too, I would recommend this item."
5.0,Exactly what I expected<br /> Easy and fun to wear.
5.0,Love this set and so does my grandson!
5.0,Lively earrings. No complaints.

5.0,"I love this dress - it's so cute, vibrant & comfy!  I ordered a size Large and it is a little more loose than I prefer but they no longer have a size Medium so I'd rather keep it than not have it at all.  (I am normally between a size 10-12.)

5.0,"I love this wallet. I know that it is a man's wallet, but I like it because it has so many slots to put in all my cards. The two zipper parts are  large as well. I use one for my checkbook and one for cash. I have every slot full, and some are doubled up, and also a checkbook in one of the zipper parts and it still folds and snaps and fits perfectly in my purse. I love the leather, it matches the purse I got from them."
5.0,The skirt is really cute! Very good quality for a ballet style skirt. I am not sure what else to write.
5.0,Love these for workouts!
5.0,"Very comfortable, stretchy, adjustable band. Easy to install on my Galaxy active 2. Will probably get additional bands in other colors."

5.0,Me gusto que son como se miran en foto y ala vez un poco duros pero buena calidad.
5.0,i like the weight of it .not too hot .the longer length is flattering
5.0,"Originally, I purchased the black front pocket/large collared pullover in size small for my 13 y/o. He liked it which says a lot right there. It’s like a perfect middle grade thickness. Not to thin but not crazy heavy. I tried it on and decided that my daughter (23) would also love it. It’s casual with the front pocket but the collar dresses it up just enough to make it wearable for many occasions. After hers arrived and I was putting it away for Christmas lol, I realized that I really liked it too. So my third (for me) just arrived and I have yet to wash it but I’m super excited to have it for when the season changes to cool. I did wash my sons and dried it on low heat for a bit then let it finish drying by air dry. It did not shrink at all. These shirts have such a nice feel to them. We are cotton lovers and I’m loving this cotton shirt enough to buy three lol. It was on sale, I probably would not have been so quick to get three had I not gotten them all on sale, though it’s still a very good shirt and I would highly recommend, especially if they’re still on sale. I will update as we wear them if there is any issue that I feel a buyer would want to know. After the first wash my sons has retained size and shape very well as well as not lost any of the color, the black is still very black. No pilling or anything like that but it’s still never actually been worn out of the house. Take care and be well, I hope this helps. We are all similar size, 5 ft 8 inches with light build, about 140-150. The small fits great. My son is a bit shorter, 5 ft 4 or 5 and it fits him great with just a bit of room to grow in the sleeves. Men’s small sleeves usually don’t fit me so I’m very happy with this one. Long armed people need shirts too!!!!"
5.0,So cute! I love them and how the turtles are hidden just enough to make my coworkers look at them more.
5.0,"This is my new favorite dress! The fit is perfect, the material gorgeous, soft AND not see through. The color is rich... I seriously can't say enough good things about this dress. I am ordering more for sure!! I bought the navy in large. I'm 5'9 and 150lbs and it fits like it was made for me.💟"
5.0,I love the material is made from stretchy and super comfortable. Its fresh for summer and warmth for cold weather. I love the dress so much that I’m gonna order mother one .

5.0,"This is my second one, as my first one went MIA. I get so many compliments in not only the chesire cat but the color that is displayed. Awesome buy!"
5.0,Lamborghini do I have to say any More??
5.0,"Personally, I love this. I got it as a gift for someone. I think it will be well received :)"
5.0,"My 8 yo son wore a Christmas hat all thru the holidays and needed a ""replacement"". His obsession with all things Among Us ended us with this choice. He likes the hat and wearing it with his blue coat so he ""looks like"" a Blue Among Us character :)"

5.0,"Use it for the car.  It does what it says. It stops the glare. It is worth the money for the price.  It came with a screw driver for keeping the screws tight, also a cleaning cloth and a cloth case.<br />Great value. I was surprised."
5.0,"Luv, luv, luv these peds!  I like the padding on the heels—-not only do they keep the Sox from slipping, but my heels are cushioned by them.  The bamboo fabric is quite soft.  By the end of the day, my feet feel more relaxed, not pinched like other Sox.  They wash easily and so far have not shrunk.  Great product!  Thanks!"
5.0,"Cute!  Lots of compliments, and a tight enough compression that I was looking for.  I'm getting more!"
5.0,"Seems like a good quality and looks adorable. It does have pointy ears and is more Fox line than bear. Yes, the arms would be short for anyone over 5”4"
5.0,"Wigwam socks  always fit well,  wash and dry  and wear well...  Good value for your money....."
5.0,"This is my favorite daily bag, because of itssize and features. I bought an extra to give as a gift."
5.0,It’s durable
5.0,"So far they are holding up well. Easy to put on and take off, but lock up securely"
5.0,"Great product for use at pool side. Look good, fit comfortably, and have clear lenses. Can beat 'em for 10 bucks!"
5.0,Bright and adorable!
5.0,Wanted a large necklace to wear for graduation. This did not disappoint and was bold and beautiful without being overwhelming
5.0,"I can never go wrong with a top from Patty Boutik!  They fit me as though they were especially made for me!  Amazing.  The look, feel and quality is superb!  I have NOTHING negative ever to say about a top by Patty Boutik.  So beautiful, classy and perfect fit!"
5.0,These are super nice with a pair of jeans and dress up they have to colors blue and black I have the blue pair I can never get ahold of the black pair hope come back online soon.
5.0,"While I recommend ordering a size up because the toe box was tight, these shoes are beautiful. I like that the sparkle is built in and not glitter glued on top. No glitter trail. They are also not costume shoes and she says they are very comfortable. We used them her 6th birthday party, Wizard of Oz theme.  They looked great after playing on the playground and at church the next day for Sunday. So glad we sent back and got the bigger size. Completely worth the extra trouble and money."
5.0,Beautiful and soft rabbit fur gloves at an affordable price. Satisfied.
5.0,"A little nervous that the belt wouldn't be as great as the picture, but it is! Great price and a great belt"
5.0,"Light weight, but nice and warm. Love it!"
5.0,Very pretty.  Not shear at all. Great price.
5.0,"Yay my glasses are here , there super cute & everything I expected . Got here super fast :*"
5.0,The pants was great my husband love them i just ordered the to big
5.0,"I just bought these, so I can't speak to their durability technically, but they appear to be made very well and are &#34;stiff&#34; not flimsy cheap earrings. They're so beautiful and I will wear them every day; I'm so in love. I'm going to buy them for my sister too. Instead of piercing your whole ear, this is prefect and covers good space. I LOVE that they dangle. By far the best earrings."
5.0,Light and subtle. Looked great with the red dress I wore
5.0,I really like this product as a gift for Shigeki no kyojin fans. The pendant is sturdy and well coloured.
5.0,I am having a great experience using this product.
5.0,Love these! I needed socks to go with my Tom’s (Deconstructed Alpargatas) and these are perfect. I like that they have more coverage than socks for ballet flats and they never slide off.
5.0,"These sporty little socks with arch compression make walking and other activities easier. They look great, and that extra squeeze around the arch help prevent aching, improving circulation and performance."
5.0,I love it...and will be able to wear it someday... sizing is way smaller than in US sizes...my mistake
5.0,Husband loves his slippers. He usually puts inserts in his slippers and shoes but no need with these.
5.0,My granddaughter loved it. Shrinks in wash so bought a size larger.
5.0,These Pjs are very soft and comfortable. I would order again.
5.0,Easy to install (once I got the old one off) and works great so far. I'll get back to you in six months.
5.0,This is my 4th time buying them!
5.0,"I have gotten SO MANY comments and compliments while wearing this, it has been hysterical!<br />Strangers have asked if it is okay if they can take selfies with me a couple of times!<br />I have shared repartee with doctors, quoting the movie!"
5.0,"Great fit and hold..a life saver for a hat that was too large, thus I was unable to wear even though I love it..no longer!"
5.0,It was perfect n arrived in a timely manner
5.0,my dream thank you !!!!!!!!
5.0,Very thin mouse pad with an adorable picture that nicely serves it's purpose!
5.0,"I gave this review 5 stars because initially I had gotten it for my daughter it wasn’t her fit, I communicated with the seller and they were wonderful in trying to rectified the issue.  Amazing customer service, I ended up keeping earrings for myself.  Love them."
5.0,They like it.
5.0,"This scarf is big, cozy, & soft! I was super impressed with the great quality."
5.0,"Fit was perfect. I ordered a size 7 and I wear a size 7.  I did not have them on too long but I suspect they might not be too comfortable, but I cant say for sure.  Probably depends upon pain tolerance."
5.0,"Excellent design, fits nicely"
5.0,"I blacksmith with a forge and work with forge welding temps so using these in combination with my glasses does the trick. Changes the bright orange glow to a sort of reddish glow, definitely easier on the eyes. Only downside for me is the pair I have are clip on lenses for my prescription glasses and they add a bit of weight, often having to adjust on my head but not a deal breaker. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,It's soft  and just what a yoga blanket should be.
5.0,"This pair of pants looks great. The bow ""belt"" is flexible enough so that you can change the height of how you wear these pants. Also, the pant legs aren't ridiculously long. My wife is 5'3"" and petite. They are just long enough but not too long."
5.0,Great product. Fast Shipping
5.0,This is beautiful on a purse. I attached it to my turquoise Dooney for a pop of color.
5.0,Makes adding or removing keys easier. Light weight metal makes my keys feel lighter in my pocket and the ignition.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! It feels so flattering and is perfect for hot summer days.
5.0,"This is a beautiful wig, very well made and perfectly styled. The bangs are evenly cut, and the curls are very soft and voluminous. I'm using this wig for a burlesque act, and it is just perfect. The color is exactly as you see in the picture. The fit is comfortable, and very flattering to the face. I have definitely found that Franco makes high quality wigs at an inexpensive price. Definitely worth the money!!"
5.0,"just what I needed.  I usually carry a lot of cash around but not many cards.  this wallet is a champ.  I love it and will buy it again if/when this one wears out.  I mean, less than $20?  A bargain.  Right now in my wallet I have: three credit cards in one pocket, and in the other pocket, my ID, my medical insurance card, and two of my business cards.  In the bill pocket I have 11 bills - but it can hold many more.  You can easily cut out the label on the inside, although it's small and wasn't in the way to begin with.  I also like the dark grey color of the wallet and the subtle pattern of the fabric."
5.0,Good quality. It’s very heavy and substantial. Haven’t had it long enough to know if it’ll chip.
5.0,"I am obsessed with this bra.  It was like getting a boob job!! I am a small 34b and got a 36b as everyone said it ran small.  It fit perfectly.  I was looking for a bra with no underwire but that provided cleavage and this was the only one that fit the bill.  It's super comfortable and the straps are pretty invisible under clothes.  It's definitely not a make out with a new guy bra as it's super padded so he may be a bit disappointed when it comes off.  But I literally stood in the mirror trying on tons of clothes as soon as I got this as the cleavage was insane!!  I did work with it on this summer, and it's not great for super hot days as the padding makes it extra warm.  I am still super impressed with this bra and wear it every day."
5.0,"Pricey but a very good hat,looks and fits well.durable"
5.0,"These have saved my fingers so many times. The little plastic dots really keep the heat away, unlike the gloves without them. I tend to touch the barrel of my curling irons and as you can see the plastic does come off onto my curling iron. I don't have a problem with that because otherwise I would be burning my fingers. I have a neck injury and it's hard for me to hold my arms up sometimes when I'm curling my hair. I don't consider this a flaw in the gloves because most people probably won't be touching the barrels of their curling irons like me."
5.0,Absolutely love this top! It’s light weight and flows. Highly recommend
5.0,"Great bracelet! I got it for my 10 year old. If you have a bigger wrist I'm not sure that it would fit. It won't fit on my wrist for sure. There is, as you can see from the other pictures I've included, extra chain left."
5.0,"One of the best parts of this legging style and brand is the colors and styles. They allow someone to express themselves in positive way and also look stylish while doing it. They are colorful and they are fun.<br /><br />They are also comfortable. The leggings are not too tight or too loose. They are easy to get on but they aren't easy to fall down while exercising. They also don't seem to stretch and they also don't seem to get damaged easily. I haven't seen tears, cuts, or scrapes anywhere. I also haven't seen any stitching come loose.<br /><br />These are great."
5.0,My daughter loves this. Good quality.
5.0,Love the red.
5.0,It’s nice just a bit long.
5.0,"my daughter loves this watch, for the scooby doo lover"
5.0,Solid. Good quality & detail. Nice size. Lots of compliments!
5.0,Good quality. Colorful pattern.
5.0,"great product. very warm, comfortable under clothing in cold"
5.0,Great quality and quantity for the price. Thank you.
5.0,I bought these for motorcycle use and so far they're pretty good. I'm 6'4 and think I have rather large hands so I bought the xl. They're a little snug around the knuckle area but the length feels ok. I'm concerned about the durability of these gloves due to the sniggness but so far they feel pretty good.
5.0,"great design and color , I love it"
5.0,Nice silky smooth texture
5.0,"Beautiful color, fits well, looks slimming! I bought 2 shirts for horseback riding and material was light and breathable. I didn't feel like I was going to die of heatstroke, as I live in the desert and summers are brutal. My mother, also a horseback rider, loved my shirts so much, she bought 2 for herself!"
5.0,"So cute!!  I have a feeling the vintage look is def. going to be in this summer :).  I adore this dress, the capped sleeves, bow and flared bottom are absolutely charming.  The square neckline is low enough that you can wear a cute necklace, but not so low that you are showing off to much skin.<br />This is a  must have summer dress :)"
5.0,Awesome!! Best pair of sunglasses I ever had. I have a ton of sunglasses and these by far surpasses them all in fit and the &#34;coolness&#34; factor.
5.0,Great quality and sheepskin is warm and lush<br />Great value.
5.0,Buy them
5.0,Nice hat. A little large but I expected that
5.0,"When I got it, I thought I'd made a mistake buying without dome fastener. It seemed too floppy compared to the one my son has(with dome). But I am, after a week of constant use, really pleased it doesn't have the dome as once in pocket, it's not an issue and is far more comfortable and lower profile sans fastener. The leather is lovely and soft and I like the distressed look that it has. Makes it look like a longtime loved servant, which I think it will become. To keep profile down with notes in it, I put them laid out flat in their sleeve and then fold up wallet, so notes end up trifolded.<br />Promising to be a great product."
5.0,"Bought for my husband who loves the Old Bay seasoning.  He loves them, they are great quality and comfortable."
5.0,"These earrings are just lovely. I have a very short neck, & these are just the right length as they clear my shoulders. They look classy, move beautifully & go perfectly with lavender or darker purples. AND they strands don't stick out all over the place. I've worn them about a dozen times, & they still look perfect!"
5.0,"My 10 year old son is so tall and lanky 5'2"" / 85lbs.  Most jackets/shirts we purchase for him are short in the sleeves and very baggy in the torso.<br /><br />Don't know what it is about this jacket, but the arms and torso are perfect.  Perhaps its a more Chinese-style cut.  If your kid is as tall and lanky as mine, this should be an excellent fit.  We received this for 12 year old instead of 10 year old.  You may want to size up as well."
5.0,These are now my son't favorite shoes!!
5.0,The purse is well constructed with great big zippers that open easily. Better than one I bought for three times the price in the store. Durable- fashionable
5.0,"I was looking for a meaningful gift for a first communion present for a boy.  He got other religious themed gifts, but when he opened this one he said ""COOL!"" The string is slender, like an embroidery thread, and the carving is not super deep, but it was overall much better than expected.  The stone came in a nice box that talked about the Connemara marble.  I added a blessing and some information about the trinity knot to the box.  Very pleased."
5.0,It fits well and is attractive and comfortable. I like it.
5.0,Looks fancy and seems like it'll last.
5.0,"Great costume - this costume was as expected - made out of this meshy/polyester stretchy fabric. The white pads did not breath - so wearing it inside a warm house was a little toasty, but out and about this costume was great. The dog costume was also HILARIOUS and fit my 15 lb yorkie like a charm - the only complaint is that the mini storm trooper needed to be sewed on a little tighter to the green material."
5.0,I like how it looks and the multifunction the watch has.  Highly recommend this watch
5.0,These look awesome! Having larger hips and a smaller waist it's hard to find shorts that fit right but because they are stretchy and high waisted they look and fit amazing! I'm going to buy a second pair. These are short but they still cover your butt. My hips are 38&#34; and I ordered a medium.
5.0,"The band is great quality, sleek & comfortable.<br />Additionally, this company was incredibly helpful & offered some pretty sweet deals for additional bands.<br />Will 100% buy from this vendor again."
5.0,Very subtle carbon fiber look so you can keep the classy look of a black stud while adding a little personality.
5.0,BEAUTIFUL blouse .... flowed when I moved. Got several compliments ... I felt pretty wearing it!! The fit is perfect ... I'm a size 40C and there was enough room up top but not too big either .... it for as expected according to the size chart.
5.0,"I bought these for my Dad to wear to dialysis in MN.  I wish they were longer in length and not so roomy in the rear, but he loves their comfort and warmth.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase!"
5.0,"Product good quality, but send the wrong color."
5.0,my husband wears it every day
5.0,"I got this for my wife after our first child was born.  She isn't into heart-shaped items.  Neither am I, so this was perfect.  It is just the right size and she loves wearing it."
5.0,Excellent for keys and cell phone.
5.0,use it every weekend....
5.0,Hands down I'd buy it again. This dress is so worth it.
5.0,looks sexy on my boyfriend!
5.0,This ring is the real deal!!! I love it. I was skeptical but now I am impressed.perfect fit.
5.0,"I purchased this item for a gift, but from what I saw and felt, it is a high-quality item. I'm sure the recipient will be satisfied."
5.0,Very comfortable! This is a thin hoodie that is pretty flattering and minimizing. Lightweight fabric made this not bulky and the hood is not bothersome like some hoodies can be.
5.0,Very nice spacers. I put one between each of five birthstone dangling beads and the bracelet looks great!  Can't beat this price!
5.0,Minimize!
5.0,"I get complimented on these glasses daily! They're a great quality, especially for the price."
5.0,"This is a very nice sport shirt. Wash and wear well. Breathe well, sweat gets pulled onto the shirt and dry quickly. After a few wash it still looks new.<br /><br />Sizing is accurate. I am a average medium and this fits perfectly.<br /><br />Recommended."
5.0,very comfy. good fit.
5.0,"EYE catching!  It qas super inexpensive, yet so pretty and fun. I love it."
5.0,Comfortable nice looking etc etc gonna order more leggings in future
5.0,"great length (adjustable), goes with everything and isn't too obnoxious and doesnt rattle all day like some other larger silver necklaces with tribal/aztec-like coins on them."
5.0,perfect. i love them and cant wait to wear them in the cold!
5.0,"Took a month to actually get to me, but love the color and fit. Feels great and goes perfectly to any outfit...dressed up or dressed down... with jeans and booties, a dress, or even your PJs. Tends to fall off the shoulders a bit but I dig the bigger size."
5.0,Great style and sturdy
5.0,My husband loves these pants for outside work. They keep him cool and stuff doesn't stick to the fabric...grass when weedwacking and sawdust when sawing wood brushes right off. They do fit a little big around the waist but a belt solves this problem. The length is great.
5.0,Nice fit. Rubs true to size.
5.0,Loved the Vibrant colors
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter, she loves them. They fir perfect."
5.0,Very nice cap. Makes a great gift.
5.0,I just received my bag on today and it's everything I expected! Perfect size fast shipping! I recommend this seller!!!
5.0,"I love 90 degree by Reflex. I am a massage therapist so I'm constantly moving around all day and get very hot. These are perfect. Not too tight, not too loose, not too warm, not too cold. They fit great as well."
5.0,Dread bathing suit season...loved this one and actually felt good about myself wearing it.
5.0,I love these tank tops. I first bought them at Costco then I wanted another set so I found them here. I love them so much.
5.0,"I have ordered a few different Fullmosa bands and have been happy with every one!  They are great quality, comes in excellent, high end packaging, with tool for removing (and installing, if needed) the band AND... the price is unbelievable for the quality!  I find these comparable with bands that cost 3X the price. Lastly, great customer service as well."
5.0,My son loved this beanie! Definitely worth the buy.
5.0,Si los recibí gracias
5.0,"My husband got these as a gift and loved them. They are soft and cushiony. The size gave him some wiggle room as slippers should. If they get wet, be sure to put them out to dry immediately before they get moldy."
5.0,"Bought it for a concert and it was so perfect , lots and lots of compliments on it !"
5.0,This was perfect for our Disney Cruise for pirate night! Comfortable and cute!
5.0,Extremely great quality for an affordable price. Was a birthday gift for our teen and he loves it. True to size
5.0,I bought this set for my toddler who is obsessed with Cocomelon. The quality seems great and it's adorable. She's going to love it on Christmas morning!
5.0,I really like Castelli and these bibs reinforced my confidence in the brand. Very comfortable and great for hot rides.
5.0,Super cute and looks great. Worth it.
5.0,I love this dress!! I wear it over leggings.
5.0,"Fast to ship item. Prayer shawl is beautiful & well made. It has an anointing on it that has blessed our family immensely.<br />When we take communion at home, we put on the Messianic prayer shawl first. When my husband was fighting lung cancer, I would cover him in the prayer shawl nightly. He was in the hospital after surgery to remove a lobe of his lung, & I would cover him at night too. He recovered very quickly & is out splitting wood 2 weeks after surgery with our hydraulic splitter. Praise God!<br />[[ASIN:B0072898TW New Covenant Christian Prayer Shawl tallit (33/73)]]<br />[[ASIN:1599792656 Talitha Cumi: The Secrets of the Prayer Shawl]]"
5.0,"Sure, you can tell it was a football, but damn if it doesn't make a badass centerpiece for a fallout display"
5.0,The material feels good and the wallet holds up nicely.
5.0,"I liked that both my daughters could have their favorite colors on their cameras.  Also the price was low, and I couldn't even find this product in my areas department stores, in any color--they had none."
5.0,Super easy to wash and hang on the line with no ironing needed!  Love the collar and fabric.
5.0,These are very cute and don’t hurt your ears.
5.0,They were colorful and stitched nicely.
5.0,Great wallet that has yet to fail me. It's a truly beautiful bifold wallet that has plenty of space for all of my cards and cash without making it took large for my pocket.
5.0,My son is 23 and a good person and he loved this out of every gift I got him for Christmas the most. Thank u.
5.0,"Very sexy and beautiful elegant! The material is stretchy and form fitting, not itchy at all despite the “glitter ascent”. Wore to my sisters wedding and got a ton of compliments."
5.0,Love these. They work great to have cleaners in each room without having big bulky bottles everywhere. Spray really well too!
5.0,Perfect for my daughter. Very light. Used at the beach and for a hike.
5.0,There strong
5.0,True to size fit.  I wear an 8 pants and ordered a medium.  Perfect!  Ordered another set.  Great bargain.
5.0,I love this sweater so much I'm getting in some of the other colors. Nice quality and feels so soft.
5.0,"These are my first ever pair of compression socks. I love them! Nice and tight and they stay up without any problems. When I get another pair, these will definitely be on my radar!"
5.0,All pieces came intact I bought 9 of them I do not think that I will use them as the jewelry for my bridesmaids but it will be an extra gift in their bag .. The jewelry didn't match what I was looking for but still cute for another formal event
5.0,This is my favorite band!
5.0,The delivery took forever! I love the socks
5.0,I needed these socks due to having foot surgery and needed extra roomy socks for that purpose.  The price was reasonable and The socks held up to my standards. Comfy!
5.0,"I was kindof skeptical but free returns so I gave it a shot, im about 5’2” so normally maxi dresses are too long on me, but it fit perfectly! Looks just like picture and fits well. Definately will be buying more in other designs"
5.0,Fit well. Comfortable. Everything they said it would be.  Great job!
5.0,Like the comfort of the fabric. Easy to get on and off.
5.0,Love this. I wear it as a head band and it barely moves.  It has a soft rubbery lining along the top and it stays where you put it.
5.0,Extremely well made hooded zip-up. It feels comfortable and attractive. I started wearing it right out of the box and I love it. Great price too! Very pleased.
5.0,"Daughter loves them. She is growing out of them quickly, but she loves them."
5.0,"The best band that you can find. Great package, great product. Easy to install. In addition for a very reasonable price, even cheeper for the good quality. I order in red and black. I would like to buy a couple of extra colors.."
5.0,Gift for my granddaughter. She loved them!

5.0,THE FIT AND WORK AND LOOK SEXY
5.0,Great for working out and comfortable enough to lounge around the house in
5.0,"This wand doesn't appear to quite match some of the replica wands from the Harry Potter series in the originality and design department, but it's a well-made hand-carved wand.  I'm considering staining it as I think it might improve the appearance, but it's still nice as it is.  At 15 inches long, it's a little longer than I expected it would be.  This would make a nice prop for a costume and could easily double as an interesting orchestra baton for a conductor.  It comes with a nice carrying bag with a drawstring."
5.0,Comfortable. I definitely recommend these masks & would purchase them again
5.0,"I have a friend whose health isn't stellar right now, so I've bought the hat for him. The infirm should all be made to wear these hats.<br /><br />One note:  The gold piece that holds the red yarn on top comes disconnected to the hat, and it's just a tiny little bolt and washer that hold it to the hat itself. I've assembled it and hope it doesn't come loose during shipping as I don't think my friend is in any shape to contend with that.  I will subtract a couple stars if this happens."
5.0,Perfect snug fit
5.0,My grandson loves this outfit
5.0,These fit like a dream over my regular glasses.  They divert the airflow around my eyes and the shade and coloring offer great view even in low light conditions.  May have to buy my wife a pair as well!
5.0,"Nice. The only thing is it has a strong smell, i might wash it before i use it."
5.0,"Bought this for a Slytherin I knew at the time. Subsequently, I have no review for you. Bet that sorting hat barely sat on his head before he earned the colors on that scarf! It did look very nice at the time I gifted it, though. :) Felt very warm. I'd order a Ravenclaw one."
5.0,"MUCHAS GRACIAS, RECIBÍ Y ME ENCANTO..TODO BIEN .DESDE VENEZUELA.MARACAIBO<br />MUCHAS GRACIAS, RECIBÍ Y ME ENCANTO..TODO BIEN .DESDE VENEZUELA.MARACAIBO<br />MUCHAS GRACIAS, RECIBÍ Y ME ENCANTO..TODO BIEN .DESDE VENEZUELA.MARACAIBO"
5.0,I love the look of this bracelet! it can adjust to my wrist and it is very comfortable!
5.0,"Love these capris! I gave up Lululemon years ago because of their diminishing and unreliable quality but I still have my first pair of capris from them when they were higher quality with these side pockets and they are my favorite running/walking capris. But I think these just replaced them. So thrilled they are so inexpensive but also well made. Only wore them once so far on a 5 mile walk this morning but they are comfortable, material is not too tight, thin or thick. Will update if I find any issues but I will be wearing these to work out in as well as run errands, etc..  Every body is different but I would not hesitate to try these, I think you will be happy you did. And I noticed that they make it super easy to return as well, with a reusable bag. I won’t be using it though :)"
5.0,Very light weight. Doesn’t feel like you are wearing earrings
5.0,"It's very comfortable, light weight, and my favorite color. I just love the quality!"

5.0,Great sturdy wallet exactly what I wanted
5.0,"I usually always wear size L, this is extra tight! Go a size up! I have to return it to get an XL!"
5.0,"After receiving it I realized it wasn’t a toy, I had to take it apart to unclog it but it worked great"
5.0,Super cute. Looks just like the pics. Is a little short though. I’m 5’4 112lbs.
5.0,Got this for my niece and she seems to really like it
5.0,"I am 5'4"" 185 ish lbs. Size DDD cup (in Victorias secret bras) and ordered an extra large. It fits perfect and I love it and I'm not even a dress person."

5.0,"BEAUTIFUL ACCESSORY FOR MY WHITE SHIRTS, IT BRINGS OUT THE CLASSINESS OF A WHITE BOYFRIEND SHIRT."
5.0,"I bought the black cherry blossom. The color of flowers are much more orange than the rose or pink I expected and not my personal preference, so either the picture isn't accurate or my laptop screen isn't? The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I have had many silk robes and pajamas over the years, including some I bought while in San Fransisco in Chinatown. This is excellent quality. If you aren't used to silk robes, expect &quot;most&quot; are very thin, no pockets, and can not be machine washed. Silk robes are slippery. Very slippery. Unless you tie it on tight knotted, it will likely be slipping and you will be needing to re-tie it often. I like to wear mine open over my pajamas, as I don't love a super tight tie around my waist anyway.<br />This robe is a thicker fabric then I expected in a good way. I know this is pricey for some, but for a silk robe, I doubt you will find many of this type less than the price here. This was as good as mine from Chinatown, with thicker material! I am 5'5&quot;. and large busted. It fits me well. If anything it's more roomy then I need, but I expected that for a one size fits all. The length is perfect. Now, here is my concern if you will. I doubt all these colors of robes are the same quality or even sized robes. That might explain the negative reviews? I love it enough that I am going to order another color and I will update."
5.0,"It’s been a belt, opened beers, secured a boat to a dock and has been a dog leash."
5.0,Love these glasses! Such great quality for an affordable cost!
5.0,"I have recently put on weigh so I was worried that even the XXL would not fit, but it did.  My husband loved them and thought I looked very sexy!"
5.0,"I used bobby pins after tying the fabric to pin the bow high up on my head to keep the mask at a level that worked for my face. Very authentic, has some weight to it."
5.0,"Super soft material. Fist as expected. I’m 5’0, 116 lbs, about a size 5in jeans and ordered a small. Very comfy. I’m going to order more in other colors."
5.0,Love the fit! Looks great & feels very nice!
5.0,Liked the thin style; just what I was looking for
5.0,I’m 5’6 tall and long pants weren’t to short :) the material is stretchy and comfortable. This is my third pair cute to dress up and down and I love that they are high waist.
5.0,My husband loves it! Durable and manly.
5.0,Nice shirt but a bit snug on my XL body.
5.0,"Some may choose to wear tiaras, I chose to wear a veil 💁🏾‍♀️ Amazing product and price"
5.0,Good Value and Very Comfy.  The large shoe string tie is a good look.  I am 6' tall and the medium is long enough which is not typical for me.  They don't bunch at the bottom but they are the right length.<br />I would buy these again.
5.0,Loved the dress..I had to get it hemmed..Wore it on my 22nd Anniversary in Jamaica
5.0,"A sleek, elegant lapel pin of the iconic F-18 aircraft with a very good price/value point."
5.0,So dainty and beautiful. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,Very soft comfortable and well fitting PJs and lounging set. Love them!!!!
5.0,Night shirt. easy washable
5.0,Like all the different colors and the way they fit.
5.0,Loved the colors and it fit well besides in the busy area it was a bit tight. I got many complaints though
5.0,"Nice coat, fits well, seems to be quality. Will update my review after I wear it for a month or so. Currently, temps in east coast do not warrant a warm coat. Otherwise, I'm happy with the way it looks and feels."
5.0,This is so cute and pretty. Worn a lot and still in great shape
5.0,This provided a beautiful base for a prom wristlet. Lasted for 2 proms!
5.0,It looks great and fits nice.  I will be taken this to the Philippines in two weeks and will be using it a lot.  I like it!!
5.0,Dress was perfect to attend my friends wedding. Classy but not too over the top
5.0,"This mask is adorable. The colors are vibrant, it's very well made, and it comes with filters to place inside as well. Sent as part of a Xmas gift to my Scottie owning friend and she absolutely loved it!"
5.0,"This is an adorable kimono for my 1 year old granddaughter.  We have kimono Monday’s and she loves when I pull it out and put it on.  The small is still too big but we roll up the sleeves and she is happy.  I don’t use the belt, just because.  But she is happy wearing it."
5.0,It is so beautiful and looks to be quite sturdy. Hoping my mom will love this gift. It is good size for an overnight bag or carry on for a plane.
5.0,I love this and have had a lot of positive comments on it when I pull it out at stores.  It is too large to work in the smaller purses that I use when I go out but I don't really need it in those cases.
5.0,Love it. Just as I hoped and arrived early.
5.0,The certain part of the top was a complete different color than the body of the top
5.0,"This is the 4th skirt I have ordered from this company.  Very vibrant colors and nice material.  I am 5'7, 155 pounds and ordered the XL.  Fit perfect"
5.0,"By the time I ordered these tabs, I no longer needed them (I shrank).  However, they're almost a perfect match to those on the kilt, so they'll be great replacements when the originals get worn.<br /><br />Well made of leather and heavy duty all around.  If your kilt somehow shrank in the wash (lol), then these will save you.  Simple fix that really works."
5.0,Beautiful and delicate.  If you have a large neck the necklace will be lost on you.
5.0,Glad I ordered them!
5.0,Love how it fits 😍
5.0,Very light weight but strong.
5.0,I love these boys dress shoes and have bought them a few times as my boys have grown. The quality is great and are a great value. Will miss these Payless shoes.
5.0,Can’t wait for the party
5.0,It ran smaller than I thought but I still love it
5.0,Love it very stretchy fabric
5.0,I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the scarf. It is the perfect length and the texture is really nice. No one would believe the purchase was less than three dollars - including shipping. I plan to wear it tomorrow.
5.0,This far exceeded my expectations. I got it in Rose Gold and love it. Can't beat the price for this piece of bling!
5.0,This is so great! It was very inexpensive and super cute! Hope it comes back in stock
5.0,I got this for my son. It has bows on the back pockets but I can easily take those off. I think these are really cute.
5.0,Great for travel! Very comfortable.
5.0,I love these earring they are so colorful.
5.0,I Hope set arrived before Christmas. My complete order......
5.0,"I have a thing about watches, I mean really, how many does a girl need? :) I couldn't resist this one as I was looking for a semi large one that was square and of course had a little bling, the Fossil name sold it for me..My watches get banged up alot in the course of my work and the Fossil brand really stands up to it, if I lose a rhinestone or need a repair they do it super fast, easy and inexpensively.."
5.0,Nice wallet just bigger than I was thinking it would be.
5.0,I never ever write reviews...but this dress demands it.  I bought black and olive.  I was hesitate to buy both being I'm the size girl that needs to try clothes on.  I bought an XL.  I carry my weight in my stomach so I was concerned.  This dress is PERFECT.  Flows in the right places and snug in the right spots.  I work in court and put it with heels and a cardigan and it looks great!
5.0,"I love the material, it doesn’t feel cheap at all. I wear this to the gym and it’s super cute."
5.0,Looks great with the perfect outfit! #satisfied
5.0,Unique.  Adds to any outfit.
5.0,Awesome leggings. Injust love them ! They are smooth and fit perfectly! I love that they are tight and stretchy and they are true to size.
5.0,"I purchased this dress to wear at the temple.  I love how pretty and modest it is, as well as how well it fits.  So many dresses are made of flimsy fabric, but this one is made of a sturdy but flowing knit with a lightly flocked inner side that feels very nice against the skin.  Definitely, I will be getting more of these dresses in the future, in other colors."
5.0,GREAT! Very supportive!
5.0,Love the colors flowing
5.0,"This Pop Fashion Silver Dog Pendant Necklace with Silver Chain and Hanging Charm Pendant is adorable.  Of course I have a Westie so I really like the charm.  It is not real silver but it has 925 markings on it so it might be plated.  The chain is sturdy and has a lobster clasp.<br /><br />The necklace arrived in a jewelry box and could be a good gift.  Overall, I am very pleased with it and will keep it for myself.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount or free for the purposes of evaluation in exchange for my unbiased review. This does not influence my judgment of this product, nor does it affect my review in any way. I personally value customer reviews when making buying decisions. My reviews are to help others make informed decisions about their purchases and to provide ideas about how a product may be used."
5.0,"I bought this by accident and returned it, but it was really cute."
5.0,Love color<br />Lots of compliments
5.0,This is a nice shirt. Color is true to picture and size is as expected.
5.0,"Amazing dress, .  I got the 3XL, i am 220# and 5'8&#34; tall (us size 16 - 18). I wear a 38 B-C.  It is perfect for date night and hides what it can and shows a little of what it should for a date night."
5.0,beautiful earrings and I LOVE them...
5.0,Love this hat! I receive tons of compliments when I'm wearing it. I have a pretty average sized head and it fits perfectly.
5.0,Nice pants but are made in CHINA.
5.0,My daughter was beautiful in this
5.0,i've been wanting a keychain like this and before my father died he gave me the money to order it. I was very happy. Thank you very much for making this purchaser happy.
5.0,"By far the best bag I've ever had. My only complaints (and not worth taking a star off) are that the bag is pretty heavy, and it just barely fits my 15&#34; Macbook Pro."
5.0,"ITS BEAUTIFUL, I said it fits somewhat small bc everyone else said that so I bought a size up and it fits perfect. So as long as you get a size up (instead of medium i got large) you will be satisfied! (well I was) Its cute and looks good on."
5.0,"He loves the two I bought. The colors and designs are so unusual, and the colors are vibrant and vivid! Just what I was looking for!"
5.0,Love it. Its fits comfortable on my head while sleeping with out its coming off. Its doesn't leave any mark on forehead after removing it. I love it so much that I ordered a second. Just for our door to pretect my locks from debris. Will definitely recommend.
5.0,I like it because it fits perfectly and the sleeves never lose the firmness and get droopy
5.0,"I have never worn a visor... but I was doing a competitive walk race and knew it was going to pour that day.... and I needed a way to keep the rain off my glasses during the race.  I purchased this visor, put it on for the race, and I was good to go!  It never felt uncomfortable, even though I walked a half-marathon in the rain -- at times a downpour!  It kept the rain off my glasses and I was thrilled!"
5.0,It’s great quality but made in China of course. Can’t we make veteran stuff here? Goodness gracious.
5.0,"Great socks! Fits great, keeps my feet dry, and no odor!!"
5.0,very good durable umbrella.very happy to own
5.0,I love the hunter green color! I’m 5ft 2in and the length was just right. It fit perfectly and the material was breathable.
5.0,"This suit is awesome! Price is fair, well made, color is even brighter in person. Fits just as I wanted.  Very flattering and I feel contained in it. I ordered a medium."
5.0,I love the tie and hope my husband does too. I am giving it to him this weekend for his birthday.
5.0,"I love smiley socks fits perfectly very nice durable comfortable material, will buy it again since my LO now is two!"
5.0,"I have purchased from this Amazon Seller previously and was not disappointed.  Once again, this Seller has come through by providing a top shelf, very nice quality piece of Jewelry.  This one was a Birthday gift for my wife who was delighted with the product.  The brightness of the Stones, their settings in metal, and overall quality to detail are top shelf.  Do not be afraid to purchase from this seller or this particular product, you will be pleased.  The only request, that this item should be sold with, and placed in a suitable, small flip top type jewelry box vs. a cellophane baggie packaging."
5.0,I had a custom made cowboy hat and this band sets it off
5.0,Great deal for price
5.0,I love these shirts. I’ve worn one everyday to the gym since I received them. The hood is pretty big but not too bad. Doesn’t shrink after washing and drying. Tie a knot in the strings before washing or they might come out in the wash. I’m 5’9” and 180 lbs…large fit perfect.
5.0,This watch is Beautiful it made my Christmas for real.......&#34;..........now I have to figure it out
5.0,"These are priced great for two tie chains. They're not quality material, but my husband manages to lose them often, so they're never around long enough to show wear. He prefers tie chains over poking holes into his ties with tie pins."
5.0,Excellent Quality and Effectiveness 👍
5.0,I have used these for years and I cannot believe how well they fit and how durable they are.
5.0,"I love everything about this skirt. The value, the fit, the comfortability and it isn't too short or too long! Get this skirt! I am 5'5"", 195-200 lbs and got the XL."
5.0,"True to size. Love the fit. Perfect length, just above the knee. But I'm short at 5'. Would buy again & will recommend to others."
5.0,"Great value for the price, much longer than pictured they hit the ground instead of being above the ankle I have to get them hemmed. Other than that good price and fit"
5.0,"I got these for a trip to NYC. Normally we travel with duffel bags, but this trip required multiple flights & a train ride so I wanted something with wheels. We ended up taking only the big one & the small one. They are so roomy, I kept thinking I must be forgetting something because there was still room in the suitcase. I packed changes for two of us for two days + hygiene bag & odds & ends, an extra pair of shoes each, & there was plenty of space. I recommend getting a set of packing cubes. They made it so easy, & easier to manage the laundromat as well. But don't put your ipad or laptop in the pocket until after you go through security. I had to unlock it in the line to get it out. On the way out I put a paperback book in there. That got my bag hand searched because the X-Ray can't see through paper. On the way back, I remembered to put the book in my purse, but the pocket was the perfect size for my Yankees program & I forgot to move it so they hand searched my bag again. The packing cubes made that easier, also. The cases held up beautifully. I recommend getting a hand held scale. I actually went over weight, with room to spare."
5.0,The product was wrapped beautifully and it ran try to size Thank you it made a great gift !
5.0,"Way too small, it was return.<br />Really beautiful, but it runs too small"
5.0,Love them! Great Boho look to add to any outfit.
5.0,I was a little skeptical about buying a cleaner for my wedding rings but I do have to say this was a good purchase. My rings came out way cleaner than before and overall look brand new. It's easy to use and makes your jewelry sparkle. If you don't know whether to buy it or not... take the leap and purchase it.
5.0,"Transition from back pocket carry to front seems to have helped reduce a bit of hip and tail discomfort.<br />Seems to be well made and no issues after months of use.<br />Also, forces you to eliminate carrying things in the wallet that you truly never needed anyways.<br />Just takes a bit of break-in to get used to how to retrieve which card or item you want/need."
5.0,"Nice belt, holds well.  Worth it for the money."
5.0,Exactly as displayed. Love the threaders.
5.0,Friend loved it as a Christmas gift. Any true office fan would appreciate this bag.
5.0,Love them mostly the print.
5.0,Very nice chain for the money.  A little more substantial than the diamond cut type of chain of this weight.
5.0,"I love these slippers.....only thing is I asked for size 6 - 7<br />I was sent 71/2 - 8<br />They say they are med.  I'm not sure about the sizing?  My first pair came that size too...at that time I just thought it was a mistake.  I loved them so much,I kept them.  I have 3 pairs now."
5.0,Comfortable & gets the job done.<br /><br />My only gripe is how the leather strip on the underside is at risk of peeling if you change bands often.
5.0,So cute my niece was so happy with it
5.0,"The hat arrived quickly, well packaged and is just super cute and very nice quality!  Ran a little large but I have a small head and have lost my hair to chemo so I bought some foam inserts for a better fit and hopefully that will do the trick as I love the hate.  I will purchase more from the vendor for sure to get me thru my chemo &#34;hairless&#34; days."
5.0,Great deal. Nice quality. Very cute. Many people have commented on the slippery sole. I did find them to be somewhat slippery on carpet. But I’ve been wearing these and have had no problem. The cost to have them re soled is about $50. I probably will eventually do this because the boots are so mice
5.0,"Boots are excellent,  perfect for the ranch."
5.0,Great product. Looks and feels premium. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,"Very cute, you can wear it daily. Loved it and it’s stamp s925. Nice necklace, I probably order more for gifts to my friends"
5.0,"Fit , don’t slide off your heal"
5.0,I’ve owned this body suit now for two years and I still get great complements every time I wear it out. I usually wear a fancy black lace bra underneath (which I also purchased through Amazon). The bra worn with this is soo sexy yet classy as well.<br />I’m 5’9 160 lbs and ordered a size XXL<br />I’m so happy with this bodysuit!!
5.0,Super cute. I wore as a bathing suit cover up!!! Loved it. Soft comfortable material
5.0,"I swear they just disappear after two minutes, it feels like you’re not wearing anything but are somehow supported. The fabric is so comfortable and feels a little cool to the touch which is awesome for the summer. The front is a little least generous than some others, but not so much that it squishes your...uh...stuff. The sides are probably an inch top to bottom which is nice for those looking for more minimal coverage.  Would buy again."
5.0,"I wanted extra big, I ordered extra big, I got extra big! It's like wearing a big ol' blanket! I Love it!"
5.0,I got this for my daughter and she really loves it.
5.0,Elegant bag yet very functional. Good buy!
5.0,"LOVE this.  Very flattering fit, comfortable, lightweight, great for casual workwear with leggings.  Fabric wrinkles easily but also seams to un-wrinkle surprisingly well."
5.0,"I ordered this AOOKSMERY Women's Casual Floral Print Maxi Dress V Neck Long Sleeve Loose T Shirt Dresses with Pockets for my wife.  When she put it on it got a ""wow, that looks nice on you""  It flatters her figure really well.  I was slightly worried it would be too long on her 5'7"" frame, but it is the perfect length.  It just skims the top of her shoes.<br /><br />It is made from a soft cotton feel tshirt material.  It is constructed well, with nicely sewn seams.  The pattern is a gorgeous, vivid floral.  It is lightweight, again it is a t-shirt style maxi dress, so it is thin.  The v neck maybe shows a little too much cleavage for some, but it's not overly showy.  The pockets are perfectly placed and rare on maxi dresses, so that is a bonus.<br /><br />Overall, my wife loves this dress. It works great for the office, yet is soft and comfy. It moves and stretches. I think my wife will be ordering the same style with alternative patterns.  She also travels extensively and this dress will pack well and be wearable right of the suitcase."
5.0,The watch has worked great so far and the numbers are easy to read. I really like the sleep mode where it powers down the warm at late hours but turns back on with watch movement or any button being pressed. I recommend this watch due to its low maintenance (solar charging and atomic time adjustments)
5.0,I bought these for my wife she loves them this is her 2nd pair!
5.0,This shoe is both stylish and comfortable.
5.0,I am quite impressed by the quality.  I did take it too a watch she to have the band adjusted as I am too lazy to try it myself.  Comfortable and adds character to my Apple Watch
5.0,I am a nurse and these socks are perfect for nurses on their feet all day.
5.0,"I use this for strength training, pilates, and yoga.  No gaping neckline!"
5.0,This dress is great! It has a casual sundress fit but the print makes it look Fancy.
5.0,"I love the way these are made, plus they look really nice.  They do not pitch your ears and since I have numbness in my fingertips. these are ideal and they don't pinch."
5.0,The tie clips are great. They come in a great gift box and all are individually wrapped in a poly bag to prevent scratching. Perfect for my needs!
5.0,Nice bracelet. Very simple design and looks great with almost everything.
5.0,This shirt is so cute! Very good material and stretchy.  I ordered my size and it fit perfectly! Size medium. Its a really cute midriff that you can wear to bed or with a cute pair of jeans.
5.0,Fair va
5.0,They are the perfect size.  Love the 3 colors.  Perfect for a bit of fun with every outfit
5.0,Very pretty bracelets and they shipped fast!!

5.0,"Very dainty. Looks like was made well, hope real sterling.<br />Good price, just as pictured"
5.0,"Great looking items, hoping to do more business"
5.0,I bought size L. I am 5’1 and 160lbs. It fit perfectly. Very comfortable and went well with my jeans and my leggings. The texture of the cloth is soft which I liked.
5.0,"Loved it,  I bought the mickey head and feared most of all that the magnets wouldn't hold and am pleased to find they are perfect. I received one charm incorrectly. It was still beautiful so I decided to keep it, my advice is just try to be as descriptive as posible. There was a courtesy call that I received and was truly impressed by their customer service."
5.0,"Just what I pictured, looks just like what was shown when I ordered it.  Will order more for nieces and nephews when they turn 16!"
5.0,This ring is precious!
5.0,This hat set is warm and I love the color. My eldest son thinks this is one of the best hat sets.
5.0,Perfect gift for a lady trumpet player
5.0,"Currently using it as a wall decoration, but I can still use it as a mask.  Very well made"
5.0,The dress came and fit great. The fabric is soft and comfortable. Ordered 2 more dresses today!
5.0,Great shirt! Looks better in person than  on line.
5.0,Simple and slim. Easy to get cards in and out of. Great product.
5.0,perfect size for my 5 yo.
5.0,"Good quality, perfect fit, light weight and comfortable. Happy customer!"
5.0,I loved this dress it fit perfect for my daughter she loved it also great color And just was about the best thing I have order off Amazon that hasn’t been a head ache cause of the item not being what I thought !! But this was perfect !! Loved it !! Will be ordering again soon ! Thank you
5.0,Good quality and my bf loved his
5.0,"I absolutely loved this dress. Fits so well and it is stretchy material so you can move in it. It is beautiful as well. I would definitely wear it for a date, pictures, or a fancy occasion."
5.0,Very cute robe!!! Nice design and the fabric is nice. Lightweight. Make sure to check the size chart!
5.0,"All of them were in the package, and they are wonderful! Wanting to buy more!"
5.0,Swimsuit fits true to size. Very flattering.
5.0,"Ordered this on April 6th, received it today. Decent shipping time from China. Looks just like the picture, very sexy look. I'm 5'8, 149 lbs. I got a Med to make sure it snaps around my butt without being too snug. Fits perfect!"
5.0,"Right off the top, I have to saw that the photo of this shirt is off on the color. The photo makes the shirt look like it is a deep chocolate ice-cream color, whereas in actuality it is more of a brown with a grey tone. That's not to say it isn't gorgeous, because it is, but it's not that rich, deep chocolate color you see in the photo.<br /><br />Like all the nailshead Cutter & Buck shirts, this one is assembled of first-rate materials, stitched just right, and should have a long use to it if it isn't abused. The material is thick and somewhat stiff, smoothing out after multiple washings. It iron's up exceptionally well and works great with or without a tie.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but when you pick it up, you all of a sudden realize why it is more expensive than the many shirts you more commonly see. There is not only a superior fabric used but an attention to detail that is clear upon inspection. Size runs true, too, so order in the size you normally use and you should be fine. Five stars."
5.0,perfect for the evening out.
5.0,Nice shirt. My son loves it. A true Warriors fan.
5.0,I typically wear a 16 or 18 (XL or 1X) depending on the store and style of the shirt. I'm short and a 42DDD and this fit perfectly.  I ordered the XL.
5.0,Skirt fits perfectly!! This piece has become one of my favorites!!
5.0,"So cute and feminine! I bought a small (normally wear small.....121 pounds, 34 C, 5'3"") ..... I wish this came in more colors because I would buy so many more!"
5.0,I love the look and feel of this! Has a lot of card slots and also great for taking out my ID!
5.0,Great cover up!<br />Hides everything 🙄
5.0,Got this key chain for my 6 year old to put on his among us lunchbox. He loves it!
5.0,"I just can't find thin&breathable natural socks like these in the conventional retail markets. They wear well, are durable enough, yet breathable, without those cushioned soles that make you sweat."
5.0,This wrap is lovely! It truly can dress up jeans or be worn with an after five ensemble. Perfect!
5.0,I was unsure initially about purchasing this bracelet.  It seemed smaller than what I was looking for. However it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Bigger than pictured and beautiful details. Very happy I got it.
5.0,Good quality. Improved my Seiko watch appearance.
5.0,This dress fits to size and looks like picture.
5.0,"This is an awesomely made costume.  Looks super authentic.  The material does NOT stretch too much.  I'm fairly petite and a Small was TIGHT but still wearable.  It just feels a bit restricting; not much wiggle room since the material doesn't stretch much.  The area around the feet is a bit ""baggy"" but the rest fits just right."
5.0,I ordered a 2XL and I am a size 14 normally with about a 40 bust and 44 hips and 36 waist.  It fits me nicely.
5.0,This is an exceptional bag.. Soft light with many pockets.. I ordered as a travel bag because the Olivia and Joy bag with the two Zippered pouches in the front was out of stock in black. This bag is marketed for baby but will also make a great travel bag.. The extra handles will attach to a cart or shopping rolling bag.. I will have this bag for many years and will purchase more Olivia and Joy items.. I just wish they would make the insides a different color from the outside..
5.0,"This is a quality key-chain, looks great and will last!  Nice gift item too. You can't go wrong with this key- chain."
5.0,Received as promised. Good quality.
5.0,My friend couldn't be happier - it was a gift!
5.0,"These are great! Comfortable, adjustable and cute!"
5.0,I already had this item from 3 years ago & have been looking to purchase it again. The pants wear well &<br /> I absolutely adore the color.
5.0,Nice and covers well.
5.0,"These work great at night, especially when it's raining. They even help in the rain in the daytime! Great purchase!"
5.0,It's awesome!!! :) and cheap
5.0,Beautiful. I get lots of compliments!
5.0,Love these earrings! Love the brand name too!
5.0,"I have been looking for years for a reliable non- allergenic watch. I have tried plastic, wood , stainless steel.All have failed. Stainless did not prevent rashes. Wood watches have Japanese movements that are unreliable Victorinox Inox titanium is the watch I have been looking for.No allergic reaction. Great look.Light weight but stong case and crystal. Total Swiss reliability in construction and spot on accuracy to the second ."
5.0,These are great! Loved the colors. Fit perfect. Great quality!
5.0,I love these fishnet stockings! The assortment of styles are great and I have paired them with many outfits. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,Lightweight bands in brilliant colors.
5.0,Bought it to go on a monthly bracelet I get.  This was for the mothers day bracelet and it was perfect
5.0,Very nice.<br />Just as described .
5.0,Used polishing cloth immediately.  I am now wearing a silver pendant that I almost forgot I had.  Shines now as when I first got it and was very easily accomplished.  Will be exploring my jewelry box for more treasures I have not worn because they were tarnished.
5.0,worked as discribed
5.0,"Very cute, wish it was a little bigger and thicker.."
5.0,It came in a cute box and looks very cute!!!! I just got it today. I havent wore it yet but ill resubmit a review to let you know how long it will last
5.0,"SHIRTS FIT IS GOOD , FEELS NICE ON BODY."
5.0,Runs small. Loved the dress andcolor!
5.0,I was very happy with my bag. just what I was looking for. I recomment this item. I would order from them again.
5.0,I really like the colors and the neck tie.  The dress covers my trouble areas (tummy) and I feel comfortable in it too which is a huge bonus.
5.0,"I like the extra padding in the heel & toe. At first i was disappointed in the thickness as I was looking for winter socks, but they did a very good job at keeping my feet warm."
5.0,A hit with granddaughter.  What else can I say.
5.0,"Not much to review, they are correctly fitting underwear, they arrived fast when shipped."
5.0,"More beautiful than it looks in the picture, this multi-colored bead necklace goes with all my summer outfits.  The two toggles allow different lengths.You can twist the strands or not, this necklace can look quite different depending on how you wish to wear it.  By twisting it and threading the end through the strands, then using the inner toggle, I was able to turn it into a choker that would completely hide a thyroid surgical scar. Using the outer toggle, it rests nicely on the collarbone.  The beads and the waxed cord, and the toggle and loop closure, are all smooth and comfortable.<br /><br />That's the practical side.  It also feels handmade, craftswomen touched, and is a pleasure to handle."
5.0,"I Love these sunglasses. I bought the red ones and absolutely love the design of them. They fit me perfectly. The lenses are shaped perfectly.<br /><br />They do not rub against my face or my ears. They sit comfortable and the part that goes over your ears, has rubber on it so it'll &#34;stick&#34; to your ears but not rub against them.<br /><br />I don't have anything negative to say about these sunglasses.<br /><br />The tint is also fairly dark as well.<br /><br />I liked these so much I bought a second pair for use in another vehicle so I don't have to keep switching them around.<br /><br />Highly recommend these stylish sunglasses"
5.0,I am really enjoying this crossbody purse. The space inside the bag is great because I can basically fit a lot of things without it looking too bulky. It feels comfortable too and it’s very cute!

5.0,Excellent size handbag and looks stylish.<br />Rest In Peace Kate!
5.0,"Love the fit, no pictures but  I am 5'3"" with a 40D chest, purchased the xl.  It does go all the way to the floor but a nice wedge 3"", makes it perfect.  The fabric is comfortable and not see through, easy to wash, but do not put in the dryer per the instructions, hang to dry.  I received a lot of compliments at work.  I plan to purchase a few more."

5.0,great for my son...he brought back everything back home
5.0,"Fabric is great for summer, right size phone pocket, I am 50, 5'4 tall 150pounds and bought size  large and  is just perfect , a little tip for manufacrurer is the elastic for high waist area should be thicker. Looks great with sandals or gym shoes or heels for evening wear...."
5.0,"Awesome costumer service.. I received my product but it had a few holes in it, I send in a email and they replied right away. They are sending out a new pair.  The item I already have is a great material, very soft feeling and stretchy..  I tried them on and they fit great, very comfortable and form fitting, not too tight and just over all looks great..

5.0,"I bought two of theses eyeglass cases and I am very pleased with my purchase. The cases a very hard, close tightly, and will protect your expensive spectacles. The bonus cleaning cloth works great. The only downside is that they do not fit in your shirt pocket which is not an issue for me. I would recommend this product to family, friend, or foe."

5.0,Best boot socks ever! Wear great and that's why i bought them again and have spread the news to all my boot lover friends!
5.0,"i have used these for every child I have raised, they really do the trick."
5.0,"If your child is tall, pay attention to the size comparison,  based on height. My granddaughter is a tall girl and the child large fits her."

5.0,sick designs!

Quality looks about the same as before (which is to say pretty good), and they still seem to stay put well. This looks like my new go-to!"
5.0,"3 different sunglasses for that price is awesome.  I still wear them all the time,  surprisingly very good quality."

5.0,Absolutely adorable!  I love them.

5.0,"Light weight, works very well to keep my EDC grip from chafing my side without adding heat here in FL.<br />I'm 5'8"" 210 lbs.  I got the large. Im not sure how much ""compression"" is going on, but it is form fitting but<br />stretchy enough to pull off even if a bit damp. I would buy again."
5.0,Perfect size for passports and all the essentials. It has a lot of pockets for a small bag. Can't wait to use it on my cruise this fall!
5.0,"Feels and looks like real stone, not sure whether it is or not, though. For the price, I assumed not. I use these and coordinate them to my outfits, they're seriously put together, don't break, look nice. They're part of my daily outfits."

5.0,I love this outfit it arrived and is as pictured and for the price is better than what I expected.

I am 5'7&#34;, 195lbs with a 38B bust and I ordered a size 12/14. The only thing I didn't care for was that the skirt can wrinkle fairly easily if it isn't give enough space in my closet. The lace trim along the bottom of the skirt is stiff enough that I have not had any problems with is folding over."
5.0,"Super soft and very cute.I'm 5""8 about 175lbs n the XL fits great."
5.0,Arrived on time and the for was perfect! Fabric is also soft and comfortable.

5.0,I really like this earrings. They are so cute and stylish.

5.0,"Very good quality, same as the original.  Arrived quickly and ahead of time"
5.0,These are really very pretty earrings and seem to be quality made. I wore mine on our dress up evening while on a cruise. I would definately recommend them.
5.0,Completed the costume perfectly
5.0,Fit nice look good
5.0,Purple is thinner than the rest but very cute
5.0,Absolutely wonderful! Make sure to keep them under a light for them to glow better. But they’re so cute.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for...I have 3 holes in each ear and these are the perfect size. Very difficult to close on my cartilage piercing, but they are super secure once closed. Love them!"
5.0,"Love the material, I got medium. my waist is 28&#34; hips 39&#34; but since its stretch, I had to buy another in small. They both fit fine. since I wanted a fitted look, the small fits better."
5.0,This band is adorable! I love it! It’s beautiful and very comfortable. Worth every penny. I get compliments on it all the time. You won’t be disappointed!
5.0,Such a cute and more discreet way to keep my passport while traveling!
5.0,"For a person dislike this cold weather and still hope to continue my jogging, this vest is my saver ! It's very warm and light, easy to charge, perfect for outdoor event !"
5.0,They were perfect for the count down to Christmas calendars.  The girls 5 and 8 loved them.  The product was perfect and only a few three or fours. Mostly two of a kind in my bag which was perfect.
5.0,Nice coach keychain. Arrived promptly.
5.0,"Great Product, warm, soft, and big enough to fit!"
5.0,"Small, elegant, classy purse. I saw it at Bloomingdale's, but even with all of the discounts they had it was more expensive than online with this seller."
5.0,Ever since I put it in my nose I haven't taken it out and I love it. The only issue I have is you can see where it ends sometimes but other than that it's perfect
5.0,I love the deep v-neck.
5.0,"Thanks, beautifull"
5.0,"5’1”, 145 lbs, 38B, 32” waist. All the other reviews at the time said, “it’s tiny!” So I double-sized up to an XL. That was the wrong decision. I would call this more “juniors” sizing, so my normal “American medium” would be a “large.” Nevertheless, even as a ridiculous XL, it’s really beautiful and flowy,  the apricot is a nice color, and the price point is good. Recommend."
5.0,Quick delivery<br />Love it<br />Large and tough<br />No color fade or snags as yet<br />Very well made
5.0,Just want I expected!
5.0,Catches on fabric
5.0,I wore this today and it's suuuuper comfy. I received so many compliments. It fit a little big but nothing to drastic. I would recommend.
5.0,Great size! Highly functional!
5.0,It really holds up well. I wear mind every day and I'm hard on watches. The face of my Fitbit looks worn but this ban looks as good as it did when I took it out the box months ago.
5.0,Small is usually my size but these run small. Next purchase might go with large.
5.0,Liked everything and it’s sneakers for my feet
5.0,"I love this sweater! I wear a size 12/Large and so ordered the L. I'm really happy with the fit. I'm 5'8&#34; and the length of this just covers my backside so I'll be able to wear it with leggings and boots if I want to. The lacing in the front adds a nice style detail to the sweater, but it's not so low cut that you would have to wear something layered under it if you didn't want to. The lacing accents on the sleeves is a nice touch too. The yarn is super soft and not at all scratchy or itchy. That's important to someone with sensitive skin like mine. I ordered the soft red color that I'm going to call BRICK. It's not coral and it's not red. I'm a fair-skinned blonde and the color is really nice. I only tried the sweater on, so I haven't washed it yet. It looks well-made, but as with all of my sweaters, I plan to wash it on the gentle cycle and then dry it flat to extend the look and life of it. Again, I'm really pleased with this sweater!"
5.0,Love it! I get alot of compliments!
5.0,Very pretty but the dress is somewhat heavy
5.0,"I loved it!!<br />I will be ordering more.<br />For reference:<br />5ft 2 1/2&#34;<br />Bust 34 D<br />Waist 33<br />Hips 46<br />I have a tummy and (slight) high rise butt, so the dress is a bit short in the back. No worries, I wear it with tights, so it's not so revealing."
5.0,I wasn’t sure about a floral watch band but I love it! It’s really cute & I get compliments all the time! Great quality!
5.0,"What a gem! I really didn't expect to like this as much as I do because of the price I thought it would be thin and cheap. But it is thick enough and super comfortable.<br />I am 5'9"", 117 lbs and bought the small in the ocean blue color. Gorgeous and flattering!"
5.0,"Very surprised at the quality of these gloves with the low price. The touch screen works perfectly which is a problem I found with other gloves in this price range that I purchased last year. They are somewhat thin so won’t be a super warm snow glove, but will keep your hands warm in the fall and would be perfect for driving on the very cold days as they do have a nice soft lining. Can’t truly speak on how warm they are yet as we bought them in preparation of fall weather in the northeast. Very fashionable and could be dressed up for dinner dates or down for walking. My favorite feature is definitely the touchscreen capabilities for my phone as I use GPS and call a lot during my working days from my car."
5.0,Great shirt ! Husband loved It!
5.0,"I love these clogs by Skecher's! The studs add a unique effect! I have several pairs of footwear by Skecher's, mainly sneakers! Well made & I definitely recommend!"
5.0,Costume for Sebastian in our theatre's production of The Little Mermaid!
5.0,"I bought this for my neice, she is a pet lover and loves this charm, I would say it was a hit."
5.0,These socks are thin enough to fit inside of your middle weight shoes but warm enough in down to 30 degrees F. I like them. I probably will order more.
5.0,I love the adjustable bungee. So cute and never moves!!
5.0,Material is stretchy and the color is just like the pic
5.0,High quality. Really enjoying it. Let’s go Eagles.
5.0,It's fits snuggly to give best possible protection.
5.0,So cute thanks
5.0,This is beautifully crafted.
5.0,Was a stocking stuffer.  Recipient really likes it. Quirky without being too far over the top for work.  Adjustable size makes it easy to buy as a gift.
5.0,Fit good feel good.
5.0,Buena cantidad buen precio
5.0,"This swimsuit is super cute on. I love it. I ordered it in a large and it was a perfect fit. I am 5'6 and weigh 145 lbs. It is comfortable and flattering. It also covers well. I prefer a more modest swimsuit. My husband loved this one on me. I wore it to a swim party this weekend and received many compliments.

5.0,"This apron is not only adorable, but well-made and useful."
5.0,Love these socks! Fit great and they're cut specifically for the left or right foot. Used them in my Barre class (mix Pilates/Ballet) and they worked excellently! Had a question for the seller and they responded immediately and even promptly followed up later to ensure my questions were resolved. Thanks for the rocking socks!
5.0,Great quality and great price! worked well during hard rain conditions so that was a plus! would recommend!!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  Omg they are sooooooo pretty can't wait to wear them.  Update:  THEY DON'T SAY IN PLACE LOOK KINDA STRANGE THE WAY THEY JUST HANG.  NOT VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.  SORRY NO GO
5.0,Making jewellery
5.0,Color was as displayed in the photo. Nice large size and was very useful to me during travel - especially on the plane! Many compliments received from friends regarding the color.
5.0,"My middle daughter loves turquoise and chevrons, so this was a perfect fit for her. She has used the suitcases a few times, and they seem to hold up well."
5.0,"Fits me well, good quality and it is easy to clean"
5.0,I love it. Will order more
5.0,Very pretty and practical. Exactly what i order
5.0,Budget friendly - Terrific Gift
5.0,These are great as my husband needs a mask with straps longer than I do.  We can both wear these and have no issues.  They wash well.  Great product!
5.0,I mean...it's a YEET button. You know what you're getting when you order it.
5.0,Excellent quality<br />Better than my expectations
5.0,Got for my mother In law and she loved it looks stunning !! BLING BLING! She couldn’t wear the bracelet it kept getting stuck in her dress other than that great BUY looks way more<br />Expensive than it is !!
5.0,"It's beautiful, soft and comfortable. Fit as expected."
5.0,I initially purchased this bra because I was looking for something affordable that would work well with some of my formal dresses and was pleasantly surprised when the bra not only met but exceeded my expectations. It holds really well and helps to give a little extra boost. I can't wait to wear this bra to some upcoming events.
5.0,"Item is as described, fast efficient shipping. Great quality, very sturdy, folds up to lay flat and keeps things cold and well insulated . I Would definitely buy this product again."
5.0,"I love the necklace. it is delicate, and I have had people I don't know  tell me they love the necklace. again you get what you pay for, for $2.99. it is a cheap necklace, I live in Florida where it is hot and  it does make my neck itch, but will I wear it, yes, do I expect it to last long .. nope ... I expect the gold to wear off of it. but I will order another one for the price. Its such a nice summer necklace, and again, you get what you pay for,"
5.0,Hands down the best quality sunglasses I've ever had at this price point. I will look for this brand again next time I buy sunglasses.
5.0,Expensive look and feel.  Real bargain.  Never going to spend more than this on sunglasses.  My designer sunglasses aren't as nice as this.
5.0,Omg the quality is amazing on this dress! This dress has the quality of a 200$ bridesmaid dress! I’m 5’4” 140lbs athletic build and the medium fit perfect. Perfect for a wedding.
5.0,"I was I need for new sunglasses and when I found 20 dollar polarized glasses I was skeptical to say the least. I figured I’d try them because at worst it’s just a cheap pair I can toss around, but they ended up being super nice. Actually polarized and done well especially considering the price. Definitely not flexible and could brake fairly easily if I were to twist them or if I had a massive head. But for $20 They’re amazing."
5.0,The inside should have been black instead of white
5.0,Very very happy
5.0,Really good quality for a intense workout👍
5.0,I ordered these shirts for my son.  They fit nicely and wash and wear well too.  Great quality.
5.0,"I had to buy one of these for work and it is great, looks like there is almost nothing there"
5.0,"Since becoming a mom, I've wanted a swimsuit that felt a little more conservative, without all the extra fabric that seems to take forever to dry. It's not that I have anything to hide, I just felt a bit too exposed in a bikini while chasing my 3 year old around a water park or splash pad. This suit fit the bill perfectly! It's sexy like a 2 piece, while covering just enough to be on the modest side.<br /><br />I purchased the pink/&#34;gray&#34; knit suit in a Medium. What is SO amazing about it, is that the gray is actually a thicker black & white elastic type thread woven together that only looks like gray from a distance. Super cool! It's constructed very well, with generous cups & extra lifting in the padding. (See photos) Yes, you can adjust it to fit to your body and tighten or loosen around the neck, depending on your preference of cleavage.<br /><br /> I washed it by hand twice already with no problems & it dried outside within an hour. It dries very quickly while wearing it, too. Yayy!! :) I would only suggest if you get the knit, be careful not to snag too hard if you have any jewelry or piercings. (I have not snagged mine, but I wouldn't wear my wedding ring while washing it just to be safe!) This was one of my favorite purchases ever from Amazon, and the price is unbeatable. Plus, it was delivered on a Sunday!! For reference, I'm 5'9&#34; tall, (my height is in my legs, tho) 34DD/27/36 and I purchased the Medium. It's perfect! You can't go wrong with these swimsuits. I hope this helps!"
5.0,"So beautiful!!!  I also love the Tiffany blue case, lens cloth and pouch.  I wanted glasses with the Tiffany blue color so they fit the bill exactly!"
5.0,Excellent<br />Thank you very much<br />Looking forward to cooperate again
5.0,Son ligeros recibí muchos cumplidos cuando los use en una fiesta los Recomiendo
5.0,I love this dress so much that I've ordered it in many different colors. I get complimented whenever I wear it!
5.0,"This is a far prettier shirt in person than what it looks like on the site... and since it looked good enough to order, that should say something.  It's very lightweight so just perfect for a slight chill or layering up.  I got a small since that's my normal size and it fits just as expected.  Definitely not too tight but a flattering fit around the girls (D cup) and hips.  I also found the length to be exactly what I'd expect and covers the top of my pants and then some.  Will definitely consider purchasing from this vendor again.  And of course, love the ample thumbholes."
5.0,Real cute!
5.0,Great product! These we're super easy to attach to my pins and keeps them extremely secure!
5.0,"I love this necklace - it's even better than the picture.  It's a perfect size for me, and seems like great quality so far.  It came quickly too.  I'm definitely going to check Chuvora's items first from now on!"
5.0,These are some of the best yoga pants! The material is incredibly soft. They absolutely fit while giving a loose feel for comfort. I look forward to wearing these and may have to order more .
5.0,I love the glasses.  They look great on!
5.0,"This tunic/dress fits great! It is not a heavy material, so keep in mind it is best worn with layers  (i.e. a scarf, leggings). Love it though! Perfect for fall weather."
5.0,I live this it is so cute and comfy
5.0,"perfect size, just big enough for credit cards cash and a phone. good quality."

5.0,My son like the thank
5.0,I wasn't sure whether I would like these light weight sunglasses and whether they would be too delicate.  It turns out they are very nice.  I've been using them for months now and they are sturdy enough for my uses.
5.0,"The Ford F-150 tear drop chain I received was extremely well made of solid metal.  The finish is excellent and it is not of too great a weight to get in the way.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to add a little class to their vehicle key and make it easier to quickly discriminate between this key and another vehiicle key (in my case a Ford Fusion, for which I also have a tear drop chain)."
5.0,I can not figure out wqhy this has not caught on for the dealer ships of vichiels! This would change night driving 4 ev]er!<br />Love these somuchI wil order the visor shield for the passenger side !
5.0,Bought this for my niece to wear for her 1st birthday photo shoot. Cute and comfortable
5.0,Love it! This is a quality brand.
5.0,These are the real deal.  Solidly made with good elastic strap material and great holding clips.  Made in the USA no less!. Have worn them for a couple of weeks now and I am very much a fan.  I agree with the advice from others to loosen them up to as long as make sense for your height as it makes them more comfortable to wear.all day.
5.0,"Very good material, everyone loved it"
5.0,Easy install and removal!
5.0,"Great quality. It's too small for me to flip it up when I need to hide it though. It's internally threaded, so it's much more difficult to get the hoop in and screw on the jewelry"
5.0,Can shop with this seller in confidence. Product is exactly as described.
5.0,They fit just right my daughter love them.
5.0,I like this bandy
5.0,"Really comfortable, looks just like the photo of the product. Great buy!"
5.0,Beautiful!!! Thank you!
5.0,Very comfy fit. Very shear. Moves when you do.
5.0,These leggings are THICK. not see through at all! They are true to size and very comfortable. LOVE the pockets! I ordered a medium and they are to long for me but I’m 5’3”. It has a high waist that stays in place and you don’t have to continuously pull them up.
5.0,"Very nice socks, good for yoga & hardwood floors."
5.0,"I had been looking at real necklaces on Pinterest and love all of the genuine diamond and gemstone necklaces and earrings that are featured. When I saw these for such a reasonable price, I thought I would give them a try. The necklaces surpassed all expectations. My husband and I go to several political fundraiser and dinners throughout the year and several black tie events. Needless to say, I have been pestering him to find out when the next formal event is coming up so I can wear one of my new fabulous necklaces!"
5.0,Love it really comfortable and perfect fit
5.0,Adorable and warm exactly what I wanted the colors perfect
5.0,Very pleased with the item.  Better than I expected.  Beautiful and I am already using this purse.
5.0,Love these!  Bracelets are thin but tough enough for me to wear all day/night. No tarnish or color change with weeks of wear.
5.0,I purchased this for a friend.  She absolutely loves it.  I installed it for her.  It was so easy to install.  I wish all watch bands used the same design.
5.0,"The earrings are beautiful! The shade of green of the stone I got was much lighter than the picture, but overall this is what I expected."
5.0,True to size.  Fits well on my 6 year old. For a costume it is well made.  Hat is a bit flimsy but otherwise it’s good for it’s intended purpose.
5.0,"Great outfit, nice loosely fitted. Can breathe in it and is very lightweight for having so many yards of fabric. Cannot wait to wear it to many cons!"
5.0,"Very good material, my god daughter loved it."
5.0,Thin lightweight for summer going into fall I;m 5'2 215 pds it fit just right i usually order my size 2x but ordered 3x since most of these clothes on amazon run small didnt want to take chance to have to return
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous. Going to order another color. I am 5'6.5&#34; 125lbs small was perfect. And long. I loveeeee it
5.0,"I love the material! It’s soft, shimmery and stretchy! When I opened the package and held the leotard up in front of me, I thought, “This can’t be a Medium.” It looked like it wouldn’t fit. Then, I pulled it and stretched it and said, “Okay. This may be okay.” Once I put it on, the fit was PERFECT! The fit is actually better than any leotards I own, and more comfortable to dance in. I’ll be getting a few in different colors."
5.0,"Loved how easy it was to put on,<br />If you choose to purchase this dress, be careful of the undergarment you wear with this dress because it can be visible"
5.0,These are very cute and fit well!  I love the vibrant colors.  These will help keep me warm this winter.
5.0,Did the trick.they do get a little sruck but whatever.

5.0,I have a bigger build than most and XXL fit perfectly
5.0,The code was ready after my purchase. It was easy to us.
5.0,It's a nice shirt dress..I wore it with thigh high boots just have to wear shorts under because there's a rip in the back where you can see a bit of my but cheek.other than that I like it
5.0,"It's so cute, I've already gotten a ton of compliments. I was really impressed with the packaging and the quality of the product for such a low price."
5.0,Great colors and very supportive i will order again

5.0,It was a gift for my daughter who is a huge fan of Roman Reigns. She loved it and it fit perfectly.
5.0,I love my hat. We had such a cold winter and I wish I had ordered it sooner but I will be prepared for next year. I've worn it a few time cause it's still winter. If your like me and think you don't look good in hats this one may change your mind.
5.0,"My daughter loves these. We had gone out one night and she lost one of the red shoes she had, so I got these as a replacement. she is 3 and wears them everywhere."
5.0,great fit. I love it
5.0,"I love my compression socks! I use them for Lymphedema in my foot and leg after my cancer surgery. So far, they are keeping the fluid off. If you have to wear compression socks, these are the best and are very stylish. Not like the boring solid color ones from long ago."
5.0,Cloth is quite niece and fits well
5.0,These are absolutly beautiful and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,Fast shipping  Great prices  thanks
5.0,Very Beautiful my wife very like this one pakage so cute

5.0,Beautiful perfect and lightweight.
5.0,Feels nice. Fits good. Definitely a decent purchase.
5.0,So cute and a higher quality that expected! Delivered promptly and well packed (protective zip bag).
5.0,Great size & quality! Would buy again! Great gift!
5.0,"Lovely.. It's somewhat small, and will look best on a petite lady.."
5.0,They're durable and comfy....My hands didn't sweat too bad while wearing ...They get the job done<br />!!
5.0,I'm in love with this necklace. ...it fits other snaps so I can wear it with anything. ..well made and super shiny...
5.0,I just love watching my husband roam around the house in these! They are so over the top! The ugly Christmas sweater of jammies! But they are very soft well made and fit everywhere. He has a 34' inseam but all is good there. I bought them because we both love the movie. But they are certainly going to be used. I like that.
5.0,Love love love this outfit.  Travels great!!  It is so comfortable and could use casually or dresses up.  Wore it several times during my travels
5.0,"So the stones appear nearly clear to me, unlike the listing picture, showing just the faintest green hints. Still I like these earrings a lot. This type of clip-on hardly pinches."
5.0,Fit well - excellent price
5.0,Love it black ring
5.0,Everyone laughs at my hubby's mask. He has a beard just like the mask. He loves making others laugh.
5.0,"Loved them, def. a must have"
5.0,"Perfect, love this bag!"

5.0,I love this blouse.  It is soft and fit as expected. It’s one of my favorites.
5.0,I just love my statement necklace and earrings!! Vibrant color and looks just like the picture. Will buy from this company again.
5.0,"Oh, these earmuffs are warm and toasty!!"
5.0,"The size was perfect, the fabric is very soft and the red color very vibrant.  All around good buy."
5.0,"I bought this necklace for my step daughter for Valentine's Day. It fitted so nice, and very sturdy. Most definitely worth your money"
5.0,Great socks. Better than all the others i've bought for cheaper.
5.0,all of the belly rings I got are perfect I have not even worn some of them yet and I bought this a while ago.
5.0,Very soft and a beautiful color. The wrinkles from being folded were easily taken care of with a steamer.
5.0,"This watch is amazing! I wanted something that looked modern yet classic. This watch GTA my style! The faux leather is nice and dosen't tear. The watch itself is sort of cheap but it is definitely strong. It works great but it takes me a couple second to figure out the time. I still don't know how to change the battery and what the dot at the top is for. I have had to repair the parts where the faux leather meets the watch. It's easy though, a simple spring loaded type bar. I wear it every day and love it! I have recommended it to MANY friends! I can't explain the other reviews, this watch is amazing!"
5.0,Nice. Seems durable so far.
5.0,I am in love!!  Arrived just in time.  I ordered a size l just because  I wasn't sure what I was in turns  of size but I really like the material.  For people saying it's cheap and ugly  idk what y'all got it's not thick by any means but you can see that on the models... I highly  recommend  this product and I would love to get one in all the colors they  have!
5.0,Got these for my granddaughter's Halloween costume.  She looked adorable and they lasted through the day and night.
5.0,Perfect gift for my work white elephant Xmas party. The material is surprisingly heavy duty for the low price. Would recommend.
5.0,"Wow!<br /><br />I purchased this 18k gold plated earrings for my daughter and she was so delighted to receive them. She was so impressed when she opened them that she just sat and stared at them. Turning them different ways and watching the light shimmer off of them. Some of the words she used to describe them were amazing, stunning, impressive and beautiful.<br /><br />They came in a nice gift box so they made a nice presentation when I presented them to her. They also come with two different styles of backs so that you can choose the ones that are more comfortable fit for yourself.  I couldn't  find anything in the retails stores that even compare to the quality of these. They have such details for such a affordable price. She's happy...so I'm happy. She said these are now her favorite pair of earrings.  Impressed?  Very much so!  Can I recommend these? Absolutely!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  My opinions are my own and not influenced by the price but by the quality of this product."
5.0,very beautiful my daughter loves it
5.0,"Cute, heavy duty!"
5.0,"Fits great, true to size.  Can wear as a vest or as a top."
5.0,Good fit and very comfortable. The quality is good. I order XL
5.0,"As a lot of reviewers mention, these dresses are sized differently than what we're used to in the US. I wear a size 6 dress. A Miusol Large fits my bust and hips nicely, and leaves a bit of room in the waist. Not a flaw in the dress. That's a problem I have with most one piece things, due to my shape (38-26-38). With a bit of tailoring, it'll be perfect.<br />Nice sturdy material with some stretch. Very cute vintage silhouette."
5.0,Love this nightie! Very comfortable and cool-feeling material.
5.0,"The side ties on this swimsuit are everything. And who doesn’t love tie dye? The shades of blue are perfect. The top and bottom coverage is just what I wanted for my daughter, nothings hanging out. The quality appears to be very good, I anticipate it lasting a couple years. She’s a true small and the small fit her perfect. If you’re on the edge with ordering this swimsuit just do it, you won’t regret it!"
5.0,Definitely satisfied with these! They were softer and more comfortable than I expected. and I love how they're kind of stretchy. fit perfectly.
5.0,This dress is the best.Feels so soft and looks so cute
5.0,"I ordered the white in large. Beautiful fabric and very flowy. I am a 36C, 5'9 and 150. Ladies have commented that the bust area is a little tight. I recommend to go up a size if you are bustier. There is a little elastic in the back, but because of the buttons, it could be an issue. The white is so pretty!"
5.0,This blouse is light and great for travel.  It can be combined with other elements of your wardrobe. Very versatile.
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much at this price point. Wow was I surprised at the quality of the item! Runs a bit big, so go down 1 size. Absolutely love it."
5.0,"This is a very fun bracelet. It consists of 5 bangles of different sizes with sort of tribal inscriptions on them. They jingle when moving, look like burnished gold and would add a little spice to any outfit. It's lightweight and very pretty. I love wearing it."
5.0,Afforable and durable
5.0,"This dress is beautiful. Well made heavier weight fabric than expected, but it holds its shape and offices flaws beautifully. Order a size larger than I typically wear because I didn't want pulling over my larger chest and it fits like a dream. May have to order in additional colors it's just that cute"
5.0,Nice for parties
5.0,Great earrings for the Disney fan that looks more “grown up”. Not the usual cheap earrings that turn green. Will be ordering more colors.
5.0,"Ordered this to go with a dressy formal dress...it is just as nice as expected. the copper color is great. reversable I suppose, tho back side is more flat, and not same as front. Like the fringe, and the light weight for a warm evening."
5.0,"Used these for a GORUCK event. Comfortable, not a tight of compression as CompressionZ gear but still very snug and worked great for what I needed them for. I wanted this length specifically so that the legs would not interfere with my hiking socks."
5.0,"These sunglasses are amazing.  They are super flattering on my heart shaped face, chic, fashionable and not too much of a statement.  My only concern is that they are a bit too wide for my head... which is already fairly large.  For me they slide down and usually just stay at the tip of my nose, but I worry if your head is smaller than mine (which it probably is) you might want to think about getting them tightened or something. Otherwise, great buy!!!"
5.0,"My little one loved them! Perfect fit, comfortable and warm for the fall. Fit her better than her Crocs!"
5.0,Order this a year ago and no complaints. Husband is a welder/contracted he keeps it on him at all times at work and no issues. Just a little wear from daliy use
5.0,I love how lightweight the sweater is for layering.  The colors are just as vibrant as the photos and I love the fit!  Overall I LOVE this colorful sweater.
5.0,"So comfortable! I wear it around the house almost everyday. It’s so easy to put on and it’s just soft and comfortable, but cute at the same time. I bought one for my Mother in law also that just had a Mastectomy and she loves it."
5.0,I am an emcee and In-game announcer so I got this mask and have gotten a lot of comments. Cool stuff!
5.0,"Nice and warm, but the fuzzy lining sheds a bit at first."
5.0,"Will always love Totes umbrellas. Living in Chicago, I need an umbrella that can snap out when the wind blows so I'm not carried off into the river, but sturdy and flexible enough that it just snaps right back in. The only time I've had to replace was due to losing my previous one."
5.0,"Went to a themed party and I ordered this.  It worked well and got compliments on the outfit.  I will wear it again, as it is comfortable and pretty.  Looks as pictured and true to size."
5.0,Super cute and comfortable .  The neck was a bit loose so I moved the button to to make it fit better. I also added loops for the belt on the sides of the dress to hold it in place better.<br />But 5 min. of small adjustment and it’s perfect . I ordered another color as well. Easy to wear . The hem falls  nicely just slightly above the knee  It’s going to be a favorite.
5.0,It is exactly what I wanted. Well made. Real leather. Two sections. Heavy zipper.
5.0,"This is a well made, perfect sized pendant.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I love these earrings, they are even more beautiful than in the photo. I got a lot of compliments while wearing"
5.0,I like the material ... comfortable and heavy.
5.0,Great love them! Going on my 3rd pair this year. I wish they would make it out of better materials but you get what you paid for.
5.0,So pretty love the fabric and the colors are exactly as shown
5.0,Great top for the price.  Flattering fit!
5.0,"I love this style of shirt, a bought this shirt in grey/black along with grey/navy for my boyfriend. He wears a large, and I have to fan myself when he surprises me by wearing it. It looks so good on him!!"
5.0,Very nice and well designed anime hoodie. Would be even better if sleeve cuffs stretched in order to pull up on to forearms.
5.0,The Cotton material blend<br />And she looks cute in them!
5.0,This bracelet is really nice.  Much nicer than I expected.  I also ordered the gold and rose gold.
5.0,Very nice band. Easy to change size by removing links with the included tools. Much cheaper than the $129 version from Fitbit. Really like it and it is very light weight as well.
5.0,This was a present for my daughter.  She absolutely loved it!
5.0,"Let me start by saying I am a 38DDD, 44.5&#34; bust and a 38&#34; waist. Using measurements lile this arw far more accurate than using height/weight, as everybody distributes their fat differently.<br />This dress is perfect! It has that cute retro feel, and if you are like me and have a tummy problem (I have a pooch tummy) it hides it beautifully! If you want a really retro look BUY A PETTICOAT to go with this. It hangs very awkwardly without it.<br />The material is very thick, and you could barely see my dark bra underneath the pink top.<br />Sizing was very true to the manufacturers size chart, and the XL fit me perfectly! The only issue I might have is that I am short and this dress is made for someone a few inches taller than me. Again if you get it invest in a petticoat!!! Such a good buy and I will DEFINITELY be getting more."
5.0,OK I was somewhat skeptical despite all of the glowing reviews but this dress is amazing. I normally run a 12-14 so I bought a large and it fit perfectly. There was a slight odor when I removed it from the packaging but it was gone after washing it once. I cannot recommend this dress enough!
5.0,"The red mask is a beautiful color. To my eye, it's a true red (not an orange-y red or a Burgundy red at all).  I couldn't really  tell from the images just how sparkly this mask is--it's what I was hoping for....<br />My face/nose is on small side so sometimes adult masks take up all of my cheek area up to underneath my outer eye rim below my eye and also hang off my chin and this mask does not--it's a perfect fit on me. When I recvd it, I threw it in the washing machine on cold water (in a lingerie mesh bag) then air dried it--no problem, It's still available intact."
5.0,I love the length and pockets.... causal but still cute &#60;33333
5.0,As a woman. I have a big head. These hats look so good on me. I'll post pics later. This hat is breathable. Doesn't make me hot at all! It's stretchy in the back but not gappy. It fits snug too. With the price you'd think the quality would be meh but no it's amazing. I've washed it more than once in the washer and it still held it's quality and color. I've received a few compliments about this hat.<br /><br />I bought the gray one. I want to buy more!
5.0,Me gusta que hasta ahora no se despinta
5.0,"Easter gift for my daughter. She wanted ""Dangly earrings"" and these are a great first step. (She's 7)<br /><br />Post is pretty long, but the backs are cone shaped, so that helps bridge for people with thin lobes, or children."
5.0,I love the earrings !!! They really accentuate my diamond necklace
5.0,Awesome product and service. Just as described. Prompt shipping! Thank you!
5.0,I was pretty impressed with these bandanas to be honest!  They had super clean edges and were very soft!
5.0,"This is junior size, just remember to order one size up! I normally wear a small men's size t-shirt and medium woman's size, and a medium is perfect.<br /><br />The color is a fairly vibrant turquoise instead of a light blue, but still works great for a cosplay."
5.0,perfect and comfortable
5.0,Very happy with these slippers.  They are very comfortable and the sole is perfect for quick trips outside.  Highly recommend!
5.0,"Amazing quality, definitely not cheap looking and is beautiful in person. I purchased the rust color and I love It!"
5.0,Product came in great condition. Great price and quality! Order one size up to be sure!
5.0,"I have worn this watch every day all day for 3 months now, and its still as beautiful as when i recieved it. the shipping was fast,and its the softest pink. i love it."
5.0,Granddaughter loves them for her games but make certain you buy them large because they are sized very small.
5.0,Love the floral cut out on the band. It was longer than expected and it just fit my wrist on the last hole but it is perfect for everyday use at work! Love the purple too
5.0,great price and people loved it
5.0,"Really pretty, holds up well"
5.0,"Love this dress!! I have many Patti Boutik pieces, dresses were not my favorite fit-wise..however, this dress is perfect in a size small.  I usually wear a small in Patti Boutik tops.  For reference, I am 125..5’4”..37-27-37.  Nice, thick material..can’t wait to wear!!  👍🏻"
5.0,Great arm and shoulder protection from the sun! When you want some more shade and still want to be able to wear your favorite tank tops!
5.0,I have used this for many years to make my hats fit. This is so much better than buying two small strips.
5.0,Great toy to play Spy Ninjas
5.0,"Wish there was a brown version of this shirt - the color of coffee : )  I really like this shirt, its comfortable and of good quality. I take personal pleasure in wearing it, but feel a little self-conscious about wearing a shirt that says &#34;slut&#34; in public : )  It's a nice shirt, just didn't realize how I would feel running out to sign for something from the mailman ; )"
5.0,Great dress for the price!  I ordered a small and it fits perfect.  I ordered it for a barn wedding and it was just right.
5.0,I love this top! I'm 5'8&#34; 150 lbs. I bought a medium. The length is perfect and it's not too loose and not too snug. You can wear it with leggings or straight leg jeans.
5.0,This was exactly the cap I wanted.  I’ll be gifting my cousin a cap also. “Aim High”
5.0,"I really like these sterling silver stone stud earrings. I have been going without earrings for months now because after pregnancy all of my hypoallergenic earrings were not good enough, they still caused my ears to itch and get scabby or pussy when I wore them. The doctor told me I can only wear silver and gold from nap now on.  I wore my moms pair of diamond earrings just to see how they did and I was so happy that they did not hurt my ears, however I am not able to purchase a pair of diamond earrings at this time. When I saw these earrings I decided to give them a try, and I was very excited to find that this sterling silver does not hurt my ears and I can finally wear earrings again! The cubic zirconia it is nice and sparkly and the design is simple and elegant.  I really love there.  They are nice to wear casually or dress up.  They are perfect for me to wear for work with kids or to events where I want to add a little elegance to my outfit."
5.0,"So cute and fits great! I'm short (5'3) so these dresses don't usually fit me well, but this one fit just right. The length of the small was actually perfect."
5.0,love it but it is a little small than expected
5.0,I love the way this sweater fits . It’s weird when you take it out but when you put it on it gives the desire look and more if you have the figure. It’s comfortably thickness allows you to dance and move with easy.
5.0,I really love these earrings. They seem well made and sturdy. They also are very unique looking. I haven't seen any other studs that look like these.
5.0,"Love it, looks great on my bf"
5.0,I wanted a silicone wrist bracelet with a positive encouraging messege but not one that screamed social justice warrior. Great fit and the price is right.
5.0,"very nice aviators, not polarized tho"
5.0,I absolutely love them! Super stretchy and comfy.
5.0,"I’m 5’6” 160 and the medium fit perfect, a little snug pulling it over the breast area- but a good fit. Love the dress. I almost want to buy another in a different color!"
5.0,"so cute! love the knotted back. A little bug for me, but who knows it might shrink when washing, which would be ideal for me."
5.0,I bought it for the wife and loved it.
5.0,my boyfriend was very happy with his ring it was larger and better quality then the pictured
5.0,"Got them for my lady when she goes to work, she’s a nurse and she loves them. Thanks"

5.0,Kids loved the hoodie and was exactly what the were looking for
5.0,Gift for granddaughter she loved it.
5.0,"My little one wears them all the time, she is 4 yrs. old."
5.0,Was smooth order. Cheaper then most places. VERY HAPPY!!
5.0,True to their size chart. Soft silky lightweight hoody. 8year old big boy/husky  size 10
5.0,"Superior craftsmanship on the cut of the gem stone and the gold casing. Love the way it looks on my girl and she loves it too! wears them everyday! Best quality for the money especially when compared to some of the cheaper stuff on amazon you are getting a great deal for the price considering the quality of work here, it has no equal if you’re looking for gemstone earings, my girl told me she even prefers these to regular earings cuz the gemstone shines so beautifully."
5.0,"Love this ring, it does turn green after a while but paint it with clear nail polish!!"
5.0,Awesome strap. Came better than I thought and well worth the price!
5.0,These met my expectations. Very good quality.
5.0,Love these shirts. Purchased thru company website previously then found them on amazon. Much better than cotton in hot weather.
5.0,"My son loves Minecraft, he has a few hoodies and this just goes well with his collection."
5.0,"Cute, short and delicate just like I wanted"
5.0,As shown!
5.0,I thought I’d never find a jumbo size pair of clip on hoops until these! Love them!
5.0,Really like these sunglasses.
5.0,Such a nice piece that I don't have to worry about.  Put it in and go!
5.0,Quality of the shirt was very good.
5.0,I ordered three other leather bands before this and ended up returning them because they either didn’t fit my small wrists or were cheap looking. This band is great quality and color and the little bumper case matches perfectly ! Would definitely recommend!
5.0,It’s beautiful! I got this for myself for my son and it’s amazing. The chain is very shiny lol
5.0,GREAT glasses. Delivered as described.
5.0,"Love this swimsuit! It's modest and cute! I get compliments every time I wear it. I feel and look like a Disney princess in it. It's foam cups are a little small and weird looking, but you cant see them through the suit and they provide adequate coverage."
5.0,I didn't like how they were vacuum sealed for shipping. It smashed the robe into it so it was super wrinkled. These are very cute robes for little kids!
5.0,Loved these but we’re a little short length wise.. Either way looked soooo cute
5.0,"Very pretty I really like them, lots of complements! One problem the ivory and turquoise rings are not able to be worn next to rings on adjacent fingers as they stick out too much. Any suggestions to remedy this problem ? I would be able to wear them. more often ."
5.0,"Great 5 year wedding anniversary present for my hubby. My hubby doesn't often wear watches, so i doubt he uses this much, however it is really nice for the price. Leather is super soft, watch is very well made."
5.0,"I'm a man and bought this for myself because I wanted something simple and unintrusive, unlike most men's jewelry which is thick or flashy.  Have received many compliments on it, people often ask if its real gold."
5.0,"I bought it as I already have the woodland camouflage Goretex liner jacket and pants. So this is now part of the execs system. As an US Army veteran, I appreciate any military gear to support my outdoor activities."
5.0,"I just received the shoe bags a couple days ago.  They are exactly as I was expecting.  I wear a size 11 shoe, and they fit in the bags just fine.  I no longer will have to shove my shoes in throwaway grocery store bags for my next trip.  Before the summer vacation I hope to get a set for the rest of the family.  The bag is light weight, yet very strong.  I don't have any problems recommending these bags to other travelers."
5.0,super cute and dainty. I used it for my third hole in my ear
5.0,Urumqi contacted me with regards to my purchase and quickly send me a replacement.  Glad that they are responsive to my purchase and make the effort in make thing right.  I am happy to receive the replacement from Urumqi. Will definitely buy from them again
5.0,My huband love this jacket
5.0,PRESTTTY WATCH AND HAVE WORE IT SEVERAL TIMES AND I LIKE IT. THE PRICE WAS GOOD SO I CANNOT FUSS .
5.0,In love with this dress. True fit and comfortable dress. I got tons of compliments
5.0,"LOVE this bra. I wear a 32dd normally and this one fit true to size. the adjustable straps and back closure make it comfortable and super supportive. I run and do a lot of cardio and this thing keeps the girls in place better than some of my more expensive sports bras. Some other reviews mention that it runs a little small around the ribs, which may be true, but that's what I look for in a sports bra! It's not so ridiculously tight that I would go with another size. Highly recommend."
5.0,Although the package came a little later due to issues with the postal service... IT’S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I love it! The chain is supper lightweight and the letters came out perfect and legible. I will be ordering more in the future ❤️
5.0,Very nice hat.  Husband really likes it.  Great fit.
5.0,"This ring isn't flimsy and it doesn't turn your finger green. I was looking for a very dainty Claddagh and this is perfect. Sizing is great, too. I got this for my daughter in a size 2 and myself in a size 6 and both were good quality and identical. They sent the wrong ring initially and quickly replaced it with the correct one."
5.0,Had a couple pairs of these and they are good.
5.0,"Great smocks, ordered for my salon, one size fits everybody, light weight so clients don't get to warm under capes, like that the ties are attached."
5.0,My grand daughter loves it she says
5.0,Prettier in person. Larger than expected which was a plus!! :)
5.0,Fits perfectly. very good quality
5.0,Fits perfectly. Very flattering and comfortable
5.0,"Invaluable in winter. I wore these almost daily all winter long, they really help. The quality is great, they've survived many washings without signs of wear, they stay up, everything I could ask for."
5.0,"Ive been impressed by this company for its product AND service. So I thought Id tune people in ... This is literally the best wallet I ever had, and Im someone who is quite particular about wallets. I went from wallets on kickstarter to luxury brand wallets that charge too much for the same practical purpose with no apparent increase in quality. By far, Fidelo wallets have durability, form, function, and aesthetic appeal. What I like most is the hard case design that will never expand, a common issue with leather wllets losing its grip on cards over time from packing the occasional extra one or two cards or gift cards. It also comes with a generous 4 additional cash straps in case that ever happens, and the outer case, which I only use on occasion, to hold other cards such as gift cards. You can tell they pay attention to quality when the box it comes in is overwhelmingly aesthetic, kind of like apple products, I almost felt bad throwing it away. Fidelo obviously uses high quality. In addition, they have one of the best service available that is prompt and generous, without getting into too many details. You can tell they really focus on making sure their brand is of utmost satisfaction. Try them today and give them a shot. This company does it right."
5.0,"These gloves are ridiculously comfortable and feels like something that should cost more, a lot more!"
5.0,"These are absolutely beautiful and classy! I get many compliments on them. Would love to buy more as gifts for friends and family, so I hope they get more in stock again! Backing is a bit tricky at first, so you might want to practice with the catch before putting them on."
5.0,Loved this jumper but it was a tad too small in the hips. I would order again but they didn’t have the size I needed. Highly recommend.
5.0,"This jacket is SO soft both inside and out. It fits nicely because I like jackets just a tad big. I am 5’1 and 180lbs. I bought an XL and it fits perfect. A little loose for comfort in zipping, but not so baggy you swim in it. It seems to be well made, the color is just as shown, and I love how comfortable it is."
5.0,Color is great!  Just what is described!
5.0,Perfect fit. A bit of rolling up as they usually do but overall a great find. No problems.
5.0,"These are the best sandals! Super cute, comfortable, and affordable. I get compliments every time I wear them!"
5.0,"Nice and attractive replacement for a broken, missing, or just plain ugly zipper pull.  It appears to be durable and well-made, and my wife loves it.  End of story."
5.0,Every year or so renew my quest for a “perfect”smart wool sock. I have bought 2more pairs beyond my original purchase. I like these socks VERY VERY much!
5.0,A+++++++++
5.0,I like it a lot.  Good buy.
5.0,Great fit love the high waist and stretchy and covers well as most high waisted shorts on me show too much cheek ;)
5.0,"Great quality. The clip is very sturdy. If I don’t have cash I clip the wallet on the inside of my rear jeans pocket and it is secure. I wanted something sturdy but slim, and this fits perfectly. My dad loves it as well so I am going to send him the link and let him choose which one. 5 stars from us!"
5.0,Beautiful gown! I used it as a costume for Halloween and for a photoshoot. The material is great quality and it fit perfectly! I’m 5’10” & weigh 195 lbs & bought a size XL.
5.0,"Love this watch band!  I have been looking for a band that was attractive yet reasonably priced and this was it!  Beautiful packaging, well made band, & easy to attach to my watch.  The band easily wrapped around my wrist 2x and sits nicely & comfortably. Highly recommend."
5.0,Good quality and seen well. Has a nose wire that works ok but could have been a little firmer.  As described in the listing so worth buying.
5.0,Very soft! They don’t shrink with washing & drying.
5.0,I really like these shorts. Theyre not really heavy which possibly means theyre not great material or whatever but that lightweight makes them great in the summer. I wear them way more than I expected
5.0,Love this cape-so soft! I bought it as a Christmas present for my 13-year-old niece. She wore it to bed she loved it so much.
5.0,love it !!
5.0,This dress was so great I bought one in another color. I absolutely love it and I received so many compliments and I caught several girls checking me out. I'm busty so I opted to wear a shear  shawl with mine as I could not go strapless. The black looks more classy than the burgundy one I bought. This is a great buy for curvy girls.
5.0,Get many compliments. Looks nice and it’s adjustable by adding and removing links which is great since I have big wrists
5.0,My Mother had a double myscetomy and her chest gets cold from the lack of tissue. I purchased this vest for her and she is so thankful for it.
5.0,i love it thnk you
5.0,es super sencillo
5.0,"Great buy, came in fast and are as expected."
5.0,This readers are very thing and fold flat but yet very sturdy and great quality. They come with a flat case great presentation. They have the perfect size to carry in a pocket or purse. Love them
5.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for.  My 3 year old son always wants to wear these.  There are no creases or uncomfortable spots on the inside.  Super cute and easy to slip on and off.  And, they seem good quality and not cheap looking/feeling. Will continue to just buy these the next size up each year."
5.0,Love the earrings. Had to stretch one with my wrench a little to get the ball back in place. One of the holes wasn’t finished out.
5.0,These are like walking on air. They're sooo comfortable. Forgot that I was wearing until someone mentioned how cute they were. My cat loves them too😊
5.0,"Love these socks. I wear sketchers low cut shoes and these socks don’t show at all. They’re the perfect size that they stay on and don’t slip around. They’re thicker than similar socks of tries, which is great for absorbing sweat!"
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much out of this bag, to be honest. I just thought it would be a really cute, petite gym bag.. But I was wrong.<br />This bag doesn't scream ""sports"" to me, it's more casual which is exactly what I wanted. I have to carry several medications/supplies with me and this bag is PERFECT for this purpose. Medications fit neatly in the bottom part (where the shoes are supposed to go), and this way I don't have to dig through them to find my keys. This bag came as a LIFESAVER when my daughter has sports tournaments on weekends, and we are sitting in the gym for hours. The water proof compartment is great because I don't worry about throwing a water bottle or coffee mug in there! Particularly on the go. The bag is made out of great materials and it seems like it's going to hold up well. I love the fact that there are so many zippers, if you drop the bag or tip it over, nothing will come out.<br /><br />SO. If you need a bag that has just enough room for an overnight trip, or weekend sports events, this is an excellent choice. I HIGHLY recommend. I also take it to the gym!"
5.0,I absolutely love this chain.
5.0,I got this set for both my daughter and my niece for Christmas.  I know they will love them.  I opened them on arrival and the Crystal's and stones are perfect hand sized pieces and the self is beautiful.
5.0,"Since it rains quite a bit in Washington, I wanted pants to go over my work pants.  The rain pants work for this purpose and the jacket does too,  Originally bought the set for the rain pants only, though now I use both.  Great deal!"
5.0,These gloves are soft and fit comfortably.  My wife wanted a pair that she was able to wear while she used her phone without feeling bulky. They were a good product for the price.  She would recommend them.
5.0,Great sunglasses. Everything was better than i anticipated. I was a little skeptical because the design changed a little from previous model but they look great.
5.0,Sometime it falling
5.0,This belt was very comfy for a long ride first day i did a 2 hour ride with my wife and she shelt so much more comfy than usual. I ride a sportbike with a small seat and it really gave her more confidence in leaning in the corners with me i would reccomend this product forsure no complaints
5.0,So comfy. Bought large and cut off the neck and top half. Wear it all the time for lounging.
5.0,"Love the fit, love the color. Perfect for me."
5.0,My sister loved it as a birthday present
5.0,"I purchased this for my teenage niece who loves the very costly athletic wear (we all know the brand, right) and doesn’t usually like other brands. She absolutely loved this tennis skirt and wears it often! I’ll definitely be purchasing more!"
5.0,"Surprisingly well made blouse! Nice quality fabric, (soft and flowy), true to size, and the color is beautiful. The gold jewelry attached  neck ornamentation adds a stylish flair to the piece.  It worked perfectly for what I purchased it for. It is a very classy top. I felt good in my outfit."
5.0,I love the style and fit. However the stitching inside the tankini is scratchy in spots
5.0,Bought this for my mom because her grandchildren call her “honey.” She loves the mask and says it’s easy to breathe in.
5.0,Love the feel of these. Plenty of room in the pocket but also keeping the guys up out of the way
5.0,Too Cute !!!!!!!!
5.0,"Good quality and design.  They're not too tight to obstacle blood flow, however  they're not too loose. I am 5-5 and they're perfect for me."
5.0,"This dress is fabulous. I was the hit of the Roaring 20's party. It looks great especially at night. It definitely has a costume feel but it is well made and very flattering to your figure. I ordered 6 different flapper dresses and they made me look dowdy. This dress fit great and actually made me look thin. Absolutely loved it! Regarding size I am 5'9"" tall, 170 lbs, and usually wear a womens 12 or 14. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly."
5.0,"My son was Anakin Skywalker for Halloween, and he felt like this costume was perfect!  It is a costume, not meant for everyday, so the fabric isn't the greatest... but better than expected."
5.0,Great Hoodie for the price. It’s lighter than I expected. Not too thick but a nice spring/fall wear. Embroidery was nicer than I was expecting
5.0,It fit perfect no problem and looks great.
5.0,"I have three of these in different colors, love them!!"
5.0,"Great little hat, folds flat for travel."
5.0,They fit perfectly!  At the top of sock on the calf stretches and adjust to the width of my calf and doesn't leave an imprint.  Provides great support for my 12 hour shifts. thanks
5.0,Fits perfectly isnt stretchy material though

5.0,Love the size of these.
5.0,Nice dress! So comfortable
5.0,Bought this for my mil who kept falling and hitting her head. We are having to buy more though because some stitching came lose. Has definitely saved us a few er trips!
5.0,"Great hat.  Fits like all New Era hats.  I like that it isn't a wool/poly blend, but is 100% wool.  Arrived fairly quick, and with some free stickers."
5.0,"It is very important to use the size chart, the shirt looks very nice!"
5.0,"Very versatile...can be used in different styles. Classy, loungey, sexy, and for fitness/workouts. Flip flops, slides, sneakers, sandals etc. Wardrobe staple....everyone needs a good simple romper.<br /><br />I ordered a Large. Fits perfect. It's very stretchy but form fitting.  10/10"
5.0,Love the style of the hat.
5.0,"This is a very nice shirt, well made and great material. Looks exactly like the picture. Cut  small so order a size up like most of these items."
5.0,This polishing cloth is great. It's stored with my sterling silver jewelry so I can give whatever piece I want to wear a quick wipe before putting it on. A couple of the polishing clothes I've had in the past had an unpleasant odor to them but this one doesn't seem to have any odor at all.<br />Very pleased and will be ordering a few more just to have on hand.
5.0,Perfect for every horsewoman
5.0,"I got it in my husband’s initial, so that when it gets hung up on a sweater or something and I ya knit off my thumb and throw it, it gives me double the therapy."

5.0,Era para un regalo de aniversario
5.0,I absolutely love it! I ordered my size and it fit just right! Well with the price!
5.0,my wife love this bag
5.0,"According to my wife, she ordered a Grey 38/40mm watch band.  We received a Black 42/44mm band.  So I’m using it for my watch.  Very comfortable. I have to adjust it every time I put it on but not a big deal.  You’ll need a watch stand to charge because the circle band won’t allow it to lay flat."
5.0,"Great sunglasses! Fit my face well and love the look. I don't mind the &#34;seam&#34; that you can see down the middle of the glasses, you can clearly see it in the pics posted by the vendor too before you buy. Will be buying more!"

5.0,Hubby loves the slippers needed them for plantar fascitis.  The only thing he doesn't like about them is they are too warm for the summer.  I'm sure he will appreciate the warmth in the winter.
5.0,I love it💖 it's just the right size
5.0,Not the best but if the

5.0,Cute and convenient!
5.0,"So far so good!<br /> We loose SO many umbrellas here in Cental Florida. You always need one.<br /> This is a great deal...2 for 1.<br /> I like the way the canopy is constructed to allow rain to drip down and out.<br /> Smart colors, okay for men or women."
5.0,It has pockets and is incredibly comfortable
5.0,"I normally can't handle most of the headband since they all feel like they are squeezing my head, these headbands are not the same ! They feel great on my head, material is stretchy and soft! Even my 7year old would fight for it, thank god I bought 2 lol. Great product and pretty cute!!!!"
5.0,"Got these for my teenage son for Christmas.  He really likes them.  They are a big on the light side as far as the mirror goes, but he's not complaining.  Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Good color combination. I noticed they were a little tight on my little ones leg. They fit her nonetheless. Great for gifting and the price was reasonable.

5.0,On time and it s great item I recieved  great job
5.0,"This my 4th sweater, I have navy, off white, red and brown.  I usually wear an XS and the S fits me the way I want, snug but not clingy or tight.  I live in MN and I'm always cold so I usually layer it under a vest or open sweater, except in early fall or late spring.  This sweater does not shrink.  I turn it inside out to wash to avoid pilling.  This is not a pricey sweater and I do not expect it to last forever but I have been happy with my purchases."
5.0,"Does not come with a chain, but the pendant is very nice"
5.0,Compresson ideal .  Fit perfect just below the knee .  Easy to put on.

5.0,"Took a little bit of searching but these were exactly what I was looking for! Waited 2 full months to see how they held up and, so far so good. Ordered ""brown"" and ""medium brown"" for my LL Bean Cordovan colored boots thinking the darker one would work but actually the ""medium brown"" (pictured) are perfect.  They appear a little reddish in the picture but I think they are just picking up the color reflected from the boot (which is a good thing). I have a second pair here and, when not on the boot, they appear medium brown with a hint of golden in the color. Very nice!<br /><br />I'll use the brown one's in some other boots I have coming and definitely will be ordering more."
5.0,"These little twigs are amazing for crafts or jewelry making , they are kinda thinner than what is showing in the pics which is the perfect size I was looking for , I totally recommend them for friends and family. I got the gold ones if you are wondering what I got 😍😍😍"
5.0,My daughter wears this all the time. She is rainbow and plane obsessed and loves this dress
5.0,This is a really nice bag! Very fashionable!  The waterproof really works! I got stuck in a downpour with the bag and it kept everything dry. The back zipper makes it a little tricky to get into quickly but makes sure that no one else can get into your bag. I also like the versatility of being able to use the backpack or shoulder strap.
5.0,I get so many complements on these. The are very over sized and a nice fashion statement piece. I have had them almost a year and have held up well for cheap sunglasses.
5.0,Great product and excelent customer service
5.0,You can move the second hand back by swinging your arm. I'm going to try and return it.<br />Update: The seller promptly responded and provided a fully functional replacement.

5.0,I ordered 2 beanies  one grey and other black they fit perfect not to tight doesnt hurt your ears after wearing them over a long period of time
5.0,I used these when I had a broken shoulder & couldn’t maneuver a regular bra. This bra goes on very easily. Not much support but that was ok
5.0,Very pretty dress. I’m 5’5” 198 lbs and I got the 2x after reading reviews. It’s a little looser than I expected but I would rather have it slightly loose than too tight. It camouflages my postpartum tummy well. It’s longer than i expected but I like that it looks classy and elegant. The detail on the top is very pretty.
5.0,"Soft, true to size, just as described. Prompt delivery."
5.0,"Nive and warm, functions better than expected. Comfortable and warm."
5.0,"The fabric is soft and fresh. It has the perfect length. It is a little wide, but I guess that's the style. Very comfortable"

5.0,"Comfortable band, very lightweight but doesn't feel fragile"
5.0,I love this shirt. It's feels great!!
5.0,I love this necklace but beware it tangles extremely easy and it's very hard to untangle. So when you are storing it I suggest hanging it on a hook or something. Mine got tangled and it took me like ten minutes to untangle it because of all the chains.
5.0,Me encanto!! La tela es riquísima y me encanto el largo y las bolsas a los lados!!

5.0,"When I got the bag, I thought this bag was going to be bigger. When I got it, I was like this is the prefect size that I have been waiting for. It is able to hold my tablet that I have plus still gots enough room for whatever else that I need. I love how it is cotton canvas and not like how others are. I love all of the multi-function the pockets have.You can place your water bottle, cell phone, pens, cards, books, note books, and lab top.

5.0,"I have purchased other 'large' masks, but they have always been too small for my very tall son's face. The length from the nose to the chin was always too short. This one fits well without sliding up and we will be purchasing this item from now on. Thank you."
5.0,"These sunglasses are very lightweight and comfortable.  The lenses are great.  They do not have flexible hinges, but for what they cost I can live with that."

5.0,Amazon needs to stop making right a review just give stars.
5.0,"Product<br />Today I will be discussing the Besteel 8 pcs 18G stainless steel lip rings. I have been searching online for so long to find the “right” kind of lip rings to make my Monroe piercing beautiful. I absolutely LOVE my Monroe piercing and when I saw these online and I HAD to get them to match my style!<br /><br />Compare Similar Products<br />I saw these lip rings online and decided to give it a try. In the past, I have tried many different 18G stainless steel lip rings, however, many of them were either too long, too short, or just not right. They never really suited me, however, and they never seemed quite as pretty as this product. I was a little hesitant at first to make the purchase, however, I am glad that I did. I ordered it online. The package arrived super fast. As soon as I opened the package, I became super excited!<br /><br />How Long Using Product<br />I have been wearing this beautiful lip ring for about two weeks now, and I am SO HAPPY with it! It is simply delightful to wear, and I have received so many compliments about the lip ring and its beautiful diamond. It completely matches my style. I liked the fact that there were 8pcs to the order, because I have trouble losing my lip rings!<br /><br />Why I liked It<br />The reasons why I liked this product are many. I liked the product from the first time that I opened the package. I was so excited to wear the lip ring! I have received so many compliments about it.<br /><br />Identify Specific Attributes<br />Specifically, I liked the diamond color. The color is gorgeous, and I love how much it matches my style. Having more than one lip ring helps me in case I loose one! Design is really cute too! VERY PLEASED!"
5.0,My son & husband LOVE them  gonna buy more when small bottoms comes back in stock . I like that they can be bought in mixed sizes .We all aren't all one size .it's great to get..medium tops & small bottoms .
5.0,I used this to hold a container of pepper spray gel. I feel safer because I'm ready to protect myself if needed and the lanyard keeps the gel handy around my neck.
5.0,Much better quality than I anticipated! Will more than likely buy again in another color!
5.0,I wear a 40 DD so i ordered an xl. It fits perfect. Just gotta get rid of some fat. Im 5'5 190 lbs. Order xl . U may can order large if u have smaller breast.

5.0,Love love love!!! Simply beautiful especially for a date in a warm weather setting. Great buy! ❤️❤️❤️
5.0,"Plenty roomy to store all your stuff and use as a wallet and a cross body, clutch or wristlet.  Looks very expensive and leather is a nice quality.  It easily expands because of the softness of the leather but keeps everything safe inside."
5.0,"I had LASIK surgery two years ago, and recently I have found myself missing the fun of accessorizing with glasses. I wanted a bigger frame, but nothing too big that they looked fake. These. Are. Perfect. Goal achieved! They are the perfect proportion and very high quality...whenever my eyes worsen again and I need glasses I plan on taking these frames to my eye doctor and getting prescriptions put in. LOVE!"
5.0,Has every spring you'll ever need for a watchband fix. Well organized. Be careful when opening so that the sticker is facing up not down or else your springs will be everywhere in the case. Five stars for value/quality.
5.0,Great quality and a lot of pockets
5.0,At first seemed small for an adult but it takes some adjusting to line the shoulders up and then making the catch basin. Once all that’s done then cutting and cleaning was easy peasy 😊
5.0,Truly rich color.
5.0,"I have one word to describe these socks, FANTASTIC!  I spent about 6 hours outdoors this weekend clearing snow from my driveway, deck and sidewalks.  While most of my body was wet from perspiration, my feet were dry, warm and comfortable.  I like my EchoGorge socks so much I am going to buy more as gifts for my family and fellow lovers of the outdoors.<br />In addition to a great and comfortable fit, I love that EchoGorge manufactures in the USA, sources locally and is environmentally conscious.<br />Great product & a great company!"
5.0,Appears to be MUCH more expensive than it is.  If I could I'd give it 10 stars. I buy cheap watches because at work I destroy them. I'm ordering 3 more
5.0,A little too big for my wife. Order a size smaller than your actual size.
5.0,"JUST BUY THE SHOES! They are so comfortable and cute, they by far exceeded my expectations."
5.0,"super cute, high quality 😊 i really like them!"
5.0,This beanie fits very well. Leaves plenty of slouch room to hang off of the head. Great buy!
5.0,cute. nice quality.
5.0,They looked adorable on her feet
5.0,"I love this backpack already! I have 3 kanken minis and this backpack is easily my favorite, for $25 and actual pockets inside and it fits my 40oz Hydroflask and iPad Pro, it’s very versatile and the quality is outstanding."
5.0,Vey good quality for the money.
5.0,Who wants to deal with a big cooler? Or those cheap white styrofoam things? Not me. I finally broke down and bought the flip-box classic. Just what I was looking for! And can be used without ice. Great product.
5.0,"Great quality, looks better than the pictures. Heavy duty, rugged, I see why it's called biker jewelry!"
5.0,I have these in a 00g and I’m stretching my second hole to a 2g and knew these would be perfect for my ears.
5.0,I've never tried a front closing bra until now.  It's supportive and comfortable.  I'll never buy a back closing bra again!
5.0,I love this swimsuit. Nothing shows too much or too little. I have a large chest so I usually have an issue keeping everything tucked inside. Used this for an indoor waterpark and it managed to pass the &#34;no slip&#34; test. Fit perfectly everywhere else and gave me a cute look. :)
5.0,"So cute. Perfect for summer concerts and lake days. Also, cant beat the price"
5.0,It perfectly matches the cloth I first used it with and people did commend on it. It’s unique and easy to fit in
5.0,Great price for costume. It was the right size for a tall youth.
5.0,"I love gloves like this for working around the house and yard. I don’t have great finger strength so I wear them if I need to lift something heavy. They’re also great while woodworking to avoid splinters and to help with grip on power tools. I actually wear these instead of winter gloves, too, because I hate bulky winter gloves. However these have no insulation, as mentioned in the listing. They still offer an extra thin layer to break the cold, and the rubber palm and fingers let you still easily grip a dog leash. They are super flexible and you can do basically anything you’d do without gloves on. I was shocked at how good the touch screen capability was. Normally I am putzing around in gloves trying to get the screen to turn on, but with these it’s like I wasn’t even wearing anything. I definitely recommend these! I measured my hand and ordered based on the size chart. They fit true to size."
5.0,The fabric and the fit are perfect.  In love with it.
5.0,"This was for college-aged daughter who was going on grad school interviews and meetings.<br />She said it worked perfectly, and it looks of decent quality leather."
5.0,"This dress is everything I wanted it to be and more. The price was great. It’s form fitting, figure hugging, shimmery, and sexy. The material is not the softest but it wasn’t an issue at all, it was still very comfortable. It’s lightweight but not see through. It was perfect. Now, the slit was a bit higher than I would typically go (I eventually sewed it a to close it a few inches) Other than that, I loved it so much that I’m going to get it in black as well. I’m 5’8, 180lbs, typically size 12-14 and I got an XL and the fit was perfect. Wore it to my friends wedding and had some many compliments. Love it."
5.0,The blouse is well made of a very good quality material.  I am well satisfied with this shirt.
5.0,Makes great necklaces
5.0,"I love the bracelet this is well made, head turner and it feels good on the wrist. I would encourage anyone contemplating on purchasing just go ahead it’s a dope bracelet"
5.0,"Love this hat, it's perfect."
5.0,Very soft. But elastic can be a little tight.
5.0,Beautiful. Exactly what I wanted to fit with my star of David.
5.0,Use it in class last night and I love it. Thank you
5.0,"These have been my favorite pair of sunnies for quite some time now.  They are so unique and chic, turning heads everywhere I go."

5.0,Love this soft & warm jacket. So glad there’s no hood!
5.0,Light weight and cooling to wear during a hard workout. Fit is just as expected.
5.0,Our town hosts a Halloween parade every year. This years theme was cartoons. Our church made a 12 foot television and had our Awana clubbers inside wearing cartoon masks that I bought on Amazon. It was very cute!
5.0,So stinking cute I have a little boy coming in October and I can't wait until he can wear this!! A little big but it's for bedtime snuggling anyway
5.0,Live thisbag! Not too bigbut not too small. The blue is delicious!

5.0,Bought this as a Birthday gift for my Husband and he absolutely liked it. He is a big fan of Ancient Aliens.
5.0,I keep this in my car as it is small and cute.  I like that it folds into such a small and compact size.  The material is great quality and I liked the pink color.  Great small umbrella!!
5.0,"Amazing buy. Use as my everyday work purse. Professional, pretty and solid for carrying everything. Perfect size. Careful not to leave on carpet for example it will pick up the color on it. Just bought one for my sister too."
5.0,Bought this for my husband as a gift. He absolutely loves it.
5.0,Item was very well done and a perfect size.
5.0,"Super high quality jacket! I love the material and weight of it, super sporty. Big fan of jackets with thumb holes. Fits perfectly, and I will be wearing this to the gym often! Could not be happier. A must have active wear staple."
5.0,Made strap on hero masks adjustable. Worked great!
5.0,"I love this bathing suit, it is so perfect! I've had two kids via c-section so my stomach is definitely not flattering. I weigh 140lbs and ordered a medium. The waist goes high enough to cover my problem areas and looks great."
5.0,Clever design.  Folds down to a 50 cent piece size for storage.
5.0,Fits great. Definitely buy these again.
5.0,My husband says they are comfortable .
5.0,I’ve been looking for an outfit for my 8 month old son to wear to a wedding- I’ve had a terrible time trying to find pants and tops to fit due to stiff and unforgiving materials. This is PERFECT! It has some stretch to it and is such a nice quality! The top has a button closure in the bottom and love that it’s a onesie style. The suspenders are removable as well. I bought a bow tie and bam- my son looks so handsome in this and most of all he will be comfortable! I described this as a little too small as the 12 month size fits my son and he’s considered an average sized 8 month old. He currently fits in other Carter’s clothing that are 9 months in size.
5.0,"I love the band, it’s been 3 months and it looks like new, totally recommend this product."
5.0,"Great quality, fast shipping, larger than expected. This is by far one of the best shemagh I've purchased online. Nice packaging as well!"
5.0,This is such a beautiful accessory to add to your wardrobe. It can dress up a plain t-shirt in an instant. It also makes a very nice gift especially for someone who has everything. Definitely unique and special.
5.0,Good fit and very comfortable. Good value
5.0,I think these are a steal based on the price. They are super cute. I love them.
5.0,Product replaced worn out band. Good value
5.0,"This bag is the perfect overnight or weekend travel bag.  It hold so much!  It's cute, nicely made, I love it!"
5.0,"Bought them as an additional layer of warmth when worn as liners with my military issue cold weather mittens. Kept my hands toasty warm and I didn't have to remove all the layers when needing more dexterity, just fold back the pocket, which attaches to a Velcro tab and your in business. Well priced too."
5.0,"Rated somewhat small, as all gymnastics leotards are supposed to be. My daughter normally wears a size 5 and is tall/slim. Ordered a 6/7 and fits perfectly."
5.0,Fit as expected. Looks exactly like the photo. Material is super comfy and the sleeves really make it a lil somethin’ extra. Love this shirt!

5.0,Got these for our trip to Disneyland! Worked great! They were too mug for my kids 8 and younger but perfect for I would say age 10+
5.0,"Works perfectly for my needs.  I am nearsighted and cannot anymore read with my glasses.  This does the trick easily and simply when I need to read.<br /><br />Keeps me from laying my glasses down and possibly losing them.  Excellent product which simply does a great service with no fuss, no bother."
5.0,Always have to order an XL in these.  But love them anyway.
5.0,"Bought these for my son. Very light weight. Runs big. I would get a size smaller. Overall, we are pleased."
5.0,loved this hat
5.0,"These sunglasses look amazing and given the price I don’t mind using these daily, without the risk of damaging one of my expensive ray bans. Bear in mind, these aren’t the highest quality, so expect the hinges to be not smooth. Not sure how long these would last - my expectation is only one summer and that’s that"
5.0,I really love It so I went and order 3 more. The band could use a little more length but beautiful product. It arrived ahead of time.
5.0,Love it.. can even hang around the house in it all day (weekend)  and not have to run to get dressed if someone shows up..

5.0,Good quality and very flattering. I purchased the pink shade which look very girly perfect for beach days with girlfriends.
5.0,The USB cord comes with it does not work I have to get a new USB cord for it to work I thought it didn’t work but I have to try multiple device which the USB came with my product but when I get a new USB cord it finally charge and it is working so I would like you guys to send me a new USB cord please
5.0,Love these!  Own 5 pairs

5.0,"I work out 6 days a week, liked them well enough to order another 3 pack to make a full set."
5.0,"Edit to Add: After my initial review,the company contacted me about my broken bracelet offering immediate replacement. The bracelet was replaced free of charge along with a token gift. Amazing customer service!<br />This company truly does back up their products and that impresses me.<br /><br />Broke 1st day wearing it! The cord frayed and now Im out of a bracelet. Sadly, this was beautiful but didnt hold up."
5.0,Product as described. Comfortable.
5.0,replaced a pair of angel earrings that had broken!
5.0,beautiful  great product looks exactly like pictures
5.0,"This is a cute true to character gown. My three year old daughter wears this as a dress up dress not a night gown. It has an elastic waist band in the middle to be a fitted look to the top half of the gown. She loves this and lives in it. My only complaint is that the glitter on the top overlay on the skirt sheds pretty heavily. So glitter all around, small price to pay for her excitement as she twirls around the house. Very good quality well made and the price point is super affordable. Retail MSRP is $38.00 I paid around $15.00."
5.0,Great socks- Xmas present for my girl!
5.0,nice watch! got what I wanted.  All features work unlike others that are just glued.. would buy this watch or from this brand again
5.0,"Great price for a large selection of brightly-colored keychains. Lots of uses at home and while traveling. We take some on vacation - everyone gets their own color - to keep track of room/locker/car, etc. keys, mark bags (or drinks!), keep towels rolled up, etc."
5.0,Now I am Mark Zuck.<br /><br />So get zucced.
5.0,Good material. Nice design and the phone pocket is a nice touch
5.0,I have so much room in this wallet I'm still getting used to all the compartments.  The color is just what I was looking for (easy to find in my BIG handbag)!
5.0,"Super soft material , washed it a few times hasn’t shrunk kept its softness."
5.0,Love it. It has a nice glossy shine. Very light. Can be warn under a bigger coat in the cold weather.
5.0,Absolutely love this ring. Made with sturdy quality. Fits perfectly. Shipping was super fast! Very happy with this buy all around!
5.0,"It’s a different style than I’m used to, but I love these shirts for spin class. I sweat a lot (I produce a lake under my bike) and these shirts never feel like they get stuck to me and I never feel like I’m going to overheat.  They’ve been through the wash at least a dozen times each without any noticeable change. This is my second set of these. After the first set, I bought a second set because I like them so much and they are my go-to shirt for spin class now. Love that they come in 3-packs."
5.0,It fits good and has no wires.  I don't really see a down side.
5.0,"I use this purse when I am going out in a crowd or when I go to our local casino.  I keep it across my body so I don't leave it when I move around.  It is just large enough to carry my wallet, cell phone, a small hand sanitizer bottle, and my car keys.  I love it!"
5.0,This was the first time buying these charms and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I think that they are very good quality.  Now I just have to find room in the charm necklace for it.
5.0,Very pretty & look much more expensive than what I paid!
5.0,Well made quick delivery
5.0,Great piece of low cost jewelry. My wife loves it
5.0,Got them for my boyfriend as a lil gift and I think he liked them :) came as described and on time.
5.0,I wore this to a wedding. The shoulder straps are super cute and I received a lot of compliments! Danced in this dress for hours!
5.0,I can't wait for fall to be here so I can wear this. It is so perfect for my steampunk outfit and for everyday wear. Sturdy construction and durable. Overall the perfect jacket for me.
5.0,"Sparkly, perfection."
5.0,Love these pants.  Just ordered more in different colors.
5.0,Absolutely great quality fabric.  I ordered another dress from this seller due to very nice dress
5.0,Good quality and it fit me just right. I wish the fake pockets were real.
5.0,The pants are very long. I'm 5ft 5in and the pants go past the tips of my toes. I don't mind. They feel great and well made. Surprised with how well they were packaged. Plastic zip-lock like bag in a mailer.
5.0,Not too bulky. Fits a triple combination just right. I bought two for my teenage sons. Wish it came in a few more colors.
5.0,I am a Disney fanatic and these are nice earrings.  Well made and the bling is great!  I would definitely recommend them to any Disney fan!
5.0,These exceeded my expectations! A great variety of colors and styles!
5.0,Nice top fits well. Thank you
5.0,love it my daughter is very happy with it
5.0,"Want an easy dress up play set! This is it. Super easy to get on and off. The 4 year old I bought this for immediately put it on at the pizza place! The braid fell apart slightly, but she just started putting the flowers in her own hair and did start to unravel the braid. If you do have a toddler that wants to unravel the braid... it doesn't go back. lol"
5.0,"Finally a steel toe work sock that doesn't squeeze your ankle to death.  The old Dickies were great and after a few years, they got it right again."
5.0,"Haven't used these for long, but love the XL black pair I purchased. I have another pair of Warmen gloves that I've used for years. I love this new style. Can be left on and not have to worry about taking on & off to use your iPhone. Wish had option for tan for playing golf as black gets hot out in the sun. I refused to buy plastic golf gloves, so use these instead. Red is too bright for me but good color to get if tend to lose gloves, so you can find them. My kids keep borrowing them, so will need to get them some pairs too. Snap stays securely fastened. Well made. I got the XL large and my hands are large, with ring sizes (index to pinky): 8, 8.5, 6.5, 5, with a 9.5 thumb. The XL fit perfectly."
5.0,"I bought this costume for a friends 1920's wedding, and I was pleasantly surprised when it fit perfectly!!!"
5.0,"Bought these for my Dad who was prescribed compression stockings for his swollen legs that are losing circulation and quite painful.  He is a larger man and I was concerned these would be too small for him but they fit perfect - they are much easier to get on than the ones he was fitted for and paid hundreds of dollars for.  His only complaint is that these seem to get tighter around his toes as he walks, but overall he is very pleased and have helped tremendously with the swelling and pain."
5.0,Very cute hat for frenchie lovers. Love the little puff coming out of the rear end. So frenchie🤣
5.0,"These pants are nice, comfortable great to lounge in or run an errand.  I would recommend these."
5.0,"Amazingly comfortable,  fits and hangs great,  just like the picture. I'm buying more colors! Not too hot, not too cool... great shirt!"
5.0,"A little tight around the thighs, but I've never had a pair of thigh highs that weren't. Super cute and fit well. For the money, I was expecting these to feel much thinner, but was pleasantly surprised that they felt much thicker than I anticipated. (I was expecting them to be almost pantyhose thin)."
5.0,"Sleeves are a bit long, but I love these jackets. I got a blue one for my 3 year old and a green one for my 5 year old. We’ve gotten so many compliments on them. They are nice and warm, fleece lined, and perfect material to wash and not stain too easy, water resistant. Perfect for spring time in Duluth MN."
5.0,Great price fit & comfortable to wear!!
5.0,Loved it! Looks amazing
5.0,"I have this fabric and another one. They fit my head perfectly. Recommend not drying in the dryer for best results. My head is 56cm, and I have long, medium thick hair. I put it in a low bun and I’m good to go for 10 plus hours."
5.0,awesome product.  quality material. luv tge vibrant purple coloring and I look great while cooking his favorite meal!
5.0,"Fast shipping, good quality & excellent customer service. Thanks"
5.0,Great price.  Great product.  Wife loved it.
5.0,This fit really well. Kid loved it.
5.0,Got for my granddaughters 6 th birthday party which theme was little mermaid.  She loved the dress.  It twirls and material is soft.  Washes well.  She even uses it as a swim cover up plus wear as a nice dress.  Good purchase
5.0,I bought these neck bandanas for my husband to use while surf fishing when it’s cool. He has used them for covid masks as well.
5.0,"LOVE this dress. I'm a short, curvy, large chested woman (5'2&#34;, 155 lbs, 36G) and this dress is incredibly flattering on me. The material is lightweight but not see through, and is very comfortable. It would be a good summer dress, but I work in a classroom that runs hot so I want to be able to layer in the winter months. I wear this with leggings and a cardigan and it's adorable with boots. I usually hang my clothes to dry so they last longer and don't shrink or fade, but I accidentally ran this through the dryer and it came out just fine. Because I have a large chest this dress (like almost all others on me ) shows a lot of cleavage, but I'm used to layering with a cami for coverage. I loved this dress so much I bought 2 more when the price dropped to $12 each (WHAT?!). A total bargain and I'm considering buying it in every color. I typically wear anywhere between a medium and XL in dresses, but usually a large. This fit true to size as a large."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!  Bright colors and durable!  Can cut into any size!
5.0,Is exactly what I was looking for...
5.0,Excellent item  I am so happy  Love it  I will recommend

5.0,I absolutely love this piece. I was a show stopper!! The colors hit well and it was a good stretch. Buy it and feel sexy
5.0,I was allergic necklaces gave me a rash
5.0,"I read some customer reviews before I purchased this bag, so I was expecting a good deal. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this roll-on for the price! I was expecting more like a &#34;ThirtyOne&#34; brand quality, but this was so much better- better quality and durability with just as cute of a pattern!<br />I purchased it recently for a weekend conference trip to Baltimore, I rolled that poor suitcase everywhere! Over a few days it made several trips through town, down stairs, the conference center, across a dirty parking garage.... It held up very well and still looks as good as new. I let a friend borrow it for a trip and she loved it so much she ordered one for herself.<br />It was very roomy and fit several days of clothing, toiletries, and a large make-up bag. A GREAT weekender bag!<br />I'm going to take it as a carry-on for an overseas trip soon, it fits carry-on requirements for my airlines. I'm excited about taking this great little suitcase on another adventure!"
5.0,Cute product for young girl
5.0,"This shirt is perfect!  It's soft, comfy and can be dressed up or worn casually.  I haven't lost my baby weight so my stomach is a problem area for me and the flow and drape of this shirt is perfect to camouflage that!  I'm going to order one in every color :)"
5.0,These worked well with my swollen foot and ankle
5.0,I ordered a large and these fit me perfectly and are a nice level of warm under snow pants for riding snowmobile. A bit too warm to wear under scrubs at work however.
5.0,"nice jeans, but I order the wrong size."
5.0,"I love these socks. They are super comfortable and hold up. I've tried a number of higher end wool socks but they always start to fall apart after a year or so. I bought the six pack recently, but I have some older pairs that are 3+ years old. They have a little bit of discoloration but have maintain their shape and padding better than anything else"
5.0,"I'm absolutely thrilled with my Deerstalker Cap!  The tweed is Harris, which IMO, is the best there is.  The size is true, and is quality made.  I look forward to years of use of this fine hat."
5.0,"Beautiful bathing suit, my only complaint is that it runs a little small, but I still love this bathing suit. Good quality! So many compliments!"
5.0,They were perfect and better than expected!
5.0,"Great as usual for Hurley Alpha shorts. The length is above the knee which I like. I am 5’7” and wear an XL. It is hard to find nice shorts above the knee. Very fitted throughout, not baggy like typical shorts. Almost board short feel but nice short look."
5.0,Love them! !!
5.0,"fits nice , love the length ordered another"
5.0,Just as described.  It is more of a mustard color than BRIGHT yellow.  Absolutely perfect size for business.

5.0,"Absolutely adorable!! My new favorite dress. Fit great, super comfortable, and knee length so not too short! Definitely worth the price"
5.0,"LOVE them!!! Pants and leggings are really hard to find just because of my heavier lower half. These fit amazingly and I love the small pocket at the top for my gym key. They're light and breathable, but you can't see through them!! My one thing is that they attract my cat's fur like CRAZY! I don't mind lint rolling though, they're worth it!"
5.0,Just what I wanted !!
5.0,"I really like this shoes. Light, excellent fit, wide toe box and zero drop. I hope they will have more colors soon."
5.0,They are a bit snug but unlike other products that are similar this one is a nice material and very comfortable Imusemthem all the time for my workouts

5.0,"i bought two of these chokers sets for my niece and god daughter, they loveddddd it ! so did i ! very pretty for young teenage girls and adults can style these chokers as well. Overall these are a real pretty set &#60;3"
5.0,Exactly what I needed to update liners in my nursing Bravado bras. Great fit and shape.
5.0,These are so cute and super cozy! They look cute with tall boots or ankle boots also with moccasins and leggings or skinny jeans!
5.0,"EXCELLENT QUALITY, SAME WITH PICS"
5.0,The bands fit really well on my wrist and the watch was easy to get on. I have been using the same color for a couple of months and their band has not broken.
5.0,This key chain makes my simple key fob looks stylish. I’m always getting compliments.
5.0,"This is one of the better reader deals I've seen on Amazon. For 15 dollars you get five very decent quality blue blocking readers.  The blue blocking works well.  The readers have nice thick frames and come in a variety of colors.  They open and close very smoothly. There  is no spring on these, so after a while , we shall see about wearing out.  They don't scratch easily.  I see quite well with the 200X that I need for reading. Comes in a simple cardboard box along with five soft glass bags for each pair. A GREAT deal!!"
5.0,"The gloves fits my hands perfectly, and the inside feels comfortable. Because it is made by leather, so there is no need to worry about using smartphone with gloves on."
5.0,Very nice!  Looks as advertised. Good buy.
5.0,Wonderful quality for the price
5.0,"I weigh 240lbs and I'm 5'7&#34; with most of it in my hips and chest. I bought the 2xl and it was a little small in the chest for me but some extra buttons will close that pulling space right up. It's comfy and I don't get bunched up in the middle or feel like a whale. I feel sexy, confident and smart. I highly recommend this dress for any woman who wants a vintage, classy look."
5.0,It fits well and looks nice!
5.0,"Just for fun I showed this watch to several friends after it came in and asked them how much they thought I bought it for without telling them. I got answers ranging from $50-$200. Obviously the band material isn't super high quality, but you could switch that out if you wanted. Overall, a really fancy looking watch for an insanely low price."
5.0,purchased this for my gf.  She loves it! wears it everyday and it keeps her pretty head percectly warm and snug.  id recommend this for all!
5.0,"These are my new favorite earrings! And for such a good deal! The wood isn't cheap at all, so they are a little heavy, but that's to be expected. I get so many compliments when I wear them!"
5.0,Excellent quality mask. Stays on and very comfy. Does not ride up to the eyes which a lot of kids masks do. Very well made. I really recommend.
5.0,Pleased with the order .👌👍
5.0,The reviews were all over on whether the sizing was correct. I took a chance on whether the medium was the right size. The medium fit my 32 inch waist perfectly.
5.0,Great they worked perfect for what I needed them for
5.0,This is very cute! It’s not too big and not too small. I love the silk in the inside. It really protects my hair. Some days I use it as a bonnet for bed when I can’t find mine since it has the silk in the inside.
5.0,"I have three of these in different colors (beige, green and purple). These are my FAVORITE workout tops for running and lifting. Loose, light and flattering to the body! Perfect for spring and summer."
5.0,"Just what I needed! Fine for the best plaques despite what your commander says. ""No XO that's a dumb idea. That's the ugliest plaque I've ever seen."" Ignore advice and gaslight your boss with this fine mini rigger pin!"
5.0,Perfect fit. Nice quality
5.0,Nice quality; will last long time
5.0,[[VIDEOID:25d6e277bee614504f26b0ac779a3651]] Cute and can wear as a workout top too. This is a small.
5.0,Perfect fit for me. Great for working out or just a casual outfit.
5.0,Perfect... fabulous
5.0,"This was for my man and he loves this sweater.  I love how it looks on him.<br /><br />PRO: Super comfortable. He says that he usually has a hard time fitting - he has muscles, etc (or he's just bragging), but says this is comfortable... perfect fit. Washes well, dries well. No noticeable shrinking, etc.<br /><br />Con: Nothing according to him.<br /><br />Verdict: Recommend!<br /><br />I pride myself on accurate, honest, helpful reviews"
5.0,Great and easy to get on and remove
5.0,Fit is true to size.  Baggy in the right way.
5.0,The filters fit perfectly inside & fits great over your face. The fabric isn’t constricting around your neck or face. Love these!!
5.0,I am 5'7 and weigh 136lbs. I ordered a small and it fits perfect.
5.0,I used it for a costume and it worked great. Not cheap material. Very durable. ...
5.0,"I love this bag, it's super nice!"
5.0,"It's a very nice piece my only problem is that it is a little big with all of the links and then too small when I remove a link, so I just wear it higher on my arm to fit."
5.0,Comfy style and fit!
5.0,Was worried about the length but it was perfect
5.0,Good quality! I like the socks a lot.
5.0,I like how durable it is with me have a 9 mos old it gets pulled on a lot

5.0,This is gorgeous.  It looks even better in person and will look great with the outfit I have chosen to wear.
5.0,So adorable! Home run on this one
5.0,"Not a drop of water in my eyes and never fogged - I have used many different brands, but these are fantastic!"
5.0,This is so soft an luxurious that it is hard to beat.  Wears well and takes many washings in stride.  Definitely worth the money over other brands.
5.0,The packaging is beautiful.. Jewelry Box is classic.. they are beautiful. They are a bit smaller than I thought they would be..but truly beautiful..
5.0,The product is very nice.
5.0,Good for work safety glasses and other glasses
5.0,perfect fit.  And soft
5.0,xmas
5.0,They fit great. She did not want to take them off.
5.0,"I love it, fits a little loose but I had it altered. Will be purchasing another one soon."
5.0,Wife really loved this.  Very nice and good value for the money.
5.0,"I bought this bracelet for myself after I had ordered some for friends for Christmas.  I was surprised at the quality for the price.  The beeds are tiny which makes the bracelet very dainty.  This bracelet is perfect for layering with other bracelets.  Everyone I gave them too really liked them, also.  I've purchased many of these bracelets in various colors and I highly recommend them."
5.0,"Love this shirt! Nice material, so comfy and soft. I ordered in two different colors and the size and fit are consistent."
5.0,"This just arrived and will be perfect for traveling. It's really soft and fits under jackets, sweaters, and long sleeves. I don't carry a purse or even a backpack in most of the places I travel for fear of being robbed. This fits easily on my wrist under my jacket sleeve and will hold hotel room key, cash, and credit cards. If you are a traveler, you will find this to be much more comfortable than a money belt."
5.0,"These slippers are super cute, super soft and great for a summer slipper around the house!  Can't beat the price either! I'm thinking about stocking up on a few different ones just to have to give as a cute hostess gift or have a spare if needed!"
5.0,Fit perfect. Great colors and flattering.
5.0,"Sometimes I throw on the hood to the black one and tell new gym members ""good, let the hate flow through you, embrace the power of the dark side"".<br />Yes, I'm a gym rat and a dork."
5.0,I love these compression socks! I tried Pro compression and they were tighter than the Nurse Mates but these fit more comfortably and do the job. I love that they don’t have a stitched design so the thread doesn’t dig into my legs!
5.0,Very pretty pattern!
5.0,"I'm a 12.5 w/xw, which don't exist. Knowing that Sperry's tend to run long I took a chance on a 12W.  These could be the tiniest bit wider but are reasonably comfortable new and will stretch.  Great looking shoe at a great price."
5.0,"Nice, thick fabric. Well made"
5.0,"I got this for my niece’s 5th birthday and she LOVES IT! The legs are a little long so we had to cuff them, but that will give her room to use it for a while. She’s gotten really good at bring her stuffed animals to life."
5.0,"Honestly, I thought this case was going to be hard leather but it was actually soft and it has a belt loop that I didn't realize it had so I'm super pleased with it."
5.0,"I bought these for my car as I am always losing sunglasses, they are a real bargain"
5.0,Good quality materials. fits my 7 5/8 head. Am pleased with the hat.
5.0,These are my favorite pants for work!
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for and I LOVE that my phone fits in the side pocket! Any other clutch wallet I had was either too small to hold my phone or too big and bulky. This is perfect.
5.0,I ordered these to hold our goggles we are wearing in the ER. They are perfect!
5.0,Most comfortable hat.  My husband loves it for golfing and keeping cool.
5.0,"Works great has tons of storagw and is able to be packed tight, really on long stalks I forget it is there!"
5.0,"I ordered a size up, due to reviews I had read.  However, the next size up are really too big and too long for my granddaughter.  I would advise to order your normal size.  They are very cute and well made socks, and my granddaughter will grow into them eventually.  I bought them to wear with her boots, to keep the top of her boots from rubbing her leg.  They will work well for that."
5.0,I finally found headbands to fit my daughters small head.  She was 5 lbs 5 ounces after being home a few weeks.
5.0,A little bigger than I expected but cute and well made
5.0,These are the best masks I have tried. The material is comfortable and the ear loops are adjustable.  I like the removable filter option too.
5.0,My daughters Spanish teacher absolutely love this! Makes a great holiday gift for a teacher.
5.0,I love my new skirt. Especially the pockets.  I like the feel of the fabric as well.
5.0,Arrived on time and displayed in it's case beautifully!
5.0,I mean I’m pretty new at buying these leotards and tbh I actually loved the quality of it. Have washed it a good 4-5 times already and still looks good.
5.0,she loves it but this not what we bought.  there is some sort web mix up here
5.0,If you are in to skulls this is the item you should have in you collection.
5.0,very nice material fits as expected
5.0,"I love these!! I've had them about a year and they are holding up pretty well. The wedge at the heel is starting to get a little loose but nothing a little glue can't fix. My feet do sweat in them a bit, so I usually wear them with ankle socks, and then they're great. I definitely recommend them if you're looking for a casual boot-type heel to wear with jeans and t-shirt or you dress them up a bit with a sweater. Overall a great casual heel."
5.0,"Really nice wallet, nice feel to it.. it really feels like good quality."
5.0,"I'm not sure what makes a good pair of compression pants, I bought these for a Pokemon Go cosplay and they make my butt look amazing so they did what I wanted"
5.0,It’s so comfy. I got the beige. I’m 5’1 115lbs looks great when you add accessories. It’s oversized but you can tie it to fit more snug. Looks great 👌🏽 Good quality for your $
5.0,Great looking and works well under extreme conditions.
5.0,Ordered the large band and it just fits.<br />Wish the large size was larger.
5.0,Bought a new Honda Ridgeline!  Had to have a new hat!
5.0,We love this this watch. Looks great on and works perfectly! Glad we made the purchase.
5.0,Dramatically better than the other watch bracelet block I purchased. Worth the cost.
5.0,Love this dress. It is so comfortable and love the design
5.0,Very nice looking and functional bag.
5.0,"We bought this as a birthday give for our granddaughter.  We are expecting it to be fit as expected, we shall see. I am sure it will look very cute on her.  No issue on the order or delivery of item.  We got it just as expected."
5.0,"These are great for big sunglasses, I always get scratches on mine, so these provide great protection and now I take my sunglasses everywhere."
5.0,I like the watch just wish it had an electric band instead of a plastic one
5.0,So flattering can dress up or pair with jeans! Great purchase!
5.0,This vest is so far so good. The thickness is perfect for San Francisco's winter at home. One side is fleece  which feels very soft and warm. The other side has colorful patterns which looks cute on babies.
5.0,"Ordered a small, but received a medium,  but still fits. Love the cozy and softness of the onesie.  It also has a zipper bottom for easy access to the bathroom!"
5.0,"This is a review for &#34;Allegra K Women Floral Prints 3/4 Raglan Sleeves Paneled Tee Shirt&#34;. This t-shirt is different than the usual t-shirts. The floral print is very pretty and the sleeves are nice too. The raglan sleeves are made of spandex and the rest of the t-shirt is made of polyester. The fit is as expected. This is my seventh purchase from Allegra K and the sizes are not Asian, they are US sizes. Its better to order your own size and not larger than what is needed. I washed this t shirt in the hottest setting of my dryer and it came out without any change. No wrinkles or no shrinkage. This item is not prime eligible, however it was delivered in almost the same time it takes for prime eligible items delivery. I love this t-shirt.  Will definitely buy more from Allegra K (uxcell)."
5.0,beautiful dress. so comfy.
5.0,Beautiful well fitting blouse The lace is lovely and covers nicely This is not cheapy looking
5.0,"Purchased them for long bike rides to keep the dust and bugs out of my eyes and they work beautifully for that. Very easy to change lenses and the product seems strong and substantial. There are no adjustments for fitting but the nose piece is comfortable and the tension of the frames on each side was perfect for me. They do not  slide up or down with perspiration which is a great plus when riding on hot days.<br />All in all I would highly recommend them based on my experience. Don't know if I will ever use all the lenses provided but they may come in handy, especially the polarized lens when fishing at the  shore."
5.0,"I gave these out to trick-or-treaters for Halloween, they were a HUGE hit.  a few out of every bag didn't work, but for the price, I wasn't too concerned, they were well worth what I paid and the kids loved them."
5.0,Love this. Soft material and very comfortable. I will be buying more.
5.0,"They work great for keeping rolls of stabilizer from unwrapping.  Would work for gift wrap rolls as well.  I liked the ruler design on them, but it seems pointless because the ruler markings end up on the inside and can’t be seen when in use."
5.0,Very nice fit comfortable and soothing
5.0,My daughter loves them!  They stick on really well!  They can usually last all day!
5.0,"These were not shoes, they were sunglasses, I can say they block the sun out of your eyes very good. I like them a lot."
5.0,"Good weight, not flimsy.  Perfect for my active daughter."
5.0,It's thick. Well made!
5.0,"Dress is great quality & fits great. I’m 5’3’’ & 165 lbs & the medium fits great. I wanted it a little more tight fitting than the large, but it has a lot of stretch so I’m glad I ordered medium! You can button it up for more of a modest or business/office look or unbutton it for a more sexy look. You can still see the button tho when you do this, so I took a needle & thread & tacked the button under & secured it so it’s sexier for date night. When I’m done, I’ll cut the thread so I can button it up if needed & repeat if I wear it on date night again. Ultimately a black button would’ve worked better for this so you can’t see it, but it only took a min to sew it under so you can see it. The dress feels great, looks great & is very good quality. Happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"This is a excellent t shirt ordered a large same size I've worn for years and fits perfectly, washed it and fits the same as it went in already ordered a couple of more."
5.0,"the leggings are a little baggy around the ankles, but otherwise this costume is perfect!  I wore this all day in Disneyland on Halloween last year and it was comfortable and fun."
5.0,Really adorable hair clips.  I bought them for a gift and the recipient loved them.
5.0,Useful for venous stasis; also you can actually get them on; some elastic stockings are SO supportive they’re impossible to get on
5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend. She loves emotion. So this was perfect. There were tears! As a guy I thought it was cheap looking. She corrected me very quickly. This was a tremendous success! I’m so happy I bought it.
5.0,Beautiful and really pushes up the girls but order a number size larger.. I'm a 36a and probably needed more like a 38a for it to be comfy
5.0,Cute little camera that were a great addition to my keychains! Love them and will probably order more.
5.0,"I loooove these leggings!! You’re very functional, especially for the amount of working out I do and CrossFit!<br />They fit perfectly, especially on my butt.<br />I bought 3 pairs!!"
5.0,"I thought this was going to fit too tight and crawl as I walked but its very comfortable and stays in place -- so far. I haven't worn it out, Ive just tried it on and now I don't want to take it off because it feels like a great nighty. It's good to sleep in too."
5.0,"Very, very happy with this bag.  Exactly as advertised to be.  Great quality, too."
5.0,"Comfortable, great fit!"
5.0,Do a damned good job of putting holes in skin. Just make sure you're surrounded by something soft in case you pass out.
5.0,This product is absolutely amazing! Fits as expected! Most definitely true to size! I’m 5’8 and 105 pounds. So it’s hard for me to find pants that fit. But these fit perfectly!
5.0,"Love this, purchased in 2 colors, needed to tighten straps. I wear with a bralette which looks super cute"
5.0,"This is an excellent hat!<br />Made of durable canvas like/ denim materials.<br />It is adjustable.<br />Emblem is stitched on.<br />Hat was delivered with great shape.<br />Excellent quality hat.<br />Color is a solid, non-faded black.<br />It is your classic style baseball cap/hat with a plastic adjustable head piece.<br />I got this hat for my teenage son.<br />He is currently is obsessed with Pokémon Go.<br />He is getting lots of compliments on this hat too!<br />My hope is that sharing my opinion, perspective, and actual experiences with products I use in my everyday life can greatly benefit others as they make their own purchasing decisions. There have been so many purchases I have made that I should have checked reviews for first because disappointedly, I discovered the hard way that it didn't live up to expectations or advertisements. Now as a consumer, I always look to the reviews and reflect on what is said. Especially for larger purchases. It is so rewarding to find great products that live up to expectations and advertisements.<br />I did receive this item free to try out and give my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Great size. The red is a beautiful rich red.
5.0,VERY STRONG. LOVE THEM!
5.0,"Love the fit...length and style is awesome. It's good that the material is stretchy, on that note panty lines may be visible. It is quite thin material so wear your best body shaper if you're not quite where you want to be yet like me lol.... Some reviews mentioned the side splits being too high and the neckline plunge too low. Personally, I have no issues with either. Can't wait to wear on vacation!!"
5.0,"The only negative is that I wish it was softer. This color is honestly one of a kind and I’m so sad I didn’t like it more. I’m giving it 5 stars because it’s still a great product, just not exactly what I was looking for which was super soft and very oversized. You could probably soften it in the wash tho tbh!"
5.0,"I LOVE these!!!  I've used different brands in the past, and these blow them all out of the water.  I especially love that they're lace all the way around (instead of just across the toe), but cotton on the bottom to help absorb sweat.  These also have the added features of little grippy spots on the ball of the foot to keep you from sliding on slick floors as well as a smooth, thin, clear strip of silicone all the way around the inside edge to help prevent it from sliding off of your foot.  I'll be stocking up on these in multiple colors, hopefully for years to come, as I wear flats practically everyday.  I could see them being cute with heels, too.<br /><br />It's funny: this year, I'm actually HOPING to get socks for Christmas.  ;)"
5.0,Do elegant
5.0,"It fits great, is extremely soft and comfortable, and it doesn't show under my t-shirts like most bras do. When I first saw it in person, I thought there must've been a mistake because the cups looked too big. I'm a 36b, and I figured it had to be 36c. I was wrong. It's just extra coverage so that the cup edges don't line up with the outermost parts of my chest- aka, the part that would always show through under thinner t-shirts. To me, unexpectedly, the best part about this bra is how soft it is. It feels good to wear."
5.0,starting using it as soon as i got it. love it
5.0,Smooth fitting snug and so comfortable!
5.0,"Love them. There beautiful, nice and heavy. good quality"
5.0,Fits good nice comfortable hat
5.0,"I love my Beautiful Bling Boots by Helen's Heart.  They are comfortable as are my 12 other pair I have.  I have every color but the white and dark brown.  I don't wear those colors as often.  But, if, I got. Sweet sweet deal, like, two pair for $100.00 I would order them just to have the complete set😊"
5.0,"The leotard is a beautiful royal blue color - just as I expected.  However, I had hoped it would be a little bigger, as it just fits my 3.5 year old (ordered a size 4-6), who wears a solid size 4 in most clothes.  If you're wanting some extended use out of the leotard, you might consider ordering a size up."
5.0,This is the perfect hat. it really made with quality. The is like sherpa inside. Can't go wrong with this one.
5.0,"Matches everything. You'll get lots of compliments when you wear these. But BEWARE, the sizing is really off. My daughter wears women size 8. Had to return for women size 6 for the correct fit."
5.0,Great belt to add to my collection.  The fact that it is very nice. My other leather belts in the past have stretched the holes out over time and would then need to be adjusted.  With this ratchet there is no stretching of my belt so far.  It is a quick solution for getting that perfect fit.  I have a brown one for every day stuff but the black one will be worn for dresser occasions.  Very shiny buckle.  Release lever is underneath.  This belt did come big but it does come with instructions on how to shorten the normal length of it by cutting off the access.
5.0,Me encanto bn bella
5.0,"Best for me. I do not like boxers that sag, have to be pulled up all day but do have a fly. These are the best I have come across."
5.0,"Daughter absolutely loved it and she looked cute in it. Petticoat underneath is not necessary, only if you want a fuller look.  Sleeves are a bit snug though. Would recommend a size larger. My daughter typically wears a medium and I ordered a large."
5.0,Looks good. Great value for the price
5.0,Excellent great Christmas idea
5.0,What a wonderful dress. Nice and loose and extremely long. I am 5’11 and it drags on floor just how I like it. Must have Summer dress
5.0,A lot of masks out there are just too tight for me so I love that this one is adjustable.  The colors are bright which for me makes is just a little more bearable having to wear one at work all day.  I would recommend this to any adult looking for a good mask.
5.0,"Very classy purse. Fits my iPhone6 Plus, large wallet, keys, and perfume."
5.0,Solidly made. Very good details. Wish it came with a 2-3 inch chain so that i can keep my keys in my pocket and allow the medallion to be on the outside. I bought one just so i can do this.
5.0,"A little bigger than the size chart, and soft plastic, but beautiful."
5.0,Really cute socks that stay on and are a good vaule
5.0,Cannot say enough about this dress. Sexy.  Fitted without accentuating the stomach area. Great material. Got immediate compliments the first time I wore it.
5.0,As described. Fast shipping
5.0,"Look and feel great. May have to break them in a little bit, but after the first wear, they feel perfectly snug and comfortable to move in. Just make sure to follow the washing instructions included on the tag (No Tumble Dry) and they shouldn't shrink at all. Very glad with my purchase."
5.0,"I purchased this item as a gift for a great price.  The watch was well received, the person loves it."
5.0,"Very nice, it fits, my husband loves it and wants me t buy more like it."
5.0,I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He LOVES it!  And we love the Wildcats!!!!
5.0,"Plastic posts, I thought I would not like them, but they are fine. Good colors."
5.0,"Very disappointed. The band is well made, solid materials. However for a nato band in which the band is to be tucked thru the rings for extra security this falls literally short. I have small wrists  most watch bands are too large and uncomfortable this is too short and cannot be threaded properly thru the rings."
5.0,"Nice comfortable, even works withy prescription glasses under the visor. Did not fog up."
5.0,I wore this for a gig and it was a hit. I'm a college student taking Physics and I am also a nerd that loves Star Wars. My band happened to be playing May the 4th....Star Wars Day yaay! And this shirt was perfect!
5.0,"I am 6'2&#34; and about 260 lbs.  Every shirt I find in XL-Tall assumes that I have a huge beer gut and the mid section is way too large.  This shirt was a perfect fit for a guy my size.  My waist is about 37&#34; and this shirt fits perfectly, length wise and girth.<br /><br />If you are like me, tall and stocky, but without the beer gut, this shirt is for you."
5.0,"This package of earrings are great, lightweight, colorful. All my friends like them. It is a great deal. I even gave some to people I know."
5.0,"First let me say I chose the US 8-10 sizing. This jacket is beautiful and fits perfectly. I am 142 lbs, 5’ 7” tall and normally wear medium. Looks absolutely georgous. Have not used it for winter weather yet but will soon and will see how well it keeps the cold out but seems very much able to do so."
5.0,"These turned out to be awesome. Better in person. Great fit, great delivery. Highly satisfied and highly recommend"
5.0,I really like the band and how it looks. Over time the magnet gets weaker and starts moving and gets looser around the wrist.
5.0,Sharp looking and comfortable watch band
5.0,"Good quality silver, nice shine. Can use with other chains for longer lengths."
5.0,Bought it for my friends son nd she’s just liked it so much 👍
5.0,"It had a swivel that helped me make sure that my ID was visible to all of my kids, staff and parents who were there to become acquainted with me.  Although it broke after a couple of months, I had many other lanyards left over (didn't realize that they came in a package of 10 or more!) and will be using them next year after my holiday one is no longer appropriate.  Good product though!"
5.0,"This is something wonderful. not all the time a girl wants to wear a bikini/bathing suit. I'm comfortable I have no dislikes, this doesn't ride up my legs or rub too hard on my thighs causing inner marks, dries fast, I am so looking forward to wearing this so much more thank you"
5.0,I love it that’s all ima say lol
5.0,I were this tons and get so many complements. So comfort it's like PJs. Love love the deep pockets.
5.0,Note that the tunnels are a soft rubber. Mine came with a bonus set of odd nickelodeon-green screw cap tunnels splashed with specks of blue. Kind of trippy.
5.0,Very nice quality. I love the inside color of this bag. Beyond happy with my purchase. Waited about a month to review as I tend to carry several things in my purse. It is holding up quite nicely.
5.0,Slit is a little high for me in the back but other than that perfect dress
5.0,"I absolutely love it! The fabric is silky-like and falls beautifully. I love the color also (ordered the same from another seller and it came dandelion yellow, but this one is true mustard!). It is definitely american-sized ;) I usually wear size small and it fits normally, but this one is a bit roomy (which, I suspect, is the way it should be, being a &#34;jacket&#34; and all). I don't advise buying a size up, just expect some air in between you and the garment ))) I'd wear it with a belt over. Great product, highly recommending! Love the quality!"
5.0,Sturdy and blocks the blue.
5.0,It was a gift and he loved it!
5.0,"Very cute, not as advertised and doesn’t have bodice detail. Was more just like an elasticized tube top, and had many holes in the seams.  Unbreathable material."
5.0,"I got the 5/16"" 16 guage for my septum, it fits great and is snug to the bottom part of my nose, so it looks pretty dainty. The jewels are sparkly and noticeable, and I'm happy with the color and finish. No tarnishing or anything, I've been wearing it about a week and it's comfortable and doesn't move around much. I'll probably buy from this store again, this was my second purchase from them."
5.0,Was perfect for the angel costumes.  They were on time as well.
5.0,Was a gift. But exactly what she was looking for. House socks with some cushion and grip on hard wood/laminate floors.
5.0,Exactly as described.  Flexible enough to scruff critters!
5.0,"Beautiful bikini bottom, nice soft and elegant fabric, well made and it has a good quality too!"
5.0,"I purchased one bracelet and I love it.  Second one purchased, clasp would not snap into place.  Returned it, and I know they will replace it.  Excellent value."
5.0,"Love these pants!! They are super comfy, have a good deal of stretch, and I get compliments left and right. Def ordering more...might even size down to a 7 since they have so much stretch."
5.0,"I love this tank top! It was just as picture/described. It’s a loose fitting top and stretchy material,  so I would order your normal size. It’s very pretty and long enough for leggings. Very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,I got this as a gift for my step mom and she absolutely loved it! It's very pretty and just the right size
5.0,ok scooby doo fan's if you like scooby doo then you should buy this shirt. and i'am happy with my order.
5.0,it looks great and fits as expected
5.0,"Love this!  More than I thought. Might have to get the other color.  But it fits great, so warm and co for table but not bulky.  Some track suits make me feel like I have winter coats and pants on. Would buy in every color."
5.0,Ordered 3 of these and they are great!  Just the right weight and they are very soft.
5.0,Haven't worn out as yet but seems comfortable and fits nicely when trying on.
5.0,I've got a giant head so it fit just right
5.0,How it look
5.0,Fit great and sooooooo soft and so much less expensive than the LLR - already bought another pair.  Super comfortable and super cute!
5.0,The quality on this is AMAZING! Great sturdy material. Impressively well made. I wish there was some better color choices but the green wasn't too shabby. Just a nice evergreen color. I just can't believe I got something so nice for $10 bucks and a two pack! I use the smaller bag to pack my lunch since I just put my food in a fridge at work. The large bag which is what I was after is great. I just love the water bottle holders on the outside. They a good sturdy mesh so water/condensation is no issue. I just love it.
5.0,"Really cute, my daughter absolutely loved them!"
5.0,"I love my set of four UM Jewelry stainless steel earrings! I have had no problem putting them on. See the photo of the really pretty cobalt blue ones I am wearing!<br />I was worried the wires would be too thick, however they are completely comfortable, even on my delicate piercings. Also, even after I wear them for a while, they don't irritate my ears. They are really pretty too! I have always loved Huggie style hoops! This nice collection would make a great gift for anyone, or you could split them up and give four gifts--for example, to your best friends! Love the blue and the black especially!<br /><br />Note: I received these in exchange for my unbiased review."
5.0,"I love this dress. I wore it to a formal wedding. I love the dark royal purple, the back design, and how comfortable it is. The lace is pretty too, but I didn't realize based on the pictures that it's a more like an embroidered hard type of lace than the thin type...if that makes sense. I had no problem with that. The length was a little annoying while dancing since I didn't have time to get it cut a little shorter. I'm 5'5"" and I wore about 5-inch nude heels. I either had to hold it up with a hand or two or hope that I wouldn't trip! Luckily I didn't; my push-up bra helped a bit to keep the dress a wee bit higher off the floor. Also, I'm normally a 6 in dresses, but based off reviews I decided to go up a size. I was a little hesitant about going up since I'm a curvy pear shape (my waist is about 28, hips 41) and I'm a 34B so sometimes dresses are big on my boobs and fit my hips/butt or fit my boobs but are tight on my hips/butt. But going up a size (to size 8) was a good decision! The zipper was just right on my waist, with the skirt falling nicely off my hips. I had a feeling going up a size was the way to go for me because of my current chub, particularly in the belly, and since I haven't really bought dresses since my weight's increased. So I'd say make sure to read reviews, measure yourself correctly, and have what type of shoes you'd want to wear in mind before making a decision! (I for one would've probably bought shorter heels if I had had time to trim the dress.)"
5.0,"Looks really great on me I love these shorts very preppy, class and fun."
5.0,Great necklace for what I'm feeling very hippie.
5.0,Very Warm and comfy Socks.
5.0,Cute and soft!  Nice for everyday winter socks in the Upper Left USA.
5.0,"It was exactly what we expected, and my daughter cannot wait to wear it to class this week."
5.0,"Fits as expected, my son loves it."
5.0,They aren't clear they are the tan looking ones. They aren't durable at all. I thought I ordered the clear.
5.0,Great quality product. Super comfy & practical
5.0,Perfect size and the color OMG i love them.
5.0,These are just as described! They fit perfect. Thanks you! I wrote that I had not receive them and the post office lost them. Wow they did find them and I love them!
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter-in-law who says she really likes them. She said they run small which isn't an issue for her as she has small hands.
5.0,Great for school use!
5.0,"I've owned 3 pairs of these Engineer boots and they are the best boots I've ever had. They are extremely durable, long lasting and comfortable. I stopped buying the types of work boots that have laces and started buying these pull-ons. I will continue to buy these boots as long as they are still being manufactured. They have never came apart at the sole or seams. They shine up well for a dressy formal event and they also do the job when you're out working in the dirt. I love these boots. I'm not fond of the strap and buckle so I always slice it off clean at the seams with a razor blade. Then there's no traces of it ever being part of the boot...just a sleek black pair of regular work boots, and they break in well and relax quickly after wearing them a few days"
5.0,Very nice shirt.! So impressed I want in more colors! Runs a little small.
5.0,Beautiful dress for young girls!
5.0,Excellet.....
5.0,"These bathrobes are great, I finally found what I am looking for!! They dry well and keep t he water off of the car seats after coming out of the swimming classes. I bought 2 more for my 2 daughters and 1 of the same brand adult size for my husband. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I wear knee high socks when I ride my mountain bike and I ride my mountain bike a LOT! I wear them in the winter for warmth and in the summer for protection against poison ivy and briars. I *love* fun socks, bc I'm wearing spandex and that's really boring. These are really cute! They seem well made (and I have washed them). Not too heavy and not too thin. I have a small foot (size 6) and big biker calves so they are a little long in the foot and overall heel to knee length but fit well in the calf, which is a problem area for me. I've bought 3 pair so far - the elephants, flying pigs and unicorns - and I have my eye on a couple more that I'm sure I will buy. Good value when compared to smart wool although you can't choose a specific size."
5.0,"So pretty, love it so much, very long will have to hem, I'm 5'5&#34; will need to shorten it about 2-3 inches"
5.0,Love this sweater!! It fits true to size and the fabric is soft and feels really good on!! I would highly recommend this sweater!
5.0,I loved my Guess glasses. Are perfect.

5.0,Love it. Love the material.  Easy to clean. Easy to slip on
5.0,"For the money this dress is perfect.  Fits well, Has pockets , doesn’t wrinkle and packs great.<br />Look great for not a lot of money!!!"
5.0,Fits nicely and good quality for the price
5.0,This shirt was perfect!  Vibrant colors.  Has been washed and worn many times.  It didn’t shrink.
5.0,Definitely should have paid more close attention to the dimensions. It's bigger than I expected. But it's still great!
5.0,"Super cute product. Exactly as ordered. Couldn't find the ""tutorial"" video but if you press the crease on the plain round cylinder with your nail, it pops open.<br />Removed the  safety chain as it annoyed me. Filed down the posts on the chain was connected to and good to go."
5.0,Delivered on time and just what I expected!
5.0,"Perfect size. I was happy to see 2 small inside pockets. Good for a small note pad, eye glass cloth.The material, inside and out seems very durable. And the color...! Love it!"
5.0,Purchased for myself loved it so much I purchased a couple more for gifts!!!
5.0,Exactly as described. Numerous well-placed pockets and sturdy fabric inside and out.
5.0,"I live the quality, the color is classy and the logo is very well done."
5.0,The slit is higher than I expected but I love the dress!
5.0,"Loved em', comfortable"
5.0,Easy to install on watch and looks expensive.
5.0,very nice goes with alot of things.
5.0,"I ordered this band for my wife as a Christmas gift as a replacement band on her Galaxy S2 Classic. She loves it!!<br />It’s top quality leather, and the black is a beautiful contrast to the rose gold watch.<br />Ordering and payment was simple, shipping was quick. Highly recommend the product and the supplier."
5.0,This night shirt is so pretty and the quality is very good.
5.0,It fits great and didn’t shrink. It is one of my favorite shirts.
5.0,"These fit true to size, just slightly above the knee as basketball shorts should be.  Durable but lightweight to keep cool in the summer.  The zipper pockets are a major plus as you won't lose your cell phone or cash when riding the bike.  Perfect for my son.  Drawstring is long enough to not get lost in the waist band and thick enough that you'll be able to undo the knot you tie without any trouble.  Would recommend and would buy again."
5.0,"I bought these shoes for my daughter and they're perfect. I bought them a little big just in case the sizing was off but the sizing is spot on.<br />Color is vibrant, she loves them."
5.0,I bought these for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and they are perfect for her size.  She adores them. They are very shimmery and are a great size for her ears.  My oldest daughter wants a pair for herself now.
5.0,"Ordered a medium, I’m 5’5” weigh about 155. The t-shirt fit was great. I was comfortable all night at edc"
5.0,Absolutely amazing product!! Thank you so much...everyone loved it and it was perfectly made!
5.0,I bought this in a pinch because I couldn't find a green sweat shirt in time to make an ugly sweater for my 5 yr old daughter. It is a more heavy weight sweater. Very nice.
5.0,Kids loved these sweet sweatshirts were so soft..
5.0,Nice design and workmanship... nice price..
5.0,"I loved the way this fit my 2 year old.  I made her a dress out of this , and the material seem to be good quality."
5.0,"This is very much a mans bracelet, very mascanline feel but I love it for myself! It's definitely made for a mans wrist because of the size. It's hangs a little lose for my liking but I can live with it. The design is a black double leather braid bracelet with a slide clasp. The center of the bracelet is were the fun begins. The center bead is beautiful. The beads are separated by what I believe to be a cotton type roping. The center design secures the two braided straps together. The craftsmanship is outstanding. I figured out the secret of securing the clasp without problem. It has to be lined up just right for the two ends to come together. I really like the design of the clasp just because it's extremely secure once attached. I did receive this product complimentary for a review. This is my opinion based on my personal experience with the product."
5.0,"I paid $15 for a book that the school store was asking over a $100 for. This was a book that has Washington State on the cover but was the exact same book. School bookstores are a ripoff and they are always trying to play mind games like their book has something special in it. Do you really think English, Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, etc. will be different in some phase at your school which requires a different text and thus a special edition textbook for an exuberant increase in price? Then they tell you they'll buy it back only it's a fraction of what you paid and if they come out with a new edition it's worthless to them and you get nothing. It's a shame how the schools and their bookstores prey on students when it comes to textbooks."
5.0,Exactly what I expected when I ordered them. Great value.
5.0,I get so many compliments on these when I wear them on my dance shoes!
5.0,i'm very happy with it!
5.0,Ignore the bad review about this being a t-shirt lol. I am 5”10 and struggle finding dresses long enough. I am 155 and got a medium. Fits great!
5.0,"love these very light readers. have several of these. lots of colors.  I get lots of compliments, do not have to wear chain around neck! I keep on nose all the time. weightless ."
5.0,"So I was super excited for these hoodies. I bought one for myself and one for my husband for our Halloween trip to Busch gardens. The colors on it are so vibrant and the print looks amazing and exactly like the picture. The only downside is they are on the thin side. My husband loves thinner hoodies so they are perfect for him. Myself on the other hand like thicker hoodies. Also the front pocket is great, It’s very sturdy and large. Definitely happy with the purchase and recommend this hoodie."
5.0,"Perfect length and width for my 6'1"" son. Got 5x which is his usual size. He does not like short or tight shirts. It is not a thin t. Quality perfect."
5.0,Outstanding comfort and quality and 3 bras for a fantastic price.  I put one on in the morning and forget I’m wearing it until night.  No binding or rolling and size chart for a 38 C was perfect.
5.0,"I re-pierced my right ear at a tattoo studio after putting it off for years. The piercer did not give me another earring for my left ear, which was open but could get irritated at times. Sometimes the piercing of my left ear would still bleed a little wearing an earring. I suspected the wound never heal completely inside. I ordered this earring to just wear one on my left ear along with the new piercing of my right ear. I’ve worn it 24/7 for 3 weeks continuously now. Sometimes I'd squirt saline while I take care of the new piercing. No irritation so far, just as I expected. Hopefully this time my ears would all turn out fine."
5.0,Could be used for  bed as well as work
5.0,"I bought these for Burning Man and they were outstanding. Great optics, great coverage, and great value for the money. Highly recommended for your adventures on and off the jet-ski."
5.0,"So cute! Bought as slipper, so we cut off the elastic, she loves them!"
5.0,Very helpful for the summmer
5.0,Looks great.<br />Large bag
5.0,Just as described.  Very good quality and elegant bag.
5.0,"so comfortable ,love it"
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments. I wear a 16 pant and 10-12 shirt and had to send the XL back for a large. This is longer than exspected in a good way. The material is soft but thick and not at all see through.
5.0,My mom loved it! Such a great mother’s day gift!
5.0,As described! Simply adorable!
5.0,I gave these away  as gifts and everyone loved them!  They great color and soft and silky feeling!
5.0,"Just got today, love it!! True to size, arm holes perfect, fabric doesn't cling to torso/waist, not sheer.  Im a 2x 44G.  Perfect for office or play."
5.0,"These are fun slippers.  The furry light pink reminds me of some fancy heel a woman in the 50's mightve worn. But the animal print and flat slide add that needed modern touch. These look great lounging around with cropped jeans. They're soft and comfortable and will last the season as most slippers do. Since they're open toe, I'll try to save them for the summer."
5.0,"Great hat! Stylish. Brim was just the right size, wasn’t too heavy. Didn’t need to use wind strap but see how it could be really useful."
5.0,Love!!! Got several compliments!! Recommend!
5.0,Looks like it's way more expensive than it actually is.  Super high quality.  It's just gorgeous.
5.0,I can wear it multi-layer or just by itself.
5.0,I love my Betty Boop masks . Thank you very much.
5.0,"Gifted to a new nurse, she loved them!"
5.0,"It's way cuter than I thought it was going to be.. fit perfectly and makes me look skinny! I am a size 4, bigger butt/chest, medium fit perfectly."
5.0,"wear these all the time on my jackets,love them ,the colors are great and look exspensive!"
5.0,I was afraid it was going to be small but seems to run true to size.Im a 2x and the 2x runs true to size
5.0,"I really like this bracelet. You never quite never know what you are going to get even with descriptions and reviews so its always great when it all works. It's simple and fun, just the right size, wraps easily, the clasp is unique and works great. I've worn it quite a few times and it's been a positive experience."
5.0,PERFECT! EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
5.0,"I was really hoping this would fit me, I got a Medium which I normally get a large just in case it's too small... it fits great better then I expected it would the fabric is so soft and light I want to wear it all the time.....such a good price for this shirt, when I buy clothes online I don't really need it right away I just shop and I was so happy it didn't take as long as it said it would. If your looking for a unique shirt that is easy to tuck in or out then I would get this if you like the design of this shift go and get one....your not spending a whole lot any way."
5.0,"Very dark, much better than transition lenses."
5.0,This is a very good quality dress.  It is so pretty.  Can't wait to wear it in my best friends wedding.

5.0,Thank you for the great delivery and they fit 😃. I’ll buy more pants from here next time
5.0,It was a perfect buy
5.0,Love the color and size. Adjustable strap is a big plus.
5.0,"I bought this wallet as a Mother's day gift to my mom. She wanted a Coach one in the same color but I couldn't afford it. Needless to say, her daughter in law DID buy it for her. My mom says she loves this wallet. The leather is sooo incredibly soft and the color is exactly what she wanted"
5.0,Perfect. Fast shipping.
5.0,"I have been drawn to these socks for years and finally bought a pair!  I adore them, they are so well made and the colors are wonderful.  I know they are a bit expensive but for my money they are well worth it!  They are a statement all on their own!"
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! Perfect!
5.0,It’s a good mask
5.0,Little too small but good quality
5.0,"Great quality.  Thicker mesh and cord.  Larger than expected.  Used as shower bags and held shower essentials, including towel and flip flops and still had tons of room.  Dried easily too."
5.0,Loved the color even tho it is not as dark as the photo but i didn’t care for the material. I have several other tops like this from other companies and I thought it would have a linen type feel to it. I returned as a result of this.
5.0,I bought both the black and brown versions of this leather belt.  It is well made and comfortable to wear.  It is a little more wide than most belts although there were no problems with it fitting within the belt loops of my pants. I can recommend it with no hesitation.
5.0,fantastic product for sure
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter after having my first grand child. While it is a little thin it makes it very dainty and my daughter loves it! The initial C is for her husband and baby. Very sentimental.
5.0,These swim shorts are a great length and fit well. Very happy with them!
5.0,Fit perfectly and it's gorgeous! Much higher quality than I was expecting for the price!
5.0,"Well made, fits really well. The stretchy factor is a plus. The size chart is a little off for women though. I am an 8/10 and needed a medium (originally ordered a small based on the chart and had to send it back). I ordered gray and it's not quite as dark as the image but I like it. Blends in with jeans nicely. Quality leather too. Can't beat the price so I definitely recommend it."
5.0,Pretty dress for price!
5.0,My daughter loved them and she says they are very comfortable!
5.0,Our son-in-law will be thrilled with this cap. Well made and will surely keep him warm this winter.
5.0,see my review of the other bangle cuff bracelet
5.0,Our flower girl loved this dress and was twirling all night!
5.0,"Not quite as pictured, but I like it better!"
5.0,Luv color & design. & length.  Fits thin but curvy girls.  Stretches on top 4 girls with boobs 2
5.0,"This is an amazing jacket especially for the price. Very soft inside, very good quality build, all of the stitching seemed to be good and double stitching was done where needed. The zipper was a very good quality YKK zipper. My only concern about this jacket is that the bottom opening seemed to fit somewhat to small, the reason i still gave it five stars is because after extensive testing of many different Chinese brand jackets on Amazon (buying many jackets for a security company) all appeared to fit the same way on the bottom opening. After all testing was complete (multiple jackets on multiple people in ranging sizes) ive decided to purchase this one for my company. Well built. Warm. Great functionality. I didnt think i would like the square pockets on the front but they look very nice in real person. Overall A+ on this one."
5.0,"Nice replacement band for my watch.  Good construction given the price.  However I would have preferred edges that were more rounded.  Clasp works great, better than my original Invicta dive watch."
5.0,"This pack is wonderful!!! This is a big pack of helix earrings! I cannot believe that I got a whopping EIGHT helix earrings for the price that I usually pay for one helix earring! The four sizes of CZ studs come in packs of two (so, two helix earrings per size). It was beyond difficult to decide which one to wear first because I usually do not change out my helix earring very often. I opted for the largest size (6mm) first because it just glimmered in the light. The earring looks and feels fantastic! I have a hard time picking out helix jewelry because I have extremely sensitive ears (and an allergy to nickle/cheap metals) and the helix spot is very sensitive and often the wrong type of earring hurts while I try to sleep if my head is pressed against a pillow. So far, the earring has been in for days now and has not irritated me at all, and I cannot even tell it is in while I sleep! I am so beyond happy with this set, these will last me a really long time, but if I ever needed a replacement or a friend wanted a recommendation, I would absolutely order these again!  I feel like I struck gold with these!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"Fila's toe socks have saved my feet!!!  My second and third toes on my right foot have become hammered and were rubbing, horribly, into my big toe - creating a serious wound.  Fila's toe socks provide exactly the right protection for each toe and have completely prevented any further such damage.  I wear them, with a second regular sock inside all my athletic shoes.  They are perfect inside Fila's toe shoes, which also help straighten my hammered toes!!!"
5.0,I love love love this bag
5.0,Pretty and comfortable. Isn’t the most flattering if you’re heavier but that’s the risk you take with horizontal lines. I’ll continue to wear it regardless because I love the colors.
5.0,I got soooooo many compliments! My favorite movie!
5.0,I love this bag! I use it for Zumba and it's very study.  I especially like the padding on the shoulder straps. The separate inside compartment can be used for my sneakers or wet towel.  Very durable.
5.0,they look great I'm sure my friend will be happy with the gift
5.0,"I am very happy with this buy. The wallet is sturdy, classy, and has a high capacity without being clunky. I can fit my phone, my many cards and bill, and I'm confident that my checkbook would fit too (with space to spare) if I needed. My cards fit snugly in their slots but I'm sure they will loosen with use."
5.0,"Very happy with my purchase, bought a Small - fits XS sizes :) happy customer"
5.0,these are so cool! my husband loves them! Roll Tide Roll!
5.0,Material was amazing and fit my daughter like a glove will buy again!

5.0,Bought for my daughter for sledding. They fit me and my daughter (age 9) so could be used for any age. Great for protecting the eyes from snow and sunlight. I recommend!
5.0,These earrings are just beautiful.  They dangle and shine to perfection.  I am thrilled with them.
5.0,adorable and perfect for my 2 speedcubers
5.0,I was hesitant to buy this online because I was unsure of the size. It turns out the measurements in the sizing chart were right on the mark.. It fits perfectly.
5.0,I love the colors on the top of these and they're really great tank tops for jogging
5.0,Comfortable and just as described

5.0,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A RING LIKE THIS FOR MY WEDDING RING FOR MY MAN AND FOUND THE EXACT RING IN THE PICTURE AT METAL MASTERS AT AMAZON.COM FOR WAY LESS, THE PRICE ON THE RING WAS $18.99 AND THE SHIPPING WAS LIKE $5.54 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT WAS UNDER $25 AFTER TAX AND SHIPPING! I MEAN IT IS THE SAME EXACT RING, THEY EVEN USED THE SAME EXACT PICTURE! I RECEIVED MY RING THAT I ORDERED FROM METAL MASTERS IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK. I ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE (I ORDERED A SIZE 12 THINKING IT WOULD FIT BUT I WAS WAY OFF) AND HAD TO EXCHANGE IT FOR A SIZE 9 AND IT FIT PERFECT! WHEN I ASKED TO HAVE THE NEW RIGHT SIZED RING WITH 2 DAY SHIPPING THEY DID NOT HESITATE AND SHIPPED IT WITH THE 2 DAY SHIPPING FOR FREE WHICH WOULD HAVE COST ME MORE THAN THE PRICE OF THE RING! THEY WERE SO NICE AND SO QUICK TO ANSWER ALL OF MY E-MAILS AND SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST AS WELL! I WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST COMPANY'S THAT I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE! NO LIE! BUT BACK TO THE RING! THE RING IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND THE SHINE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! THE RING HAS A NICE WIGHT TO IT AND THE STYLE & CRAFTSMANSHIP IS IMPECCABLE! NO LIE IF I HAD MONEY I WOULD HAVE PAID $2000.00 OF THIS RING WITHOUT HESITATION, BUT LUCKILY I SHOPPED AROUND AND FOUND THE SAME RING THAT WOULD HAVE COST ME THAT PRICE AND ONLY PAID $20 FOR IT!I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE QUALITY OF THIS RING FOR THE LOW LOW PRICE I PAID FOR IT! WE LOOKED AT 5 DIFFERENT PLACES OF A SIMILAR RING AND THE PRICES RANGED FROM $180 TO $2000 FOR THE SAME STYLE, SAME MATERIAL, SAME BEVELED EDGES, SAME MATT FINNISH I MEAN SAME EVERYTHING AND I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO PAY OVER $200 (I MEAN WE ARE NOT RICH BY ANY MEANS AND HE WOULD NOT ALLOWED IT IF I WANTED TO ANYWAYS) BUT I AM SO GLAD I HELD OUT BECAUSE I FOUND THIS RING FOR 1/18 OF THE PRICE! OKAY HERE IS ONE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AND IT IS ALMOST THE SAME EXACT RING, HERE IS THE LINK.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />OKAY YOU CAN SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!

5.0,"First, these are cut small, so make sure to buy a size up from what you normally wear. That said, this is a fantastic jersey. The quality legit surprised me for the cost.<br /><br />Got a few laughs and compliments when I wore it out. For someone who used to be a Washington fan, this is a great filler until I find a new home team. Or Dan Snyder sells it. One of the two.<br /><br />Either way, this is a great jersey for a football fan, movie fan, or both."
5.0,Perfect fit for 8 row rhinestone mesh trim
5.0,The white strawberry quartz in this ring is different from regular strawberry quartz.  It is more like clear quartz with strawberry flecks in it.  The silver work surrounding the stone has beautiful detailed etching.  I like the ring as it is unique and different from others that I have seen.
5.0,Very soft and easy to use cell phone while wearing them.
5.0,I love these leggings! I didn't notice the smell that everyone stated.
5.0,"The thing I like best about this backpack is that it doesn't sacrifice durability for its light weight -- and it's VERY lightweight, making it perfect as a day bag or backpack for light afternoon hikes.<br /><br />Storage is basic to the point of being bare bones, and that's fine. One main storage area where you can put some extra clothes, sandals for the beach, lunch, some books, or whatever else you need.  There is a small inside slot, good for smaller toiletries or valuables, and two small pouches on the sides for tiny items you want to access quickly.<br /><br />The main flap buckles shut and also has a drawstring. Shoulder straps are comfortable as long as the bag is loaded down too much -- and with a generous main compartment, you can pack a lot in here.<br /><br />The look is neutral; nothing too fancy.<br /><br />And once again, it's VERY lightweight.<br /><br />This has replaced my messenger bag as my every day go-to."
5.0,The inside is very soft and warm. Way better than I expected! Different material than the exterior. 11/10
5.0,Definitely a steal!
5.0,"We needed all white shoes for my daughter to walk in a parade with her dance class.  These were perfect!! I don’t know how long they will hold up, but they were just what we were looking for."

5.0,My kid loves this Deadpool costume! It covers him head to toe and has zippers on the back and in the crotch. The eye holes are easy to see out of and The material is nice and stretchy so it's very comfortable to wear. The feet area is roomy enough to fit over shoes which is nice.

5.0,"Arrived in time.  Was comfortable, held up to several washes and stylish for a casual look."
5.0,I purchased this skirt for my 12 year old for a parade performance. She was absolutely  adorable. This fit well on her. She looked polished and age appropriate. This skirt hit her below the knees and flared out beautifully. It was a heavier weight material and not cheap looking or feeling at all.<br /><br />It will be a great skirt going into the fall paired with tights and boots and probably the early spring as well.<br /><br />A definite must buy if you need a quality low cost wardrobe staple.
5.0,If you want to look in style and also be comfortable these boots are it.

They have built-in mesh underwear to keep the ""boys"" in place and a cord around the waist for adjustment.  They look exactly as pictured and as of now I can't find anything negative to say about them.  These should be just fine for swimming in."
5.0,I got this one for my grand daugther and she just love ir<br />because of all the colors love it
5.0,Edwards shirts are always top of the line when it comes too uniforms
5.0,Nice quality suits.Feels very soft as it is 100%cotton.It is made in China. Feels not to thick and not to thin.honestly I don't notice any difference between these and carter's suits.they both feel the same to me.Also it's nice to have embroidered work on 2 of those suits just like the name brand ones like carters.Feels and looks very nice.I would definitely buy this again in different patterns and design.<br />I received this at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review!
5.0,Bought for my teen daughter. She loves it!!

5.0,I don't know that you'll be able to get a better pair of sunglasses for the price.  Blown away by these.
5.0,"Panties are terrific. No stretching, no fading in color, elastic is great...only thing is, when ordering , get 2 sizes smaller than what you normally would wear. They tend to be of the bigger size and I had to send my first order back."
5.0,The kids love them who are 3 and 5 year old boys.  We just splashed in a bunch of puddles the other day and they're still working.  I highly recommend these. Thanks for such a great product.
5.0,So cute! True to size. My only &#34;critique&#34; is in the picture the top looks like a sweater but it's actually a light long sleeve top. Love this outfit tho.

5.0,"A really attractive, form-fitting top!!<br />Great with jeans and can even be dressed up more! I didn’t read the full description and missed that the black did have little sparkles in it, but it’s nothing too overpowering. I think overall it’s a very nice shirt and I would recommend it!!

5.0,Easy for kids to fit to their comfort tightness.
5.0,"I love this band, it fits my apple watch perfectly. My wrist however is in between one link and no links. I have been wearing it with one link, but I think I may try no links to see if that will be too tight."

5.0,"I don't think the photo does this tie justice. It's more of a true gold color and worked really well for my wedding. Our colors were black white and gold and it was almost impossible to find a gold tie for the groomsmen that was affordable. I'm really glad we found this one though! Some other reviews we read mentioned it being difficult to tie, but we didn't have this issue."
5.0,Love these pants! I was surprised how well these fit.
5.0,So extremely cute and comfortable!!! Love love love!! Will be my favorite sandals for this summer!!!
5.0,"Adjusts easily. Dainty but sturdy. Wearing it day and night and after two weeks is still shiny and intact. Occasionally will catch on fabric if I'm not careful but given the design that's expected. Quality for the price.<br />Wish they had rose gold pieces like this.<br />Update: After two months the outer surface of band has lost it's silver coating. The surface next to my skin is still in tact, so no green skin. To be fair, I wore it day and night and exposed it to everyday activities. It would have held up better if I had only worn it for special occasions and not while I did household chores.  It is dainty so use gently and it will last longer. Even though the silver is gone I still wear it and am happy with the value for price and it's design, so five stars remain."
5.0,I just received my bathing suit this morning. I wear a size 16 and 38B/40C depending on the cut of the bra. The 4XL fit me perfectly. The bathing suit is very figure flattering.

5.0,perfect for my gym group exercises.  Now I have a place for my phone and car keys on me!
5.0,"This fun dress is exactly as pictured and I get a lot of compliments on the uniqueness of the design. The fitting is loose and forgiving on the average frame and I think it is very cute. The fabric is a slightly crinkly polyester, not the kind that gets all wrinkly and wretched -- rather, the kind that has a textured quality feel. It seems perfect for an outing at a caf&eacute; or a stroll downtown. I am 5'10&#34; | 140 lbs. and the medium size comes mid-thigh on me. Tr&egrave;s sucr&eacute;!"
5.0,"Great, sturdy bracelet. Beautiful."

5.0,"Very cute, but it broke and is not usable. The metal hook ripped through the plastic. No longer able to hang on anything."
5.0,"I have 3 of these and I love them. I wear glasses for reading & need them constantly while working. I'm a nurse, so just putting the glasses on my head isnt sufficient because they can fall off and potentially land on my patients. This holder is so convenient and easy to use. I get a ton of compliments also."

5.0,Very cute. Soft and as pictured.

5.0,"I LOVE these!!!!  I have very sensitive eyes even in winter time so these glasses really just take the harshness out of the light.  Plus, they're not dark as the standard issue sunglasses which often times makes seeing too difficult without taking them off.  These are perfect!  Plus, I don't have to wear eye make up - no wonder the celebs like their shades on at all times being out and about : )"
5.0,Happy with purchase. Item as pictured & described.
5.0,I did have to get it 2 sizes larger than I normally wear. But it fit perfect.
5.0,Got it for my 11 year old son love it for perfect
5.0,"Worth the money in my opinion. I really like the fact that the straps start at the bottom and sewn in to the top. The insulation all the way around inside the bag, the zippered top and it's collapsible is something I really enjoy too. It's a decent size too. I shop at Costco so I can fit at least three packages of meat/poultry in one bag."
5.0,"Quality product, quick shipping"
5.0,Shoes look amazing!
5.0,My  husband loves this shirt. It is lightweight and great to wear during hot weather!
5.0,I now have a few items from this brand and really like all of them. These bags are a great size to be used in many ways. I like the material because it is easy to clean. The print and colors are nice in person and just as pictured.<br /><br />I would buy these again!
5.0,I had an 80's themed party to go to and it they were perfect for the occasion. Highly recommend them.
5.0,This shoes is very comfortable and cute.
5.0,I can breathe through this mask. It’s pretty
5.0,"Very comfortable. Even when the top rides up onto the shoulders, it doesn't come up all the way, making it comfortable to wear off the shoulder as pictured, or semi-off shoulder. The fabric is light and sewn together nicely. Looks good with dark blue or white; with long pants or capris."
5.0,"Got them for my girlfriend. Great product, doesn't seem cheaply made, the stones look pretty cool. Would recommend.<br /><br />Have only has them for a few days so far, but we shall see."
5.0,It's Just a Visor but what I wanted.

5.0,Super!! Very cheap and excellent quality. Fast delivery.
5.0,They very good and very nice
5.0,This was priced right! We love the nightmare before xmas and was so pleased to find this affordable set. The fabric was so silky soft my daughter loved it!
5.0,"I love Fair Indigo's cotton t shirts. They are thick, and have a bit of spandex in them to fit nicely and not drape or stretch out and lose shape! I'm a 36B, and have thicker upper arms, and bought a size medium and it fits great."
5.0,"Didn't know if I would like this band, but it's great!  I hardly even notice I have it on.  It was super easy to install and even came with extra pins.  The design is nice and it's very light weight.  Super happy I purchased, I will definitely purchase more.  I got the larger size and glad I did.  There is plenty of stretch to get on my wrist but it sits nicely, not loose moving all around.  Highly recommnd."
5.0,I have purchased belts like these before. They are easy to use and comfortable. I like not having to buckle and unbukle the belt. It doesn't cut into your stomach either. You don't realize you are wearing a belt.
5.0,I'm 5'7&#34; 158lbs. I usually wear a size 8 but after reading the reviews and the size chart got the large. They fit great. Comfy and soft. Higher quality than I expected for the cost! I may have to get another pair. Great overalls!!
5.0,"So pretty, love the fabric, I carry this everywhere!"
5.0,"These yoga pants are great, and as a yoga teacher, I have tried a lot of yoga pants. These stay up at the waist, most importantly, as it is such a pain to always be tugging up your pants during class. These stay put which is rare in a high waist pant. The addition of the small piece of material that rides along the arch of the foot makes them stay down as well, but doesn't cause any slipping on the mat. They are really comfortable, fitting perfectly. as well, they are soft to the touch rather than the sweat-inducing material most are made of. Easily one of my favorite pair of yoga pants, and you can't beat the unique design on the legs that looks like a fine mesh, but again is soft, and you don't feel all the seams on your legs because they don't cut in when you move."
5.0,"My 3 and 7 yr old just had birthdays in Dec. I ordered them a medium and a large. The medium was slighty too long and I should have down sized. However, I love their outfit their shirts fit them to the T which is something I worried about. Yet, it looks great on them. There were some extra strings on the skirt but they fanned off easily and looked precious on my girls. (My girls wear walmart skinny jeans size 4 and 8 if that helps)"
5.0,"High quality, thick fabric. The front has strings you can pull to give it a v-neck, bunched up detail. The button snaps at the crotch make it easy for my daughter to use the bathroom without assistance during dance classes."
5.0,"Very warm and stylish. I had thought the touch screen compatability would just be a gimmick, but it really works! I get a lot of compliments on these too"
5.0,Wife liked it.  Alex and Anni do not have Pooh bracelets.
5.0,"This is my favorite dress that I've bought on Amazon so far. It's the perfect length, so comfy, and also stylish. The neckline is good, not revealing, and the fabric is thick and cannot see through it at all."
5.0,"Beautiful, elegant and I love it! I found the stopper in the picture loose - lost it (and thankfully found it twice) but they provided a second stopper of the usual metallic kind within the original delivery. I am very pleased with it!"

5.0,"100% will be recommending this jacket. In the PNW, we get a lot of rain but it's also chilly. This is a perfect outer layer that also has a good warmth fleece lining. The thumb holes were a great added bonus. My 8 year old loves the color change as it gets wet. Overall, really a great coat !"
5.0,Beautiful dress good material fit perfect very happy!!!
5.0,"This purse has all the pockets that I need.  The leather is quality yet not so heavy that when empty, weights a ton.  The color is a little brighter than I anticipated but it works."

5.0,This adorable. I bought the yellow... fits great and hides problem areas like tummy. Only complaint shorts are a tad short. This would be a great date night outfit

5.0,Very comfortable and the colors are beautiful.
5.0,YES! The answer to your “should I buy these?” question is yes ! They are so so comfy and squat proof. I wish they came in more colors because I would buy one of each. They are nice and high rise as well which is very important as I’m a mom of 3. They also make your booty look real nice! Your spouse will approve 😉
5.0,"This dress is insanely beautiful. Bought it for a formal on campus and got compliments on it all night! I can’t believe the quality for how cheap the dress is! It did fit tight on the chest though, but that just allowed me to wear it without a bra - no complaining here"

5.0,"Quite lovely for an evening at the beach or cocktails and the theatre.  The fabric is just right, not too thin, nor heavy.  Just slip it on and go.  Good job!"

5.0,"My husband and I love these ,were the same size so we are sharing the pack ,no complaints."
5.0,Good value and lots of great colors.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. I was skeptical of the low price and actually expected low quality. But it was in her wish list. What a surprise! It looks great on her and the quality is surprisingly good. She wore this dress for her first day at college.
5.0,Better than expected especially sending my son off to the army

5.0,Husband bought them to wear under military uniform. Fit great
5.0,I was looking for a pullover to replace a beloved hand-me-down that is on its last leg. So I was looking for something that was soft and not too thick but also not too thin material wise. This sweater fit the bill perfectly! It is so soft and comfortable and a perfect fall pullover for me :)
5.0,This item too a long to time to receive but my son really liked it.
5.0,Great price. Den Caddy great for my loose golf clubs and golf balls. Would recommend the product to anyone considering to purchase this  item.
5.0,"Love this hat! Perfect fit, very pretty design. I'd definitely recommend it and order it again myself"
5.0,"Great product & an awesome value. I love the quality & let's face it, I paid 99¢ for each one so the value is spot on.  The only hiccup I had was they run a bit bigger than they should. I measured my finger with a ring sizer & doubled checked it with a ring I already own, ordered size 11 but wish I had gotten the next smaller size. Not a big problem but I'll get a ring insert to fix the problem."
5.0,So WARM and SOFT!! Love it!
5.0,"These rings are little ropes, not solid rings. They are dainty, lovely and comfortable."
5.0,"Thick plastic. Not brittle. Great for travel. I leave one in each of my travel bags so I am never without one. Normal size, only slightly larger than the small metal ones in some shoe stores."

5.0,My kid loves the 👟. Nice and lightweight she says.

5.0,Feels plush and luxurious and size was fine.
5.0,Good fit. Light weight.
5.0,"I used my measurements and found that the dress fit ""date fit"". For work, I went up a size.  My measurements are 40/36/44. I bought the XXL. I wear a 12 to 16 dress. I have to tell you I received at least a dozen compliments on this garment today...….. even from sales clerks at JCP!! The material is thick enough I didn't need a slip. I wear a light shaper just because I don't like panty lines, however, I am not wearing it in this photo. I say this is a great buy! I have already bought more from this designer. Packaged very well and sent quickly through Prime."
5.0,The price for just two pair of leggings is a bit high but so far the pants are holding up to the high stress/demand on the fabric.
5.0,"I usually don't write review, but today after receiving this beautiful set, I decided to rate my purchase. We purchased this ring after reviewing all comments and pictures. And now I know it was a great decision! The ring is soooo pretty and looks great on my finger. I am happy with my purchase, and will be wearing it with my great pleasure. I don't have a real wedding band since we can't afford it now, but this ring is a great replace. For those of you who don't want to spend much now, consider buying this set. It worth the price."

5.0,Fits great. Im 5'11&#34; and 160 lbs i got the large but would rather have the medium because the leg is a little long.
5.0,Love these and they stay on all day
5.0,Love this dress. Fantastic price too!!
5.0,The perfect bag to use as a carry on! Plenty of room and lots of pockets to keep things organized.
5.0,"I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this product, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It fits nicely, stays closed, and the metal has not bothered my sensitive skin. These quickly became my got-to earring. I can even sleep in them without worrying they will fall out."
5.0,"Very cute but still modest. Fits really well with good coverage and support.  High quality fabric.  I'm 5'5"", size 12 pants, XL top, 38DDD and I got an XXL."
5.0,I bought this for my son and daughter. They love it. I had to get bigger chain for my son because he is a big guy and the chain was way too small. But it's a great gift idea. we like it

5.0,Cute and fits very well. Quality is really soft.
5.0,Great pants stretchy and very form fitting also very long
5.0,I like this sandal because it gives me a little more height than my other slip ons. Because of this it feels dressy. It is comfortable and cushions your steps.
5.0,Bought as a gift for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. The quality was great and came in a wonderful box. This was definitely a hit.
5.0,My 2 yr old toddler is slender and very petite. She fits into the 2T size just perfectly. Does have one loose seam in the back of the neckline but she only needs it for dance practice so I'm not worried about it. Love the thickness and quality of this leotard. The ballet pink is a peachy pink. Not a powder pink! I love ballet pink on my daughter with her fair skin so I chose this color.
5.0,Varg is just as good an author as he is a musician.

5.0,Got this necklace for my 10 year old daughter. She is very into smiley faces. This necklace looks high quality and is very reasonably priced. Great gift for young girls. Trendy and cute!
5.0,"I own A LOT of traditional high end metal watches...when I received my bamboo watch I have no problem noting its now the one I love the most!!! Very light, super cool design...being bamboo its on the delicate side and I will probably scratch it soon enough because I forget that Im wearing it and Im a bit rough...gladly buy another one if/when that time comes."

5.0,"These are extremely well made, very comfortable masks I can wear for hours without discomfort. No ear pain! Easy to breathe/talk. Fit both my face and my husband’s, which is much larger than mine.  Recommended by friend who has to wear them 8>10hrs/day, which I don’t. I chose All Keeper because I knew they were authentic South Korean made, following SK govt’s high standards. Beware of fake ones made in China and made to appear to be from SK, picking similar brand names, such as Keeper. Independent research has found this brand are just as protective as KN95s, filtering out 98>99% particles.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Got this for my brother and he couldn't wait to wear it.  Got lots of compliments!  Highly rate it!!
5.0,"Love it. I'm 5,9 and my torso is a bit long. The length is great for me. I got a large n it's not quiet oversized but fits well. I don't really like tight clothing"

5.0,Love the butterfly design. Folding into pouch is easy. Perfect size for fitting easily into my purse. Great for grocery shopping.
5.0,Amazin
5.0,"UM WOW!! These are definitely my new favorite yoga pants. They remind me exactly of a pair I had several years ago, and I wore them to death, but never found a replacement... Until now!<br />Fit: I ordered a large, as recommended by, the size chart, and they fit perfectly. They are snug and flattering around the butt/thighs, and loose and comfy around the lower leg. The waist fits perfectly, but it sits a bit lower than most of my other yoga pants - I'd say it's mid-rise. The length is perfect, and I'm 5'7. They do,fold just slightly at the waist when I bend over, but that's because I have a tummy (three kids, hello!), and he waistband is smaller (around an inch wide).<br />Feel: the material is soft as can be, with a great amount of stretch, but enough support and stability to hold in the right places.<br />Functionality: The seams all appear to be top knotch. I've washed these once, and they didn't shrink at all.<br /><br />I loooove these, and can't wait to get the other two pairs I ordered (straight leg and Capri's).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received these for free in exchange for my HONEST review."

5.0,I normally take a Medium in U.S. sizes.  I ordered and XL in the Asian size according to the chart shown.  It is a beautiful jersey.  I get complements from both women and men anytime I wear it.
5.0,Super cute sunglasses & good quality! Great dupe for a great price!
5.0,"The thigh is a little bit tighter than I normally wear,But not too tight.  The flexible waist is nice and the pants stretch/flex.  Much more comfortable than regular jeans."
5.0,The spandex band across the waist helps reduce my love-handles... LOVE THIS.
5.0,Well made and good price.  A little on the small side. Suggest picking at least one size up. Other than that works great.
5.0,Love this hat!  I agree with the other reviewer who said that there’s just enough volume to style it. The black one was so pretty and really well made.
5.0,"Looks just like the picture, sturdy."
5.0,Me encanta 😍 me queda perfecto
5.0,Very cute looking! Happy with it
5.0,This is a beautiful statement neck piece!
5.0,"These are the cutest earrings. I bought them for my friends that hosted a baby shower for me. They're very small and dainty, and made a great gift."
5.0,Loved the sweater.  Runs a bit large but it’s comfy and kept me warm for the few chilly days in Florida
5.0,Love it! Plastic not but cheaply made. Stylishly sleek.
5.0,She looks so cute!
5.0,I don't know what the negative reviews are all about. I bought another bag once I realized these are better quality than expected. I finally threw away my ten-year-old underwear lol. Thanks

5.0,Nice packaging. Suitable for gift giving. Very sparkly. Purchased for a teen. It says it's a clover but it looks like a flower also. The back is silver but if it flips around it still looks nice
5.0,Nice fabric. Perfect fit! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,It’s very pretty. Bought as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday.
5.0,"Don't have the five finger shoes to go with the socks, but they work nicely in regular shoes.  They keep a nice separation between the toes.  After 70+ years with regular socks, the little toe on the side is snug against the next toe.  It is nice having separation, sort of like bare foot spacing.  A little extra care with snaggy toe nails is needed, and getting each toe in the right place.  The comfort is worth the extra effort."
5.0,Nifty
5.0,Love these masks!  They are comfortable and easy to breathe through. The give full coverage with seams for the nose and chin.  I have gotten numerous complements every time I wear them.
5.0,Good fit !! I love it!
5.0,"Wouldn't you know it?  Since purchasing this umbrella it has only rained twice and one of those times I was inside and the umbrella was in the car when it started raining.  Consequently, I have only had the opportunity to use it once.  However, that one time was enough to make me like it a lot.  It popped right open when I pushed the button and seemed to hold its own in the wind.  When I closed it and used the velcro strap it wrapped up readily into a very small profile.  I liked that.  Other than that I really can't say anything about it.  When I use it some more I will give more of a review."
5.0,These boots are perfect for all weather
5.0,"THese are my favorite earrings! I wear them everyday &#60;3 they are easy to wear, and I get a ton of compliments on them!"
5.0,I've really been into phone accessories lately & these definelty do it for me. The colors are perfect so I can mix & match with my cases. I initially got them for aesthetic purposes but they're sturdy enough to hold your phone. I always get compliments when I wear them. Adds a little razzle dazzle to any fit.
5.0,I'll be ordering all the colors...I love it
5.0,Love the ponytail hole and  how comfortable this hat is
5.0,Love this top and love the fit!!@
5.0,Beautiful. As pictured.
5.0,"I bought it for the leopard print hat as a gift, but having the classic Santa hat was definitely a plus! Both are pretty good quality, I would suggest lint rolling it before wearing because the extra tufts of material will get in your hair. But otherwise, good purchase."
5.0,"This was a gift for my husband who is an archery enthusiast and a very big Hoyt fan.<br /><br />Aside from getting wife points, he loves how light and comfortable it feels. This looks like something that you could wear year round.<br /><br />Winter, for warmth.<br />Summer, for sun protection.<br /><br />The material is high quality, washes well, and is a very comfy shirt."

5.0,Love the shoes. Great for walking.
5.0,"Perfect for children. We walk everyday and my children (12 & 9) have it on the entire walk. They like it because it is breathable.  It’s made for smaller children; therefore, I wouldn’t recommend it for kid over 12"
5.0,Nice dress! Wish the sleeves were longer to combat that sequin rub! But besides that! It works
5.0,"It was a christmas gift,  my daughter really liked it."
5.0,"I have purchased sooo many dresses off of Amazon and have ended up returning one after another because it just doesn't fit right.. but this one, is absolutely perfect!!

5.0,"Really heavy duty, they work well."
5.0,"I’m really good quality, good price just the pants little big"
5.0,"These are great for your basic thin Christmas sock, which was exactly what I was looking for! I love the variety of designs. Perfect for the holidays (and other random times of the year I might wear them). They come in a gift box so great for a Christmas gift too!<br /><br />They are not the softest socks I have bought, but I find that socks with designs tend to have a little more time polyester and are thin and not so much soft. They are really exactly how I expected them to be."
5.0,Got a lot of compliments with this.
5.0,"This product worked perfectly and I can now enjoy two pairs of shoes I’ve avoided wearing.  I followed the diections, sprayed the inside of the area that needed to stretch and immediately put the shoe on, wearing thin socks.  I wore the shoe for about an hour.  For one pair,  I had to repeat the process once,  to achieve the fit I wanted.<br />Thank you, so much easier than using the freezer or shoe stretching appliances that friends recommended."
5.0,I love it it's cute and it looks great on me.
5.0,"Fits perfect! It includes dress, tights, hat, and broom! No need to purchase any accessories it comes with everything you'll need for a witch costume."
5.0,Great Fit! Got it for my mother's bday and she loved it
5.0,"Two things: 1) awesome quality accurate design, good material 2) Runs small, Size-up!<br /><br />Quality is great, printed design is accurate and material is not super thin or easy to rip cheap stuff. Its solid and of higher quality than i expected.<br /><br />Size up! If I hadn't recently lost 10lb from when I ordered it, it wouldn't fit. The zipper on the side helps to get into it, but an additional zipper someplace would help to get it on. Once on, it's great!<br /><br />Overall 5 stars because compared to others, this is a good product. 👍🏼"
5.0,The dress fit great! Most of the accessories were great! The necklace came broken but it was an easy fix. The dress was nicer than I expected and had a good amount of stretch. You get a really good quality costume with lots of accessories for the price!
5.0,LOVE having pockets.  Love the fit and fabric.  It will pack and travel well.
5.0,It was a present for a friend.  She loved it!
5.0,This is a real nice made shirt. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I bought this bag for a recent trip and was so glad I did. I felt my belongings were secure as we toured through Paris, which I had heard was a place one needed to be extremely cautious due to the large number of pickpockets. Travelon was recommended to me by my sister, so I started checking through the offerings on Amazon. I found this amazing color, and all the zip pocket features - it even had a little flash light that came in handy on a tour we took. I think this is the bag to buy for anyone! My friend Jerry, ( yes, a male) wants one in  black!"
5.0,This is a great shirt but the color is a little of from the photo but anyway great

5.0,Worked well and was very comfortable!
5.0,"Big love loves too much. Strapped to the waist, did a few anaerobic exercises, the outside of the band is not wet, the inside side is full of sweat. Band feels good air permeability, moderate width and width, do exercise without obstruction, will not affect the movement. All five points"
5.0,"Great cleats, fit true to size. My son has wide feet and cannot by him off the shelf cleats from the sporting good stores near us.  Thankful to find these online here.  This is our second year buying this brand and they have been great."

5.0,These are great for work.
5.0,Love the dress and happy to have the pockets
5.0,It's a shirt! What do you expect? Cannibal Corpse!
5.0,Really cute on my 2 year old. The skirt has a few flaws but nothing I can’t live with.

5.0,Excellent item for cost
5.0,"My first move after receiving this hat was to cut off the silly tassels, but the chapeau is very warm -- something you won't find with many of these earphone hats -- and the speakers in the hat are nice and loud."
5.0,"When my husband saw my Pavlovo Posad Russian Shawl he said, ""It looks like wearable art."" The multiple colors go with the variety of outfits and can be lightly rolled and kept at the top of your purse. A stylish way to travel, an evening out or a cool office without having to carry a jacket.  I have received compliments every time I have worn this exquisite shawl and greatly appreciate the history behind this wearable art form."
5.0,"I love this dress, the fit is perfect, and the style is adorable. The only thing is it isn't as white as the picture it's more a cream color."
5.0,So many options and they don’t tarnish!
5.0,I wear a size 8 in pants and have struggled to find the loose flowy look that isn't too tight.  These fit around my hips loosely and flowed to the ground.  They are high waited.  Fabric is opaque so I can wear them to work or out.
5.0,"I got this for my wife for her birthday, she says<br /><br />"" I love this ring, it couldn't be any nicer, even with diamonds, it is well made and comfortable. The stone size makes it quite believable as a fine piece of jewelry. I have gotten many compliments. Would highly reccommend."""
5.0,"These fit great,  the quality is excellent.  I use them under my dress clothes as a compression undershirt.  They are smooth which prevents my sweaters or dress shirts from clinging or binding up."
5.0,"product itself works flawless.As per shipping time, arrived on point!"
5.0,Great fit for the price. Doesn't run big or small.
5.0,"Got these for my kid at school. She likes them more than regular masks. You do need to wash them and the dye comes off some. Not an issue and expected. They are pretty durable. I hand washed them at first as recommended. I machine washed them last time and they survived. A few threads came loose but if they last 6 months and I have to buy some more, so be it.<br /><br />Can’t wait for the day when masks are no more. Until then, my kid likes these. Bought them 2x so she can match her outfits."
5.0,Product fits my 1.5yrs old wonderfully with plenty of room to grow.
5.0,Excellent quality and very stylish!!
5.0,So cute!  Love them!
5.0,"I love this necklace sooo much its colourful , light and looks really expensive . Everyone should have one its a must have .great find great price i love it"
5.0,Nice product. LEATHER FOR THIS $ IS VERY COOL.
5.0,"Love these bras! No joke, they're the absolute comfiest sports bras I have ever owned! I wear a size large in women's shirts and once and awhile size XL in Chinese sizing. However, I wear in between bra sizes of 36 B and 38 B. I am 190lbs and 5'4 and these are absolutely amazing. I don't need support for my breast because they're pretty on the normal side. However women with maybe a size D or bigger, I wouldn't recommend these, they are padded but not supportive if you need the support I would stray away. These bras are very high quality for the price. I got the 3 pack with pink, white and blue and I love them!"
5.0,"Perfect fit for me at 160 lbs, 5’4 and purchased XL, love the color!"
5.0,I have received so many complements on these shoes!  I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt. Very comfortable and stylish shoes.
5.0,Teachers loved them.  Great gift
5.0,Very nice wand. Bought it for my daughter.
5.0,"Wore these for a wedding.  They looked great, and functioned well.  Nothing broke off, nothing is tarnished... seems to be a good quality product in my opinion.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,Exactly what it is in the picture.. Good gift
5.0,Better than departments
5.0,"I have tried so many bands for my Apple watch and this one is by far my all time favorite!  It is easy to put on, comfortable to wear and so easy to adjust!  It is very durable and looks sharp as well.  I have a black one and a rose that I love to switch around.  Also I keep my old one to wear when I am working in the yard or doing heavy work.  I would highly recommend this band."
5.0,Bought for my daughter as a gift. She loves them. Theyre pretty cute.
5.0,Good quality product what you can expect from Brute Force.  The initial adjustments to adjust to your body are a little difficult maybe easier with another person assisting you or without being weighted.  It does weigh 42 pounds as described if you fill the filler bags with steel shot.
5.0,Me fascina como queda en el cuerpo.
5.0,"The seam in the upper middle of the back of the dress i<br />makes it mildly uncomfortable and unflattering. If you put the dress in the dryer, you will lose about 6inches in length off the dress."
5.0,"I wear, and ordered, a size large and it fits perfectly and seems to be of high quality (for the material used). The photo I attached are the labels that came with it.<br /><br />There are plenty of pockets. Two pockets with zippers are on the bottom part (where you can put your hands on colder days) and the pockets are big enough to be comfortable for that purpose. I have been annoyed by some other jackets I've had that had pockets too small for my hands to fit in comfortably. There is a pocket on the inside the jacket, secured with velcro, that will fit most wallets or a cell phone. On the left sleeve there is another zippered pocket that could fit a small wallet (3x5"").<br /><br />This jacket would be great to wear on a crisp cool fall day but isn't quite insulated enough for a cold winter day. It is not made to be reversible.<br /><br />In my opinion this is a great jacket for just $50.00!"
5.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, I have a waist of 27&#34; and I bought the small size. I like having very fitted high waisted clothing so I wanted to make sure the skirt fit me tight around the waist instead of the skirt just sitting on my waist. It does fit me as I wanted it to so I'm very happy about that !! I don't mind at all that it's very fitted and tight on me since that is how I wanted it and I'm comfortable in it so it all works out.<br />So it depends on whether you want the skirt to fit tight or a bit more loose, if you want it a bit more loose then I suggest going up a size!<br />The skirt reaches above my knees but it's probably bc of how high I wear the skirt.<br />For the fabric itself, it's sturdy fabric that won't rip, it does stretch ( not the waist band though !!) it isn't see through at all and the stitching is pretty good in my sense, overall it's good fabric that should last and it has pockets !!!! I didn't see in the features that it had pockets so that was a good surprise I'm still pretty stoked about it tbh,,<br />Overall it's a good quality skirt and I'm surprised by how much I like it !!"
5.0,"I loved, is very cute, and great quality, more than I expected...."
5.0,Very bright and colorful
5.0,I am very pleased with these sandals. They are great for biking or hiking. Good support and rugged.

5.0,fits perfectly and is very pretty
5.0,Beautiful earrings. Worth more than 9.99
5.0,"I got this EleQueen 925 Sterling Silver CZ AAA Button Cream Freshwater Cultured Pearl Leaf Bridal Stud Earrings as a usual gift for my wife. I have to say I just got better at shopping for jewelry for my wife I mean she loves it. these Pearl are just fantastic looking and they have this amazing milky and creamy shine to them which makes them look fabulous. the leaf design on top of them just adds in a bit of look and they look amazing. the leaf are filled in with sterling silver bumps that makes it look really like diamonds and just amazing. for those who are not familiar with the Fresh water Cultured Pearls, well they grow inside the mollusk in exactly the same way. They are not imitation, and they are not fake. A cultured pearl necklace or earing like this one is as genuine as its natural cousin. The majority of cultured pearls available today derive from freshwater mussels and saltwater pearl oysters. Freshwater cultured pearl appear in a wide variety of shapes and natural colors, also, because they are solid nacre, quite durable, resisting chipping and wear, making them very popular with younger people and designers. they are just very cute looking.<br /><br />the Sterling silver piece is Rhodium plated which is a silver-white in color, resistant to tarnish and other forms of corrosion, even acids, and very shiny. It is used in jewelry primarily as a hard protective plating for sterling silver. It is applied as a thin coat through a process of electroplating.<br /><br />While rhodium is reflective, silver is even shinier. As a result, sterling silver coated with rhodium will not be as bright and shiny as the underlying sterling piece would have been without plating -- at least initially. However, over time silver can get tiny scratches, but rhodium coating can minimize such problems. The effect is that as time goes on, rhodium plated sterling silver will continue to keep its fresh look longer.<br /><br />guys I have to say my wife is really happy with the earrings and I am also happy because she is very happy. I have been getting jewelry from EleQueen so much and I wont stop because their jewelry is very nice looking and its real deal stuff. I defiantly recommend you to get this. you will love it. hope you found this review helpful and have a good day.

5.0,"Leggings with pockets? What more could you ask for? I love wearing these lounging around the house. But if I have to run out to the store, I don’t have to change pants. Super comfy and fit great."
5.0,I love all fox accessories!  This one a lil pricey for a wallet but is adorable and artistic... beautiful threadwork and colors
5.0,Was enough room for my stuff.  Travels well.
5.0,Used for an outdoor music festival on a day when it rained. Paired with knee high rainboots - did not get wet AT ALL throughout the day except for hands and face. Full sleeve with elastic cuff made these much better than other people's ponchos that day. Draw string hood was also helpful. Would definitely buy them again.
5.0,"I love these so much, I bought them for a friend as well!"
5.0,"Looks great, feels soft, warm and is so comfortable.<br />I’ve had many compliments while wearing this jacket."

5.0,Excellent wristlit love it!
5.0,Very comfortable. I want to live in the pants!
5.0,Excellent quality wallet.  I like the small size.  The only nitpick is that it should have built in RFID protection.  I use anti-RFID pockets for some of my cards but that make the wallet fatter plus they are a tight fit.  I know that the company does this for non-leather versions but needs a protective liner for the leather models.
5.0,Good quality and good size. Perfect for my needs. The color is nice and it's not too big to hold when shopping if you don't want to take a purse
5.0,My boyfriend and I absolutely love these! I was afraid that it wouldn't fit around his wrist because he's had issues before but this one fit perfectly and mine was a little big but it's very easy to adjust. It comes in a cute little box with a bow on it and a nice velvet pouch for safe keeping. Overall I'm really happy with this purchase!
5.0,Everything was excellent and just as described. My 10 yr old son loves it.
5.0,Great slipper. My feet felt better as soon as I put them in. Great shoe if you suffer from plantar fasciitis.
5.0,These are great! Real leather which breathes. The band is plenty big for a large wrist and has enough holes for a small wrist as well. My wrist is a woman m/lg.
5.0,This swimsuit was perfect.
5.0,Very nice and comfortable bras.
5.0,"Love these charms, love the variety of shapes and sizes. Great packing it even comes with a polishing cloth. Good quality for the price."

5.0,I love these pants too sweet!!!
5.0,Working as described. they are adjustable. They aren't incredibly tight so as long as you're not running while using it will be fine.
5.0,"I love that this is a reversible belt with two different colors. One side is brown and the other side is black, which is so cool because it looks like a different belt the next day when you wear it. It gives you a different look. I like that a lot. It feels strong and sturdy. It is not thin or flimsy. I expect this to be able to last a long time. It has a nice thickness and quality to it. There are two prongs and they can go into any of the holes, which make it super easy to adjust if it's too big. You just want to make sure that it is long enough. I bought the 38-40 size and my son is a 39 or 40 at the most but this belt was still too short for him to buckle it comfortably. I should have gone one size up since this only went up to his exact size. I ended up giving this to my nephew who has a smaller waist. It looked very nice on him and he likes it. I received a complimentary product for an honest an unbiased review. However, this review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product whether it is positive or negative, from a customer's standpoint."

5.0,"Although this mesh basket was manufactured by Sun Mountain FOR Sun Mountain, I have bought two of there recently to use on my MGI Zip5 Electric Golf Cart and my wife’s Kangaroo Electric Golf Cart and it works great on both. I am impressed as to how versitaile this<br />product is."
5.0,These joggers definitely have a legging material feel to them but they’re so stretchy and comfy! I’m 5’7” and 165 lbs and ordered my usual medium which fits great but they’re not as roomy in the thighs for me. So if you want a loose fit I’d size up one. Other than that I wouldn’t mind buying every color in these. They’re that comfy!!
5.0,Have your iron ready because shipping through the mail makes wrinkles. Ironed out nicely and it is a very attractive hat.
5.0,I'm in my 60's and am an RN on my feet for 12 hours.  My Dr. advised that I wear compression socks to help with circulation and improve my aching legs after a 12 hour shift.  I'm very happy with my Go2 compression socks.  My legs feel much better after a 12 hour shift.  I will be purchasing more!
5.0,I ordered the large and the fit is perfect.  It’s very soft and comfortable.  I bought the rust color and love it.<br />It’s so comfortable I am going to buy me one in the denim.
5.0,I was concerned that the straps were not adjustable but they work so well I bought a second set.

5.0,I tried a different pair of Aegend goggles before these and they leaked and fogged up significantly. These are amazing. I love them. No fogging issues at all. They have leaked a little but it really was a tiny amount during my 30 minute swim session. Overall I strongly recommend!

5.0,"I bought these gloves and had a slight problem at first.  So I left a not so good review, thinking that nobody cared and it was just another lesson learned. I was wrong, The next day I got a Email from the company saying they were very concerned and wanted to send me some new gloves. ( Blew me away) And they said to keep the other gloves that I hadn't worn, (WOW)  They wanted the faulty pairs back so they could look them over and possibly hunt for a new supplier (yikes) Now this is a company that cares about their customers. I got my new gloves this morning and they look very good and tough, and well stitched. Couldn't be happier. Thank you (Darren with HQ Products) for caring and taking care of us customers.  In this day and time Integrity and quality go a long long ways.  I wont ever order gloves from any other company.  I highly recommend  HQ- products."

5.0,"Cute. They fit perfect my 6 years old daughter, are confortable and warm. Great quality and easy for her ro put on."
5.0,Love these pants! The fit is great and the material does not feel cheap. These are perfect because they can be dressed up or down. I hate my knees so they are my alternative to shorts.
5.0,I love this jacket! It's soft and cozy while still being stylish. Yay!! The zipper glides like a dream. I found it to be the perfect warmth (not too light or heavy).<br /><br />I was worried this jacket would be too bulky looking and visually add 15 pounds. Nope!<br /><br />You can dress this up or down and it's already my new favorite. I'm passing over my other coats and sweaters every day for this one. Might buy another color...<br /><br />Just get it!

5.0,My classroom children loved this outfit!
5.0,"Needed several quality shoe strings for several dress shoes.  The quality is good and feels like the originals from the shoe manufacturer.<br />Size 11 wide dress shoes from J&M.  My arch is not high so the 34"" are perfect.<br />Can switch the colors out fairly quickly, so the variety of colors is ideal."
5.0,Comfortable workout shorts.  My son took them without notice and he likes them.  Must be good.....
5.0,"I use this ring to fasten all sorts of items that don’t come apart to a carabiner. It goes on really quickly and easily, holds securely, and comes off again just as easily.  It maintains its shape, is strong, and won’t corrode. Also, no sharp edges that will cut you like some Ti rings. Great product.<br /><br />May be too “tall” to fit in some keys with small openings."
5.0,"Its beautiful.  It was comfortable and fit me perfect for the photoshoot.  I tried to wear it for my birthday with pasties and tape my boobs never stayed covered! 🙄 im going to sew an elastic from the sides to the back for the next time.<br />The stomach and back could sit flatter too, its how its sewn to the liner kind of like overalls?<br />Im 5'6 1/2  122-125llbs 34b<br /> I ordered a small"

5.0,Love this ring came exactly as pictured.
5.0,Just a good deal
5.0,"I don’t usually buy bikinis online because the fit is so specific, but I needed a last minute costume. Turns out they actually fit really well. No squeezing too tight in the hips to give you love handles. I figured I would only wear them for a night, but I will definitely be wearing them again!"
5.0,"I love this cover up!  At first I considered the black one, but it was sheer in the back, so I opted for the stripes.  Super cute!  Very reasonably priced.  Shipped in a bag and the item was folded over a cardboard sheet so it could easily fit in a mailbox if you're away when it arrives. I couldn't be happier!"
5.0,It arrived on time everything was perfect condition and have included a beautiful velvet case absolutely perfect!!!!

5.0,"We bought these bags for our kids for our recent trip to Paris.  We have LOVED the bags and have used them so far for our trip to Paris and for overnight stuff.  They hold a LOT more than it looks like it would.  Love that the bag zips all the way down both sides so you can load the entire bag instead of having to dig in the whole bag like you would a regular backpack.  I give this product 5 stars--its held up well, its different than your average ""backpack"" and my kids have not complained ONCE about having to lug their own bags.  HIGHLY recommend."
5.0,This is gorgeous but too long even in heels.<br />I am 5'5.
5.0,"This is currently my favorite pen! It's stunningly attractive. The design is beautiful! It has a pearlescent quality which changes as to rotate the pen. The exterior is extremely durable, and I don't foresee it breaking any time soon, if ever. The nib has little flex, but writes extremely smooth; never R/R tracks or falters. This pen definitely needs to be in your collection!"
5.0,very pretty perfect size for single pendant looks nice on a silver chain I put it on and have never taken it off would recommend this to everyone
5.0,I love them! They are made well and they're adorable!
5.0,"A wonderful gift for a himym fan. The material was very good, not a cheap material. It actually looked very fancy and is not itchy or tight when wearing. This tie is perfect for a himym fan as it is very close to the exact tie Barney wears and for a wonderful price."
5.0,Incredible very eye catching.  Do many compliments
5.0,Perfect fit for a large. Nice product
5.0,My wife loves it but wishes it were silver
5.0,Very unique  Good for the price
5.0,"Beautiful, just right"
5.0,"These were perfect, I wear a size 10 shoe and was worried they would be too small but they are great"
5.0,"These are so cute! My sweet baby wore these at Halloween with her Raggedy Ann costume, and then again for Christmas with a dress. We have gotten lots of compliments on them. I ordered these in several colors and we love them all!!"
5.0,Love it💞💗😍😍😍
5.0,"I have to carry 2 cell phones (company and personal) and was looking for something small but could hold both phones. Most smaller purses/clutches have space for 1. This holds both of them nicely plus I can keep money, credit cards, and my ID separate from them. Previously I’ve had a problem with cards coming out when retrieving a phone or cash being shoved to the bottom when putting a phone back in. I will probably order another one in black."
5.0,They fit my oakley fuel cells. I got the protection I was looking for at a much cheaper price than original lenses
5.0,I love the fabric but the color isn't my favorite.
5.0,Beautiful cardigan!! They don't post the size but it came in L (Asian size L) so its more of a medium in American size.
5.0,My husband loved this hat. Fit perfect. Feels good when he wears it. Love therwversible colors. Better than expected.
5.0,Love these shirts and the price is perfect!!!
5.0,Its so soft! One of my favortie hoodies to wear

5.0,It’s durable and cute. Packaged nicely.
5.0,"Looks great, fits well. Went back later and ordered the cloak, too. Had a great time! Highly recommend!"
5.0,Helps me in my marketing
5.0,"this is an awesome and cute little bag. I ordered it for my mother and she loves it. She uses it to take her laptop to and fro work. Even though it has an easter egg design, for the most part, you don't notice it only that it's colorful. Wonderful Buy.  I only paid $6 for it but it's worth at least $20."
5.0,"I've bought two colors, light weight, stylish, yet warm!"
5.0,"Purchased for my son: 5’8” slim and narrow at 110lbs. They fit nice w/out being “sucked” on or skin tight. Not tight in the areas where boys are most concerned about, but spandex like in the legs, ankles and bottom. No slouching or streatch if out and getting baggy! Warm for coke days rowing in 40-50 degree weather."
5.0,I'm saving this for Christmas.  My son will love it!
5.0,Love this suit! Great customer experience:)
5.0,Got here quickly and the hat is just like I expected it to be. Awesome!
5.0,"Cute, simple and perfect for dress or a t and jeans"
5.0,"This shoes are awesome.  My daugher loves them, super comfortable.  Lots of compliments.  Considering buying some other colors."
5.0,Fit my 15 yr old daughter perfectly!
5.0,Bought these to help with one armed dressing after rotator cuff surgery. I was able to put it on and zip up myself just 5 days post op. It was a bit tough the first few weeks as you do have to pull the two ends together in the front but wasn’t impossible.  I was between sizes and went higher hoping the bigger size would allow for less tension when pulling. Glad I did as these fit fine. I am able to wear them to physical therapy and all is well. Even though I bought them for a specific purpose I will continue to wear them after as they are very comfortable.
5.0,This belt works great after 2 months of use.  It seems well constructed and the ratchet effect if very satisfying.  I'll most likely be buying some more colors soon!
5.0,Day 2 of wearing my ears were green.
5.0,Was a little hit hesitant on buying these for my GF. As soon as I received them I knew my gf would love them. They're just like in the pics. Arrived sooner than expected.
5.0,"Made Right,Thanks"
5.0,This bag is a little larger than I thought it would be and a little larger than I needed.  The quality is great and seems like it will last a long time with normal use.
5.0,The dress is so cute and fits me perfectly.  The colors are true and vibrant.
5.0,"The size is perfect. And as someone whom likes organization, I love how this satchel has a zipper pocket and other pockets on either side and the zipper pocket on the outside for quick and easy access. The handbag itself is beautiful and actually textured. The color is just like in the photo online. I would order again!"
5.0,Bought this for our 1st grader she loves it thinks it is super cute and has held up so far
5.0,"I have a pair like this already but wanted a second pair to wear with skirts that were in a little better shape.<br />I love these Sandles and have worn them to the beach, gardening, and going out. They haven't really worn down on the bottom but the finish is not quite as shiny as when new.<br />I had that pair for over a year and still wear them in on a regular basis depending on how dressed up I am."
5.0,Great quality tanks. Will order again
5.0,These cuff links are gorgeous! The picture does not do them justice. I am very very pleased with my purchase! Thank you  Jblue and Amazon :)
5.0,These glasses have greatly improved my sight while driving at night.
5.0,"So nice to have a dangling ornament on my bags, love the excellent quality and the great colors."
5.0,Easy to decorate! Nice project bracelets!
5.0,These are perfect for they gym. I like the fit as well as the added pockets on the side.very comfortable and stretchy I will definitely buy more
5.0,Adjustable fit.
5.0,Love these earrings- they add to any outfit.
5.0,Nice and warm! I can't wait for it to get cold and it fits my big head nicely.
5.0,"This jacket is super cute!  I'm 5'2"", so it sits a bit lower than in the picture, and I'm also a bit hippy, but the waist stretches well, and doesn't look like I'm ""forcing"" (haha, get it?) myself into it.  I would recommend to others!"
5.0,Exactly as expected. Easy to switch.
5.0,The item was rechargeable and fit perfectly. Grandson loves the beanie.
5.0,"I noticed people commenting that these were smaller than pictured, and recognized immediately that the product was pictured on a small woman, so on her, they would be true to size. This being an Asian company or model was something I also considered because when you purchase from Amazon, your purchase is world wide.  On myself, they do not come to the elbow as I assumed they would not so since I expected them to be quarter sleeve length (which is fine with me) I am happy with my purchase. I did not think they were inferior quality, nor did I feel they were itchy. I think they are exactly as pictured, once you consider the model's size. I plan to purchase several more pairs, as my daughters all want a pair now that they have seen mine. :)"
5.0,Nice piece of Jewelry
5.0,"Love this suit.  Well made, Feels expensive.  I’m 5’9 160 and  I bought a large. Top is slightly large, but I’m not heavy chested. Still looks great."
5.0,"Great!  Stay on my face no problem.  I look like a huge dor per my wife but hey, she's stuck with me."
5.0,"Beautiful shawls. These are silky and very comfortable. I am very happy with this purchase. These are shipped from Singapore, so it will take about a month to receive these. Absolutely worth the wait."
5.0,"It took forever to arrive, I mean months, but it is adorable. I love how delicate it is, and it looks just like my cat."
5.0,"Better than expected. I don't think the product description or pics showed that the snaps actually opened and closed. I assumed they were permanently clamped in. Because they opened, it made the whole replacement process a piece of cake!"
5.0,My friend was impressed. She wore it out to dinner that same evening.
5.0,"It's the end of summer camp talent show next week and I have 30 boys who are participating, with 9 being the leads. They are going to look quite sharp and the delivery was swift."
5.0,Excellent for holding up socks
5.0,great watchband.  Doesn't make my wrist sweat like some other bands.
5.0,"Wore it to a wedding. Good material, looks nice. Bow comes off and dress looks nice with or without it."
5.0,It fits perfectly. Nice quality mask
5.0,Just like the picture love love it!!!
5.0,I like the detail!
5.0,"Awesome fit, color, and size is right on. Loving the sweatshirt !!!!!! Have already ordered two more in different colors."
5.0,"For this price it's very nice. Fun summer color, nice size."
5.0,i gave these nice sunglasses to my husband for a xmas gift. he really likes them.they are a good fit
5.0,Love it. Fits as expected. Super cute!
5.0,"I like it, the watch lives up to the description and at 30$ - it isn't bad at all<br /><br />It's very light since it is wooden and quite comfortable to wear and looks great<br /><br />About the only thing that is not great is that the dial is not treated to glow in low light conditions, so in darker conditions,  the watch isn't helpful as you cant read the time. this does seem to be the case for most wooden watches though  from what I can tell"
5.0,"This dress fit's amazing - I am 5'5 1/2 and I weigh 129, the small fit perfect. I didn't think it would fit so well because the price is too great, but the material and everything about this dress was lovely."
5.0,Great for beach
5.0,great hat for the price!
5.0,"Beautiful! High quality, very soft material"
5.0,Very good quality ball.  Would definitely buy again.
5.0,Very comfortable and love the material. The pockets aren’t really big but they do fit your hand. Loved it so much I got the same dress in a long sleeve.
5.0,Either runs small or shrunk a lot in the wash. Ordered the 5t for my son who normally wears 4t because he's skinny and he will probably outgrow these within a couple of months.
5.0,Love it! Soft and comfy! Runs small though so I'm glad I ordered a XL 😊
5.0,Bought this as a gift and she loves it! It's a perfect fit!
5.0,"Very firm, great quality, no case. Some other here include the case."
5.0,These look so great! Arrived in 2 weeks. Came in a cute little box and jewelry bag. They are sparkly and a very nice rose gold color. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Super cool glasses. My son loved them and they are really sturdy. Good for toddler hands.
5.0,"Dragon Radar arrived with a dead battery. Package says they are non-replaceable and not to open it up.<br /><br />Otherwise it is very heavy and not something you'd want to use on a car keychain because you could damage the ignition.<br /><br />The capsules are great quality, bigger than I expected, and even have an o-ring with the threads.<br /><br />Requested replacement, will change review if I get a working Dragon Radar.<br /><br />UPDATE: Replacement package (all three items) arrived next day. Dragon Radar works now, click the top button and it displays three Dragon Balls, flashes 5 times and makes the iconic noise. Neat little trinket. Just a shame its too heavy for a keychain."
5.0,It really surprised me how well made is this belt
5.0,Nice sturdy chain for the price.
5.0,I really like the purple color of this sweater. Too often a dark color has a faded look which I don't like. The color here  was deep and beautiful. The fit was just right.
5.0,"I bought these gloves last year for driving during Montana's long cold winters.  I love the way they fit.  If I wear them to walk my dog when it's in the 30's degree weather, my fingers do get cold, but I always have cold fingers. They are not the type of glove to wear outside in really cold weather, they are meant for driving.  They are comfortable, not too tight.  They are my favorite pair of gloves.  I wanted to order another pair for next winter but unfortunately they were out of stock in the medium/large size.  I hope they get more in.  I highly recommend these gloves."
5.0,"Great product.  Perfect size, love the necklace.<br />Beautiful.  Great packaging."
5.0,"I managed to get 2 in XS, and they are confortable and fit just right.  Being a 30D, I tend to struggle finding clothes small enough in the ribcage area, so I was thankful when I found these at a decent price. I get compliments on the style and colors. One of mine had more darker colors while the other more brighter with more green, yellow, and orange."
5.0,"I'm obnly 5 ft 2 so it covered me mid-thig.  The material is soft and nice without beeing too light. looks fine with legging but I can also imagine dressing it up a bit, if I wanted.  I purchsed the pink flowers on the grey and cam4e back hoping for the gree one but they're already out of stock."
5.0,"The beanie is really good. My husband found it really helpfull he sometimes work nights and says that it really helps when your hands are full and you need a flashlight. The bluetooth is an extra when working alone or else everyone else can hear. But its a 3 in 1  it warms , has bluetooth and a flashlight. The best part no batteries you can usb charge it ! Awsome product for the price, the Material is soft and stretchable."
5.0,I love this dress and the fit I love amazon
5.0,This swimsuit is very beautiful and I was very pleased that I ordered one size up cause now I don't have to return and reorder anything.
5.0,Perfect!!! I'm happy... Good quality and comfortable shoes
5.0,These fit beautifully and don’t move at all
5.0,I didn’t want to get a fake gold watch and cannot afford a real good watch so this is what I pair with my gold chain. Fits the bill. Keeps good time and is vintage digital cheese.
5.0,I ordered the gray color and it does look exactly as pictured. The sizing runs slightly small so if you want a looser fit I suggest ordering up 2 size. Washed and dried in dryer before wearing so it may have shrunk.
5.0,My son likes these boots a lot.
5.0,Very nice and the fabric is so soft has a good stretch to them
5.0,They're fabulous!  Not too tight; not too loose; just right!  And so soft!
5.0,"My niece loved it! The look on her face when she opened the box was so sweet. Very sparkly, the chain is AWESOME. It's not a flimsy piece of junk that'll fall apart at the slightest touch or tug. It's a nice, solid chain. Perfect for a little girl."
5.0,"These are really cute boot cuffs ... and kind of hard to review because they're just boot cuffs ... but I'll tell you what I know.<br /><br />Shipping was quick and painless.  These were delivered via USPS and the padded envelope was left in my mailbox.  Easy.<br />They were wrapped in thick clear plastic, so no worries about germs or being damp from the outdoor weather or anything like that.<br />They were professionally packaged, meaning there was a cardboard insert.  You can tell these are produced and not just something that someone has used and is giving away.<br />The quality is great.  They are thick and heavy-duty and are really constructed well.<br />Probably most important, the color to me doesn't seem 100% white.  These are more of a bone color - a very lightly tinted off-white.  I don't know why it seems to be so difficult to find 100% white boot cuffs or boot socks?!<br /><br />Anyway, the instructions say to hand-wash and I'd agree.  You definitely don't want to toss these in the regular laundry or I think they'd shrink or get misshapen.  The lace, buttons, crochet, everything is really pretty.  They fit well - I'm about 5'2&#34; and 120 pounds with proportionate-sized calves - these are neither too tight nor am I afraid of them slipping.  They do say &#34;one size&#34; and I can see that these would fit a range of shapes.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty pleased.  I wish they were totally white as they claim, but you can even sort of tell from the stock photo that they aren't.  I took a chance and it didn't pan out, but for the price, I'm sure I'll still use them."
5.0,My niece totally loves it. Wears it everyday since. Even showers with it.
5.0,"Little snug, but really cute and worth the $!"
5.0,"As soon as my grand daughter saw this, she had to borrow it to snuggle up and watch a movie in, and I don’t blame her one bit!  This blanket hoodie is so soft and snuggly, like wearing a hug!  Perfect for keeping warm on cold winter evenings and doesn’t slide off when you get up like a blanket or throw does…you can even sleep in it!"
5.0,I found it really made nicely and very soft. I have not warn it or washed it but trying it on it was really nice
5.0,"Great quality, fast shipping!"
5.0,Very cute! Love them!
5.0,"Very versatile,  easy to carry, roomy."
5.0,"I was tired of carrying around a phone, wallet and keys when most of my pant pockets won't accommodate it. I know can carry everything, and then some. I have an iPhone 6s Plus with a case and it fits fine. A ton of credit card slots. Leather smells genuine. I like it a lot so far. Will probably get some flack for having a &#34;purse,&#34; but don't really care. Think I might put a Bluetooth tracker in the wallet too in case I lose it somewhere."
5.0,The belt is made out of really nice leather and I think it will last me a long time compared to my other belts.
5.0,"The quality of the material was very nice.  It included an inner tie as well as the outer belt which others had complained about in previous reviews, so that was a nice surprise.  Colors are vibrant and it came nicely wrapped.  I haven't washed it yet or had it cleaned but so far so good."
5.0,I love the quality and colors!
5.0,"It is actually not as sheer as it looks, rather a less sheer black but is still very pretty."
5.0,My wife absolutely loves it.
5.0,Super cute. Love the colors! I've been looking at earrings from this designer too. Nice job! Thanks!
5.0,Love it! )
5.0,Fantastic Buy!!!!!!
5.0,This is a great umbrella!
5.0,"When it arrived, the lenses was popped out but it snapped back in easily and my son loves them. They have been pretty durable since then."
5.0,Nice 2 piece swimsuit and it is soft to the touch. I believe it is worth the money in my opinion.
5.0,love love it for work
5.0,The color was perfect. The product fits well.
5.0,Dunno why I ever waited to change straps. This thing is 100% just magnifecnet. This watch has quickly become my favorite
5.0,"These were a gift to my grandchildren, which makes them extra special as they use them at their house, not mine. :-}"
5.0,"Excellent product, everything is just as the description."
5.0,"Nice big coffee cup, really pretty color too. I liked the review about the ceramic not messing with the taste of tea, I haven’t noticed any taste changes either but I never would have thought about it until I read that review."
5.0,Needed a storage bag for my Honda Ridgeline cargo bed net...very sturdy and was a perfect fit...
5.0,"Inexpensive.  $1,00.  Bought spouse 2 pair.."
5.0,"Ordered these in different colors.  Nice, light, fits well but a bit long.  Husband 6'2"", 190 lbs, ordered large size,, a bit long.  I bought for husband."
5.0,"This is truly an excellent wallet for under ten dollars.  Mine is slightly different than the photos here as it only has one ID slot and doesn't have a piece that flips / folds out on that end of the wallet.  The look and feel of the wallet it excellent and it does not suffer from the dreaded odor that so many PU leather items have.<br /><br />I really like the slots for carrying around a couple of memory cards as they're easy to forget and if I'm out shooting photos on my camera or recording audio on my Zoom recorder it's always good to have a spare card on me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the prominent logo on the front, but that's pretty easy to overlook at this price-point.<br /><br />Overall this is a really nice wallet.  Recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review."
5.0,I never order clothes online. I'm a nursing mom to a 5 month old and had 2 kids in 2  years so my body is foreign to me now & I usually need to try everything on. My gamble on this top paid off! It fits and best of all it is flattering! It slimmed my body and I didn't even notice my mom belly. I pretty much want to wear it every day! Super happy!
5.0,My husband loves this and it’s great quality.
5.0,I had my first pair of peppers 7 or 8 years ago I fell in love with the clarity and the way they made things look. I was skeptical to order these Eclipse G15 sunglasses. I figured since they didn't cost much I would try. I'm glad I did! They aren't my favorite style frames but they are really comfortable feeling for me. I can wear them most of the day with no problems. The lenses are my favorite part. Clear and polarized just right. In between dark and light shading. I will be buying another pair cause I'm rough on glasses. They are also my semi safety glasses for me. Been wearing everyday since I got them and not a scratch yet! I have treated them like a baby cause I like them that much!
5.0,Perfect for our Bears / Star Wars fan Son-in-Law.
5.0,"Product arrived on time and is much better quality than I expected. The modes are great for the soccer official as it has a clock that counts down from an adjustable preset time as well as a stoppage time counter that will count up until stopped. The official time counter will then continue through to stoppage time and begin beeping once the end of stoppage has been reached. Great watch, great quality, best part is the price. Very pleased and will buy this again."
5.0,"Bought 2, 1 for each of my daughters. They love them! Super cute and lightweight."
5.0,Arrived as promised--product was in excellent condition. Would buy from this vendor again.
5.0,I love my little baby Todoroki hanging from my keys. I even have got a compliment so far! From a cvs worker shout out to him. Anyways yeah
5.0,"I have a fat wide face (sexy, yes I know) so it's very hard to find specs that don't look like glasses laying on the surface of the moon. In fact a girl once said when I leaned down to kiss her it was like the moon falling on her face. Needless to say we didn't date. Her loss totally. I digress, the shades are awesome and look quite stylish. They extend slightly pass my eyes which was exactly what i wanted. I wear them all the time whilst driving in my stylish mini cooper with the sun roof peeled back.<br />I'm so hot I can't stand it. Girls are literally running down the expressway chasing me on foot trying to get a glimpse of my sexy pie face. Step aside ladies, I got it make it home to my baby, the one I see each day when I look in the mirror. Enough about this product. Someone write a review about me buying another pair of these badass shades!"
5.0,Kids would love them.
5.0,"I wear a 36dd and I ordered a Large. Fits perfectly! Comfortable, not compressing. Actually fits around ribs and gives support! Win, win!!!"
5.0,These masks are well made and fit well
5.0,"For about 60 bucks, how can you go wrong? Well, I guess you could but you won't with these eyeglasses. They are durable, comfortable, and look great."
5.0,"Beautiful, pretty comfortable and fits perfectly ! Also the color and style is just so easy to match"
5.0,Grand daughter loved them. True to size:)
5.0,"This dress fits as expected. It's super comfortable and helps hide bloat, which is important for me."
5.0,Comes with two covers that are very sturdy and will stay in the opening regardless of conditions.
5.0,Birthday present for Daughter. Little bigger than expected but she grow out of them later than sooner.
5.0,it run a little small but streches
5.0,Fit a little weird on my back because I’m short and curvy but I still loved it for my graduation pics!
5.0,"I bought these headbands for my guy, who has longer hair that falls into his face at times. He loves them! He has worn every color. He likes the patterns, especially the skulls. He also likes that they are long enough for him to bunch, tie, pull down like a ski mask, etc.  Great quality and variety for a low price. We bought only one headband like this at a retail store, and it was $8 on sale."
5.0,"a little bigger than I expected, it’s like a normal sized purse not smaller but honestly I could use the extra space so I love it!"
5.0,"This is everything I expected!! Comfortable, perfect fit, flattering and love the shorts underneath (no chafing)!!<br />Bonus it looks like a skirt and not workout shorts so you can feel dressy BUT at the same time throw on a T and sneakers and go for a casual hike or a day at the amusement park. Perfect for traveling and easy to care for.  If you are considering getting, go for it you won’t regret it!!"
5.0,Lindas quedaron perfectas
5.0,"My 5yr old looks super cool in his new shades. 😎 I purchased the navy ones because the navy colored frame looks cool but it has a purple tint to it which really stands out in the sun. He's gotten used to the tint but when he first put them on he said ""everything looks purple!"" Even though it has that tint to it we still like the look and feel of them and I'll be buying another pair."
5.0,"Stylish and fun, frames are on the big side."
5.0,Bought bpem for my girl and she loves em🔥
5.0,Cute and comfortable and made well and size is on target for label
5.0,Totally cool...
5.0,I love this bracelet. I purchased one for myself and now bought a second one for a gift.
5.0,"I am 5'10'' so I'm always skeptical to purchase pants online due to the length, but these turned out to be a great fit and a good length for me.  They are good medium weight, not as heavy as a sweat pant, but not thin either.  The inside is a soft fleece-like material, so I've been toasty warm when wearing them.  Very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again."
5.0,"Cool, hip pants for the goth athleisure style. Love them."
5.0,"Softness, cute design"
5.0,"Love - super cute on, absolutely love!!!"
5.0,These caps fit well and look great.
5.0,Very cute!  fits well
5.0,Got soooo many compliments on this dress for a work holiday party. Can't believe it was this affordable.
5.0,I thought the sweater would be cut a little larger. I have received many compliments.
5.0,Great fit!  As pictured!
5.0,"I purchased this watch for my husband for Christmas.  The Invicta watch he had was broken in a fall and I wanted to get him something less bulky, but which looked good and impressive.  I was a little worried he might not like the black color, though I thought it looked rather ""executivish"".  I needn't have worried as he loves it!  The price was more than reasonable and the watch is beautiful!"
5.0,"This would have been a great gift for a grandmother or mother. I actually used it for my son's confirmation sponsor. The three rings are her, God, and my son. I wrote up some wording and inserted under the necklace. It is simple, but has so much meaning."
5.0,Wore these the other day.  Got many compliments.  Love them.
5.0,Cute pjs.
5.0,"Exactly what I need, restore & protect  my heritage boots"
5.0,Nice looking and very comfy
5.0,"I love this collection! only they put one zebra, I would like to have two zebras and be available to make an earrings!"
5.0,Was ordered and received by Christmas and was a big hit to the person that received it. Was in excellent condition and good quality
5.0,super stylish and a nice quality feel! :)
5.0,I'm nineteen but this fits perfectly and looks amazing on me. I love it
5.0,"Just gorgeous to slip my phone, camera and gloves into on my wedding day!  Small and sleek enough to look classy and elegant, and big enough to hold those little extras in a beautiful sparkly purse."
5.0,I took it apart and used the charms in a necklace.  Very nice!
5.0,Liked this tunic so much thatI bought four more. Love the material too.
5.0,"Beautiful colors, very comfortable fit!  Definitely a short dress if you are less than 5' 4&#34;.  I have received many complements on it already."

5.0,"The rosary is beautiful and well made.  Every detail has excellent craftsmanship.<br /><br />It has a smell of incense, or it could be the wood itself.  Either way, it's a nice smell.<br /><br />This is well worth the price."

5.0,"I’m a pretty petite person, 4’11 and about 100 lbs, since this whole pandemic started it’s been impossible to find masks that fit me like a normal mask would. I figured maybe a children’s mask would fit and these are PERFECT."
5.0,Love it fits perfectly.
5.0,I absolutely love this top. It's super soft and the button and lettuce edge detailing is so cute. I normally wear a size small. I wore this the other night going out with some jeans but I also think it would make a great layering shirt for under a graphic tee.
5.0,"Shirt allows for so much airflow, but still covers up all the front. Love working out in this shirt."
5.0,These look amazing and are of fabulouse quality.
5.0,They came just as advertised!! There the perfect size and look amazing! Even prettier when your wearing them!<br />I Highly recommend!
5.0,"As always, Mordenmiss came through!  I love this brand."
5.0,Perfect for my little princess and reasonably priced!
5.0,"I own many PB tops and decided to purchase a sweater. I am not a huge fan of acrylics but the blue was such a lovely color, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.  It's very denim-friendly, washes well, and no pilling so far. I am 5'2"", 100 lbs, and a 36C and I got the small (my usual) which fits true to size: not too tight but figure flattering and warm. Would love to see this in more colors!"
5.0,Love it!! It was 4 days late but its beautiful!! And fits amazing!
5.0,"Great glasses, perfect fit for my 6 year old. Love the color. Highly recommend!"
5.0,I recommend getting 1 size smaller for a fitted look. It fits & looks good... Just don't like the fact that it's shiny
5.0,"38 in waist / 5 ft 7, I ordered a large and it fits pretty tight, but in a good way. I could go one size up but I'm pretty satisfied with the large. The material is great, very sturdy."
5.0,Love this frame
5.0,Stylish and fits perfect. Great bike jersey. Make sure you order 2 sizes up for USA buyers.
5.0,Very cute! 10/10
5.0,I havent exposed them to water yet or had them on for long so I don’t know how they are long-term but as of right now they’re really cute and the metal is pretty strong
5.0,It is good for whom are not too fashionable
5.0,I really like this turban and plan to wear it a lot.
5.0,The hat is well made and is adjustable velcro strap in the back so you can adjust to fit. Great way to show your support for law enforcement officers.
5.0,Very nice cuff links
5.0,"The slippers were very popular with my grandson. I thought that the large size was too small since he's a size 12, but they fit just fine."
5.0,"I got  my first one in wine in style 1 and I love it.  I got a second in style 2 and it is too big.  The neck is so large that I can't keep my bra straps from showing.  It is also not the color blue that it showed in the picture but I actually liked it better.  It is a soft grayish blue.  But I will have to send it back.  I'll probably get another in style 1.  I haven't washed it yet so don't know if it will shrink.  But really like the fabric.  Style 1 fits nicely a 5'1 1/2 tall, 40 chest.  5 stars for 1 and 4 for 2."
5.0,Well made heavy duty
5.0,It's strong and nice looking chain. I love it!
5.0,"Nice fit, closes with magnetic flap. Includes mini stylus."
5.0,love love love them! even with plantar facitis
5.0,"Wore these pants during my 2016 Warrior Dash obstacle course race. They withstood mud, dirt, water and sand. Took a beating, washed up and still look great!<br /><br />Highly recommend these!"
5.0,"These are snuggly soft and cozy. Can be worn with a longer shirt, or under roomy jeans. Nice and stretch but don’t lose their shape. Great color choices."
5.0,"These are the perfect length for me. I am 5’2”. The denim is good quality, they have actual pockets, and the belt that comes with them is cute. I really am pleased with the purchase!"
5.0,Adorable bracelet. Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The charms and bracelet are a perfect size and seem to be pretty durable. She loves all the different positions of the gymnasts.
5.0,bought more need i say more
5.0,It is well worth the money. If fact I think you get more than your monies worth. It does run about one size small.
5.0,Fits perfectly...absolutely love wearing them as they are so comfortable. Material is soft.
5.0,These were long lasting durable an cute. They have 3 dots on the side but they dont light up.
5.0,"Skid-proof, comfy, and adorable!"
5.0,"Loved this - the detailing is what sets these apart from plan white gold hoops. They are petite, but that is another reason I like them so much."
5.0,I love them it looks like a real piercing. I recommend i get compliments all the time that they love it.
5.0,"Dasein never disappoints I'm always pleased with their handbags. I've wanted a bag this style for awhile, when I ran across this bag at a great price I couldn't resist. The bag is stylish, large, well made,  and well priced. The only con is it's heavy. So while it can hold a lot &#34;pack light&#34; if weight is a problem for you. The lining  of  the bag is detachable, you can car carry it alone, the lining is well-made also."
5.0,"These are warm, stay up nicely.  They come up to just below the middle of my knee (I am 5'6"").  I bought them more for warmth than style as I was sporting a walking boot cast all winter and my foot and legs were getting cold.  They did the job nicely on the walking boot foot."
5.0,"Fits just right, love the color!"
5.0,Awesome shirt. Great for getting your sweat on.
5.0,Very nice product in a reasonable price
5.0,Got this for my dad at Christmas.  The leather is nice and it opens up great and stands up.  It's great quality.
5.0,LOVE!!!! I am 5'7 and 155lbs and curvy. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. I am small chested and the top is a but big but nothing noticeable to anyone but me. I am going to order more now that I know my size!
5.0,We bought for our wedding and they were perfect!
5.0,"My 8th pattyboutik top and it might be my favorite. Sooooo soft, warm and flattering!! Love this brand and this top!!"
5.0,My son killed a new shoes in a few days because he was in transition to walk. This pair has thicker rubber at front so made them last a lot longer. I am so happy that I found this pair to last a little longer.
5.0,Easy to adjust to fit my wrist and love the look of it.
5.0,Excellent item. Good solid quality.
5.0,"Was able to go a size smaller for my daughter, and they fit her great! They are a little hard for her to get on, but I think just because she’s only 9. They are good quality so far, we will buy some more if these last through the wash! We haven’t had any issues so far, but time will tell."
5.0,Very soft and comfy.  Will buy this in another color.
5.0,Great fit and a great price.  Bought the neon yellow pair. If there’s a quick comfortable way to put on compression sleeves I haven’t figured it out. But once they’re on I can feel them working.
5.0,Product fits great and is a nice smooth material. Feels like butter! Perfect length and works well with high waisted leggings. Great staple clothing item.
5.0,Love. Nicer than I even expected
5.0,"If you're wondering what the difference is between these leggings and the LLR brand here it is: it's the waistband.<br /><br />These leggings have just a simple waistband of elastic, while the LLR have a more supported waist band that almost fit like a snug pair of yoga pants. With the LLR I felt like my fat was getting sucked in and I had more support. I'm afraid at this point it's just a matter of preference, because they both feel exactly the same and pretty much fit exactly the same (except for the waistband).<br /><br />For me, I found these leggings to be far more comfortable than LLR. I deal with chronic stomach inflammation and these are like the best thing for that. I may &#34;hang out&#34; a bit more but when I pair them with a tunic top and you can't tell. At all. They cling and hold up just like LLR. The price really helps in the decision too!<br /><br />Overall, I was impressed with this brand and will continue to purchase. They also have many of the styles in youth sizes so my daughter is excited she can match Mommy!"
5.0,"LOVE THIS!!! SOOOO COMFY&EASY TO CARE FOR.<br />WASHES GREAT &I Air-dry MOST ALL MY THINGS. THE FIT IS PERFECT;NO PILLING, STILL LOOKS &FEELS BRAND NEW.************(PERSONALLY --*SO***COMFORTABLE TO WEAR @DR.S-& CHEMO. )"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for!  I previously had the silver metal band with magnet clasp, which I liked but kept getting stuck on metal objects (refrigerator, chairs, etc).  This band was initially heavier than expected but I've adapted and absolutely love it."
5.0,Sweater is soft and warm. Fits a bit oversized.  Could have worn ca but a is fine.  Winter<br />Staple.
5.0,Love the colors and fit great on my daughter
5.0,Loved this shirt. Ran a little big.
5.0,"Very pretty, looks like Amazon advertised."
5.0,Love these. They fit perfect and hold up well. They stand up well through the washer and dryer also. The only thing I don't like is the removable straps.
5.0,"I wish I could give this purse more than 5 stars because I think it deserves an even higher review. I love this purse so much! I love the satchel ability as well as the handbag ability this purse gives. It has lots of room and pockets! I also love the grey color, very cute! I would highly recommend this bag to anyone who enjoys a good satchel purse/bag with lots of room!"
5.0,Perfecto y me encantó el color ❤️
5.0,"Tight, spandex material, but very flattering! Tight on the abdomen and fans out to an almost a-line very nicely. Comfortable material and I love the longer sleeve length. Not short but not 3/4 either. Just perfect."
5.0,Not as magnetic as other bracelets I own ( washing dishes with the other bracelets the dishware stuck to me) but because I love the style it doesn’t matter !  I pray it brings me the health benefits!
5.0,Nice workout top to wear under open-back shirts for a fun look.
5.0,I needed a shoulder strap for my carry on so I could be hands free when traveling and this worked perfectly.
5.0,The vest works exactly as described. I sweat a lot with this. The only issue I have found is that the zipper pull on the vest is on the opposite side that I’m used to. Not a big deal; just a little awkward.
5.0,Love it!!  Looks great!!
5.0,Slim fitting and very nice quality.
5.0,Works great in 20mm with my Casio vintage calculator watch (CA53W-1) - now people think it's something new & hip not nerdy & old! lol! The quick release pins make it very easy to swap out straps and the gray or red make the black watch face really pop. The packaging is very customer friendly - comes with the pro tool for removing the strap pin and a set of regular pins in case you don't want to use the quick release set. Will definitely be ordering some more colors!
5.0,These bags are awesome. They hold so much and they're easy to bring along wherever I go. I use them all the time and they are holding up great. Very sturdy. I love the fact that I can throw them in the washer. HIGHLY recommend these.
5.0,I bought these bands for my daughter who has a very slim wrist. These bands are adorable and they fit her good. She loves them.
5.0,The strap is nice and easy for my son to put on and take off by himself. Very soft and the sandal is comfortable. Has lasted longer than we expected.
5.0,Love these glasses. 2nd time buying them had the rose color the first time. Lasted about two years before completely broke. Worth it to me for the price. Cute accessory
5.0,I love these sucks. They look beautiful and feel great.
5.0,A little dorky but work great.
5.0,Fits well and good price
5.0,Started wearing these about 2 months ago and my legs and feet feel great. They help the circulation in my legs immensely. I don't feel like I'm dragging my feet along and I'm much warmer in the winter cold. It is a quality product and holds up very well to repeated use. I have four pairs now and will probably be buying more in the near future.
5.0,I started with the copper and needed a few more pairs and decided to try another brand which lead me here and ended up ordering more so i can wear everyday. i don't even use the copper now
5.0,Best slacks ever.  Just as nice a Betabrand at a fraction of the cost.  Wish they came in Tall White.
5.0,These are adorable! They fit my size 10 foot just fine.. soft and not cheap feeling.
5.0,Nice quality appears it will last a while
5.0,So cute and beachy. Love it.
5.0,"durable. comfortable, paintable."
5.0,"I'm confused by the pictures... is that just a reflection on the shiny surface, or does it have some kind of design/cutout on it?  Is it just a plain band?"
5.0,Just a bit larger than I anticipated however this tote is perfect
5.0,Good deal!!
5.0,Very comfortable and I can wear it with shorts escort leggings or jeans.
5.0,"Amazing sunglasses, I have gotten endless compliments on my wood frame glasses. These are both stylish and practical. I am looking for other wood framed sunglasses."
5.0,I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it great buy!!
5.0,"Grabs attention but isn't too revealing if you are traveling with family. Flattering and comfy, everything stays in place no matter what you're doing.<br /><br />Small size fit perfect for me at 5'2&quot;, 117lbs, 34b."
5.0,"Crossback shout-out. Solves a big problem, goodbye Victoria's Secret!"

5.0,I'm in the medical field and my hair is long I am able to tuck all of my hair under this cap:)
5.0,Such beautiful
5.0,Bought these in addition to a pack of three hook extenders.  Perfect for a new bra I brought (same bra in a different color fit fine - go figure).  Wore it for the day and I have no complaints.
5.0,"The package was received promptly, and in very good condition. The earrings themselves are rather pretty, and the clasp mechanism works very smoothly. Would love to purchase this product again."
5.0,"Great product, beautiful and vibrant color. Will buy more of this in a different color. I brought a large."
5.0,Love the ease of this garment! It’s light weight but covers everything.  Great to through on while I cool down after a long walk.
5.0,"Love this dress. Good material.  I’m 5’ 4”, 160lbs ordered medium/size 8. Fit perfectly."
5.0,Makes you look snatched. I love it. Not itchy at all. Comfy too. Worth it.
5.0,Elastic in waistband gets twisted easily
5.0,I found this to combine with insulated coveralls that did not have a hood.  I think this will do the trick.  Seems to be sturdy and high-Qualiy.
5.0,These shoes were a replacement for a previously owned pair.
5.0,This is a very comfortable shirt it fits just right . Maurice
5.0,They fit well. I have a narrow face and they look right. I love the tortie classic look. Not to mention everything looks better with them on!!
5.0,This dress is awesome.  The material is light and soft.  It fits very nicely.  Best of all...it has POCKETS!!!!
5.0,Ok this is one of my favorite pieces of jewelry i bought so far!
5.0,"Perfect for my conch piercing, it's small and fits close to the ear so it never looks like it's going to fall out."
5.0,Well fitted (slim) going just below waist.  Comfortable pique-type fabric in a rich midnight blue.  Interesting collar adds nice visual impact.  Can go styled up or more chilled per the other accoutrements.

5.0,"Works good to glean and Polish silver, gold & gemstones"
5.0,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
5.0,Perfect for my 8 year old sister's first communion! The mask was a bit large but we were able to finagle it so that it fit her! It matched her dress perfectly!
5.0,My son is proud to dress up for a wedding without having a tight tie on. Tie sits at neck without being stiff at the collar.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet with an inspiring message. It is a great product! I would definitely buy again!
5.0,Love these ! My 6 year old was so excited!
5.0,Nice slim fit shirt! Amazing price! It’s hard to find good slim fitting shirts and this one is great!
5.0,"After I purchased my 1st Cowcow dress I  immediately went back to Amazon and started my Cowcow Wishlist and today I can proudly say that I have 100's in my list, but I own at least one maybe 2 for every month of the year from seasonal to just fun or funny. I plan on collecting several more as time goes on."
5.0,"After reading such horrible reviews, I was reluctant on buying this! But I’m sooo glad I took a chance and bought it anyway!! It is exactly like the picture! I wore it out the night I received it and I got so many compliments! Everyone thought they were separate necklaces!"
5.0,Fabric is thin but it looks great hanging up. White letters are bold so that's good. Great price. Fast delivery.
5.0,The shirts were everything I thought they would be! Good quality too!!
5.0,I could sleep in these things. They are lined with fleece so they're warm on a chilly day but feel silky on the outside. Easy to dress up or down
5.0,"My mother mentioned to me she would be having a weekend getaway in a snow-covered cabin so I immediately looked for warm clothing for her. She fell in love with this winter hat as she claimed it was very soft, warm and of great quality. Her satisfaction made me want to come and recommend this to any interested buyers."
5.0,We ordered this for my daughter to wear to a wedding. It looked great on her.
5.0,Great Quality. Fit perfectly!
5.0,"Beautiful!  Will buy again from them, thank you!"

5.0,Es un bonito vestido ajusta perfecto es arriba de la rodilla me encanto
5.0,They are so lightweight and look so expensive. Great product for the price!
5.0,"Second Scarleton purse and I love both of them! I carried my other one for two years! It's still in good shape, just wanted to change things up a bit. I love the color and the style. These bags are more &#34;flimsy&#34; as in if you set it down, it will not hold it's shape. This is something that does not personally bother me but I can see how someone may not like that. It's a soft faux leather, very nice feel. Plenty of space on the inside. I'm pleased with my purchase!"
5.0,This is a quality product that fits straightaway and will suit you right down to the ground.
5.0,So glamorous and comfortable.  I really loved wearing this around the pool area on my cruise.
5.0,great. Go tigers
5.0,"I love these leggings! They have great compression and the high waist stays up well (it doesn't roll when bending over). The material is also amazing, super buttery, feels a lot like LuLu"
5.0,It's very pretty and stylish. Love it !
5.0,These are well made from high quality material. Fit is perfect!
5.0,Made little girl happy!! Print and colors true and fits true to size.
5.0,"Ladies, this is THE perfect dress! I must admit, I was skeptical to purchase a dress online. I have large breasts, and a lot of times, even using sizing charts, things don't fit up top because it goes by bust line and not cup size. So even though I'm a 38, I'm a DDD or F, so sometimes clothes just don't fit right. This dress was sized perfectly (I bought an XL).<br /><br />It came rather quickly; I'm so used to Prime, it was hard to wait! But I ordered it March 24 and received it April 5, so less than two weeks from order to receipt. The dress came in a compact package so it was a little wrinkly, but I just hung it up and let it kind of fall out for two days, and it was mostly fine. You can see in one picture how it's still a little wrinkly, but I don't iron! I might throw it in the dryer.<br /><br />I didn't realize it had subtle black outlines around the neckline and bow, but it worked out beautifully with black heels. I'm 5'3&#34;, and the dress hit just below my knees and flared out so prettily. With heels, I looked like a 1940s model!<br /><br />I highly recommend this dress; it's affordable and beautiful and well made. The material is a bit stretchy and I don't even have to unzip the back to get it on! It's comfortable, it breathes and it flows nicely and gives me a pretty shape. I received this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I'm so happy I got to try it because it's a beautiful dress. I'm considering the one in red next!"
5.0,"Not quite black, not quite gray, it is nice to go with jeans or any color pants. Good looking sweatshirt!"
5.0,The extra padding on these socks are not just visibly apparent but you can feel how much more padded they are and they don't seem to lose their elasticity after 3 washes. Usually the padded parts fray but so far this one is not showing any signs of cheapness. I wear these type of sox all the time due to my Morton's neuroma. My job requires me to stand all day which is usually not a problem but without the right kind of footwear your day and night get complicated really fast.  I simply love these sox for that pain issue i don't have to deal with anymore.
5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She loves it. She said it is her favorite Christmas gift.
5.0,Looks exactly like the one on the show. I am very happy with it. Doesn't breath very well so I wouldn't suggest wearing on a hot day.
5.0,thinking of buying the other 2  colors!!
5.0,Slim wallet. Perfect for pockets. Sturdy material. Friend loved it as his bday gift.
5.0,"Very good fit, material seems very good and durable. Joints are a little bit stiff, but will probably loosen up with wear."
5.0,These are very comfortable pajamas and i would definitely buy them again.
5.0,My daughter tells me this is the only polo that she feels comfortable in for her school uniform. (She is 12 but she wears an adult large in clothing.)  Nice material and fits as expected.  It also washes well.
5.0,Great quality and fits my 3 year olds head and my 1 year olds head.
5.0,Very convenient and effective. I never take the watch off. There is no need for a pricey watch.
5.0,in love with it!!!
5.0,LOVE IT!! I love the fact that it is a metal case with some very ice soft felt lining the inside of this case. Felt does not leave any type of residue on your glasses.
5.0,My husband wears ties frequently & he looks great.  He always gets complimented.
5.0,These are made of good material and fit great...very comfy.
5.0,"Beautiful earings, I hope the wife likes it."
5.0,"They are worth the money, I use them for work and they are very comfortable."
5.0,"I wore these the first night I got them.  The night prior, I had woken several times with night sweats and I was miserable.  These are so comfortable and soft.  I slept through the night and I was cool and dry.  I woke up this morning and immediately ordered another set.  I have also recommended and sent links to my Mom and my best friend.  I am going to order a few more sets and throw out all my gross nightgowns."
5.0,Can wear comfortably all day
5.0,"These look even better in person than in the picture.  They fit true to size; if you are someone who needs wide sizes these will probably be fine, as the design allows the shoe to kind of open up.  I wear regular sizes and they fit me fine with a little extra room around the ankle.  The material feels sturdy and well-crafted.  I can't wait for cold weather to arrive so I can really start wearing these!"
5.0,Fit as expected.  I’m normally a womens small and ordered a medium for it to be loose.
5.0,I loved these earrings.  They were just what I wanted and I had fun wearing them through the St. Patrick's Day holidays.  I liked that I could wear them with any color I was wearing--not just if I was wearing green.
5.0,"I love these. They are super easy and cute. They dont fall off unless you brush your hand against it hard. other than that, they stay put. So many compliments."
5.0,Love the shirts. Fit very well :)
5.0,"I’m about a 16, I think bigger than an 18 might be pushing it if you’re blessed with meat on your thighs and backside"
5.0,"I love it! I love floral so this is perfect. I got the size 44m SMALL, and it’s perfect!! In the picture I pulled it out to show how much it can stretch, I can literally (I actually did it to be sure lol) for both hands and wrists in this band, the small size. But what’s great about that is when it’s just regularly on my wrist it’s not tight or lose! It doesn’t move around when I shake my hand. It’s just perfect!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It’s perfectly fitted and is classic in its silhouette. I have other HOMEYEE dresses, so I knew to size up. I usually wear an 8 in brands like Calvin Klein, White House Black Market, etc, but in HOMEYEE I always order an XL. Sadly, I had to return this dress because it was just a tad too short for my liking. I am 5’6”, but am proportioned to have longer legs, so it came right above my knee. I would’ve loved it at knee, or slightly below. Oh well. It’s still a lovely dress and I highly recommend this seller for its quality of items and fabric. All of my HOMEYEE dresses are thicker fabric, never see through."
5.0,"Order your size. DON'T order a size up. I'm very large breasted with an hourglass shape. I ordered up to accommodate my chest size, and the dress was too large. This NEVER happens to me. I ordered the size I would normally be, and it fit like a dream. It's gorgeous, and I plan on wearing it to a Christmas party. I purchased a crystal sash to tie around my waist, and it looks stunning."
5.0,"I bought these for my whole crew of Fire Investigators, very high quality and good price."
5.0,"Really cool.  Expanded nicely, strong elastic, fits adults, bright and sassy colors.  These folks are a little high end on price, but worth it when you see the product.  All 5 of my granddaughters and daughter raved over them."
5.0,"I am not going to lie, I used to wear sunglasses purely to look cool. There was even a time when I was that guy that wore sunglasses indoors too. I am not proud of that time in my life. In the past few months I have started to take my health more seriously and and that includes the health of my eyes. I was looking for sunglasses that were stylish but now more importantly with actual sun protection. These frames actually deliver in both of these areas. They are classic wayfarer style and provide real UV ray protection. I actually notice a difference wearing these verses other sunglasses."
5.0,I was very happy with my purchase. I wasn’t expecting as good quality as it is. Perfect for my Belle Halloween costume! I highly recommend
5.0,Good quality for the price. I was looking for something small but professional so I could just leave them in but the clasp usually breaks after a few weeks or they begin to irritate my ears. Not these! Plus...they’re cute.
5.0,"Fit perfect!! Fabric is really nice, the top half is perfectly form fitting and the frantic falls very nicely on the bottom, no problem with wrinkling when I sat down or pulled lines like you see in a lot of cheaper dresses. Wore it to an evening wedding and it was perfect"
5.0,I’m very pleased with the quality! These are substantial leather belts. They are not the light flimsy weave that stretches out after wear.  An amazing value.
5.0,"I have a perfect wedding suit in solid black, but did not have either a vest or a pocket square for it. This 4 piece set includes vest, pocket square, tie and a snap in place bow tie, which is great since I cannot tie a bow tie to save my soul. LOL<br /><br />The vest fits true to size and also has a watch pocket, for my old time railroad watch. It looks good and does not clash with my black suit. I also got this just in time since I am attending a wedding in September so I needed to make sure my outfit was complete.<br /><br />Now it is.<br /><br />Again you get:<br /><br />Button up vest<br />Necktie<br />Bow Tie<br />Pocket square.<br /><br />No matter what color you select, it will all match to help set off your best suits. I am very pleased with it. You have your choice of 6 colors and UP TO six different sizes, depending on which color you choose.<br /><br />This is a nice, affordable way to dress up your wardrobe and the price is right too. At this price you can afford to buy several sets and not break the bank.<br /><br />5 stars and recommended for those special occasions.<br /><br />JPL"
5.0,Large size soft
5.0,Great quality and leakproof. I will recommend this to my friends and family
5.0,My husband will love it.
5.0,Great fit.  My sis loved em!
5.0,Picture is clear on the mask and fits well. Would order again!
5.0,Sent these to son in colo.  He puts them under reg socks and likes them
5.0,"I love it and had additional words, a personal message, embroidered on the front!"
5.0,Absolutely love the top! Can be dressed down for the office or dressed up for a night out. Recently wore it for an evening of drinks and lordy lord did I turn some heads! Can't tell you how many times I was hit on. Wore it to the office with a cami under it and it was a very comfortable and flattering top.
5.0,Love them. I am able to interchange for certain events. Best bags ever.
5.0,I bought a 6-pack of these for my wife on Prime Day. She likes the feeling of the material and the fit of the shirt. I think they look great on her.
5.0,Love this dress! Fits perfectly and the cut outs are so cute! I'm 5'10 and it's a perfect length.
5.0,this is adorable
5.0,Great looking watch. The instructions are in impossibly small tribe not suitable for the vision impaired. On the other hand it is simple enough to use that instructions are not really necessary.
5.0,Good value and very useful
5.0,Wife Used It Through Out The Cruise.
5.0,I may should have gotten a bigger size.  I have a post pregnancy pudge and I wear a C cup in bras and I purchased a large. I should have gone up a little but it zips fine & works wonders.  YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO SWEAT !!
5.0,Used as a gift for a teenager! loved them and wears it frequently.
5.0,I now have 3 of these dresses and I love them all!!!
5.0,"I love the dress, doesn’t feel cheap, pretty lace. I’m 5’1 130 Lbs 34B chest & I felt a medium was a tad loose on top but maybe cause I have a small bust! I wish it was a tad short maybe right above the knee but it was nice still. I do wish the purple a bit deeper purple though. It’s not as dark as the amazon pic depicts. I wore it to an outdoor Covid wedding :)"
5.0,A door caught the heel of my boot and shaved it. It made my boot look awful. I applied the sole edge and heel polish to my heel and boot sole and it covered up the blemish nicely. Good product!
5.0,Very cool and comfortable. Really didn't expect much because of the low price. Would definitely recommend them. Pleasant surprise. Glad I made the purchase.
5.0,Love it. I purchase the 2nd one. Fix me well and good garment.Meet my expectations.
5.0,"I love them, could not find in stores. Good quality. Recommend"
5.0,Came early  Like the glasses a lot.
5.0,Absolutely LOVE this mask. It's comfortable and breathable. I had trouble with cloth masks at work because they didn't breathe well and got very warm when I was moving around. I wear this one every day with no problems! Great for any office fan!
5.0,Excellent gi top for the price. Absolutely love the fabric and stitching.
5.0,I absolutely adore this hat!
5.0,Very soft and cozy!
5.0,My sister loved the feel and variety in this 10-sock-pair collection.
5.0,I liked this bangles very much. They go very good with my Indian sarees. Thanks
5.0,"My dad is a person who isn't one for bags, citing that only women have purses and that this is a purse. He was able to fit everything he usually carries around daily in this.<br /><br />A list of everything he carries around includes his<br />-LG Stylo 4 in a huge protective case<br />-iFixit Mako driver set<br />-Wallet<br />-every single key he has ever had<br />- a small jar of change<br />- His EZ .380 ACP<br />- and a few bullets<br /><br />Since I bought this bag for him he has stopped losing things he regularly uses or carries on him for whatever reason, and has started spending more of his time enjoying life with his family because he no longer has to look for any of his common carry things for nearly every waking moment of his day."
5.0,Wow! This dress is beautiful! It is very long but I will have it professionally hemmed. Fit is very flattering but must be worn with shape wear for best fit because it fits very snug at the waist and hips. I would love to order more of these at some point.
5.0,Fits my one year old son perfect!
5.0,Strong and great color!!
5.0,Got these for my 8month old boy.  Took him to a Pittsburgh Penguins game and he did great with them on.  Just snug enough fit so he couldn't pull off but didn't bother him to be on.  Removed for a second during game and he started screaming so I know they were working.  Would buy again without looking at another brand of we lost these ones.  Only thing is they barely fit him and he's a bigger 8 month old.  So I wouldn't buy unless close to that age which is the manufacturer recommended age.
5.0,"I like the product because it’s simple yet very elegant, all my friends who saw me wearing it said it’s nice and cute.."
5.0,I love this shirt! I specifically wanted a shirt that didn’t require an under layer so I didn’t have to wear two shirts and be blazing hot in the summer. This one is not see through and fits great. Plus I got it in green and I LOVE the color.
5.0,Work well for organizing your luggage
5.0,Very  Beautiful looking and wearing. Very Please.
5.0,I really am impressed with my watch band. Fit into my iWatch perfectly. Color is very pretty(lilac) need to order different colors
5.0,Just the right size.  beautiful color.  great qualityfor price
5.0,Just got this order perfect for the weekend getaways. Based on the reviews I read here I did order one size up (M) and it fits me just like the lady in the picture. Love it!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!! Fits perfect not too small!! Quality material and gorgeous all around dress!! Perfect for beach or a night out worn with a belt and jeans or shorts.
5.0,My daughter used this for her cosplay and it worked great for her. It was really good quality for the price and I was very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Nice quality and feels great, and I love the bag that came with it!"
5.0,"I received my ring yesterday and I absolutely love it it!!!. It looks bigger in person than in the pictures. It has a bit of a waxy feel to it and it was slightly smaller than expected but it still fits. Overall for the price, I think it was a great purchase."
5.0,"Wore this dress to a wedding. Wore it with tights, would have looked better with nylons. A little big in the chest area but if you wear it work the right undergarments such as a push up, it would fit perfectly"
5.0,Love this I feel ready to head out on the town.
5.0,These are brilliant.  The size is true so make sure you get correct sizing for finger sleeve. The blade is very sharp and very useful.
5.0,I got xlg but it didn't fit..it looks like a lg I'm 175 lbs n xlg is my size
5.0,Love these! I get so many compliments when I wear them. I just bought a second pair for the care.
5.0,Love these socks and I have multiple pairs from this manufacturer.
5.0,Hard to install.
5.0,Happy with our purchase.
5.0,"Comfortable shorts to wear, they were more stretchable than I thought."
5.0,My toddler loves this outfit! It’s great quality
5.0,"I thought these were a good quality and fit my 8 year old daughter perfectly. She loved them instantly and said they felt super comfortable. I’m glad I took a shot on this brand, I guess time will tell how long they last. Purchased at the beginning of July 2022."
5.0,"Great! The only thing is that the size I got was too small for the length of my body, so beware."
5.0,"These are great bands. Love the colors, teal and fusia. Fit my GearFit2Pro perfect. Have swim with it on multiple times and have not shown any signs if damage. Well worth the money."
5.0,I love the design of this. I received it last night as a Christmas present. At first it was a little stiff on my wrist but with overnight wear it has been fitting great. Stitching on the sides seems good and no pulls. I also love the fact that it is a buckle and not like the silicone bands that is just a metal piece you push through the holes. Only time will tell if the pleather will start to crack.
5.0,Like but snug need to exchange for a size L
5.0,"They are soft to the touch, perfect size to catch food spills. Love the color."
5.0,"My son loves these masks! He is 6 and wears these to school. He also likes them to wear when its cold outside to help keep him warm. They are the perfect size for kids. These also seem a little thicker than others I have purchased in the past, which is nice!"
5.0,"They fit true to size. The fabric is soft, lightweight, stretchy and breathable. They are great on sensitive skin. (My son is severely autistic and can't tolerate sleek fabric but this one he likes). They hold well after wash and air dry, do not loose shape or color. Good design for an 8 year old kid. Recommend."
5.0,"This is my new favorite dress, hands down. I have the Red version (white background with black and red flowers). Let's start on the fabric. I was amazed that the actual fabric of the dress has so much stretch to it! It's very flattering and very forgiving. I typically wear a size 6 and the small in this dress fits me perfectly. I feel like even someone who is bigger in the bust would love it, too, not only because of the flattering shape, but because the fabric has enough give to allow for a variety of sizes. It's also incredibly comfortable. The background is a crisp white and the flower print is bold and vibrant. It's a very striking dress that is totally reminiscent of the 50's. The skirt is very full and would also look nice with some sort of fluffy slip under to give it more poof. I would love to have one in every color!<br /><br />Pros<br />-Super stretchy, comfortable fabric<br />-Bold, striking colors and pattern<br />-Flattering fit<br />-Great zipper in the back<br /><br />Cons<br />-The tie that goes around to the back could be slightly longer for a larger bow, but that's being extremely picky.<br /><br />I'm so happy that I received a discount on this dress in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
5.0,I used this to spice up my plain silver shoes for my friends wedding.<br />I was very pretty and did the trick perfectly
5.0,Great quality and great scarf! Not too thin or cheaply made like many other similar scarves I have seen. Bought one for myself and gave another as a Christmas gift and both were perfect!
5.0,"They are gorgeous, all one of a kind, and I receive compliments every time I wear them."
5.0,Very cute I love it!
5.0,So cute! My 4 year old loves it.
5.0,"It is a very nice keychain and very durable in my opinion, I destroy these kinds of key chains just to to bending , pulling, dropping, scratching. But this one is still in tact and still holds it shape well so it isn’t all crinkled even after being crinkled for a good hour. Great product to make you keys look cool!"
5.0,The look is so pretty
5.0,I love these pants. They're stylish and comfortable. And they are cheaper than I can get them for at any stores in my city. I highly recommend them.
5.0,Brought one for myself and my daughter
5.0,"These gloves does it job, I work in the cold, and they do there job"
5.0,"Perfect size, very durable"
5.0,Muy bueno excelente material 👍
5.0,I seriously love this piece.  It is lovely and the hand written thank you note made it even more special.
5.0,"Easy to melt in the microwave. I applied using a cotton rag. Started with just my gloved hands, but rag worked much better. I needed 1.5 containers for my long oilskin duster, but if I would have used the rag to apply from the start, 1 container probably would have been enough. Used a blowdryer to finish. Worked great. And yes, it smells much better than original formula. Have not been caught in the rain yet, but am sure it works to re-rainproof."
5.0,"Great hats. Can be worn with anything, looks great, and keeps me warm."
5.0,"Super comfy, thin, breathable material. These pants are perfect for lounging, yoga, or pajamas."
5.0,I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly.  The material is comfortable and it’s long enough but not too long in this 100 plus degree weather.  Will be purchasing more in other colors.
5.0,I got this as a thanksgiving present. I loved the fall design and it came in handy for all the extra stuff I had to take back home from my trip.
5.0,Love it! This ring is very classy and very thin on the sides. So happy to find one in real gold that I hope will last for years to come!!
5.0,"I ordered the size M in pink.  I was super skeptical that it was going to be wayyyy too small but it was the only size available in the pink.  For reference, I am 5' 6"" and 150 lbs.  I am normally a size medium and this fit PERFECTLY.  it is a light cotton material it is not fleece.  I wore it out as a set, super cute! I was shocked at how much I loved this!  I would order your normal size, if you're considering getting this set make the purchase!  It is great quality and true to size 😊"
5.0,I love the fact I don’t have keys jingling around and it all fits in this little cute case
5.0,"This dress is adorable and I love the smooth fabric. It reminds me of a nice men's dresshirt with an ultra feminine style. I am 5'5&#34; weigh 150 lbs and hourglass shape, I ordered the small which fit like a glove. Very comfy and cool on a hot summer day."
5.0,"I really like this dress. I got the lite green one. I am usually a medium but after reading the reviews I sized up to a large. The material is great, it’s lined and the sleeves come down a bit to the middle of your arm which I like. It’s a great lite dress for spring and summer."
5.0,This dress did not disappoint! Perfect! I bought an XL
5.0,"These are great - soft interior, well constructed. I bought two pairs since I lost the first pair."
5.0,Perfect for the Holiday season. Got a lot of compliments first time I wore it!
5.0,"Outstanding socks! Great fit, super absorbency, comfortable and wears well for hours. Attractive is a plus."
5.0,We needed an inexpensive bow tie and this was perfect!
5.0,"I have size Medium. Nearly perfect fit.<br />I am 5'6&#34;, 124 lbs., waist 28&#34;.<br />The sleeve length is good, just at the beginning of my hand.<br />The coat length, 6 inches above my knees.<br />The shoulder seems, they are past my shoulders by 1/2&#34;, looks fine.<br />The belt goes around my waist 2x, yes really, and still enough to use the (slip through) buckle. I actually like this belt length.<br />The color of the exterior is a creme light beige, the lining is the same.<br />It is lightweight and feels like a good quality, not cheap. Not for keeping warm in winter temperatures, but that is alright,<br />good for 50+ degree weather and wearing indoors as a duster.<br />The construction is pleasing.<br />Includes extra buttons.<br />Zero packaging odor.<br />I would buy it again, in black.<br />I have not tested to see if it is waterproof.<br />Looks great with almost everything in my wardrobe."
5.0,Holds all my important cards and nicely made
5.0,They are a lot bigger than inexpected but are beautiful. I wear them to fancy things
5.0,Perfect for 4 year old:)
5.0,"i have a hard time finding these square-necked tanks for my husband, but these are perfect! he loves them."
5.0,Did it's job
5.0,"These are great I have two pairs, They fit as expected and are extremely comfortable."
5.0,I’m 5’6 and 123 pounds and got a small and it fits great! Definitely recommend y’all!
5.0,These were a gift for my 10 year old daughter. She got her ears pierced a year ago. She loves them and has worn a pair every day since Christmas.  They are good quality. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I ordered three kinds and these are the best. Soft and flexible. Now, when I drop one, I am not on my hands and knees crawling around for the precious item. Actually, I now enjoy when I drop one, because I just smile and decadently reach for another. Do yourself a favor!"
5.0,"Although not N95 quality it is handy because you wear it as a scarf and lift the face piece when you feel a mask is prudent.  (Remember, wearing masks is effective in keeping others safe.  We should wear mask for each other.)"
5.0,"Purchased this necklace to match earrings, a ring and a bracelet. It is a perfect match. The color of the coral beads is just just what I was looking for and it is well made. The length is perfect.  I hope to enjoy it for many years to come."
5.0,"I played a slot machine the other day, I won money and put it in the box. For the first time I left with my winning instead of giving it back. I gifted one to my husband. Very sturdy little box."
5.0,They are absolutely amaizing and great quality👍💖
5.0,Cute colorful leggings. Daughter loves them.
5.0,These are fun and do the trick
5.0,I bought these as a christmas gift for my granddaughter. Havent givin to her yet. Im sure she will love it. Came on time would buy again.
5.0,This is another Christmas present for my daughter!  It's so cute!  She loved it! Thank you!
5.0,Nice colors and materials- as expected
5.0,I saw someone with this bag at the mall. I'm usually more of a Michael Kors girl but I fell in love with Snoopy and the heart on this bag! I saw another girl with the black one and knew there must be a sale going on. I asked around and the Coach store only had brown and black left so I turned to Amazon and got the white one! I have received sooo many compliments on this bag! I am so happy with it.
5.0,Perfect belt for my granddaughter.  It looks nice with so many colors!  I'm glad I purchased it.
5.0,"The original band caused second degree friction burns on my wrists. This band has only caused one, and that was mostly my own fault."
5.0,great quality . great seller . thank you!
5.0,"I have been a loyal Lululemon Align fan for years  and these are an absolute game changer!! The cut, waistband, stitching and seams are identical. The material is almost an exact match, these are just ever so slightly thicker but not in a way that feels or looks noticeable. I wear a size 6 in the Align pant, ordered these in a Medium and they fit great. Get them!"
5.0,Loved the watch. It's better than in pictures. What a great seller as well. Great communication and speedy delivery. Fantastic
5.0,"Love, love, love them! The color is brilliant! A little bigger than I thought, I purchased them for my daughter, so I guess I will enjoy them until she can. ' -Lisa M."
5.0,Daughter loves it fit as expected
5.0,I haven't used the mesh band very much but the linked one is nice. It arrived comically big so I had to remove about 5 links (and I'm not a small dude) but doing so was straightforward. It's held up well and is comfortable and nice looking.
5.0,Lot's of compliments! Love the feel of the fabric. I ordered a 2x - size wise it's a tad smaller than a Men's XL t-shirt.
5.0,"wear it all the time, love it!"
5.0,"These are the darkest sunglasses I have ever owned, and that includes designer brands. They also come packaged nicer than any other pair I have and come with a small glasses screwdriver. The fact that they donate a pair also is a bonus to me and will keep me as a customer.<br />You can not beat the quality, and the way they are presented,for a very reasonalbe price."
5.0,Adds a certain Pazazz to a dark suit.  Good enough to wear on a Formal Night on the cruise ship.
5.0,I love the material and shirt fit like described. Not super loose but fitted enough to accent shape.
5.0,My kid loves these on his crocs! Kinda hard to push in as they’re not actual “jibitz” made by Croc but they got fine with a little force.
5.0,i wanted this very large on me and it is exactly the size i'd prefer.<br />its adorable and it has engrish on the sleeve<br />95483043820 stars.
5.0,I ordered a Med for my 5'3&#34; daughter who normally wears a juniors 9 and it fits perfect
5.0,I used this cloth as instructed and my ring seems to be a lot shinier! I had some scratches in my silver ring that it took out as well.
5.0,Exactly as described! No issues!
5.0,I purchased this for wear at a day long convention where I'd have my two toddlers in tow. It was very forgiving as far as hiding some trouble spots. It flowed nicely. In the evening we were invited to a graduation party so I just kept the same dress on and it was a hit there too.  I received so many compliments.  I'd say purchase your size or one size larger if you have a bit of a belly (I have baby weight still from a recent birth and I'm in my 40s).  I purchased the white floral dress with spaghetti straps.  I added a cami to give some modesty to the chest area.  It is a bit long so I paired it with wedge sandals.  But it looked great when I switched to my flat sandals by evening.
5.0,I love these glasses. They are effective and stylish. I was a little bummed that the nose pieces came out so easily. I ended up losing one pretty quickly. I would suggest superglue!
5.0,Great replacement worth every penny. Far cheaper then the store and a better quality
5.0,"Very nice, sharp look, just what I was looking for"
5.0,Made my grandson's day!  Actually season!
5.0,Bought this band for my son and works great. I feel it's a lot better then the oem one.
5.0,"I like this Blaze band, very comfortable. I will probably go back for another color."
5.0,My daughter liked them for her nose!
5.0,Good product for the money. Much preferred than ones costing 3 times as much at my eye clinic.
5.0,"Nice, quality material, shirt color and print as expected and true to size. I wear a medium & ordered a medium. It's a fitted style shirt so if you want extra room, get a bigger size. It fit perfect in my normal size, not too big and not too tight."
5.0,I am a 2x and this fit perfect it’s so soft and super baggy very cozy
5.0,This is the slogan we use all the time
5.0,"It’s a nice looking hat with good material, and pretty comfortable to wear."
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend. It’s a perfect fit and the color is spot on to the picture
5.0,Laurel Burch does it again..  Love the vivid colors and themes. Her horse series is my personal favorite subject matter. Materials and workmanship is exceptional.
5.0,"Love this sweat shirt however.l, I got size Large cause I was plus size and it too big so I have to get size medium to fit me. But it stretchable so be careful with size you pick if u wear size large get size smaller. It does help u sweat but it hold ur sweat inside. I wear this to protect sweat in my pants and this does help with that."
5.0,Cute shirt a bit on the larger size.
5.0,"These worked great on my 6mo  old girl, they stayed tight on her and she couldn't pull them off.  She didn't even seem to notice the noise most of the time."
5.0,Cute t-shirt with groot and Grogru. The t-shirt was a little thin but soft.
5.0,"Beautiful, just Beautiful"
5.0,Love this swim top! Fits great and very flattering!
5.0,These socks are so comfy!  I love them and bought 2 pair. One as a Christmas gift.
5.0,Great dress......great material.....beautiful....look more expensive than the cost.....I bought these dresses for my bridemaids....a wonderful gift to them and I know on my wedding day they will look beautiful.....will definitely use this company again!
5.0,I bought this as a gift & the birthday girl loves it. No complaints. Shipped fast & arrived in perfect condition.
5.0,Very elegant looking. My wife loved it!
5.0,"I went by the size chart but had to return for a smaller size. I could probably have gone down two. Not a big deal since I sew but I would have preferred to get the right size first. It is a really cute, comfortable vintage style dress at a great price."
5.0,Just an excellent beautiful nice fitting suit.
5.0,Got these for my 10 year old for his birthday and he loves them! Perfect for him.
5.0,"Perfect for the whole family! Fits perfectly, light material but not see through like some shirts can be."
5.0,I love this belt it looks just like the picture.
5.0,"Really nice, exactly what I expected, exactly how I saw it on the picture..!"
5.0,True to size chart.. happy with purchase
5.0,So frickin cute!  Comfortable and easy to get boot on. Very happy with purchase.
5.0,I've always hated tucking my shirt in because it would never be perfect and it would come un-tucked all the time. I could get all my shirts tailored to fit me exactly but who has time for that? You look really stupid wearing them but they actually worked really well. You aren't able to see them under your pants and they didn't irritate my legs at all.
5.0,"Every day jeans, comfortable and slimming, no zipper bulge"
5.0,"These were too big, but I put a rubber band around the lens part, left it in hot water for 5 minutes. When I took the rubber band off, it fit snuggly around my glasses."
5.0,Fits great and is super cute in person!
5.0,I really like this sweatshirt. Very comfortable and fits perfect.
5.0,"I am 145 lbs, 5'4"" and this fit perfectly. It is a nice modest fit."
5.0,nice casual tee shirt
5.0,Love it!!👍
5.0,These are very nice shorts.  You can tell the quality is there.  If you like the satin feel you'll like these.
5.0,"This is a really beautiful bag. There's tons of room too - I use this for work and can easily fit my iPad and documents in here. I wish there was a shoulder strap, but if you don't need one, this is a great purse!"
5.0,"Perfect fit - comfy - and just the thing for cold, winter days and nights. I've used them under mittens for an additional layer when needed. Received several compliments."
5.0,"Super stretchy, nice fit, runs small FYI"
5.0,"This dress is the perfect choice for a wardrobe staple. It can be casual with a Jean jacket or popcorn sweater. It can be a little dressier with a blazer and extra accessories. It is a very versatile piece and very comfy. The material is nice and holds its shape well. The pockets are pure bonus! As a teacher it’s great to find a piece that I can use for classroom, casual, and church attire. Love it!"
5.0,It Fits  just right I love it.
5.0,Really like the fit and look of this hit. Fits low to the top of my head which is exactly what I wanted.  Nice fit hat and quality.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1601b69bb7401228ff2136814b6f0feb]] Love this but I at the end a small issue  skirt i ordered a 16 and it was . Comfy great length. Lots of give in waist so it became a bit to big next time i think ill order a 14. Love the color and length. But this is my 2nd one they start to do this after a few washing do this . I do not use dryer.
5.0,Definitely heavy duty they are thick and well made
5.0,"Lovely pearl, delicate, pretty chain."
5.0,Bought it for my niece and she has worn it almost everyday. Beautiful dress!
5.0,"I was skeptical about this band, I have a very small wrist and it is hard to find things small enough. I was a little worried about cutting the length too... but this ended up being EXTREMELY comfortable, easy to install, easy to cut to the right length! So easy I am considering getting it in multiple colors"
5.0,i like this sunglasses am happy with this product
5.0,"These seem to work great. I bought 2 and used them for our 8 month old and 3 year old at a sporting game. Allowed the 8 month old to take his nap without any issues. They fit on my head as well for cutting the grass, and we are taking them to Disney in case they need them for fireworks, or to take a nap."
5.0,A mi novia le gustó
5.0,"Very nice quality, really like these &amp; have been looking for this style for awhile. The customer seller communication was great!"
5.0,Very beautiful dress and hides the tummy
5.0,Since ordering these glasses I have worn them everyday driving east into the sun in the mornings and west into the sunset in the evenings. They have the perfect balance of shade/visibility so that I am able to drive safely and protect my eyes while doing so!
5.0,"The quality of the sports bra is really solid. However, I had to return it because the sizing runs extremely small. I am typically an extra small to small. The extra small was so tight I could not pull it over my shoulders & did not want to risk damaging the bra. I believe I would need to go up to a medium in this brand. Order up in size."
5.0,The dress is so cute and conservative. Perfect Dorothy costume. The only problem is the straps needed to be adjusted since they are too long and the bottom back Velcro comes off if I bend forward too much. Other than that it fits as expected. I am 5ft. About 116lbs. Waist 28ish.
5.0,"Bought three sets of these pj’s for travel...love them, soft, no shrinkage, just right!!"
5.0,"This is a great key chain! Two of my friends saw mine and wanted one, so I ordered two additional key chains for them. Quality product. Very  happy with this purchase."
5.0,"I love it on her, she loves wearing it too. If it lasts a few years, that's great. A very happy buy so far."
5.0,Buy again and again and again
5.0,"The first pair of Telic Z strap I bought are very comfortable and very attractive looking. The second pair, supposed to be the same size, are too small but Amazon very kindly refunded my money. I want to get a second pair but I think I will order by length of the sandal rather than size next time. Though it's a puzzle that the two pairs marked the same size were different.<br /><br />I am very pleased with my recent purchase of Telic Z strap from Amazon. This time I ordered them by length rather than size and found the size to be exactly the same as my first pair."
5.0,"Great stackable Sterling ring. Nice construction and the stone is lovely, bright color and well cut. I purchased several in different colors and they are easy to wear in multiple combinations. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"It's a little big than what I was expecting, but it doesn't really change the fact that it is cute.<br />It doesn't feel cheap as well. I'm just not sure how long this will last with regular/normal use."
5.0,These run a bit big. Really cute.
5.0,Very nice Harry Potter feather quill charm bead.  Thank you.
5.0,Great quality for the price! The pants are nice & long! Will be buying more!
5.0,It was just as I expected and perfect for the office over a nice sundress!
5.0,"Just love this, bought it for a coworker and she was very happy."
5.0,Absolutely adorable and perfect
5.0,Hat looks nice. It compliments my chef attire perfectly. I will definitely be buying them in different colors
5.0,"I can’t wait to wear this on vacation. I can go from the sand to wearing this to boardwalk shops or a beach restaurant and feel completely comfortable. Lightweight, soft and so comfortable."
5.0,"I got multiple colors of these socks for my cousin's son to wear with his AFOs. They're a perfect fit. He just turned seven and the 6+ is perfect and has a good stretch. He even hit the middle of his knee so he has a little time to grow into them even more. They're warm enough for the winter. The thickness is also perfect for his braces because, although they have a good stretch, they don't stretch out to where they will get worn out or torn. Not many kids get excited about socks for their birthday and Christmas, but he loves them. I will be buying more."
5.0,"Fits just as i hoped it would! Measurements seem to match the description. I usually wear size large to xl, 38C-ish, so i ordered the xl.  its not too tight or too loose, perfect sleeve length and shoulder width. There is a tiny hole in the left pocket and some of the embroidery is a little frayed, but the fabric is so thin and fine that this is to be expected, and easily fixed. Was debating getting it for MONTHS, soooo so so glad i finally did. NOT a winter jacket tho, just a heads up!  I'm a tundra-dwelling gal, couldn't use it as a ""jacket"" in temps under 50 F.  I personally didn't get it for that anyway, just for the fashion aspect :) Hope this helps any indesisive people eyeing it!"
5.0,"This is a very classy looking product, looks really great in thick hair and I couldn't be more pleased. With the free shipping it's well worth the price.  I bought extra ones for gifts."
5.0,Order a size up they shrink on the first wash.  great product.
5.0,Item was of the most invaluable quality! The packaging was very foxy. Very swift dispatch. First-rate service.
5.0,The shirt is true... Its how we feel...
5.0,Love these. They have two pockets on each side!! I wear these all the time.
5.0,"Love this soft hugging dress!  It's too long, so I made a knot at the bottom until<br />I hem it.  Gave me the look of a fine statue and did not allow me to walk as comfortably...<br />that knot kept my steps close together... but I did have fun in it though.  :)  I added a Scarf<br />for a more elegant look.  I felt 'precious'!  LOL. ♥"
5.0,Top provided adequate coverage for DDs (which is hard to find with this style top) but waist was slightly too big. Received lots of compliments. Overall satisfied
5.0,"Good price, good quality.  Good stuff."
5.0,I love this dress and every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.
5.0,Very nice pajamas. Well made.

5.0,"Love these septum rings! I haven’t tried the large one, but the other two are dainty and adorable."
5.0,"I don't know about you, but I lose my readers ALL the time. Great to have 5 pair in waiting!!"
5.0,This set is a pleasant surprise. It is well-made and even more beautiful than I expected. I am very pleased with this purchase. I love it.
5.0,"I love this chain!! It looks beautiful on the dress and other clothes!! It is not tight for me ,it fits me well but I think it will not fit well too skinny girls!"
5.0,I reviewed this based on my son's answers.  It's go Texan day tomorrow and he needed new boots for Rodeo.  He is super happy and hasn't taken them off since they arrived yesterday (except to sleep).  I say these are a winner.
5.0,Better than expected. Ordering extra
5.0,These were perfect to keep feet warm and also allow child to move about freely. It helps prevent those crashes that come about while running in just socks!
5.0,I love them! Looks exactly like the picture .
5.0,"Very cute, price was right!"
5.0,I am very satisfy with the product
5.0,This bracelet was amazing.  I purchased five items for my husband's birthday and this was his favorite.  Excellent value and pricing.  I would definitely recommend to others.
5.0,"Others are now ordering their own, thank goodness, or I would have to buy many of these as a gift! Even the chain is special."
5.0,Love these. Great quality and great colors. You can’t go wrong with these.
5.0,the fit was snug.  my head would feel it because of the pressure.
5.0,Nice fit.  Nice look.  Gonna use these for driving.
5.0,I ordered a small (I'm a size 4) and the dress fits perfect.  I love the soft and smooth material.
5.0,Fit is perfect for a 2 year old. Love it!
5.0,Love this hoodie and the message is the frosting on the cake❤️
5.0,Ordered these as &#34;keepers&#34; for my Jawbone Up Move on the wrist strap ordered separately. Fits fine and works great!
5.0,I really like the vintage look of this watch.
5.0,I was really impressed with this flannel. I ordered two different colors and size 6X which honestly was kind of embarrassing to do but I'm going to rip the tag off. I am normally a size 12-14 in women's us and the shirt fit well the sleeves were long enough the chest was just big enough but the length of really long it went down past my butt. It's really soft flannel material or brushed cotton I haven't watched it yet so I'm not sure if it shrinks but I'll update this if it does. It's only September 7th but I feel like this is going to be a great fall piece.
5.0,"Frankenstein is really awesome, there are two or three amazing frankenstein figures, and this is one of them<br />i had been waiting this action figure for two years approximately<br />i am so happy"
5.0,kinda stiff but such nice and cute mules. i will keep it! love it!
5.0,"I purchased size M in army green. The dress is soft and comfortable. Feels and fits great. I am 5'3"", 130 lb, full C cups."
5.0,I love the color of the dress and how it flows. I do caution that the size runs smaller than expected. I'm 5'2&#34; and about 117 lb but waist area is bit more snug that I hoped it to be.
5.0,Love them all fits well
5.0,"My hands float between medium and large gloves. I ordered large to compensate for insulation, glad I did. Gloves seem well made. Bought for 4 wheeler riding in cold temps. Thinsulate is always a good insulator."
5.0,I work in a warehouse where I have to spend time in 34 degrees a few times a day. I wanted a jacket that was warm enough that I didn't have to layer so much and be too warm when I'm in my office. This jacket is SO warm. I'm usually a medium but I bought a large because I didn't want it to be too fitted. I wish I would have bought my regular size because it's pretty big but that's okay. If I was more worried about it being flattering on me I would exchange it but since it's just for work I don't mind. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the hood. When I have it up I can't see that well because the fur is so thick. It doesn't fall off like a lot of hoods do so that may be a plus for you.
5.0,I’ve been looking for a variety of only cat charms and came across these. Adorable! I am a very crafty person and can use these in a multitude of ways. Can’t wait to get several projects wrapped up and be able to start on something to use these on.
5.0,"My son wanted uggs because I always wear uggs in the winter but I couldn't justify buying him pair without knowing he will wear them and not destroy them, so I bought these knowing that dream pairs usually has quality shoes at a cheaper price and I was very satisfied with them! My son who is 5 says they are the warmest and most comfortable shoes he has!"
5.0,Fits great good price good quality unexpectedly comfortable
5.0,"When they say these are big believe it.  Subtlety is not my strong suit so I went ahead and ordered them. They shipped fast, and proved a tracking number.  For the size they aren't as heavy as I expected. They look exactly like the picture and i love them!<br />I can't wait to wear them out.. just maybe not to work. Maybe..."
5.0,not as cool as my other glassess but they do a MARVELOUS job of blocking the sun and removing road glare.
5.0,I feel super organized when using my packing cubes.  Helps to keep from over packing too.  Good size variety and machine washable.  Great product!
5.0,Got a lot of compliment on this dress and it fits sooooo perfect. I would definitely order from this designer again! Oh and the material is perfecto!!!!
5.0,My dad is by welders all the time and loves these to help block the flash
5.0,"I bought this purse as a travel bag for Europe for 3 weeks and ended up using it as my every day purse for a couple of months afterwards! This bag is solid and sturdy and fits all the requirements I had for a travel purse - most of the ones I looked at were too small, and a certain brand of travel bags is SO expensive! I got the animal &#34;print&#34; because it was cheaper... but it looks very stylish and attractive! I didn't have any information lifted and I don't know if that's due to the RFID nature of this bag, but hey! I love the numerous pockets and compartments on this bag. This bag is large enough to put a kindle, iPad, or even one of the new small Macbooks in. This bag is also capable of taking a serious beating and still looking nice. The zipper clip added to my sense of security that my $$ and passport in it would be safe. Definitely an affordable and stylish looking thief-resistant travel bag."
5.0,Excellent Rings
5.0,Better quality than I anticipated.  The colors are beautifully put together and will be a complement to outerwear.
5.0,Love them get lots of compliments
5.0,It's warm!
5.0,Just the thing to help keep your glasses handy!  Nice colors & value for the money.
5.0,Lovely outfit. Well made. Washes on delicate cycle with no problems. Hang to dry. Fits well and skirt is a bit longer in back than front so helps cover better. I bought another just to be sure I had an extra.
5.0,they look amazing in my white chucks and it's just a little something to show my team spirit!
5.0,"It appears to be a good belt but have only worn it once.The price was right so I thought I would try a ratchet belt because of the quarter inch increments in the sizing.  To get a better fit, it is easy to trim off excess length with scissors.  The Bulliant people follow up after the purchase to make sure you are happy.  A nice touch."
5.0,Very good quality.  Excellent for teachers appreciation.
5.0,I typically wear a small or medium and the extra large fits me perfect.  Perfect transaction.  Great jacket/shirt.
5.0,"Keychain has held up well.  Paint has some wear after a few months, but the hook is like the day I bought it."
5.0,"This dress is beautiful. My pictures don't do it justice. Fits as expected. I'm in between 5 and 6 so it's slightly lose cause I bought the medium, so I should have bought a small (For reference). It's a very classy dressy!"
5.0,Everything fits great
5.0,"Second pair.  After confusion in replacing the first pair because the left shoe didn't work, both shoes work perfectly in this pair.  Daughter is very happy!  Thank you, Eslla, for your effort to right a wrong."
5.0,Bought in a half size up. And fit perfect. Very very comfortable and well made. Serious odor when you first get them because they’ve been packaged so long but one night outside and strong odor is gone. Love these boots!
5.0,These are high quality and toddler loves them! They come with a little holder which is great. They fit perfect.
5.0,"It is very nice with my daughter, great elastic for a better fitting."
5.0,"I love aprons! I love the feminine feel of them. I think it has to do with my grandmother. This is perfect! I love the color, I got the purple and it is as the pic describes. I'm 5'0&#34; and I just adjusted the strap and it fits well. My friends think it's adorable...and my husband finds it sexy hehe. The material is nice as well<br />I'd buy again, and would recommend."
5.0,"love these, purchased as a gift for a coworker and very pleased"
5.0,Product came packaged nicely and has hold up nicely to sturdiness!<br />Do not recommend if you currently have kittens who scratch at things though! Mine has a small scratch in it and with the material there's no way to fix it.<br />But that it my fault and NOT the company's! Company did greay.
5.0,Just as pictured!! It fits perfectly can’t wait to wear it on my vacation
5.0,Love this shirt. The material is also great.
5.0,I'm 310lbs. 5ft 10in.  I bought these for fishing on the Mississippi and leech lake.  I did purchase the 3XL size and it fits like my 2XL Duluth trading company shirts.  It is a great fit and very comfy
5.0,Cute.  Fast delivery
5.0,This jacket is so well made! It’s beautiful and I love how it suits on my daughter

5.0,beautiful dress. needs no ironing.
5.0,I love the color and work well for my teacher id and money while in school.
5.0,I personally only got these because I'm pregnant and jeans are not even an option for me anymore. I love these and I dont have to worry about using a hair tie to keep them together. :)
5.0,"The LifeVV Women's Waist Trainer for Weight Loss was an absolutely smashing purchase.  At first, I wasn't sure what I would receive as the price was so low that I did not think the product could be very good.  But, I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />The material in the waist trainer is stretchy but it does have some terrific body to it.  Especially around the waist...it appears that the fabric is denser there in order to keep the owner's waist looking slim and trim.  In other areas of the garment, the fabric is not quite as stiff.<br /><br />One of the most helpful features is the flap on the back that can be rotated to facilitate using the bathroom.  Typical garments of this nature either do not have the proper engineering to allow for easy bathroom use.  I have had to undress practically in the entirety in the bathroom more than once in order to relieve myself.  This garment has a fold down feature in the back that makes using the bathroom so much easier and one does not have to undress anymore.<br /><br />The color of the garment is a nice nude shade so that the wearer has greater flexibility in wardrobe choices.  I am dark  complexioned and I have no luck wearing white undergarments unless I plan on them being seen by everyone who comes near me.  This just seamlessly blends in.  Another great feature is that this allows me to wear my own bra, which means I have a better fit.  The garment sits snug against the bra but is still comfortable.<br /><br />This is a great product for the price.  It would give that other well known brand a run for the money.  This is less expensive and very effective.  For the record, I was allowed to purchase this product at a greatly discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.  This is what you have received.  I do not receive financial compensation and always strive to give an unbiased review.  If you found this helpful, please let Amazon know.  I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have about the product."
5.0,"These boots are spot on in size. I normally go between 8.5 and 9, depending on the brand. These not only fit perfectly, they're extremely comfortable. Granted, they are soft toe, but if that's not what you need them for then these are great. Plenty of cushion in the sole. These boots look great overall, quality material and I can wear them all day. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"I just bought these for my 3-year old and she absolutely adores them!  She can easily put them on herself and are apparently very cozy, comfortable and easy to walk in.  They are really cute and appear to be well constructed despite the other review...of course they have only been in use for a couple of days now..."
5.0,Fit well. Always get compliments when I wear it!
5.0,Love these earrings! I wear them all the time with the matching dog paw necklace. Great value and price!
5.0,"Fits well. I am 5ft3, normally weight about 140 and right now I am 7 1/2 months pregnant, it was perfect for a belly and looked great for my shower. Nicely made."
5.0,Best belt I have ever paid to get. works well! and I don't have the clip pushing on to my skin when I sit down or stand. I will buy again over and over again!
5.0,"Great for my 2 and 5 year olds! They aren't easy on sunglasses, but these stand up to them!"

5.0,"Good quality, love the scripture written on it."
5.0,"The zipper metal the little change & ring can clip off, but is great for me because I can clip it to my seatbelt D-ring w/my keys & it hangs safely. I’ve not had it unzip once even w/all my movement being in a wheelchair! And it’s a beautiful quality green leather."
5.0,Looks nice and not cheap
5.0,"Have had 2 pairs now. I LOVE them. They are packaged well, fast shipping, & look professional/fashionable. 5 stars!"

5.0,Very beatiful
5.0,Beautiful armband in stainless stell at a giveaway price. I am wearing it now.
5.0,"Very cute purse!  It actually has more pockets than advertised.  There is one behind the cat pattern on the front, one on the back, the big one in the middle, and a hidden pocket inside.  All have zippers.  There are also two small no-zipper pockets on the sides.  It's a little bigger than I thought, but I am loving it anyways."

5.0,"Warm, what else can i say?!"
5.0,Our girl wears this top a lot and it is holding up strong in the wash.  Very impressed.  She gets a ton of compliments and it is definitely a favorite.
5.0,I loved these socks. They are perfect for the how much they cost. Some other websites sell some socks like these for double the price. The length are not all the same. I didn’t mind it because they are still all knee length on my 2 year old. The can still be worn for many years. I think my daughter can wear them until she turns 5.
5.0,A present for a grandson who loved it. Nice colour and style.
5.0,Super cute dress and fit great!
5.0,Great dress- dress up or down!!

5.0,I love the extreme amount of storage space! I could go on and on about it but nothing beats the price!
5.0,Everything it's good
5.0,"My daughter really loved this dress! It was a good quality for the price. My daughter is a little more petite for 5 and this dress had a little room for her to grow in, so I think it would fit an average five year old perfectly."
5.0,"Super comfortable! It feels like every pair of period panties I find cuts into my legs and stomach, this is so worth the price."
5.0,Like the color and it’s not a heavy  material
5.0,Very pleased with these i switched to  these after trying several pairs of keens that would last for about a year (wearing my work shoes 5-6 days a week) these fit perfectly and have held up to 18 months of constant use.
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my mom that has a hard time putting on her jewelry.  She has no complaints and uses it regularly.
5.0,Discription says Antique God but the picture shows antique silver. Came as the picture shows. I ordered hoping it was as the picture portrayed and it was so I was happy. I would suggest  changing the description to say silver and not gold. It was and is a bit confusing. Nice chain
5.0,I need a new one
5.0,My wife had a great time making different bracelets for granddaughters.
5.0,"This shacket is plaid flannel and not corduroy.  I'm 5'3"" and about 127 pounds.  I ordered a size Small which I at first thought was a bit small for it pulls just a bit in the arms and back when I raise my arms.  Otherwise, this fits perfectly.  I'm wearing this shacket a lot and just making sure the top underneath is fairly thin.  This shacket is so comfortable and soft feeling that it's like a second shirt but offering more warmth.  I love that this shacket has 2 pockets - 1 on each side over the bust.  I also love the green and brown colors of the flannel.  My rating is 5 stars for this shacket is stylish and comfortable."
5.0,"I wasn't sure about the sizing, but this was perfect, and it's a great dress--cute, well made, nice and light for summer!"
5.0,I loved it!!help you to get sweaty 🥵 faster!!

5.0,"This dress was extremely comfortable and i got so many compliments on it. Would definitely order again!<br />The only negative thing i have to say is, for an outside event, leaves were sticking to the bottom of the dress. I’m only 5’3” so the dress was too long to wear without heels."
5.0,These earrings are very light and if you love leopard print you will love these earrings.  Perfect and I will order more for a friend.
5.0,This is the PERFECT summer bra for those cute halter tanks. I just wish it came in other colors!
5.0,"Great Watches- we have 3!!!<br />First the bad: The little icons for alarm etc. are very small and tough to read. The band will probably break in 4-5 years- we have had two such failures, so you should squirrel away a couple of dollars a year to budget for the replacement.<br />That's it!<br />Wear it in the shower, throw it off the wall, no prob. I pirated mine from my daughter- who was not home when it arrived.. Ordered her another- she is a glacier guide in Alaska and this is what you wear. My other kid works on large schooners and this is what you wear- does military time. You do not need to pay more than 10 bucks to tell time."
5.0,My five year old picked these out herself and she loves them. They have a wide range of colors and different effects. I did read some of the other reviews about them not working after a few days and it made me wonder if the people had charged them. They lasted 2 days on the charge they had when they arrived and took about a half hour to charge back up with the included cord. You will need a usb wall outlet for the cord though. They don't come with any instructions so it took us a few minutes to figure out the remotes. Push and hold the power button to turn them off and on. If using the button inside the shoes just push and hold to shut them off. The button inside the shoe does seem to be bothering my daughters ankle so I have been making her wear high socks with them and it seems to help.
5.0,"Awesome bag, I gave it to my sister as a birthday gift!  She loves it!"
5.0,Love love and have compliments every time I wear it!

5.0,My gf and my first thanksgiving together was around the corner. Great charm to celebrate with.
5.0,Ordered for my daughter for her outdoor &#34;spring&#34; soccer games.  She absolutely loves this and it was a great price!
5.0,"I got this for daughter and it fit her well, the suspenders were a bit long but overall she is happy!!"
5.0,Super soft & perfect fit! Didn’t fade in the wash.
5.0,Very cute and nice rain jacket!
5.0,"Great quality and style, I love it!"
5.0,Could be cheaper in my opinion. Cap fits well and looks great.
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised at how well this fit. I sized up based on reviews. Not too tight and not too loose. Just right. Shipping was faster than expected, too."
5.0,"Love it! I’m 5’6 and usually wear 2-4. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Very flowy and I love the pockets! Plunging neckline, but can still wear a strapless bra. I can’t wait to wear it out to dinner. I’ll probably wear some kind of sweater or jacket with it."
5.0,Great looking watch at great price.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them!!!
5.0,Received many compliments on this unusual piece
5.0,"Love the material, very well made, fun and flirty"
5.0,Very cute flowy dress. Arrived on time and fits as expected. Material is comfortable. recommend purchase.
5.0,"All excellent, the product arrived in perfect condition, resistant packaging and dimensions meet expectations, time costs fulfilled expectations as at the times indicated by the supplier was adjusted."
5.0,Better than the picture. Fits beautifullt!!
5.0,"These socks are affordable and fit well. 10 pairs are included. They are very thin, which is desired for my use. My feet sweat quite profusely, so I prefer thinner socks. These socks are very lightweight and wick sweat fairly well. They work for both athletic shoes and boat shoes.<br /><br />They are low-cut and additionally include a silicon non-slip guide near the heel. The never have issues with the socks slipping and they will last an entire day on my feet. They gray color is light and blends in well with my diverse shoe collection. Note that the bottoms have writing which denote the non-American sizing (see photos for details). While I would prefer that they not have this writing, it is a minor comment that does not affect the function... especially when such writing is hidden 99% of the time."
5.0,Got it in decent amount of time and love the product the material is awesome sleek and stylish. The only thing bad is the &#34;hidden&#34; pockets I can't fit a normal card in but the six card slots lock the cards in well and it's just a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. Great wallet
5.0,Great sweater. Fits and looks great. 6'2 188lbs athletic build. Large fit perfect. You will not go wrong with this sweater.
5.0,"Very happy with the shoe, wish the velcro was a bit higher quality."
5.0,These knee socks look fine with my boots. I love all the colors too!
5.0,Works perfectly for my daughter and her gym clothes. Excellent quality and value for the price.
5.0,"I wear a 36 C bra and I ordered a Medium. Tried it on and I do have to say it was a bit on the tighter side, although the support is great. I did stretch it out a bit and it’s pretty comfortable, not to mention super cute! I love the style."
5.0,These little spring bars are the perfect replacement for a few watch bands I have. The quick release is way nicer than using a spring bar tool.
5.0,Great quality. Highly recommend.
5.0,So cute and so simple. love how lightweight they are
5.0,"So I am 6’0” tall, and online dress shopping has never been my friend. But this dress fit as expected (I ordered a large) and I will be keeping it! The buttons are fully functional and the fabric feels/looks like linen. It is also lined!! The waist hits right under my bust (normal for me), and it is long enough to go to the middle of my knees! But to the busty ladies out there: be warned! I am a 36D and the fabric is not stretchy, so I get that dreaded open gap between the top two buttons. Nothing a safety pin can’t fix, but if you’re more busty than me, you might want to size up. Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,"It was a perfect fit Medium size  My bust is 35, waist 29. I'm 5'7. I have worn this dress four times now. I get so many compliments on it."
5.0,Exactly what my son wanted and he loves them! Says they are very comfortable.
5.0,Best Poncho Sweater ever bought!
5.0,Gift for my boss and she loves it.
5.0,Fit is great and comfortable. Fabric materials used are stretchable which make these skinny jeans a lot better than the others advertised here.
5.0,These tie dyed socks are fun and do the job!
5.0,I wish I would've gotten them sooner.
5.0,nice quality! a lil slow delivery but i love it
5.0,Great for wearing under thin shirts
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:650ca3a3752677e214f6d724306e4c77]] I read some reviews on here that complained about the quality of the backpack for the price. Well, I ordered this backpack after having ordered one by Adidas for the same price and this one is far superior in quality than the one I got from Adidas. I would consider this great quality, especially for the price, so I don't know what the other review(s) was complaining about, but my guess is they don't know the current backpack market. I would consider this heavy duty material, even stronger than what I would expect for the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. High quality material.<br />2. Cool space-themed design!<br />3. Part of the proceeds benefit astronaut Buzz Aldrin's sicence/space related non-profit.<br />4. The patches are a great touch.<br />5. Easy access zipper to the main compartment next to the American flag on the side, so you don't have to unbuckle and unroll the top of the backpack to quickly get something out.<br /><br />Slight Con: There's only one really, and it's that you have to like rolltop backpacks. This was my first one, and I can't say I love it for every day use, but we'll see how easy it is to frequently use the side zipper to the main compartment.<br /><br />Overall, I think the design is great and the material is fantastic! Well worth the price."
5.0,looks great it is for some of my friend.
5.0,"Look. This is crazy, but whenever I wear this watch people comment on it. I mean, it's gotten to the point I've gotten numb to the compliments. Like, ""oh yeah, of course you like my watch."" Is this a taste of what it's like to be famous?"
5.0,"A nice duffel bag.  Seems to be, as usual with Carhartt, good quality.  I like the size of it, I was a little bit worried it would be too big due to some of the other reviews but it wasn't. It'll fit the clothes for both me and my fiancee when going on a weekend trip.  I've put a 12 fl. oz beer bottle in the pictures for size compassion."
5.0,These are amazing. Very very nice. Hubby loves them
5.0,Style.
5.0,Great bag looks and feel like those quality bags
5.0,Great Fit!!!
5.0,"These earrings were a hit. The picture leads you to believe they're much larger, but they are a nice size and I got lots of compliments.  I love them!"
5.0,True to size. Very soft material.
5.0,What an absolute steal. Amazing price for this amount of product. I love each one of these designs and they fit my fat ear lobes perfectly.
5.0,Nice for wearing around the house!
5.0,"This was a last minute deal I was able to snag which worked out because I had a masquerade party to go to. Fount that an XL was perf for me (179 lb; 5""5) and I was pleased to find out that it wasn't extremely form fitting so it was comfy enough to breathe, eat in and enjoy my night overall. Hit right at knee."
5.0,"I have sweaters and T shirts with necklines that aren't perfect for the office environment  and these dickies have solved my problem!  I don't like the feel of a full shirt under a tighter fitting sweater or Tee, so this is the perfect solution.  The quality of the fabric is great - and the stand collar is well designed.  I like how the dickey has straps that go under your arms to hold everything in place.  I used to laugh at dickies from the 60s but now I'm glad to have found these."
5.0,Great material! Love it. Just as cute as it was in the pictures! I wound definitely recommend!
5.0,I like the look and fits right because the prong goes in any space between the weave instead of predetermined holes.
5.0,"Excellent shuffler.  Slick, quick, and smooth.  Very satisfied."
5.0,The cats love this!
5.0,Very comfortable and absorbent too.  Highly recommend these!
5.0,soooooo worth it
5.0,"Adorable!! So cute and nicely packaged really good material, and a very unique magnetic lock! I would definitely buy another one from this manufacturer😍"
5.0,Absolutely ADORABLE for my nine year old who’s a huge Stranger Things fan! Surprisingly well made! The shorts are adorable and I think we could actually pair them with a cute top and shoes yo make a cute outfit. Really good quality for the price and she got so many compliments! Many thought she was a sailor girl but that just comes down to some folks not being familiar with the show.
5.0,I have an alligator belt that had been sitting in the closet for about 10 years with no attention paid to it.  I noticed that it had lost most of the original sheen and felt dry and brittle to the touch.  I ordered a bottle of the Angelus product and found that a single application restored both the shine and the supple feel of the leather.  I was well-pleased with the results.
5.0,Perfect fit and extremely comfortable for a good price
5.0,Size were on point.
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! Love it. Nice quality
5.0,Perfect for themed bday! Arrived in no time and looks great! I’ll be back to buy from here… no more Etsy for me!
5.0,Nicer than I expected. Great value!
5.0,nicem and foe the pricem exellebr!
5.0,"Comfortable & perfect for hot, muggy nights."
5.0,"Better than I expected, comfortable, eye-catching, but not over the top, very tasteful and versatile, grab it, ladies, till it is available! Carolyn never disappoints!"
5.0,I LOVE THIS NECKLACE. I totally recommend it. It is great quality and super stylish.
5.0,I’m a male nurse or Murse and I’m wearing these socks RIGHT NOW as I write this review on a short break. I highly recommend these socks. I bought two pair and wish I had bought more. Compression socks are NOT just for old people. They work great for anyone who walks a lot at work or stands on their feet for long periods of time. This brand is a really good choice.
5.0,Top fit perfect bottoms was a little snug on my hips but still manageable
5.0,I got the dinosaur print. Super cute! Just like the photo. I wear a pant size 12 and a large shirt. Got the large dress and it fits perfect! I’m 5’6 and will prob have to wear this with leggings; I could go either way but a little gust of wind my show off more than what I’d want :)
5.0,"SUPER DOPE!!!!!!!!! Quality is 10/10!!! Shipping was fast, and the glasses make me look sooooo fresh."
5.0,Super soft! Great quality! I am buying more!
5.0,"Great quality, awesome fit, washes well, arrived on time"
5.0,Great fabric covers butt fit is flattering
5.0,Great quality sweater!
5.0,Really nice . Great fit and look great !
5.0,I love it ! Very good quality
5.0,Fit is absolutely perfect (same as shoe size); does not pinch or squeeze toes.  I wore these all day the first day and they stayed comfortable.
5.0,The front was a bit too high but i just bought a tutu for under And that worked out perfectly. Loved this dress
5.0,A friend gave these to my Honey for Christmas and he loves them.  It's nice that there are so many lenses that can be rotated quickly.
5.0,I have to wear glasses and a pair of clip on sunglasses at the eye doctor was going to run me about $40.00.  I was able to get these for under $12.00.  They are easy to clip on and then clip back off when I am done using them.  They block out the sunlight very well.  They are a pretty color and I love them!
5.0,Got a size too big to get an extra year out of it. Our daughter absolutely loves them!
5.0,Almost perfect but run just a tab big
5.0,Will add some pizazz to your style of dress
5.0,This is so cute! I know my son will love it and appreciate the sentiment! Can't wait for him see it on Christmas!
5.0,"Great quality, great theme."
5.0,I Love this dress. The style is very simple and nice. It's a good material but a bit lighter than I expected. It fits perfectly on my little petite body and it's not tight which is great.
5.0,Perfect fit and very soft!
5.0,This is a very durable backpack and quite large it is worth its weight in gold.
5.0,"Good quality, vibrant colors"
5.0,Got this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it!
5.0,"A touch too big, but can Velcro the strap tighter to fit. Room for my daughter to grow into. They are adorable! Great price, too."
5.0,Just as described; good value; comfortable shirt that is true to size.
5.0,Bought for my son for a Christmas stocking stuffer and he said that it was very comfy.
5.0,Great overcoat. I wear it to work all the time. Everyone loves it! Very comfortable and stretchy. Worth the buy!
5.0,I really like these sunglasses.  They fit so good and have good sun protection.  I love the color of them also.  I would recommend these sunglasses to everyone.
5.0,"Exactly what we wanted, it looks great in person and is true to what is pictured. My daughter is 5 and the size 6 was just right. Will buy more.<br />Not sponsored."
5.0,"This shirt seems to be fit like a unisex tee, which I love. Not form fitted around the stomach like most women T-shirts are made. I bought a large because I wear a 36DD and it fit perfectly. I plan on washing it on delicate and drying it on low or air dry just to keep it looking good."
5.0,I love this dress! It came in with long sleeves instead of 3/4 but I actually love that! I got the white with black stripes so it's see through but with a slip it will be perfect. I love that I can wear it in winter or summer--may be a little warm for 75+ degrees but good for cooler summer days.
5.0,"These rings are awesome, and you can't beat the price. A must have item!"
5.0,Loved the hat. Comfortable and the product is made to last a long time.
5.0,Bought for my boyfriend to have a different option to wear with hit fitbit Blaze!
5.0,"All the sock/slippers did not fit.  They are a little to small.  I am a size 10 womens.<br />They are absolutely beautiful, colorful and warm.  I will have to return them though.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Loretta"
5.0,"My daughter was in need of a pair of house shoes. She has wide feet so slippers seemed like the best thing for her, comfort-wise. They are easy for her to slip into. We needed to wash them and they held up beautifully going through the washer twice. They have a nice sole on them. Even if they only last a year, I would be happy since they weren't very expensive. She loves the cute avocado pattern."
5.0,"love this blanket, i was kinda nervous when i read the description and it said sherpa but it's actually waaay softer than i thought it would be, thank you papa, very cool"
5.0,It was just what I wanted for my goddaughters high school graduation!!
5.0,Great job i got these sun glasses like 3 days before the original delivery date i luv them they fit perfect
5.0,Ok ladies I am 5'10 and 180 I have 38dd and I ordered and xl and I love it the top and bottom fits perfect I all ready ordered another one in a different colors if you are a curvy women this is the perfect suit for you
5.0,"I'll order another one, one size smaller. Very soft and gentle to my skin material/textile. Modern line and look that it is contoured clearly. Love it! I'll even keep the one somewhat large one and wear it with a vest or something.."
5.0,The underwear is very comfortable and soft.
5.0,Can’t believe how soft it is.
5.0,This shirt was perfect.  I recently had elbow surgery and needed something easy to get on and still look professional.  This was perfect.  The fit was as expected.
5.0,"Not sure how they do it, but there is no mistaking the fact that this wallet, with all the same cards and cash in it as my old wallet, is much thinner in my pocket.  I carry 10 plastic cards, 3 coated paper cards, and cash in my wallet.  My previous wallet was 1 3/4&#34; thick with these contents.  Transferring it to this wallet, it's a shade less than 1&#34; thick and it is far more comfortable in my pants pocket.  And, I'd say they underestimate the capacity when they say it will hold 12 cards.  After putting my cards and cash it seemed like it would easily accommodate more, so I grabbed a few gift cards I had just to see how much I could comfortably fit, I easily fit 15 plastic cards, my 3 paper cards and 12 paper bills in without any problem.  The test with extra cards did result in a thicker wallet, but still very slim.<br /><br />Initial impressions on the construction are all positive, it appears to be good quality leather, well stitched and with the pleasant aroma of leather; not an overwhelming chemical smell like many leather products have.  Of course, only time will tell if it is a durable, quality leather product."
5.0,"I own about a dozen pair of the leggings depot ultra soft leggings. They are by far my favorite leggings. They are super soft, do not have seams or tags that irritate, do not bind, are not see-thru and the colors remain vibrant and the crotch seams remain intact after multiple wears and washes. All this and at a great price too!"
5.0,Very soft and pleasant to put your hands in!!! Love that inside is fur lined
5.0,"Extremely comfortable and cute, shipping was on time."
5.0,Even though the nose screws were very short I'm still giving it a 5 star review.  I have a lot of jewelry and in these lots I got some perfect length tongue bars. Since standard length feels way too long I prefer the shorter ones.  The belly rings are great too. The industrial bars are nice.  My favorite parts of this are tge tongue bars.
5.0,Great product. Very well made. Sleeves for glasses ear piece is deep and snug. Great purchase.
5.0,"Very comfortable with the patented rocker roll.  They do look a little clutsy, but they are ""working"" boots."
5.0,Very comfortable sleepers with good cushioning.
5.0,my favorite sweatshirt! really comfortable!
5.0,Love the color and quality is fine let's see how long last. They are a little bit to darker but is fine.
5.0,I love this this bag it feels very soft on the outside and a very good price i love the bow the most on the out side
5.0,Yes! Yes!
5.0,Super cute swimsuit! My daughter loves how soft it is. Fit is perfect.
5.0,Made of a soft comfortable material. Husband loved the style.
5.0,Love it!!! Not too short! Not to long!!!
5.0,"Sleeves on this dress were a little tight, had to cut slits but other than that, it was a great “Snow White” dress and good quality."
5.0,"This is the second time I’m purchasing socks from the same brand and they didn’t disappoint - the material is soft, the print is nice, my 9-year-old son really likes them."
5.0,Balroom dancing shoes!
5.0,This zipper front robe fits great!  I am 5 feet so I was skeptical.  I have the XL- fits loose.  The material is very comfortable.  My previous robe was a thicker fleece.  I like the material of this new robe better.  I would never have a robe with a tie -  only zipper.  This zipper is fine now- with low quality zippers these days I hope this holds up.
5.0,"These jeans are cute but don't believe the size charts.  I wear a size 12 and bought a size medium, as per chart (which says a medium should fit 12/14) but they are too small.  I can get them on, but they creep up and form wrinkle folds all up and down my legs.  Looks bad.  What's worse, I would have to pay shipping charges to China to send them back."
5.0,This fit perfectly. I got a 30DDD after having a 32DD (of a different brand) that got knocked out of place by the ocean waves. This top was more revealing than I expected but I put it to the test and it stayed in place without budging.
5.0,After putting thesse on my 9 year old was the fastest in the class.
5.0,"These socks are nice and warm and they fit perfectly. My son loves to pull off his socks generally, but with these ones, they are comfortable and almost feel like a booty. I definitely will re-order."
5.0,My 2nd pair of Zero's. Great gloves. I got the small which are a little snug but Im hoping they'll stretch a bit. The mediums would be too big for sure.
5.0,Great find plan on using when I travel.
5.0,"These gloves are so beautiful! The leather is so soft and supple, the fit is so cozy, and they come in a package that they can be stored in when not in use so they stay fresh. I bought them in black and in red and I’m so glad I did."
5.0,"Met all my expectations.  Replaces the same watch which I previously had for 10 years or more!!!!!  Very, very satisfied."
5.0,This blouse was everything I expected!  Nice fit and no color variations.  Exactly as shown!!  I love it!!
5.0,Just what I was looking for. I was nervous about figuring my size but Amazon's return policy took the fear out of the guessing game. I love this Ang going to order another pair.
5.0,This watch was exactly what I was looking for as an everyday casual watch. It arrived with a dead battery but was otherwise in perfect condition with all the expected packaging/documentation. I had a new battery installed and the watch was sized by a jeweler and I am now wearing it. I have already received several compliments on the appearance and style of the watch. I especially like the clasp on the strap as apposed to a buckle since bands with a buckle tend to be uncomfortable for me.
5.0,"I meant to order Wayfarers because that's my go-to style but I'm glad I made the mistake now because I love these. This is my 7th pair of Woodies and they're just as great-looking as the pairs before them, I get complimented on each pair every time I wear them, I love this company and I love love love their products."
5.0,"This is a gift for a friend. For the price, I thought it was very nice. The tag price said 228¥(chinese yuan) approx 33USD. It came in a box, band around a cushion, with a pin to adjust and cloth to clean. There are no bad factory smells, watch is overall clean. I normally don't buy watches at this price or brand, but as quality goes it's good. Weight is okay, band doesn't feel cheap."
5.0,I love these! I put my reading glasses and sun glasses in them. I also gave some to family and friends.
5.0,We used this for our daughter’s graduation. She were her heritage with pride. Proud to be Nicaraguan and Puerto Rican. Loved it.
5.0,It looks good and fit so sexxy.
5.0,Work well for kids. The different colores alow them to conquer they kids experience.
5.0,Great product.  I use this for my officiating shirts and the clasps do NOT call off my shirts.
5.0,"Simple and cute, just what I was looking for."
5.0,"Great fabric, quality."
5.0,got this a lot faster than expected. i love it
5.0,excelente calce y perfomance.
5.0,"These earrings are much prettier actually than in the photo.  Small, very nice shine and comfortable backs.  Highly recommended."
5.0,I’m super in love with this jacket. It is super warm and soft it runs<br />Just a bit small nothing to bad or uncomfortable
5.0,Soft and very cute !!!
5.0,Great glasses and a quality case. This was a fantastic deal.
5.0,These are great I love them!
5.0,Pretty straight forward.  They hold even a heavy damp wetsuit and I haven't had one break and I've used these for years
5.0,Beautiful trendy sheer turtleneck ... I wore for holiday party and received countless compliments. Easy I Recommend hand washing and hang dry due to sheer material.
5.0,sent it back and got the petite size which fit perfect. Nicely made.
5.0,"My daughter choose that, she like the colors, it is her first watch. Good for a 3 year old girl to learn time and practice her violin."
5.0,"Excelent, perfect good suit sport"
5.0,"Ocarly 925 Very nice cross, very authentic and cool. My wife loves it."
5.0,This is my favorite shirt my daughter owns now!  Ordered a size 3 and shes in size 2 but it fits her really good. So I'd say sizes run a little small
5.0,"My daughter loves it and fits great,  ty"
5.0,"Living in the south, I get so hot in the morning after a shower. I've worn robes forever, but even the sleeves are hot and annoying (especially if they're longer than 3/4), and I contantly have to re-tie the belt. This solves all my problems! It's so light and airy, but covers you up, and the zipper is a lifesaver. Love the two pockets, too. I'm a solid medium, and the medium in this fits with the perfect amount of room to still be comfy."
5.0,Cute.  Ran a little big
5.0,"Love this Dress! So comfy, wear boots with tights  or leggings! Dress up for work or dress down for home. I will be buying more in different colors!"
5.0,Purchased it for someone. She loves it
5.0,"I love these jeans. They fit my body perfectly. I have a small waist with large hips, pants that fit both my hips and my waist are hard to find. These fit perfect and I will be ordering them again and again. Thank you"
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to lock and unlock.
5.0,The quality of the shirt is what I expect. When you order online you never know. My son loves it
5.0,I love these earrings. They are the perfect size. I wear them almost daily.
5.0,This watch beyond met my expectations. It is beautiful and looks way more expensive than it is! I want to buy it in the other colors cause I like it so much.
5.0,"Look great on, dont fall down when running. Everything I wanted."
5.0,"The blouses material is actually pretty thick. I was kind of iffy about buying it assuming that ran small, but surprisingly, it fits me well. I’m pretty busty and was able to fit comfortably around my chest. The sleeves are puffy, but not too much that interferes with mobility. Overall, this blouse is well made and I recommend it."
5.0,Love this wallet. Away get complement on it!! Will be getting a second one soon. Order one... You will love it too!!
5.0,Super soft and comfy!  Fits true to size and is so cute!
5.0,Got as a gift. Loved them
5.0,"Fits great, arrived in great shape and the details around the brim are whimsical and well made. I was able to shape it easily and for the first time in my life, I have a cowboy hat that looks cute and chic for a really inexpensive price. Great buy!"
5.0,"bought for my daughter but ended up returning because she didn't love the design, however, looked exactly like it did online."
5.0,"The shirt was cute, but I had to order 2 sizes larger than what my husband normally wears."
5.0,Haven’t tried the gloves out yet but they seem to be well made.
5.0,So thankful to have bought this three pack for my three kiddos! They each got one that fits their personality! Great buy!
5.0,Gave as a gift to my granddaughter:  she loves it!!
5.0,"Was bought as a gift for a pendant. Works perfectly and great length, fell just right"
5.0,"Really good product for the money! I usually buy my bras at VS, but considering what I have to pay there for a D cup bra, I thought I'll give it a shot and try a cheaper solution.<br />This bra fits very well and feels comfortable. I just received this item today, so I only tried it on, and didn't wear it all day. However, if this bra feels as comfortable wearing it long term, this buy was a success!"
5.0,Very pretty and small like 🥳
5.0,Better in person fits perfectly!
5.0,I paid more than this for one pair of these fabulous leggings from a local boutique and loved them so much I went looking to purchase more and found these!  They are warm and amazingly comfortable. The high waist band prevents the dreaded muffin top or cutting in at the waist.  Highly recommend!
5.0,"This wristlet is the best surprise I've ordered. It has all of the  slots I need for my cards, cash IPhone, Kleenex lipstick. I can carry it alone or put it in a larger handbag.....very convenient to move when I change bags, and is flat enough to fit in a large pocket"
5.0,Niece was very pleased
5.0,Great fit and very pretty.  It was just as pictured.
5.0,What a great sundress! Comfortable and fun!  Easy choice for a summer day.
5.0,This was the perfect addition for our white elephant game! It definitely got a lot of good laughs
5.0,"A bit too wide and thick for my taste but overall, very good"
5.0,I love this. It works perfectly for my Gear 2 smartwatch.
5.0,Perfect fit love this Tank top
5.0,The frame is light and very comfortable definitely worth the money.
5.0,"Glad that I took a chance and ordered this stylish fashion-statement for my Best Friend birthday! Her finger size 7-7.5, fit snug but that's okay! She prefer it that way.<br /><br />Material: good quality (not cheap looking)<br /><br />Shipping: only 2-days<br /><br />Lots of compliments =)"
5.0,"I have this in the long sleeve and short sleeve and had to order a Small in both. I usually wear a Small or Medium depending on brands, so wasn't surprised it was a little baggy as  Medium. Super comfortable, holds up well, and lightweight. Really cute shirts for the price!"
5.0,"Absolutely loved this swimsuit!!  Did hear the elastic pop a few times while pulling up and down on the bottoms.  Overall, would recommend if you are looking for something to flatter a full-figured body type.  I would order 1 size down to ensure that it doesn't sag too much in all the wrong places."
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my friend. She loves them. They are the perfect size, not to big or long but easily tell they are flamingos.  Perfect gift for anyone who loves flamingos"
5.0,"excellent fit, a very good inexpensive choixe"
5.0,"It is beautiful , it is light ... feels great ... but to me it is a little bit ( just a little bit ) smaller in size ... but it is acceptable ... i really love the shirt"
5.0,"I have small but wide hands, so the fur was as expected for my hands.<br />I happen to love then a lot too....<br />A nice change up from full coverage gloves especially in the fall. And more stylish than driving gloves which sometimes hurts my wrist with the snap closure.<br />These slide in nicely for me and stay put.  I wish there were more colors."
5.0,"Bought it to go with a costume. It's so darling, I wish i could use it all the time. :)"
5.0,"These are nice, well-made laces. I bought Timberland boots that come with terrible, thin laces and I have replaced them with these laces. There are 3 to a package so I have spares for years to come."
5.0,Unreal quality fast shipping well packed gonna buy another.. Mike _ Tina
5.0,"This outfit was perfect for my son's baptism. I ordered many outfits trying to find one that was modern yet classy. This was it! Everyone loved it, and I love that we have such an awesome keepsake now. The outfit came to midcalf, which I at first thought I wouldnt like (had wanted pants) but it lookes great. He wore white shoes to go with it, and didnt wear the hat (only at the after party, as it was adorable). He typically wears 12mth clothing - the 9-12mth was way too big and the 6-9mth fit spot on. If he gained a lb he probably wouldnt have fit :)"
5.0,fits well for petite
5.0,Good quality fits nice ! My son is 5 and is obsessed with unspeakable so he loved this shirt
5.0,"I got these first in black and then in the darker grey.<br />They come up to the natural waist and are loose but not baggy, fitted but not tight. Soft material, good stretch, nice fabric density (not too thin or thick).<br />I've tried on maybe 10 different sweats trying to find the perfect pair. These are them."
5.0,"My husband loves them...since he has a beard, the regular face type masks were more cumbersome to wear (because he was always adjusting to accommodate his beard). The ear loops make these slip down his face less"
5.0,Used it to pack food for my kids when we travelled. I just placed it on the conveyor belt when we passed through airport security. No need to indidvidually pack food in ziplocks and bring them out.
5.0,"Very well packaged, just the right amount of  weight  and  size.  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE!"
5.0,My grandaughters liked them
5.0,as advertised. Arrived on time and works great
5.0,A must buy for the summer! These earrings are lightweight and the perfect pop to add to a tee shirt and jeans/shorts ensemble.
5.0,Arrived in excellent condition.... Thank You!!!!
5.0,Exactly what I expected.  Shiny and nice great look!  Good price
5.0,"Perfect, as expected."
5.0,"Small but heavy, high quality materials and craftsmanship, would make the best gift because of the size of the also very nice package it comes in."
5.0,I liked the print and that It came with a 2 free filters! It’s a nice mask!
5.0,Love the fit. So many compliments & fits as is.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my Daughter. It is just lovely and very well made. I know she will love it. Thank you!
5.0,Came the very next day after I ordered it and fits perfect. Very flattering. Material is lightweight. I ordered a large
5.0,"these shirts fit as expected and work great! Sleeves are a bit too long, but this is not a problem."
5.0,This cross-body bag is one of the most convenient. I love to be able to reach right into an outside pocket zipper without the hassle of having to take the bag off of my shoulder just to get something from the inside. These outside pockets make it so much easier to just reach with one hand while to having to remove the bags position. The size is perfect and the ability to secure your items without worrying about them falling out makes this a good recommendation.
5.0,Perfect fit for my daughter. Very comfortable. Easy to keep clean
5.0,Beautiful sweater. Great fit. Very impressed
5.0,I'm really surprised to not see a single review on this sweater. It's lovely. I am an XL and it still looks great for a one size fits all. I am going to love wearing this sweater this winter. Super cozy and looks great.
5.0,The strap was a replacement to one I had years ago and allows me to hang my phone around my neck when exploring this great world of ours.
5.0,Simple but functional wallet or small clutch
5.0,Love these sexy pants. They fit perfectly and I wear medium normally and ordered a medium so they fit as expected. They are super warm and stretchy. So cute to wear out in these northern winters. I am 5’3” and 135lbs and ordered a medium.
5.0,Very cute! It fits true to size and washes well! Well made and looks cute!
5.0,Very soft nice color flattering to your figure
5.0,My husband loves these sandals. Most comfortable ones he has ever had
5.0,"This shirt is comfy and adorable! I'm 5'3&#34; and the medium was big, long, and hung off my shoulder! Received great compliments!"
5.0,I liked everything about it great birthday present.
5.0,"Can't beat this dress for the price. Dress it up or down. Just buy it, you can't go wrong."
5.0,Good quality. Soft inside. Built sturdy. Fits well.
5.0,Well made and weight to them.
5.0,They are truly soft and comfortable.<br />Love them!
5.0,"Such cute socks! I love the gummy bears. They fit similarly to my other Socksmith socks (I'm a women's 8, and they fit perfectly), and are decently thick for novelty pattern socks. They've withstood a few wears and washes so far (machine wash regular cycle, perm press in the dryer), and I imagine they'll handle the weekly wear they'll be going through!"
5.0,"Fits all my cards , just what i needed"
5.0,"I love the dress and the cute print. Nice gold color, flattering fit, slightly high waisted. Material is comfortable, could be more substantial, however, it isn’t so thin that you can see through it. It’s definitely a body con dress. Not too low cut and has pockets!  Fabric is lightweight enough for Summer months.  It’s 3/4 length sleeves give good coverage.  It’s a little snug on me because of the Quarantine 15 but will fit great when I lose that."
5.0,Good grip and durability after a wash
5.0,"Bought this for my girlfriend and I can't tell you how much she loves it! She wears it at least 3 times a week. Very good quality, no concerns there at all.<br />You're either a sloth person or you're not. She's a sloth girl."
5.0,"This arrived very quick and looks exactly as pictured! True to size and fit perfectly, but if you wanted to order a size up it would still look great! Really shows off your curves &#60;3____&#60;3 I might have to order more from this company."
5.0,"These mittens look awesome and are very warm, our daughter loves them! The long string that comes with them and runs through your coat is a plus, no more losing gloves! Would highly recommend."
5.0,Nina Queen! My new favorite bead for my pandora! I hope the quality never changes! The designs are delicate and beautiful.
5.0,Great looking necklace with a sentimental message! My daughter lost her BFF and she loves it and put it on as soon as she got it. The words describe how she feels. Looks expensivr
5.0,"I absolutely love the pattern, the fabric is great quality, and the dress is made great. Pictures do not do this dress justice. I am so in love with this dress. It looks great with and without a petticoat underneath. Definitely a great purchase."
5.0,"I really love this.  It is a made of  a nice, comfortable fabric.  It fits well and looks great with tights and boots.  I love the lace detail at the hem.  I plan on wearing it for Christmas.  It will be so comfortable but still look good.  I recommend it."
5.0,Love the size and the very expensive look of these earrings. Beautiful for work or dining out. I’ve received many compliments when I wear them. Would make a very special gift.
5.0,Great dress for great value
5.0,Just what I want perfect
5.0,I love these bras!
5.0,So comfortable to wear through out the day.
5.0,"I really like this comfortable little summer dress. I’m 5ft tall so it’s long enough to be just a little above knee length. It would also be cute with leggings.<br />My only issue, it runs small in the bust."
5.0,My husband absolutely loves the variety!! They fit perfect and he loves being able to have different rings to wear on different occasions
5.0,Beautiful color. This dress fits and feels great! YAY
5.0,They fit well. They look good. They're easy on the wallet. I purchased the Brick Geode frames with gradient lenses....cool. Real Cool.
5.0,Very very comfortable.  You can tie it up & wear it alone or with leggings. I love the satin material.
5.0,I love the watch. Look so cool !!
5.0,Very Cute! My little sister loved them
5.0,Runs small love it great for one time outfit.
5.0,Love it very nice 🥰🥰
5.0,Get this!! It works for all colors and materials I used it on 3 of my shoes and I’m gonna try it on my all white Curry’s. I think it will go well but I’ll see 😁
5.0,"After having a knee replacement, compression socks were recommended. The SBs are well made and more comfortable than the two other brands I bought. With limited flexibility after surgery, they are very difficult to put on. I wear them all day with no issues."
5.0,This was purchased as a gift for a friend. He likes it. He liked the maroon color and the way it fit.
5.0,"I am a 5' 9"" and a size 6 in a dress. This dress fit me like a glove. It was perfect for a wedding reception I attended. Definitely recommend this dress to anyone."
5.0,"Love this dress, I have it in 2 different colors.  True to size, very flattering."
5.0,Perfect fit and good color.  May order other colors in the future.
5.0,Love this boot! Just as expected
5.0,Love<br />The softness and warmth
5.0,Me encanta este reloj
5.0,This works well when I am riding my stationary bike. It helps me get my step count.
5.0,"I ordered the XXL and felt it was a lot looser than I wanted so I gave the XL a try, and it fit fantastic. For reference, I am 5'2, 190 lbs, 38C bust, 37 waist, and 47in hips. If you are busty, you may want to size up on this. I purchased dress in 5 colors. It fit very well."
5.0,"This is just what I needed.  It's very shiny and holds all of my credit cards and some cash too.  Opens and closes with ease and even has a place for engraving, if I wanted to.  As a business card case it would work the same.  Closes with a snap and just suits me."
5.0,Love these sunglasses! Will have to get in every other color. Very well made. Happy it comes with a carrying bag and cleaning cloth.
5.0,Comfortable and great for summertime.
5.0,"Great pair of stylish suspenders that arrived safely, and within the allotted time-frame! No problems, and fits my 15 yr old son just fine--not too short, nor too long. They are well-made, and look like they will hold-up well to lots of wear! Would buy this brand from this seller again!"
5.0,"Totally beautiful. Exceeds my expectations for size, softness, quality of fabric and intensity of color. This drapes nicely from the weight of fabric and there is no static.  I can't wait to wear this all winter! Also, I got a chuckle out of the label on package."
5.0,I just got these today. I was a little bit in question as to how they would fit coming from someone where else. They they fit PERFECT! I normally wear a large in sweats. But I tried a X Large and hit it on the head. So if you order...order a size up.
5.0,"Perfect. Just as described. It is big enough to take my phone, keys and other things I need to carry when I get out of my house without looking bulky. Can easily use it with most dresses."
5.0,Bought these for my littles to wear while they use their iPads. They’re great!
5.0,I love it its so cute 😍
5.0,It was more then what I explained it to be. 💖 IT
5.0,"They look beautiful, not fake like a lot of CZs do. Nice sterdy backs."
5.0,This was an authentic looking safari hat.
5.0,Super cute. I love them
5.0,Beautiful I receive many compliments great quality !
5.0,Buying more! A little long but not too bad. Easy to hem.
5.0,Beautiful! Fits perfectly very please!
5.0,"I get so many compliments when I wear this!! It’s soft, cozy, and falls so nicely no matter how you wear it; single loop, double loop, looped off the shoulders, etc. I will be ordering it in different colors!!"
5.0,Very nice dress. Was pregnant at the time when I got it and got a lot of compliments on it. Fast shipping and overall was happy with the fit.
5.0,"So I just received this dress Saturday and I wore it to work today. It fits really well. The fabric is nice and soft. I thought it was just a simple dress, I bought it for the days I'm feeling lazy and dont want to put on pants. I had so many compliments on it. I had random Male customers tell me how beautiful my dress was. I was walking outside and had people driving by tell me they loved it. It was very odd. It's a very simple dress, very comfortable. The skirt is a little see through I had to put shorts on underneath but other then that it was a fantastic buy."
5.0,Its so dainty and pretty. Exactly as shown. It looks a lot more expensive than it is.
5.0,Couldn’t be happier w/ this purchase!
5.0,"Very nice leather strap, beautiful distress look, a good quality."
5.0,My stepson loves it! He wore it skiing
5.0,Very soft! Has pockets! Button on top so it won’t pop open! Fits the 18 inch doll as well!
5.0,"Love these chains, they do come a bit tangled, but once you untangle and get the sorted out, they are so cool! kurapika is one of my fav characters, so these were totally worth it"
5.0,Great sun shield!!!
5.0,I received these pearls yesterday afternoon.  They are perfect.  Love the size and the magnetic closure.  Makes it so much easier than the hook clasps.  I will look forward to more from this seller.  Five stars.
5.0,"My teenage daughter loves these earrings they are made very well, especially in that they were so affordable. They are definitely versatile and that she can throw them on with a T-shirt or she actually loaned them out to her friend for prom. They were beautiful greatest and the best or in the most in formal attire"
5.0,Great quality and fit. Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Good quality. Buttons are nice size.
5.0,My husband wears it everyday and adores it.
5.0,My daughter lives in these. They are holding up very nicely!
5.0,Very comfortable. I use these for high intensity and yoga workouts. Provide me nice cushion and support and I have high arches
5.0,"Muy linda, me encanto"
5.0,The shorts were awesome!
5.0,Love love love. It fits great. I am 5 ft 6 155lbs and due to reviews I bought a large because it runs small and it fits perfect.
5.0,Awsome shirt people ask if I work for Harley Davidson..
5.0,"Lots of room in this bag, it is holding up to all the stuff I put in it. I get alot of compliments as to how different it is."
5.0,"Extremely comfortable and better than advertised. A friend of mine recommended for me and I am very, very happy with this product. The back of the waistband fit perfect and is very comfortable to relax in and wear to bed."
5.0,"I bought these for my husband, but I tried them on, and I loved them. Once he tried them on I couldn't get them back!<br />I would definitely recommend these wonderful pajama pants, and wanted to buy more. I hope they will be back in stock soon!"
5.0,Pendant is smaller but classy and the color of the stone is awesome.  Not overbearing at all size wise.  2mm chain fits this perfectly
5.0,"Love it! You get exactly what you order. Adorable dress and high quality, stretchy fabric"
5.0,So beautifully made and quite large. The medal is a nice addition. Hoping for conversions :)
5.0,Very nice for very little.  Stretch bracelet makes it easy on and off
5.0,Daughter picked this out as her birthday outfit. She paired it with a pleather moto jacket and black Vans. Very cute!
5.0,These boots are beautiful.  The color is more of a coral than a red.  UGG never disappoints.
5.0,"I thought it might be a load of rubbish when I read other reviews because said it was very thin etc. I agree it is thin but now I'm wearing it , that makes it feel snug on your wrist. I bought one 6 months ago for another tag I have and paid $35 just for the deployment buckle, all in all this looks and feels great , compared to tag heuer prices it's dirt cheap ."
5.0,These are so soft and cute. The look like regular clothes too.
5.0,I like the quality of this little necklace especially for the price. I don't think anyone could find a nicer necklace for the price.
5.0,I got the gray cardigan and it fits me a little big but I can still pull it off. It's more of an oversized cardigan. It's very soft and well made.
5.0,"I bought these shoes for my 4-year-old and she loves them. Easy to get on and off and nice, cushy support for the bottoms of her feet. I always buy leather shoes for my kids (otherwise their feet sweat like crazy) and this is one of the few that I can afford.<br /><br />The only thing I can say is they scuff easily and I'm not sure how I'm going to polish them with the decorative stitching.<br /><br />Very true to fit. Go easily with blue jeans and dresses. I would buy more umi shoes for her."
5.0,Perfect buy! Works great!
5.0,"The green stripes on shoulder are material sewn in so should wash well.  The design on chest however, looks to be a heat transfered image possibly screen print but doesn't look like it.  I am interested to see if it washes well.  Other than that, the jacket itself is a good quality, size is pretty accurate and looks nice.  WOW emblem zipper pull is a nice touch.  It is a Christmas gift so won't know about wash durability until later."
5.0,Gorgeous piece of lingerie! And arrived very quickly. I love the lace and the red and black color. I feel so sexy wearing this. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to feel sexy and beautiful.
5.0,Love the colors! The dress runs big! The top was very loose but with minor alterations you can readjust!
5.0,"Great for a girls night out! I bought the pink sparkly in a small: I’m 5’4” ~123 lbs. with 32DD chest. I loved the fit and the color and I received so many compliments!<br /><br />Only cons: in the daytime the skirt was pretty sheer, if you want to brunch in it, buy a liner/slip. Also because I have a semi larger chest, I had to tie the straps pretty tight and I had slight bruising by the end of the night, but that was probably form dancing and the strings rubbing my clavicle all night.<br /><br />If you are in the market to switch up your going out outfit I recommend :)"
5.0,Love these !! I have my right side of my nose pierced and they fit perfectly. You can also use it as a “fake nose piercing” i did that on the other side of my nose and I love all the colors it comes with definitely recommend these 😍😍
5.0,Great shorts for a great price.  Wore them for the first time on a 29 mile ride and they were great!
5.0,"Love it!  Color is fabulous reddish copper.  Fit perfect.  I look marvellous. Lots of hair and curls.  Exactly as pictured.  Now, I just need a party to go to!"
5.0,"I'm posting pictures to help others with choosing the size. I ordered a small because I wanted it to form fit and less baggy, I'm wearing it out tomorrow.<br />Review update: I got so many compliments and the dress was the best choice for the birthday party! Flattering for sure!"
5.0,My son said they are very comfy. He wears orthotics in his shoes. So it was nice to have a flip flop for a kid with arch support.
5.0,Fast delivery. Product as described. Love my earrings!
5.0,Ellegant
5.0,"It hugs all my curves, holds things in, isnt see-through and is really well made :) I could not be happier!"
5.0,My boyfriend loves his hat. They fit great and can be adjusted if need be. Wonderful price cant be that deal
5.0,"It is super comfortable, love the pockets and it super soft"
5.0,Love it!  Will be ordering another.
5.0,"I am enjoying these a lot. Have been wearing them almost exclusively with exception of a great threader set I purchased at the same time as these but I like these more because they don't need to be adjusted throughout the day the way the threaders do. I have two sets of piercings so I love stacking. They look cute on too. Also, they are comfortable. I am allergic to nickel and I have not had a single allergic reaction so far. Plus, I was so shocked to find that I fell asleep one night and forgot to take them out. I don't think I've ever done that in my life (unless I was traveling on a plane or someplace where I couldn't go to bed). I hate feeling encumbered by anything when I sleep so earrings, tight hair bands,  rings, etc. all must go. So you can imagine how shocked I was to catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror the next morning and realize they were still in. Great purchase."
5.0,I normal don't wear t-shirt dresses because they're either too short or they're too boring but this dress is so cute! I does not come tied but its pretty easy to just tie it myself and that means I can adjust the height of the tie which is great! This dress is also a great length because I have a bigger butt where dresses are usually too short but this dress is longer in the back when I tie it so its perfect! 10/10 totally recommend!
5.0,Fits nicely. I’m 5 feet 135 lbs and a medium was perfect.
5.0,These are literally the ONLY earrings my 9 year old daughter will wear! We have two sets just in case she looses an earring.
5.0,Beautiful!  My grandson loves this.  It is just as nice as the one I got at the Renaissance Fair for $20.
5.0,Very good dress I bought size 4/5 for my 6 yrs old girl and fits big but good i love the dress
5.0,"While visiting the Vermont Store on a bus trip through beautiful Berkshires, my wife purchased the multicolored scarf with built-in hand warmers. As a Christmas gift I ordered matching Solmate sox to her delight!"
5.0,"Cute dress, fits as expected. Love this dress!"
5.0,High quality and very Cute!
5.0,love this top and so did everyone else
5.0,Best socks ever! They sre no show and they stay in place!
5.0,I was so excited to get this on my doorstep. It is even better than the picture if you can believe that!!  I couldn't wait to get it on my daughter.  The material is great and it is very will made.  I am thrilled with this product and I would definitely buy from the seller again.
5.0,Well made mask. I got this for my 10y/o and she loved it. It was for her to use with her Halloween costume which was just a Jack Skellington tshirt. The mask and t-shirt matched very well.  We already washed it a few times and it has held up pretty well.
5.0,"I wore these to a cat-themed party, and they were perfect for that. The title suggests using it for running, but I don't think your legs will really be able to breathe that well in these so I recommend against that."
5.0,"Sent my daughter several pics of dresses for prom and she finally said “yeah I like that one”. Ordered the rose gold, size 12 and it fit like a glove.... thankfully lol. We did not have a back up plan.  It was delivered quickly. She loved it and I loved it too (loved the price)!"
5.0,Finally glasses that don't break every time they fall over.
5.0,These are very comfortable. They do run a bit wide though. Service and delivery was great.
5.0,"Love it!  This dress is such an easy wear, it is comfortable and easy to dress up or down. I am a mom of three kids and having to dress up and take my kids places can be a challenge because I don’t need anything too low-cut or too short  (parenting requires a lot of bending and stooping).  I ordered a size small, I am 54 and 120 pounds and the fit is perfect.  I did order this dress in both black and maroon but found that the maroon dress looks a lot cheaper than the black, the colors don’t quite match up."
5.0,"Still holding its elasticity 3 years later. Fits very comfortably and doesn't seem to roll-up as badly as other binders I've tried. Very breathable material. I'm a drag king, so I wear this consistently 2-3 nights a week under very intense stage lighting. I wash it with my normal laundry and dry it as well and it's still held up remarkably! No complaints."
5.0,So happy that i ordered this cute little charm.its was worth the money and was delivered  quick....im very pleased with my order an will be ordering again very soon..
5.0,I’ve never received so many compliments!  Thank you Lido Luxe
5.0,"I wear this bracelet daily.  Fits perfect, and helps me to ward off negative vibes and energy. I am an empath so I get drained by people’s energy easily,which is the reason I got this bracelet. I appreciate the sentiment of a free gift, but what I got was crushed up, broken remains of a crystal. However, the product itself is just what I wanted."
5.0,"Love these - I have a small face, so they fit great without overwhelming my face - they are prone to bending, so get a case, but love them."
5.0,I really like this pair of jeans and would buy it again.
5.0,"I typically stick with classic black or tortoise shell sunglasses, but have a birthday trip coming up so I decided to step out of my comfort zone... so glad I did! The oversized lens are just the right size and shape, not too exaggerated. I was worried the tint would be too light for the beach sun, but I was pleasantly surprised how dark they were once I had them on! Absolutely love these... may have to order the classic black just because!"
5.0,Stretchy fits perfect if your kid is slim if not go bigger
5.0,"This was all my boyfriend asked for for Christmas because he loves Uncharted. Lost his first one, this one is a better replacement!"
5.0,Looks amazing. I want to buy everyone one
5.0,"Super cute and comfy, fit as expected. Material is soft. My daughter loved them."
5.0,I first received these glasses and thought they were amazing! To pay this little for a nice pair of sunglasses makes you feel that much better when you inevitably lose them/break them.<br /><br />I had an issue with my order and the customer service team at Newbee was super prompt and helpful in fixing it. All around great product and great company.<br /><br />Thanks!
5.0,awesome purse&amp;wallet just perfect in size .lightweight an compact
5.0,"I did not have high expectations for such a low price, but this scarf is gorgeous. The print is beautifully done, and it has a sheen that makes it just right for the holidays."
5.0,Well pleased with this shirt. It is of good quality and shipped quickly.
5.0,"I had bought the Male 3XL and Female XL.  The Female XL was tighter than expected, however 365 In Love made it a point to make sure I was happy with the product, and sent me the 2XL along with postage paid receipt for return of the smaller shirt.  The Men's shirt fit perfectly - they are true to size, but I would go up one size you normally buy for the female shirt.  Otherwise, very happy purchase - got many compliments on my honeymoon weekend with them, would purchase again!"
5.0,Excellent shirt and service 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5.0,Fantastic quality and price!
5.0,The strings are super sturdy and all of the seams are well stitched. No plastic smell like I would have expected. I liked the bag so much that I came back and ordered a second one.
5.0,"This chain is a very lovely chain at the price. It's decent quality and is somewhat close to gold (only a little more yellow/orange than gold(depending on the karat)) at a fraction of the cost. If you look at the picture with two chains, the stainless steel chain is the shorter of the two and looks very close in color to the longer chain which is 10k gold. I wanted a simple chain to wear daily but also wanted something that would withstand daily showers and wear and not turn in color. This has been great so far! I ordered the 20&#34; and was a little nervous that it would be a little long but I actually love where it falls. Very lightweight too! I am very satisfied with my purchase and you will be too if you purchase this."
5.0,good price and quality.  It has become my go to hat for hot days.
5.0,"I RECEIVED THIS BELT TODAY AND I LOVE IT, PERFECT FIT. I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE DETAILED BUCKLE W/LEOPARD PRINT ON IT(NICE TOUCH).

THIS BELT CAN BE WORN FOR ANY OCCASION AND I WILL BE WEARING THIS BELT TO WORK. THE ARRIVAL TIME WAS NEXT WEEK AND IT ARRIVED TODAY. THE ITEM WAS PACKAGE VERY NICELY.

I got the apricot color and in person it's a pretty neutral peachy beige color that can be worn with most every color. The material feels nice and there have been no rips or tears. I was actually surprised but very happy that the quality is so great. The price was super reasonable and I'm glad I purchased this scarf. Just a heads up for those thinking of buying this, make sure to order well in advance if you are ordering this as a gift or for a special occasion since shipping for me took between 2 and 3 weeks."

5.0,"These are very pretty and good quality. But best of all, the seller took their time to triple wrap these for shipping and even put them in a cute little drawstring baggy. They ended up being a little small for me (my fault for not being sure if I was a size 2 or 0), but for such a great price I can just buy the next size up and give these to a friend who is the size I got."
5.0,It is perfect for breastfeeding. Perfect for many occasions!
5.0,bought brown ones and they fit perfect. very satisfied with my sandals.

5.0,Perfect accessory for my costume
5.0,Great light and cosy cardi
5.0,"This is a very beautiful shirt and I love the lace on it. As for the fix, you may what to let people know that the sizes run small. It would be very helpful. It is make very well. The fabric is very soft and lays nicely on your body. The lace is a fabulous addition to the shirt and looks great. I choses a white shirt which is a great look. Over all I am very satisfaction with this produce, other then the size issue. This would make a great gift for a family member or a friend. (Disclaimer this product was purchased at a discount for an honest unbiased review.)"

5.0,These are beautiful.  Very nicely made.
5.0,"This boyshort shaper is perfect. I got it in nude and black. I'm 5'8 133 lbs and a got a small and medium because I wasn't sure. They both actually fit fine and there isn't much difference. I don't need super support,  just enough to smooth out the bum under a dress and have slight coverage on my upper thighs. The length is perfect to wear under a short dress or even a shorts romper."
5.0,Fantastic buy for my Navy guy!!!!!
5.0,I read the comments so I sized up since she likes them on the big size. Good quality and she wears it all the time

5.0,I loved ...

5.0,[[VIDEOID:4e32ad97dba8489e8a24b188d274d7eb]] Love it! It is a bit thick in the chin area where the electronics sit but otherwise not much different that wearing a regular mask. I have gotten tons of positive feedback when people notice it. Visability not great in daylight but fine inside.
5.0,The slippers are great
5.0,Plata 925 segura 👍me facino.
5.0,High quality. Soft.
5.0,"Love the size of this bag. A welcome addition to the messenger bag, weekender, duffle, gym bag, and small tote."

5.0,I LOVE THESE BOOTS THEY ARE VERY COMFY NOT MUCH ARCH SUPPORT BUT THERE IS A BIT. I SO LOVE BOWS SO THE BOWS ARE A NICE TOUCH.
5.0,"I really like the dress.  I was confused about the design because it looks like a seam finish.  So I wore it on the other side, but then I saw the tag on the outside.  I read some comments from others and found out that some wear the dress with the seam finish on the outside and some others wear it on the opposite side.  Personal preference.  Overall I like the dress.  You can dress it up with accessories or wear it more casual.  The fit is good and I like long dresses.  Would love to have something like this with sleeves for the fall and winter."
5.0,Love it! Fantastic design and very well made!
5.0,"Love the different sizes!! Backs stay on good, almost too good, hard to pull off. But that's great for me!!"

5.0,"I have had three skin cancer operations. Have been buying summer hats for a while, but none of them shaded my face or eyes from the sun. This one is great. I like the way it looks. The wide brim definitely cuts the glare from the sun and protects my eyes, too. I also like the fact that there is a cord that goes under the chin. I live in Chicago and have worn it in the wind. No problem! I really bought it for function (protection) not form (the way it looks). But, I have gotten so used to it in a short time. I love the hat. I like the look and it does the job! Very nice fit, too."
5.0,"As a runner with size DD I appreciate not only the &#34;stay put&#34; ability of the bra, but also the design and colors of the bra. I've had it for a while now and use it often. The material is holding up well, and there is no chafing (as I've had problems with in the past with other sport's bras). I always buy just a little larger cup size because I don't like to be completely compressed."
5.0,These are absolutely beautiful and very elegant. They are just enough Christmas without being too much. I love them!
5.0,Great price.  These pins were affordable and just beautiful.  I would definitely buy these again.

5.0,"Great camping socks or just to keep feet warm while reading a book or watching TV. Great for sleeping too, if you suffer from cold feet. You need to know these are NOT slippers for walking around the house, they are meant to be socks/slippers for sitting to keep your feet warm.<br />I'm women 8.5/9 shoe and I purchased XL as I like to use woolen socks in them for extra warmth. Perfect for cold winter months and seem to be well made."
5.0,Love love this combo!!!  Just the right length and look.  This looks better than the $90 Cabi combo I bought.  Fits better too!!!
5.0,Fits great but definitely order a few sizes up for a fit like on the model.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:29cf37bcd117032c1835271e723da24d]] Very nice jeans. My favorite ones tbh! I’m a big girl size 22 and I’ve had my jeans almost 3 years now and I wear them ALL the time. I’ve gotten so many compliments. It’s been three years and the sparkle patches  on one leg are now just starting to come undone but I was able to sew it back up :) and I have had no problem with tearing or wearing in the inner thigh which most of my jeans have done in the past. Great quality and makes my butt look great lol

5.0,PERFECT FOR DRIVING.  VERY SOFT AND ELEGANT WITH THE 3 BUTTONS ON THE SIDE.
5.0,Overall smaller then I expected. Belt didn’t fit me (44 waist) but that was no surprise. I was only after the buckle and it looks great. I have a belt that is for removable buckles and it looks great. I would buy another if it were bigger but I do really like it.
5.0,My daughter LOVES these shoes.  True to size.
5.0,Exactly what it says and works great.

5.0,Suits me perfectly.
5.0,"I’ll admit, I initially bought my husband a pair of these thermals because it has a “peanut” holder. I love gag gifts for his Christmas stocking, what can I say? These bad boys actually helped keep him (and his little guy) quite warm during a trip to NYC for Christmas."
5.0,"My husband's favorite golf shoe, in fact, the fourth pair I have purchased. The BOA system works well, pop out the knob on the heel, open the shoe, slip the foot in and twist the knob.  No shoe laces to become loose on the course.  Wonderful for those with arthritic hands.  I understand that these have been sadly discontinued.  I bought two pair with this purchase. The fit is classic Footjoy, the leather is quality, and the price is right."

5.0,"I needed goggles for my 11 year old girl that takes swimming lessons twice a week.<br />This model looks so pretty, very important quality for an almost teen young girl, are high quality and come with a nice hard case for protection.<br />The goggles fits my daughter perfectly, doesn't leak and remains clear during all the hour of her lesson. <br />No complaints at all and I'd definitely recommend!"
5.0,"This fit a little large on my 6 month old but that was to be expected considering it’s a 6-12 month fit. She was comfortable in it, it was easy to put on and it worked great!!"
5.0,"My sons says ""they feel great and they're awesome!"" Good deal, got them in time for his first game."
5.0,"These are perfect. The material is super soft and sporty. They are flattering and fit correctly in all the right places. I am 5’2” and 130 pounds, the medium is loose enough in the legs but snug enough around the butt. I plan to buy them in more colors. Perfect pants to be comfy while looking put together."

5.0,Great price perfect fit and in time for Father’s Day

5.0,I really like this key chain. The spinning part is larger than I was expecting (it's about the size of a casino chip) and the images are clean and sharp. Great item for a Pink Floyd fan.

5.0,Fit great and seem to be well made
5.0,"Very happy with the product, Had it on the other day at 30° and I was very comfortable."

5.0,Beautiful dress...nicely made and such a low price!!
5.0,"Beautiful blue, just as described, fast delivery, very happy with product!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this hoodie! It is stylish, attractive, comfortable and not too heavy! It will be ideal to wear inside the house since it isn’t bulky or heavy. It is perfect for outdoor wear in the spring and fall or on those cooler summer evenings. I am wearing mine in the winter, too, on days when we get to enjoy that wonderful sunshine and mild temperatures! In other words, I just love it and want to wear it all the time! The sleeves were a tiny bit shorter than what I am accustomed to and fit me perfectly but if you are someone with a longer arm length, that could be an issue. I roll up my sleeves anyway so I don’t mind. I would say that it is cut in a manner that makes me believe it leans towards a person with a petite stature. I ordered a medium and I am 5’2” tall and it fits me perfectly. I usually end up with hoodies that are slightly long unless I specifically look for a petite (which aren’t easy to find). So, I am extremely pleased with the cut and fit of this hoodie. It is definitely prettier than a lot of the ones you see. It is really attractive! I definitely recommend it. I ordered the blue plaid one."
5.0,"I have several different cat-themed bags and love them. They are well-made and are the perfect size for a small purse when only a few essentials are needed. I keep my iPhone accessories, extra bands, charger, etc., in one; my iPod and all accessories in another; Kindles, chargers, power banks, cables store well in others. I keep extra makeup in one and even store cat toys in another. Love the size and the endless usefulness -- besides being so cute!"
5.0,"Wow! These are comfy socks! As soon as I start putting them on I thought wow, this is a nicest sock I've worn in a long time! They're very comfortable in my ankle boots, and are padded in all the right spots.<br /><br />Even though I wear size 10, I ordered extra large, and they actually fit perfectly. I probably could have worn large as well, but I thought I'd try the extra large and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Very nice that they're ergonomical, one for the left one for the right, and I love the colors! By the way they are marked up by the big toe, you can see a little L in one of the pictures for left.<br /><br />I think these CWVLC socks are well worth the asking price, because I can tell these are going to last many many years, and are SO comfortable. I'm heading off on a trip to do a little light hiking next week, and I'll update this when I get back."
5.0,"Always wanted a pair, love them.  I wear them on the motorcycle and they have a great grip. Highly recommend"
5.0,"Came as described, husband loved them"
5.0,This was a gift for someone else so I really don't have an opinion other than it appeared to be well made & I was told that it fit.
5.0,Looked like the picture .. material very good quality...it's soft and perfect. The top is great to wear with anything honestly 😜 I ordered a size up bc I like bigger loose fitting tops and I'm glad I did bc you can tie the front up in a knot and wear with some jeans!!!

5.0,I love the way this nighty fits ❤️
5.0,"These are almost perfect. I reviewed another similar product that was also almost perfect. Would be great to get you two together.<br />These are my go to readers. Comfortable, light, but not very strong. They fit well.<br />Fantastic product. I LIKE these."
5.0,"Great hoodie, but it's so synthetic it &#34;squeaks&#34; between your fingers. Does the job though of keeping me warm, and it's relatively breathable. Overall it's pretty all right."
5.0,"Great set of rings for the price!! Thick and nice quality. Runs a bit big, order down"
5.0,I really wanted the Love band but they are all awesome too looking forward to purchasing many more especially at this awesome price!!!<br />Thank you XoXo

5.0,"Necklace is super cute. Made really well. Stainless steel, no tarnishing at all wear daily and shower with it on.<br />Reccomend"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1557909149b0d5e925544239292f2f4c]] It is gorgeous and so elegant! I loved this so much I purchased an matching necklace.
5.0,Beautiful charms! Loved them
5.0,"[[ASIN:B0012NFY82 Sterling Silver Pink Cubic Zirconia 5 MM Heart Stud Earrings]]<br /><br />I have 3 holes in one earlobe and two in another. I like to wear Cubic Zirconia Studs that are dainty and pretty and yet the studs are secure and won't fall out.<br /><br />At Gem Avenue, I have bought at least 3 pairs of great cubic zirconia posts, heart shaped, star shaped and in garnet color which I love. Also the stars are a clear color.<br /><br />Whenever I've tried to buy pierced earring studs in a store, where the prices are reasonable, they have these horrible large round plastic pieces attached to them. I hated them so much I stopped wearing earrings because that's all I could find.<br /><br />But at Gem Avenue, I now wear my stars and hearts and they are comfortable and look great.<br /><br />The service is professional, the earrings come in a nice box and there is never a problem. I hope to buy more from them in the future."
5.0,I needed this at the last minute for a pageant it came quickly and was great for the price!!!
5.0,Order a size or two up they run small
5.0,Beautiful. Just as described!
5.0,"Love it, it’s exactly what I wanted! I have yet to wash it, but I think once I do it will fit 100% as I wanted and expected it would since it will shrink a little! Nice and airy fabric!"
5.0,"Nice, soft and fits perfect!"
5.0,"A couple of weeks back I was perusing Orient watches late in the night and saw this model for $49.95. Usually, the Orient Chicane models are well over $100, so I ordered it. What a nice watch! It keeps very accurate time ...within 3 or 4 seconds a day. I recently learned that Seiko owns a controlling interest in Orient, a brand I was not familiar with, a few months back. Their watches seem to be more accurate than similarly-priced Seiko automatic watches. I've bought 4 different Orient watches in the past few months and have been very impressed with both their construction and accuracy. They deserve to be better known! There are relatively few retail outlets to purchase them, so buying them on Amazon at a low price is a no-brainer. This watch is about the same size as a plethora of the Seiko 5 series, so if you're shopping for one of them, you might want to cross-shop similar Orient models. This watch can be used for casual or dress wear. The leather band is very well made and not one of those cheapie ones that comes on a $30 watch. The black face with contrasting large numbers at the 12,6 and 9 positions make it easy to read for those of us with aging eyes! All-in-all, I got a very nice watch for not much money! I wonder if someone slipped up on the price!!!"
5.0,"Great product, however a little $$$"
5.0,"I mean there’s not much I can say. The material is good and comfortable. It can get a little hot if worn for too long, but that’s mostly if you’re moving around a lot."
5.0,Love this product.  So cute and was perfect with my Rae Dunn St. Patty’s day display
5.0,So flattering I love it. It that king of bright white color I would buy the black color as well
5.0,Really cute.  Get lots of compliments.
5.0,Best bang for your buck watch. Im a mechanic and i bang this thing around like nobodys business and go to the beach with it on. Its got scratches but it keeps on ticking
5.0,The picture is clear and has nice details. Would purchase again..
5.0,These are very comfortable and last a long time. First bought them just after pandemic started and old ones were worn nearly every day and washed very often but lasted for well over 2 yrs.  Ordered more just in case.  I have underlying health condition so have to be super careful.  Just received my new order and they are great quality just as the first ones. Love the colors and the cut fits my face well. They have protected me well.
5.0,"My grandaughter loves this hoodie. It is well made, fur lined, and warm. Rachel swears she isn't going to take it off till it disintegrates. She's 13 and petite so I bought her the small it fits a bit big on her but everything does due to her size. Looks just like the picture."
5.0,I have a fairly small waist so I didn't have to stretch it too much. I think it is a great product and just what I wanted.
5.0,"Great tie clip, works perfectly with any suit or shirt!"
5.0,Nice simple Henley tank.  I liked it and bought two more of them.  I use them at the gym or during the summer time.  Simple cut.  That's what I wanted.
5.0,"Very pretty and well made. Gave them as a gift, tempted to buy myself a pair."
5.0,Great fanny pack!
5.0,"These are great. I bought them for a base layer for skiing and they were great. A little tight but according to other reviews, I expected it."
5.0,Super Cute! Stretchy comfortable material. Great quality! Arrived 2 weeks before expected date!
5.0,No complaints. Looks great
5.0,Just what I was looking for.  Works great
5.0,"I ordered size 34W x 34L and received pants that were internally labeled 34 x 34. They fit me pefectly! And although not labeled as such, they're designed as SLIM FIT. Just what I wanted! Well made too. I'll soon order more of them in other colors while they're still available.<br /><br />Using a garment measuring tape, actual dimensions:<br />  Waistband 35&#34;<br />  Inseam 33 1/4&#34;<br /><br />NOTE: Its 100% cotton fabric is the lightest weight cloth. Considerably lighter than cotton jeans. So don't expect to get a lot of wear out of them. I'm sure that they will tear easily. Great for casual dinners out on hot summer evenings. Just don't go jungle bushwacking in them :-)"
5.0,"Looks nice, well made"
5.0,I have order many to give to my daughters  sisters  aunts why as the charms  becoming  smaller  will order  another  for myself  please send a much  bigger charm _ Thanks
5.0,This dress fit true to size! I ordered a medium. I’m 5’3 and 145 lbs and it fit me perfectly. It was originally ordered for a Handmaid’s costume but it was such a hit that I decided to wear it for my engagement photos. The dress is very well made and thick but the lace adds a delicate touch. The only con is that the skirt does crease easily but a little steam pulled most of the creases out.
5.0,"Bought this for my husband's job Christmas party, it was perfect! Very comfortable! I bought a XL, I'm almost 5'10, length was perfect, not to short! Great price! I was very pleased!"
5.0,Fits very well and is super comfy.
5.0,Gave to a friend for a birthday gift. Says she loves it.
5.0,"We bought these for our 4 months old and love the quality! Hats were a little big for him, so we rolled them up for the perfect fit. He will definitely grow into them though because they are good quality and will last for a while!"
5.0,Just as advertised.  My teen loves them.
5.0,Quality product. I used them to make hunting straps that go around the tree to hook your gear onto.
5.0,"Good stuff, holds well but doesn't leave my hair feeling stiff."
5.0,Field. Beach. Gym. Dinner. These shorts do it all. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,These socks are thick without causing me to sweat. They offer added support in my arches. They are comfortable both in sneakers and walking around mu house. They have been a very welcomed addition to my collection. What a wonderful way to celebrate a bit of Pride while also wearing amazing socks!
5.0,I bought for my daughter and she was in tears when she opened it. She loved it so much. The texture is more slick than the typical sweatshirt.
5.0,I ordered it Wednesday and it came on Friday. And its a great hoodie
5.0,I purchased  this watch  for my father  and he absolutely  loves it.  The quality of workmanship is amazing  and it's absolutely a beautiful  piece.
5.0,Runs a bit small so go up a size.
5.0,Russell for 30 plus years.  Consistent and I know that is what I get
5.0,"Hanging on the guitar, it's kind of sticky on the leather."
5.0,Works great.  Keeps my 3 y/o's glasses in place.
5.0,"One of my favorites. Ordered a bit larger and I love it. Great for hanging out at home and if I ever went anywhere, it would be nice for that as well."

5.0,"Comfortable, great quality"
5.0,Wonderful boots! Comfort all day standing at work. Tim's are the Best!
5.0,Great product for keeping little feet structured who typically want to run barefoot or In socks only. However they are HOT and my little ones feet SWEAT! I wish they had the inserts like the adult crocs. However the use of spray alcohol or wiping with alcohol inside of the shoe help to keep them clean and burt bees talc free baby powder in the shoe ameliorate the sweat issue.
5.0,So cute I absolutely love these! They are the perfect size and reasonably sturdy! Also came with such a sweet not from the seller! Thank you! :)
5.0,Super cute and fashionable<br />Fits my 4year old perfectly .

5.0,"It's nice, strong hold.  So far this winter, no lost gloves."
5.0,"Absolutely love these. And great price. They feel better,  then the ones I bought from a medical store and cost less. I was having a lot of trouble with my legs and feet. Sore tired really tight and felt bruised. With some stretching and wearing these socks. I felt better at work where I am on my feet all day. 12 hr shifts. Even when I'm not at work I am always walking somewhere."
5.0,Great add on to any rig!!
5.0,Very nice and made well!
5.0,"Perfect fit.  Comfy, yet sexy.  Love these.  Will order again."
5.0,"These pants are very light and airy. The instructions say to soak them in cold saltwater for like 5 hours the first time you wash them to help prevent the colors from fading. In the picture I've included, my feet are on the ceiling, so it's more of an example of how the pants look than how they hang."
5.0,Out of all my Coach crossbody bags...this one is my favorite!
5.0,"Super cute, I can't wait to try these out during special occasions when my work is a bit more lenient on what socks we wear."
5.0,fit my husbands oakleys perfectly. sooo much cheaper than anywhere else.
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. Other reviews said it would be small, I have a larger head, it was snug but in a good way. It was so thick and warm and not odd and flat looking at all. Love it. Much better than the $14 ones on here."
5.0,"First of all, I thought I ordered one shirt. I didn’t see an option for a three pack but that’s what I got, for $20.<br />It is a lovely, fine cotton and it fits like some much higher priced tee shirts I have. I’m very happy."

5.0,It’s excatly what I wanted it’s perfect not one complaint!!
5.0,"I have a lot of rings... like, almost 50.  THIS, for some reason I can't explain is just about my most favorite.  Attractive, understated, tasteful... fits great... just enough sparkle... it makes no sense why I love it... I go big or go home..., but I do."
5.0,He loves them and it makes his life better
5.0,These masks shipped very quickly. Great buy and the included filters works well.
5.0,A fine replacement for me original Oakley lenses.
5.0,"I love this sweatshirt! It fits comfy - right at my hips, it's incredibly soft on the inside, and looks adorable on. Best purchase for a Disney sweatshirt. I like hoodies too, but sometimes you need a classic pullover look. I love the Coco movie pattern - the shape of a calavera made up of the Rivera familia, Dante, and Pepita - mama Imelda's alebrije. Love love love!"
5.0,This was a gift. The quality was good.<br />I was happy with this dress.

5.0,"Love these glasses. They arrived on time and in great condition. The glasses frames are thin, but have that huge coke bottle lenses look that i wanted. The color looks great in sunlight, almost like a cheetah design pattern, but also look good in low lighted areas. No complaints here."
5.0,Ordered size up normally wear a 10 because of chest went with a large look sexy!

5.0,this stamp does dry and the looks right.
5.0,I looked into getting a distance lens put in my current sunglasses as I have macular degeneration and must wear sun protection at all times.  The cost was prohibitive.  These glasses just fit right over top of my prescription glasses and you cannot even tell that they are there.
5.0,The fabric was good quality and the design very cute. A side zipper is hidden under the arm for easier entry and the lacing in the back allows for bust and waist adjustment of about 5 inches. It is a very attractive way to make a great fit.
5.0,Purchased these for my 2 best friends. Beautifully packaged. Quality is outstanding! You won't be disappointed.
5.0,Adorable. Purchased for college aged student. Looks great. Well made and looks like it costs more than it actually does!

5.0,"Excellent fit, comfortable, and cool."
5.0,These fit me perfectly! Just enough stretch to make them form fitting but not so much that you feel like you're stuck in a sausage casing. I'm usually between a size 4 and size 6 (depending on the brand) and I got the Small.
5.0,This is an excellent sweater it is cozy and warm and the colors are very nice as well. five stars
5.0,Really cute jewelry for kids.
5.0,Wife Loves them. No need to say more.
5.0,My daughter loved it and always gets lots of compliments

The sizing is consistent, the construction is excellent, and I get compliments every time I wear them. I only wish they had pockets, but they are awesome, and I am happy to support fair trade clothing!"
5.0,The only problem was with the USPS they lost the package at first and then they messed up the packaging really bad but thankfully the shipper had another wrap around it to keep it safe and clean and undamaged. They were also quick to respond when I sent a message to them I would but again.

5.0,Son muy útiles para el sol
5.0,Out standing value for the money. Our kids love these.
5.0,Took months to get it but when I did I was shocked by the  quality.
5.0,"These do not provide as much compression as some of the other brands and are a lot more elastic. The trade-off is that they are far more comfortable for wearing all day. If you want extra compression a trick is to double up and wear two.<br />  I typically wear a cotton A shirt, a large Neleus and then a medium on top of that ...before putting on my regular shirt. Yes that's 4 layers of shirts but these are so light and comfortable you don't even notice. And even on hot days it is no problem.<br /><br />That tucks everything in, give a sleek, fit overall appearance. It like your wearing under armour and makes the overall physique look a lot more solid and toned.<br /><br />My regular vshirt size is XL. I was wearing the Large but the Medium works fine too. And again, doubling up provided that extra compression and unlike some of the others they're very easy to get in and out of."
5.0,Thin but great fit wear a slip if you need too
5.0,"delivered fast in a cute little box. The ring is beautiful and changes color frequently.Its a very rich looking ring especially for the low price. I ordered 2 more ,different styles but also great."

5.0,"I was looking for a Busch Light hat,  and thought that was what I ordered.  While it was different than what I wanted,  it was as described and shipped quickly."
5.0,Runs a little big but my son loved it as an avid fan of The Prince of Bel Air!! He is lean but tall so he likes L or XL.  Well made and so cool looking/he’s gotten multiple compliments on it and I got serious cool Mom points!!!
5.0,I use the vest for walking  in the early morning and my husband uses it at night for his jogging. Very easy to adjust to be able to fit both of us.
5.0,They're for my granddaughters. I think they'll love them. I do.  They're so cute.
5.0,"My husbanb loved them,great quality crew socks, thick cushion-y!"
5.0,"My 7 year old loves this dress.  Everywhere she does she gets compliments from folks.  Great dress, will be exploring more clothes from this brand."
5.0,Great fit and value!  They are even better quality that I expected given the price.
5.0,Looks and wears great
5.0,"The skirt fits true to size. It’s comfortable and light weight (more so to be worn from Spring- Fall, unless you’re live in warmer climates). The elastic around the waist doesn’t roll. Received a lot of compliments. Worth the purchase!"
5.0,"Exactly what I needed, easy to use, and simple packaging."
5.0,"I do enjoy these, they came in just before my workout time. It fits a bit snug in the chest but not to the point of discomfort, I actually like the fit. It is very breathable and comfortable. I guess if there was any complaint it would be the smell when I sweat, wait no, that's me 🤣🤣 got to have some humor<br />I am disabled so use my arms for everything from regular wheelchair, racing wheelchair, and handcycle so I have bigger arms and chest than most."
5.0,So cute and comfy! The top is supportive. I’m a DD so I have a hard time with sets but the small fit perfect! LOVE

5.0,I was skeptical about getting these but I'm so glad I did I'm a HUGE TMNT FAN (84 and 90's) tho yes I recommend any fan get these I'm getting Donnie next which is the best ninja turtle btw
5.0,"The dress is really cute once you order the right size. I had ordered the 18 plus even though I had lost some weight, and also based on some of the reviews I had read. When ordering this dress, you might want to order a size down. If you are large chested I would recommend the 16 plus. I am 5' tall, 36DD up top, about 160lbs. The 18 plus is a four XL, way too big. I had about 6 inches total left to fill and the straps up top refuse to stay up. I actually liked the length of the larger dress, but the 16 is maybe about an inch shorter, which is still okay with me. I reordered the 16 plus and it fits good. I will probably need to hem it about an inch on both sides, but I feel the 14 plus would be too snug.<br />The material isn't bad and actually softens up after the first wash."
5.0,Amazing price for Life is Good shirt - they last forever!
5.0,"I purchased these maternity pants because I had to face facts that I no longer fit in my regular jeans anymore. What a emotional day at my house. However, these pants were super comfortable. I am a little thick and petite. The pants were a little long on me but I am use to it by now. They always are and finding petite jeans that fit just right is a hassle. I will say my calves are huge. Like pin up girl cartoon calves, lol. The stretch on these jeans are fabulous and I always have issues looking for jeans that fit in my calves. I basically wear boyfriend jeans as skinny jeans. The hidden elastic band is great. It does not roll down and fits over my belly. I will say I am a fan of the side panel for maternity jeans so if these jeans happen to go that route I will give it 10 stars! The quality of the material is very soft seams durable and they are the same exact color of the one pictured. Usually the color is a little different but these are true to the pics. The stitching is great no loose strings, no frays, the fabric looks of great quality. The jeans are very soft and made of 98% cotton with 2% spandex. I have washed them and they do not shrink and the color was just as bright as when I received them. All together I am very pleased with the purchase of these maternity jeans and the quality of them. You can basically use them to just run errands or go out on a nice night with friends and family. They are very nice.<br /><br />I received these maternity jeans free or discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Gave these bracelets as gifts. I liked the look of them and the prompt shipping. My friend began wearing them immediately and has been enjoying them ever since.
5.0,Fit great I made mine prescription glasses.

5.0,"The wrist band is a good fit, easy to place on my Garmin."
5.0,"Beautiful, but shed a little bit. Just what I wanted as far as style though"
5.0,I'm completely hooked on this line of sweaters- they are well made and fit just lovely ! The arms are not too short and the sweater is long enough to cover top of bootie but not cover your bottom . It is flattering in every way . It hugs the body just right . Im 50 and this sweater makes me feel younger and pretty . You wont regret buying any of her sweaters or tops .
5.0,Love the softness & length.
5.0,"Bought these shorts for going to the gym, taking a chance because the price was so low. But I was pleasantly surprised to find them to be a great pair of gym shorts. I will be buying more. True to size."
5.0,I bought this dress for my 5year old. She wanted a dress to match Mommy's new dress.  She loves this dress. She is tall and skinny and this dress fits her perfectly.
5.0,I really like that it’s lightweight and waterproof.  Perfect for my workouts.
5.0,Cute. Love the Victorian look

5.0,I wear these for casual wear and on the boat
5.0,Shirt worked perfect for post op rotator cuff surgery. The tech who removed my stitches was quite impressed that a couple of snaps gave easy access to my shoulder without causing any pain to the surgical area.
5.0,Adorable play dress! I chose the unicorn and it fit true to size.
5.0,Love!! Many compliments
5.0,"I ordered these as gifts. Pricing is way better then I could pay locally, and everyone is always happy for them. The color fades a tad after so many washes... But that's the way things work."
5.0,Love the bag didn't love the price
5.0,Like so many others. I adore patty boutik.  On ocassion there is a miss here and there but this was a HIT!  I love this on.  Yes it’s long but it is ruched which means you are supposed to gently bunch it around your hips.  Very flattering and forgiving of little bumps.  I love this shirt. Also not super cleavagey like the other PB shirts so more demure.  I love it.
5.0,Great skirt - looks like real leather and fits like a glove - a must buy.
5.0,Great baby shower gift.
5.0,I loved the material and and shape but ran very small. i usually wear a large but the xlarge was too tight. I would of re-ordered but that was the largest size offered.
5.0,"Just received me. Looks just like the picture. These have a very light scent to them, not sure what it is but it's nice!"
5.0,Fits like it should. The sleeves don’t go below my elbows.  Like it so much I ordered some more.
5.0,Exactly what i was lookoing for.
5.0,Good enough for a pool party
5.0,Great bra! Try it out you will really like it!
5.0,This necklace is beautiful but there was an opal missing when I received it.  I sent a picture and e-mail to Amazon and they replaced it with a new necklace.  They arranged for UPS to pick it up so I was not out any expense.  Everytime I wear it I get numerous compliments.  People notice it wherever I go.  I've had no problem with the stones falling out.  Great value for the low price!
5.0,greta price and high quality !<br />My wife loves them !
5.0,So pretty recommend for every reason runs small is all
5.0,"My daughter loves it. It fits just a little big. We had to pin up the ruffles on the bottom since it was a little long, but she loves it. Definitely worth the money"
5.0,Really cool! My son had on his wish list so purchased as a last minute cheap gift. Shipping was speedy fast. Was truly impressed when opened. Much larger an expected. My son was extremely excited. I have to admit I believe it’s pretty cool as well. Can’t beat the price. Great gift for a fort it’s fan!
5.0,"I needed some new pajamas for a trip I was taking and staying with friends. I'm usually a sleep nude or in a big Tshirt girl, but didn't think that would be appropriate in someone else's home. These pajamas were perfect. They fit great and we're super comfy. Almost as good as sleeping nude"
5.0,I have searched a long time for a one piece that fits nicely. I finally found it. I love this suit. After having my son 5 years ago I never got my shape back after gaining 80lbs with him still have 40 to go. I am 5'4 170 lbs I usually wear a size 10-12. I ordered the swim suit in a XL fits perfectly. I ordered in various colors since I loved the green leaf one so much cant wait to get the others in :)
5.0,These shoes are really comfortable and fit perfectly. I like that my feet don't slip on them when I walk for long periods of time.
5.0,"It’s soft and fits perfectly on my grandson, I bought 3 so far. I’m very happy"
5.0,I purchased these as my Mother's Day present.  They are stunning. Very pleased.  It came beautifully  gift boxed. The box has a light in it so even in the box the opals sparkle. Very neat touch. There was even a thank you mote from the seller. Highly recommend. I have visited Cober Peddy opal mine where these came from and know this seller is genuine.
5.0,Really nice alternative to the should strap. Very comfortable
5.0,Everything fit great the jacket was just a bit big
5.0,"Only 1 did not work.. They were great people were fighting over them . Bright, study and great for parties"
5.0,I wore this to my sister's bridal shower.  the theme being kentucky derby.  I received a lot of compliments on it.  It went perfectly with the dress that i wore.
5.0,The dress was beautiful and material was great
5.0,"So cute! Fit well, and really well made. Used it for a 12 K race without any problems. Love it!"
5.0,These are a great statement earring because you can see them easily with my hair and yet they aren't too heavy on my ear lobes.<br />I like that they are simple yet catch your attention.
5.0,"Very comfortable, have several pair of this brand and usually like all of them. Haven't found any other brands that fit my feet as well."
5.0,"Love the Aviator  design, looks fantastic"
5.0,"Good fit, stay cool in warmer days. Even good for daily wear."
5.0,This is a nice price for bow ties. Purchased a few colors.<br /><br />TWCL
5.0,She loved the elf hat
5.0,I love my new watch band. It was so easy to put on and fit my wrist perfectly. As a female I was worried it would be too big. The only thing that concerns me. Is that I can already see wear on the band. I’ve only had it for 3 days. To see wear so soon isn’t a great experience. Overall it’s still a good buy.
5.0,I wear danner boots and these compliment the boot very well. I've used multiple insoles before even the highly rated ones found in Dicks sporting good stores and other top stores and none have compared to these right here. I walk on average about 5-7 miles a day while at work and these keep my feet from tiring out and hurting.
5.0,"These tights are thick and stretchy. So far, they seem thick enough that should last a while/ won’t easily run. Very happy with this selection."
5.0,One of the comfiest sweaters ever and super stylish. Love the Seahawks implementation and the ugly sweater look. It's super warm too. Just overall an awesome sweater. Definitely might get a matching one for my girlfriend
5.0,"very happy with this purchase. they fit well and are comfortable. They can be washed normally but do not dry them. They dry pretty fast though, so it is not much trouble."
5.0,very cute! and big!
5.0,Great for a gift. My first skinny tie. An real easy buy. Real satisfied.
5.0,"Ordered for half marathon when rain was predicted.  Price was very reasonable for 5 ponchos.  Each poncho comes packaged individually and I was able to fold one package in half to keep in my pouch on running belt.  I did not wear for running since rain started at end of race although I wore for about an hour and the poncho was effective.  The material is thin (as expected) although no rips or tears occurred when on/off and during wear.  Seems like something good to have around, in car, purse, etc.  I am 5'6&#34; and poncho fit with plenty of room and would fit a taller person as well."
5.0,I love mine! Was just what I expected. Arm length and fit was spot on. Love it... wish there was other colors!!!
5.0,Very nice gift - looks great
5.0,"I've received so many compliments on this necklace, I'm glad I made the purchase because I love it!"
5.0,shocked him i knew his crazy likes. Looks great
5.0,Can't wait to use rhese for my daughter's wedding in December!
5.0,Love the price and shade
5.0,I already have this same purse in black and find the pockets to be just what I need and easily accessible. My black one is wearing really well and I'm happy to have a spring color of the same purse.
5.0,I m love them!
5.0,Nice graphics - the shirt is comfortable and fits as expected - great price too! Thanks
5.0,"I am so glad I found these on here! I am currently 8 months pregnant, 165 pounds pre-pregnancy (now 185lbs) and also work long hours in the hospital and by legs have been KILLING ME! I have about 2-3 pairs of other compression socks that I have bought at scrub shops but these are HANDS DOWN the best pair i got! and they go all the way up to my knees which is exactly what I have been looking for. They are super comfortable and definitely will be buying more! Now these are super tight compression so it does take some work to get them up your legs but they feel great!"
5.0,My daughter always touches the fluffy top and she's happy with them shoes!fits as expected very happy customer!will be buying more for her I see you have style and quality!
5.0,"I have a size 6.5 foot and narrow and these fit generously in terms of width but would be too short for folks with much larger shoe sizes than I have.<br />They do stretch though so should still fit size 7 or 7.5 too even perhaps an 8 or a narrow 8.5, after that the length of the sole may be a problem even though they stretch. When I first put them on they seemed almost too short so do not overreact, they adjusted to my foot within a couple of hours. Now they are long enough for sure and I have some room left in the front. In fact my toes are swimming in there but I prefer the roomy feeling of relaxed. So if your foot is very small these may also be too long or big.<br /><br />I really like these type of house shoes they are like socks with a dark fabric sole non skid to walk on for easy wear and care.  Not strong enough for wearing outside much besides maybe getting the mail on a dry day  but around the house they are perfect for me and keep my ankles and lower calves warm without getting  too hot though in a heated house and I can also wear them year round as I had one of these before (blue with orange and white snowflakes) that lasted several years until the knitting stretched out too much and I found a hole near the heel from overwearing them. That is how much I used and liked them. For the price and comfort though and good fit for my type of foot I certainly got my money's worth and think they are a good value if they fit you.<br /><br />They look pretty cool too, a bit kiddy almost cheesy retro some of the designs and the dark green color depicted in my 2pak turned out to be more the light mint green model I saw listed too, the orange is true to image. I would prefer a more hip design however they have a lot going for them just the way they are for me, enough to override the way they remind me of years ago fashion or Christmas gifts when I was a kid/teen.<br />I have more expensive muk luks with leather soles and also higher taller versions that are warmer with a decorative drawstring to tie at the top but most of the time I feel drawn to these because they feel right not too high and not too warm just right for me. The quality is average and there are some imperfections strangely enough though they do adjust to my foot so they feel like a nice match regardless.<br /><br /> If I did not have such a petite foot especially slender too I probably would not think these are just right so it is a hit or miss based on the length and size of your foot but if they fit and remind you of your childhood going skiing, we called them Huettenschuhe which is German as for a ski cabin or alpine lodge in the Alps and they pack well in a backpack or rucksack... these are the kind of memories they emit for me..., you may like them too.<br />Now I just wear them around the house year round on colder days in Colorado and also take them along on trips they pack well and I find them easy care (gentle wash and dry too) and very convenient. I tried many other types of house shoes but these are still my faves. Most of all, they keep my feet & lower legs at the right temperature where regular house shoes might fail. Prevents varicose veins;) I should add I like to wear Birkenstocks so it could be a style question for some but I have to say health and comfort first when it comes to shoes and my feet look and feel great!"
5.0,"I received this coat yesterday and I absolutely love it! It looks exactly as pictured. I am 5'5,140lbs, 34D. I normally would wear a size 6-8/medium, so I bought an XL in the coat and it fits great!! I won't be able to wear many layers under it but it's warm enough on its own anyway."
5.0,"These are a lovely, thick wool.  Very soft and very warm.  The cut is fitted but flattering.  They came with a wash bag, a gift bag, and a pair of merino socks."
5.0,"Bought it for the hubby,he look good in it."
5.0,Super cute but runs large.
5.0,Super comfortable and easy on the wrist!!
5.0,I get lots of compliments on the way it looks on me
5.0,It's like they instantly shaped to my body. By far one of the best legging set I have bought. Do not hesitate.
5.0,Fits well but be sure to use the size chart. I haven’t worn them out yet but they washed and dried well. Cute print.
5.0,I bought this bag for the up coming CHIEFS game!! I've been looking for a crossbody clear bag for a while. Seems thick and durable. Love the front pocket
5.0,"My mom bought these shirts for herself initially but gave them to me since they were too tight on her. I’m 5’3, 122 lbs and the medium fit me like a small (my usual size). I really love working out in these shirts and wearing them under scrubs. They’re not tight like an under armour shirt, which is why I like them so much. I would definitely order a size up if you want a looser fit."
5.0,Bought it for my son and he loved it when my husband soaw it he loved it too<br />should have gotten one for him
5.0,"Arrived after only a few days with standard shipping.<br /> The actual material is thin, however the hood & strings are thicker. The logo seems like it won't fade either.<br />The sizing fits somewhat baggy.<br />Overall, a very high quality hoodie, at a low price."
5.0,"I got this ring in oxidized silver color.  It's a great, sturdy, comfortable ring.  I like it so much I bought a second one in a different size.  Great for the price!"
5.0,They arrived and are delightfully cute.  I gave as a gift.
5.0,Convenient. Nice for price.
5.0,"Fit as expected, soft, good print, came in a timely manner. Good buy!"
5.0,I’ve bought 3 pairs for my daughters so far. Just like uggs but more affordable. My suggestion is to size up.
5.0,"I was looking for something that looked more stylish than my standard fleece hat I wear outside. This one I wear around the house in the winter and outside on special occasions. I look good, get lots of compliments, and it is super comfortable. I love this hat!"
5.0,"This was my first purchase after getting engaged. I needed this type of ring for work (dental hygiene) and going to the gym (weight lifting) so I did a lot of research. I landed on this one because I liked the color options - I knew I didn’t want something super bright, and I love the design on it. This is very durable while being flexible, and it’s easy to clean. I have not had any issues while working out with it on. I also get a lot of compliments on it. Highly recommend! I will buy one of these for my fiancé once we get married."
5.0,Bought this for my 16 year old and she loves it. It runs a bit small though.
5.0,These shoes run true to size.  They are soo cute.  They are well made and none of the sparkles come off like some other brands do.
5.0,"Finally--a perfect, basic black legging.  Super soft, very stretchy, fit great.  Totally opaque.  Waist is pretty high, but the band is wide and very comfortable.  Highly recommend; I've tried so many black leggings that are awful.  These are good.  Buy them."
5.0,"Have had this for awhile now, still going strong and in my opinion timeless."
5.0,I'm in love. I haven't wore earrings for about 12 years now. I'm very allergic. I was scared what the outcome would be of putting these in my ears. But they are perfect.  I can wear them all day with no redness or swelling or irritation.  Perfect for people with allergies or sensitive.
5.0,She loves em.
5.0,Light weight and chic! Takes any outfit to the next level
5.0,A++++ Product
5.0,A lot of rings look good in the picture but this one actually looks & feels like hard core
5.0,Really love it! Fits perfectly!
5.0,I like this style for my lap swims. I like the amount of coverage in the back and the strap design allows for free movement without concern of losing a strap off the shoulder. I am in the pool several times a week and the suit lasts about 4 months before deteriorating.
5.0,Orders 3 for my bonus girls and they looked amazing! Presented them to the girls on my wedding day and they absolutely loved them ❤
5.0,Belt works very well. Easy to adjust and never have to worry about making new holes.
5.0,Well made warm neck gaiters for kids.
5.0,So cute. Happy with purchase. Hangs a little low but that's exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"If you're thinking about these shoes, just get them. I was slightly worried about buying them, but I'm so glad I did. They are excellent quality for the price. I usually wear an 8 or an 8.5 US and I bought the 39 and they fit perfectly. They feel a bit light on, but it makes them more comfortable. I'm not sure I'd take a hike in them, but they seem like they'll hold up great for normal office wear. Other reviewers said the embroidery was itchy, but I haven't noticed any issue there. I can't wait to wear them with dresses and skirts!"
5.0,I get so many compliments on this.  Shame I left it in Jamaica.  I need to buy another soon!
5.0,Love this mask even my doctor loved it.
5.0,What can I say but it's awesome. The colour is unique. Fits nicely on my head and looks great both forward or reverse.
5.0,"The color is better than what I expected which is little saturated brown than the picture. The strap is lightweight and comfortable on the wrist. Unexpectedly, the brand name is marked as SKAGEN which matches my watch."
5.0,"beautiful vibrant color, good fit washes nicely and so soft and comfortable. highly reccomend"
5.0,"For the price I think these are great! Very attractive but I do think they are too large for my kid sized face. Super fun, but I think too large"
5.0,"This is a very nice, casual shirt that could be worn as an under shirt or as a regular shirt. I paired it with a polo and it looked great. You could wear it as gym wear, for a hike, working in the yard, sports practice, or just on the go. It's well made and very comfortable. Wears kind of big, but once you launder the shirt, it does shrink a bit. No problems though. Fits as expected. Would buy again."
5.0,Easy to insert name tag and exchange between bags.
5.0,Great soft material. Just a little too small. Buy a size up!
5.0,Love this top so much.
5.0,Expensive good quality
5.0,"I purchased these for my adult daughter, who has a more narrow face.  The adult glasses are too big for her.  I knew these were for kids, but they are much smaller than the adult ones.  They did fit her face tightly,  but because she is an adult,  the bridge of her nose is out more than a child's would be, therefore creating a gap in that area.  I wish there was something inbetween the adult and child sizes.  If you have a tight fit against your face they work great, if not none of them will work well.<br />Overall the glasses are well made.  I will probably keep them for the grandkids.  I wish they were in a more neutral color.  But the kids won't care."
5.0,Three rings at s great price.
5.0,This is beautiful. My grand daughter was thrilled with the secret compartments for photos.
5.0,"This is my third ID necklace I have purchased for myself and it's by far my fav! Not too girlie, but not masculine at all. The gunmetal color mixed with the black beads is awesome and goes with every outfit I wear. I get compliments on it at work all the time and it has been a lifesaver! Love the magnetic clasp too, that it hold the badge it place, yet never gets tangles in my long, thick curly hair. Def a must buy!"
5.0,I love these shorts I want one of every color now 😍 I just had a baby so I love that they’re high waisted. They make more comfortable with myself. Hides my mom belly lol
5.0,Arrived quick. Very soft
5.0,THESE PEARLS ARE STUNNING.
5.0,I ordered the black leather boots in 7w.  They arrived nicely packaged.  They fit great I always buy 1/2 size karger in boots.  The leather is soft and great quality.  Beautiful style with comfortable and fashionable heel.
5.0,"Love these! Came with cloth, case, and mini screw driver."
5.0,Wigens makes GREAT caps.  Wear them all the time.
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Shipped quick. Great item.
5.0,My kid love it and it’s soft easy to wash great value and nice and cool designs
5.0,Lots of different designs
5.0,The quality and fit are absolutely perfect! The w skirt is too darling!  For a couple of years now I’ve always wanted a pair since first seeing them on Instagram! I wasn’t sure how these were going to hold up on my 9.5 mile run today but they worked just fine! I love that I’m able to have something I feel comfortable and confident in for the fall season of running. I’m going to get a longer pair for the winter months now.
5.0,"nice material ,more of a muscle shirt fit to size.price is a little higher,but nice shirt."
5.0,Amazing fit! Super comfortable! It was everything I hoped for!
5.0,Love good works! Friends always ask where I find these positive messages on my wrist or ankle.
5.0,"Love the tie, do you think you could make one that has black sheet on it with a single white sheep in the middle?  I get so many compliments!!"
5.0,Great comfort the light lasted 8 hours and we're still going strong when I came home from the AC/DC concert
5.0,The bag was smaller than I anticipated but arrived on time and of anticipated quality
5.0,Good size and finish
5.0,"Love this scrub top!  Fits as expected.  The material is a stretchy polyester/spandex blend, which I wasn't  expecting but I really like."
5.0,Love these! Super soft and great stitching on the Miyazaki scenes. I bought two more packs to split up as gifts. :)
5.0,Love love love this dress!  It is stylish and just a little bit sexy.  It works for a night out or a day in the office.  It fits even better than I expected.  I wish it came in more colors!
5.0,Gorgeous gorgeous. I ordered the ASIA - XXXL and it fits a USA - LARGE perfectly.
5.0,"I purchased this dress for our daughter for her college graduation!  It looked so elegant and beautiful on her.  She has received so many compliments on it.  It is true to size and even has a lacy bottom piece that is so feminine and pretty, and is lined so it is not see through.  Gorgeous!!!!!"
5.0,I was impressed when I received this belt . Usually items sold by certain vendors are not the same as you see in the pics but this one will be exactly what you ordered.
5.0,I use this cooler for deliveries of cold items.  It’s great.
5.0,Could be my shoulders but the hands are less like coverage and look more like they’re holding my breasts up but they’re still not perky
5.0,very cute on and comfy fits perfect
5.0,"Wow. I did not expect much from these leggings. But they have exceeded my expectations. First of all, it is true to size and hugs your legs. Secondly, the material is clingy, but in a very nice comfortable way. Thirdly, it is very soft and you almost would not notice wearing anything. Lastly, the color is not like on the photo, but I do like it that way. It is distinctive colors of military camouflage, (beige, brown, dark green etc) not like three hues of greenlike on the photo. Lol, I hope it makes sense. I bought matching cap with these but the first one I bought was different. When I did see the actual color of the leggings I went ahead and ordered the UltraKey Mens Army Military Camo Cap, they were the exact same type of camo colors. I hope this helps."
5.0,"These goggles are just to darn cute, and if you are a dinosaur lover, this is a bonus. These come in a really nice, hard plastic case, so they do not get ruined.These are made of a stretchy rubber,and are adjustable from the sides, instead of the back that can hurt your head. these are anti fog which is very helpful, because most of them get foggy and then it is hard to see. I love that these have an adjustable nose piece so it can fit the nose perfectly, and if someone else wants to wear it, that you can change the nose piece to them. The nose piece is a hard plastic part.These also are polarized so that the sun will not hurt your childs eyes. These goggle are by far one of the best made kind that i have yet found for my son. while he wore them down at the pool, many people asked where we have got them from. I have received this product at a free rate for my honest and unbiased review.All opinions expressed are from my own experiences."
5.0,I was very pleased with this it was just smaller than I thought it would be
5.0,"If you have BIG fingers size (8-12). Do NOT buy!! I wear a size 11. These rings didn't even fit in my pinky. I also tried to squeeze em' on my toe as a toe ring... EPIC FAIL. These rings are beautiful, sturdy, but NOT adjustable, && way too small if your ring size is (8-12)"
5.0,"I really rely on Amazon reviews when buying women's clothing -- I think they're vital actually.<br /><br />I was really worried to buy this because of the top<br />review and the responses to the questions. But it's surprisingly amazing! The fabric isn't itchy, velvety and the dress isn't boxy. It's like soft, thick leggings, but not quite as stretchy as leggings, but still forgiving.<br /><br />Look, I sent the last dress I bought on Amazon back because it was spit-through fabric and cheaply-made, definitely not worth the $21 price tag. This dress is worth it. So worth it I'm getting another. This pattern wasn't my first choice, but I'm really glad I bought it, the colours are lovely -- better than the picture.<br /><br />The neckline is great, the length is classy, the pockets are not centred on the hip but towards the inside of the hip. Doesn't widen hips at all. I think they're placed where you'd expect them to be. Great LDS dress too.<br /><br />5'5"" ,125 lbs, 34 chest, 36 hips. I got the S and it fits great."
5.0,It came in great shape and her friend loved her gift
5.0,Very nice I like the clasp easy on and off
5.0,This skirt is literally so soft and fit perfectly on me. It’s so cute. Literally I’m going to be wearing this so much. Go buy it right now
5.0,"I was worried it would turn out too small, so I ordered a few sizes up... well I was wrong, I should have ordered my regular size. other than it being a little too big, its a great deal for the price. good thing is theres holes down the entire length of this belt so its okay that its a little too big."
5.0,it was a birthday present my mom loves it very beautiful just have to be careful it doesn't fall off
5.0,"Very nice, light but offers full coverage"
5.0,These are well made. The ruffle is the same material as the sock.  It’s perfect ruffle not too big but enough to see
5.0,"Work great, with a great price."
5.0,"This is the second time I have bought these.The tiny bag has enough to be a lifetime supply of earring backs, unless you have five daughters like I do. These were worth getting again. I'm sure they will pay for themselves with the earrings I won't lose."
5.0,"This necklace is so cute, it feels real and its heavy but not too heavy on your neck. doesnt feel cheap at all, great price and it came early."
5.0,Extremely beneficial when dealing with the cold for a long period of time
5.0,this is the coolest belt I ever put on . Holds  gun up well and really fast on and  off. Have had belt on every day for past two months still good.

5.0,I wore this dress to a wedding and received such great compliments! I love this dress and it is so comfortable. Perfect fit!
5.0,"Super pack-able, nice fit, going to be perfect for vacation!"
5.0,"This like a glove, is long enough to hide problem areas. The deep-V is really deep though; I ended up putting a stitch in mine too close it up a tiny bit. Love it anyway. Five stars."
5.0,l love the hat!!!
5.0,"Grear fit, length and material.  I am 5'5"" with hips measuring 47"", this fits me prefectly.  Bra size is 36DD.  Material was not thin.  Slightly loose around the shoulders.  I wore it to church and got several compliments."
5.0,"I LOVE THIS RING 😩 i love the moon and i really wanted a moon phase ring, it spins really well and doesn’t get messed up by water or anything. it’s quiet too, i do it in class all the time"
5.0,I love the classy look...with a casual twist..love it!
5.0,Good purchase at an affordable cost. The material is light and cool. It washes very well because the fabric does not bleed.
5.0,Love it thought it was going to be a little longer but it still is great
5.0,This is a beautiful watch.  I have a large collection of watches and this one gets the most compliments.  I liked it so much that I ordered one in blue and silver for a friend.  Great price.
5.0,The richness of the colors.
5.0,Nice dress. Can be dressed up or down. Fit just right
5.0,I love this top so much. I’m going back to get another color.

5.0,Nice quality I love it
5.0,Based on other reviews I did size up. Usually i’m A large in women’s xl in juniors. I ordered a 2x and it fit perfect. I’m glad I sized up.definitly runs significantly smaller.
5.0,"I have these in several colors and sizes. I typically wear a Medium to Large and the Large fits great. I bought the XXL as well to wear with leggings,  I had to use a hair tie to tighten up the knot a bit but it's comfy. I call these my quarantine clothes... hides my Covid weight gain tummy. Lol<br />Very soft!!"
5.0,This has quickly become my kid's choice for thermal compression shirts (over other brands) for outdoor training in the cold.
5.0,I purchased this tote as carrier for all the things for a day on the water.  It’s sturdy and very lightweight.

5.0,This is definitely a good buy. You will love this dress.
5.0,"Baby like this ballet shoes, it's very comfortable"
5.0,Muy bonito ! Me encanta
5.0,I really liked this and I gave it as a gift to my sister and she loves it!<br />very nice I recommended it. came on time!
5.0,They should try to have them in black since my uniform is white  but overall it is a comfortable fit
5.0,I'm so happy with necklace! The color of the beads is beautiful & its a good quality. I can't believe the price! Worth so much more!
5.0,"Fits perfect, love the fabric and the hounds tooth design thanks so much"
5.0,Just received my hat in pewter size medium and it's a perfect fit. I wear a 7 1/8 fitted hat. Very comfortable.
5.0,"I love this top, and it takes all my pride to keep from wearing it to work more than once a week. So far have only washed it once, so not certain how it will hold up over time."
5.0,I’m looking forward short style pants for work out. I wore today and I quite satisfied with this quality. Fabric feels soft and comfy and price was affordable. I think this is a good choice for gym fit.
5.0,I love the colors and pattern and I love how big it is. Its roomy enough to put dollar bills in comfortably
5.0,"This is the second pack of these wallet inserts that I have purchased and not because they have worn out, but because they work so well! I first bought a pack for my husband because the credit card inserts in his wallet (the originals to the wallet) were wearing out, the seams were busting and his cards were falling out. Thankfully we didn't lose any of the cards. The rest of his wallet was in good shape though and we weren't interested in replacing it. So I tried these. They are a much sturdier plastic than the ones his wallet came with and there are more spaces. He and I were both happy.<br /><br />The second pack I bought to put in a new wallet for my father in law. Someone buys him a new wallet pretty much every Christmas. Usually because his credit card holders are worn out. And purchasing him a new wallet is a pain, because you had to look for one that had as many card holders as possible, because he carries a lot of credit cards, business cards, photos, etc. Finding a wallet with enough space was impossible. This year, I simply ordered these inserts and then found a trifold wallet that I knew suited his style. So much simpler!"
5.0,"I love that it has bling , without the bling ,so no stones to fall out ,the nose part is also awesome cuz it won’t dig onto your nose"
5.0,"Very heavy, good quality velvety. Would purchase again"
5.0,Comfy material. Its long but I love it

5.0,"This was actually pretty nice. I was surprised, considering the price."
5.0,I use this bag everyday. For the price I paid... It's definitely worth it. I get lots of comments on it and it is a great size!
5.0,Just as we had hoped!
5.0,"I got this for Halloween while I worked and go so many compliments.  It comes with a white tank top to go underneath and replacement buttons.  The size I got was slightly too big so it wouldn't be skin tight, so it worked.  The only thing is that the collar is a bit loose, but the tie helps with that."
5.0,Love these pants! Super soft & comfy & breathable. I do recommend washing them before wearing (which I normally do but spaced it) as they were a little stiff in the thighs for my run but great after washing. Can't beat the price too- ordering more pairs now. I ordered an XL & for great.
5.0,Excellent Dress!!<br />Fast Shipping!!
5.0,Very cute for both boys n girls- bought another one in a bigger size so I have it for when my child is a little bigger too- they have an easy zipper bottom that makes changing super quick n easy
5.0,"I wanted to add some color to my sock drawer, and these 3 pieces of the ROY G BIV spectrum were exactly what I needed. I was surprised by the softness of the fabric. I can't wait to put these on."
5.0,This outfit is really cute!
5.0,Perfect umbrella for our backyard. It's made very well and was extremely easy to install on the umbrella frame.
5.0,It's better in person than in a picture. It is beautiful also made very very well will last a long time
5.0,The item was perfect for my event. Fun and bright color. Great quality on a budget!<br /><br />Perfect for an 80's theme. Glad I was able to find this in time.
5.0,"Great fit and extremely comfortable! And of course, totally unique for all unicorn lovers!"
5.0,I have gotten a lot of complements on this necklace. I got the jade color and it almost looks like it could be vintage. My mother thought I had borrowed a piece from her jewelry box!
5.0,The price could be a little cheaper.  But the item is perfect.
5.0,My favorite cardigan. Fits well nice and fitted on arms and flowy in the body.
5.0,I fell in love with this blouse the first time I put it on.  After reading the reviews I didn't know what to think some said it fit small some said it was big.  As and Amazon Prime member I get free returns so I decided to take a chance since the price was one I couldn't refuse.  I ordered my normal size and was very happy with the fit.  I am tall and the sleeves worked for me which was another concern I had.  For the price the blouse is well made and after ironing out all of the packaging wrinkles it looked great.  This blouse is very versatile and will get a lot of use in my wardrobe.  I think I may even buy this blouse in black.<br /><br />Update: I did order this blouse in black and am very happy with that one also.  This is one of the best items I have purchased from Alegra K.
5.0,Fits as expected.  Good price point too.
5.0,Amazing job.lost my son recently.so was hoping it would turn out.and it did.breathtaking beautiful.i love it.perfect job.
5.0,Excellent ty
5.0,"Was a gift for my grandson, he loved it."
5.0,"I was looking for a dress for my nephews graduation! This dress fits great, maybe a little loose in the chest. The material has a little stretch and breaths great!"
5.0,Came in absolutely mint condition from the screen to the silver.  Not 1 tiny scratch.  Really impressed.  The night light is junk but it works in a pinch!  Buy buy buy
5.0,"We got these for our son.  He has sensory issues, and the worst one is high pressure toilets.  The ones that sound like a jet plane taking off.  They have these in his classroom.  He had started refusing to use the school bathroom room over it.  The school had a pair of earmuffs for this, but they were not countering the noise.  This pair holds well, and blocks the noise very very well."
5.0,Very light weight on my face. I forgot I had them on. The blue makes a difference as well. I’m glad I bought them. You can’t go wrong with these glasses.
5.0,"I am almost afraid of what the maximum shock setting would do. I have not yet tried it that high. On level 7 out of 10 There is no possible way that i could oversleep. Not only does it give you enough volts to make your arm jerk uncontrollably, but the electricity hitting your brain before it even knows you are awake means for the first 5 minutes of your day your eyes look like a tweeker. Again I have not cranked this thing up to 10 yet, but if I ever see anyone go into cardiac arrest, I am pretty sure I could defibrillate them."
5.0,"Love it,it is sooooo soft & fits well"
5.0,This is my 8th pair from the Legging Depot.  The quality is great.  Even after several months of wear there is no pilling.  They are made with the softest material.
5.0,"It feels soft and comfortable. It fits well, was able to adjust it properly even though I have a rather large head. The stitching on the beavers is well done."
5.0,Great quality but runs on the smaller end so I would size up! Color is great!!
5.0,Love this. I go so many compliments on this shirt. Will buy others colors in the future.
5.0,I got this for a 70's themed party and it is adorable.  I got the large so it would not be tight and it was loose on me.  I usually wear a 6-8 medium. I also bought it because the other 70s dresses I found were so short!  The fabric was a good weight.  Love the bright colors.  Everyone at the party LOVED it!!
5.0,My son loves the jacket. It is constructed well and very warm. It looks great as well. Very nice product at an excellent price. The shipping was very fast also. I believe the item was delivered within a few days of purchase. Extremely pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Adorable and fits as a 2T should!
5.0,Very comfortable and flattering helps control my “mom of 4 belly”
5.0,Great look for a photo shoot
5.0,"This cotton tank top with shelf bra felt good from the first wearing. The straps are adjustable and stay in place. I washed it on delicate and let it hang dry. Now, it is one of my favorites because it covers all the right places, yet it is cool for the summer. I plan to get another color in the near future!"
5.0,The appearance I like the most.
5.0,Great song and good shirt. Roomy in both width and length. Will be a good weeding shirt in the garden this summer.
5.0,"Great umbrella.  Perfect for someone who wants more coverage,  very sturdy."
5.0,I adore these! They feel great and look great too! Since I have short fingers these ones actually look in proportion to my hand. If I put on the half finger type my hands just look pudgy.
5.0,For my grandson and he has a ski jacket to match the colors.
5.0,"Happy to have bought, buying two more sets first chance I get ^_^"
5.0,"Thank you for your prompt shipment of my order.  You are a great company and I look forward to ordering from you again.  My order arrived in tact and was exactly what I ordered.  The price was good and was what I expected.  We live in the country where it is very dark at night.  We scout around mostly in our gulf cart, but we do go on evening bike rides, too.  I pimped out our golf cart in these lights to make us visible to drivers on the roads in our subdivision.  It works, even though they are make for bikes.  Now we can be seen for miles!"
5.0,great shoes!
5.0,"This is a great band!  I bought this in the blue with the butterfly to honor my husband who passed away. He loved the color blue, and the butterfly represents his spirit after he passed."
5.0,Beautiful and high quality earrings. Have been wearing them for years to many compliments!
5.0,It's beautiful just wished it was a little thicker
5.0,Love this it’s so flattering
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect bag for back and forth to work with my laptop!
5.0,So comfortable and super easy on and off. People compliment me on this watch band more than any other one I own. I absolutely love it.
5.0,"I have a small head and I was worried that it would not fit well! But it fits great!!!! If you have a small head, this is for you!"
5.0,Fit to big too long nice dress for some one that's taller
5.0,"Simple, sleek, good quality, and it keeps my keys, Swiss army knife, and USB flash drive organized. Easy to put on/take off new things, comes with two attachable rings"
5.0,"The dress is really beautiful and garnered much attention and many compliments. Based on other reviews I sized up, but that was not necessary.  I think my regular size would have been fine. I love the dress enough to have it altered."
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, and simple. Everything you could want from a watch with this price. Haven't tested the water resistance (which I doubt is very great) but I'm not planning on swimming with it so that's fine. Overall, very happy with it so far."
5.0,Love it! Great looking watch
5.0,"Made well, fits as expected. Sizes seem to be on point!"
5.0,"Very cute sunglasses! The colors are very true to the image. Lenses are clear and easy to see through, really some of the clearest I've used, they shade without distorting vision or dulling it at all! And it's just a bonus that the lens coloring is gorgeous. The sunglasses come in a little drawstring bag to keep them clean and protected. The material feels sturdy and like these sunglasses will hold up for a long time. These sunglasses are also slightly wider than some others I've tried before so they fit more comfortably for me and they're easier to sit on top of my head when I need to.<br /><br />I received these at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
5.0,Well put together. Easy to set the watch up. A breeze to use the stop watch. Overall a great watch.
5.0,I wear med. And I bought the product large thinking the product ran a size smaller.. but No! I ordered large and I got a large. Material is thin but it's very cute. I got what I ordered so that why I'm rate it a 5.
5.0,I love this band! I had a reaction to the original rubber or plastic band that my Inspire came with. No problem with this one. It is easy to change out and I have had no further reactions. The strong magnetic closure keeps my Inspire secure and it won't fall off my wrist. I love it!
5.0,I bought this for my birth sister... we are just getting to know one another and she loves ancestry and family history. I saw this necklace and knew it would be perfect! It comes beautifully packaged so you don't need to spend extra on wrapping! She loved it! Home run! I will buy from this vendor again. Great quality and a fair price.
5.0,"Confortable for kids, juniors or even ladies but not for male adults"
5.0,Makes my butt look big :)
5.0,"Bright color makes them easier to find in the dimly lit truck. Just the right amount of grip, decent dexterity, and nicely reinforced at the flex point between the thumb and forefinger. Washable."
5.0,Striking. I gave it to my grandson as his &#34;protection charm&#34; against school bullies.  He wears it under his shirt every day. He says his dragon's eye is always watching out for him and that it makes him feel powerful.
5.0,"Who is not getting pinched this year on St. Patty’s day.  This Girl.  I love the Oliadesign St. Patrick’s Day Costume Hat.  The hat is bright green with a gold buckle on it.  This is perfect for any St. Patrick’s day celebration.  Since I am in love with photo booths, this will make a great addition to our photo booth at work and at the block party.  The hat fit most everyone in my office nicely. It was a little big for small children.<br /><br />Disclaimer – I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and review. No compensation was received for this review."
5.0,Beautiful vintage look. Perfect fit. Exceeded my expectations!
5.0,I love this dress!  I am very pleased with the fit as well as the value!
5.0,I bought these as a gift for my husband.  I wanted something in the silver tone but not too bright. These were perfect.
5.0,"I was recently measured for a bra at a store called Intimacy and highly recommend this to everyone. I was totally in the wrong size bra and once you are fitted properly...oooh what a difference! This is the first bra I purchased with them and it is worth every penny I spent. I know the cost is high but the comfort level is amazing. There is no pinching, straps falling down or any other of the multitude of problems we women deal with.<br /><br />Personally I have always looked for attractive bras but I have also watched the cost so this was a very large investment for me. I have many bras from Victoria's Secret that I thought were okay but they do not compare to this bra. It is so light you don't even feel it and yet it holds everything front and center as it should. It also has clean smooth lines under your clothing even though it has the lace inset. In the past I have not liked seamed bras because you could see a ridge in the front if you wore certain sweaters. That does not happen with this bra - also no lines show in your back. This bra is pieced together in such a way that it just cups you naturally. As you can see I just can't say enough good about this bra.<br /><br />For cleaning it just make sure you wash it in cold water either by hand or in a lingerie bag on gentle and then line dry. It is holding up wonderfully and I will definitely be buying more of the Prima Donna line because they all have the same comfortable fit. I was lucky enough to try on about 10 different styles from this line which made it very difficult to pick just one.<br /><br />Be sure to check out myintimacy.com to see if their is a store near you to be fitted properly, then you can shop Amazon from the comfort of your home and know that all of your bras will have that same awesome, comfortable fit.<br /><br />I hope this helped you because I don't usually write reviews but I always read them.<br />Cheri H"
5.0,Exactly as discribed. Can't wait to give it to my daughter.
5.0,Purchased maroon color<br />Many compliments —<br />Much more comfortable than my dansko clogs
5.0,Loving my shades looks good on me very satisfied
5.0,"Lately I'm been into wearing tie dye clothes, they're so colorful and fun to wear! The colors on this shirt are blue, pink and yellow. What I like mostly about this shirt is its cut, it's tapered on the sides and it's flattering to the figure. It's V-neck adds to the style. The material is lightweight and the shirt feels comfortable. In my opinion, it's true to size, I weigh approximately 100 pounds and the size ""small"" fits me well. It held out well in my washer (delicate cycle, cold water) and dryer. Looks great with shorts, jeans and leggings!"
5.0,"Wear it all the time. Not like the one in the show. This one is thinner (like the face doesn't stick out, kind of flat) and darker in color (like in picture not gold like in show). But i love it. I have yet to receive compliment on it... Just waiting for a supernatural fan to notice it..."
5.0,"Got this for my GF, who's a big fan of octopi and steampunk stuff.  She's happy, which means I'm happy, and it should buy me a Get Out of Jail free card next time I screw up."
5.0,Good quality. Very soft.
5.0,Love these socks...
5.0,Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"The fit is perfect and the color, very elegant!"
5.0,Satisfied with my Halloween blood necklace.
5.0,"I bought a pair for work as I am on the computer all day.  The lenses have a slight yellow tint, and the frames are sturdy - they have held up well. My eyes feel less tired at the end of the day. Liked them so well, that I bought another pair for home!"
5.0,The dress is really cute.  Fabric is soft.  Very pleased with purchase.
5.0,Look nice. Good value
5.0,"pretty colors, very comfortable"
5.0,"I love this jacket, it's perfect for spring or fall to wear to work or nice occasions. I did order a size up because of the other reviews saying it ran small, happy I did. I'm usually a large because of my arms, the XL is perfect. Looks more expensive than it was, gotta love that!"
5.0,I love the material and how warm it is. It is perfect for the cold weather.
5.0,My daughter ordered this for a mid-weight layering item and loves it. She wears it all the time.
5.0,Washed well.  Looks nice on my grandson.  Good price.  Fits as expected for size.
5.0,"It runs a little small - tight in the chest. However, it is a very pretty top, and looks great. Can be worn to work or when going out."
5.0,"I was looking for a nice classic leather belt that will wear well with jeans and other casual pants. I stumbled across this one, and went ahead and ordered a large (I'm a size 6/8). The leather has held up very well, and it does not seem as prone to bending in the back middle as some of my previous belts (bonded leather) have done in the past. It fits very comfortably, and keeps me from constantly tugging my jeans up, as they start to slide down my hips after I've worn them for a bit.<br /><br />This belt looks very smart with a pair of black jeans and a sweater. I love that I can transition a jeans belt to slacks and have it adapt to the outfit. It doesn't draw a lot of attention, but that wasn't what I was looking for in this belt. The price is only slightly more than the cheap belts that they sell in many stores, but I can tell that it is made out of leather and not the bonded crud that starts to crack and fall apart after a few wears. I will say that this belt has made me keen to try other belts from this brand and I would highly recommend this.<br /><br />As an Amazon customer, I know how annoying and difficult it is when reviewers can’t be trusted. So, I would like to say that whenever I provide any reviews I always take my time and make sure I understand and have used the product in order to give an educated review. It's important to note here that I received this product at discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. Still I try my best to provide all the useful details in the review rather than misrepresenting a product’s quality in order to please a seller and I know good sellers always look for true feedback.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for a fair and honest review, we take our time and study each product before we leave a review and are strongly thoughtful when we leave a review, we are very pleased with this item and feel that it's a great value that you will be pleased with as well, we appreciate you taking the time to read this and we hope it will help in your buying decisions, thanks again and have a great rest of the day !!!"
5.0,Great fit. Feels wonderful.
5.0,"These are perfect for the price. The kids are using these to go up & down the dock, and get off the boat where there can be oyster shells. These slide on easily but aren’t falling off in the water when they go through  mud. They did loose some their color when they got mud on them but they’re inexpensive enough that eventually I’ll just get another pair"
5.0,Excellent quality and easy to put on legs.
5.0,Beautiful!! Stunning!!
5.0,My niece really loves these earrings a lot!!! She also got a few compliments on them. Very cute for tween girls!

5.0,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
5.0,"I placed important keys on these. We live on the water and the keys would be outside near the water, so I needed something that would float in case they were dropped in the water.  These are thick and a good size.  They're also very cute."
5.0,"These are amazing.  The cut is so funny but looks terrific.  i am 5'6&#34; 150 lbs and normally wear a size 10/12.  I ordered these in a large and they fit well and fall exactly as pictured.  My absolute favorite pair of pants currently.  They are so recognizable though, I can't get away with wearing them every single day.  Otherwise, I would!"
5.0,"Got them for my son, he loves them. Comfortable & fit well"
5.0,"I have been on the hunt for the perfect crop top to pair with joggers, bikers, etc. This was it! Looks adorable paired with athleisure wear. I am 5'2"" with a VERY short torso and sized up to a medium. The yellow is so cute, someone asked me yesterday if it was from Lulu! Big win, try it out for your self."
5.0,Great hair piece!! Easy to use.
5.0,The leggings are so cute! They are thin tho and shiny. The moon design on both legs (on the side of the legs) is printed on nicely! They run a little small but stretch out. They also have a hidden pocket on the inside. There’s no other pockets besides the one small pocket on the inside waistband.
5.0,These socks were one of my daughter's favorite gifts.  Just loves them and wears them all the time.
5.0,"Got it for my 9 year old son.  He didn't take it for an entire day.  Great quality, washes well."
5.0,"The only downside is that they fit smaller than expected.  We read the previous reviews that state this, so we knew to get a bigger size.  We could have even ordered two sizes bigger.  As long as you know to get a bigger size, these are great for winter wear around the house."
5.0,Get your size i got 4 of these and they fit as expected
5.0,"If you have to wear a mask for Easter, you should make it fun. Everyone loved it"

5.0,Good looking bracelet for the price . If you have a small wrist the 10 inch would fit you nice ! Def recommend it to add that bling & pop to your wrist !!
5.0,"Purchased several dresses for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loves the cut, cute designs and comfort.  Dress is durable and holds up well to washing."
5.0,Love the fabric and color!!!
5.0,"Brought this product for associates as a holiday gift from their employer. Associates love them, nice and warm! All we did was added the embroidered the company's logo on the hoodies."
5.0,Very nice and good quality recommended
5.0,Love these shoes bought in every color!
5.0,I wear them every day for work. I had a different set with a different style of click before that always popped through out the day.  I put these on in the morning and even after a day of running around the office I still look sharp.
5.0,"This watch has analog time and digital time and it works great.Timer alarm and backlight can work normally, there is a good time reminder function.The watch band is soft and confortable to wear.I like the big face,clear to read the time.Great for daily wear."

5.0,My daughter loved the fin.  It did take her a few good hours of practice but now she really does swim like a fish.
5.0,better quality than expected really happy with product
5.0,I lost my rams hat and replaced it with this one. It’s very comfortable and stylish. The only difference to the last is the fabric is a little heavier making it a bit warmer. Perhaps too warm for the summer.
5.0,These sandals are cute and I got a lot of compliments on them. The straps are completely adjustable so they fit all day long. The soles offer excellent support which is super important to me because I always have to have orthopedic shoes. I can wear these all day and my feet don't hurt.
5.0,"Knew I had to get this as soon as I saw it! So adorable. Works out perfect for me because in the Spring/Summer, I only like wearing a big t shirt when I’m home. Adorable pattern and comfortable material. I bought it slightly bigger so that it’ll fit once it shrinks. It is a bit thin so it’ll definitely be better for warmer climate."
5.0,Great watch. Fits perfect and looks fantastic. I love that it comes with tools to adjust the band. Great buy!!
5.0,"I bought the fox purse for my daughter, and it has held up really well so far. She gets so many compliments on it when she takes it out. Cute, cheap, and sturdy are an A+ in our book."
5.0,"It’s bigger than a quarter, and sits a little under your cleavage but everything else is fine! Loved it.<br />I used it for a closet Rhaenyra Colsplay"
5.0,Comfortable and not too warm.  It is pilling a little but definitely worth the purchase.
5.0,"I ordered 3 suits and this was by far my fav! The colors are so bold and pretty but I fortunately the criss cross area of the top came to the middle of my boobs and I just didn’t feel comfortable with that, so I returned!"
5.0,Great quality for the price. And large enough to carry your laptop and few textbooks. Honestly happy with the purchase.
5.0,Works perfect.  Stretched my hats to just where they needed to be. Recommend if you need a hat stretched.
5.0,"My 9 year old hates to be girly but will totally rock anything unique kittens and rainbows right up her ally! She wore it to her Gymnastics banquet and it was just fine looked nice, comfy and she loved it. Great product highly recommend for your kids. She's a size 7/8 clothing I got her 10/12 size in this I think fit perfectly."
5.0,Came in white letters. Big surprise. Love it..
5.0,"Love this dress, super cute! Fit great looks great. It bit long but I just had it hemmed up."
5.0,This skort is as great as the picture looks.  I am very happy with the quality and the fit.
5.0,"I love TreeLance tops because they are a good quality, thicker cotton with spandex for stretch.  (I don't like tops that are so thin you can see through them!)  TreeLance's tops last too without losing shape or elasticity with frequent washing. Well worth the price!"
5.0,Very chic top.  Looks expensive.  Received tons of compliments. I highly recommend this top.  I am going to purchase a black one.
5.0,"Love it! 2 Exterior slider packets, 3 interior divided areas. Excellent Quaility!"
5.0,Great product. Quality is top notch.
5.0,"Amazingly great quality ties, was taking a shot given the price, but am very happy."
5.0,"Love this shirt.  Light weight.  It says &#34;sleeveless&#34; but it does have sleeves which I like.  Would buy multiple colors if offered.  Got a medium, intended to be a baggy fit, probably could have gone to a small."
5.0,Summer is here and it's getting hot! I had the pleasure of reviewing this beach cover up. The cover I received was bohemian green. The print is bright and the pattern is very flattering. The material is silly and soft. I've actually worn this out as a regular dress. It has a great drawstring at the bust to cinch it in. It was a one size fits all type deal and it fit me nicely. I still have my baby weight on me but it wasn't noticeable. When it got chilly I threw a denim jacket on and looked even cuter. I will buy more of these to add to my wardrobe.<br />*I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review
5.0,Perfect shade of red!
5.0,It fit me perfect and i got tons of compliments on it at work! Would definitely purchase again!
5.0,I love these bands they are very soft and comfortable and the colors.They are also strech so they are not to tight or loose on your wrist.

5.0,Colors were perfect.  Package arrived on time.  Would definitely order again if needed
5.0,Great As expected and delivered on time
5.0,"Very nice and lovely, I do like it."
5.0,"It's so nice to find good quality, mostly cotton jet black &#34;Capri - shorts&#34; My waist is smaller than my hips and thankfully these do not gap or bag in the waist. I'm athletic, 5.5&#34; tall and weigh about 150 lbs... I found the large perfect a perfect fit. They did shrink after the first run through the washer and dryer, but continue to be comfortable. I teach yoga and found them great for leading classes. You cannot see through the fabric when bending over! If you carry more weight around the mid-section these may not be your best choice. I previously purchased a similar style from &#34;Champion&#34; and found the waist band to big. The photo is a good expression of the length, which I love... just at the top of the knee cap. Overall, if your partial to cotton/spandex blends and carry more weight in your hips vs. your belly, you will appreciate the fit. I found the tags to feel scratchy so I just cut them off."
5.0,A gift for our teenage daughter. She loved it. It is well made and versatile. What a great product!
5.0,I had a muscle strain in my lower right leg. Was told to get a better pair of shoes. Ended up getting these on Amazon and one pair from a really good shoe store in town. These are so much better. Returned the other ones. Walk without pain!
5.0,I love this bra! I have two of them and they are so comfortable and perfect for nursing.
5.0,Cute and easy denim dress to put on a toddler and just throw on some leather jacket and you have a perfect outfit together. I like the sturdiness of the button on the back to snap on because some presses the button just comes off all the time.
5.0,Seller contacted me and immediately made things right. Would definitely order from this seller again.<br /><br />I only received one and the headband was broke. The headband was cute.
5.0,The fit is great but the colors are real bright and pretty.
5.0,"Love, love, love this sweater, with everything.<br />The only complain that cuffs started to fray a bit after 7-8 washes... not sure why, rest of the sweater looks amazing still. I bought this for me and for my mom, who is bigger, still looks great! True to size on both medium and XL fits.<br />Will definitely buy this one again.  I wish they made it in solid colors."
5.0,"Fit true to size, great quality very thick and nicely made! Affordable and sooooo cute! The shrink a little when washed so keep that in mind when ordering which I was fine with since i ordered them a little big for that possibility! Fit both my great great and got so many compliments!"

5.0,Nicely packaged. The teal color is beautiful. Very soft and stretchy material.
5.0,"With all suitcases starting to look alike these help your suitcase standout.  Also, as handles get older the cushion starts to wear out, these will give new life to those handles.  Easy to move from one bag to another and easy to wash."
5.0,Amazing. Shines even old brass jewelry. Great size too. I bought two!
5.0,"Love these! Wish I could wear them every day without anyone noticing! I work in an office and they are great for work. They are a clean super jet black. They are high waisted and go right below my belly button, I wasn't expecting that but they are just so comfy I think it's better this way."
5.0,The fabric is good and fits perfect !
5.0,I love these earrings! They are a steal for this price. I’ll be ordering in all colors.

5.0,My Mom loves them.  Thank you !
5.0,"This wrap is perfect for sauna, pool, or spa. Lightweight and soft. Large pocket for phone is a bonus"
5.0,The best so far. Ordered 3 different money clip type magnets and this one was the best strength. Can hold for up to like 25-30 bills
5.0,I got the &#34;Love&#34; version of this necklace for a gift. I like the message and the simple beauty of the necklace. I'm a big fan of this kind of charitable company whose business revolves around giving and benefiting society. The necklace looks great and I am excited to give it as a gift.

5.0,"Glasses are great- comfortable, affordable.  Mirrored lenses seem to brighten up the view, while shading your eyes.  I like these a lot."
5.0,"This is by far one of the best things I've ever gotten, and I got a deal doing it too. I got one pair of the black leggings from this brand about a month ago. I loved that pair so much that I just had to buy a pack of 6. I am 6'1 (1.85 m tall) and these fit perfectly on me. Leggings are my most favorite types of bottoms because they're so comfy and stretchy. For the first time in my entire life, my favorite types of bottoms, leggings, actually fit me perfectly! And instead of 6 for $60, I got 6 for $30. That's a steal my friends! Though there is not a variety in terms of which 6 you can choose from, I still love the package. Just FYI, the colors you see are the colors you get (Christ, what am I going to do with purple?)."
5.0,These socks are very comfortable and a good value.
5.0,Was a perfect fit. Good quality and beautiful dress.

5.0,"Better than I thought it was going to be for the price, so excited for Halloween!"
5.0,"I first tried this on and it was butter soft, it felt so smooth pulling it on! I normally hate clothes tight around my neck but the mock turtleneck was perfect. It looks like a turtleneck and will keep you warm from wind/cold without being so tight and constricting. The sweater itself is thick and warm without being bulky. You can definitely can layer it and the dark green color looks good with everything!"
5.0,"THIS RING IS GORGEOUS . IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL SETTING ,THE TYPE I WAS SEARCHING FOR A LONG TIME TO COMPLIMENT MY JADE EARRING AND BRACELET SET .LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN WORN.IT IS BEAUTIFUL<br />YOU DID GREAT!!! THANKS CAROLYN"

5.0,Very nice quality.  Better than I expected.  Easily the equal to $300 frames.
5.0,I didn't realize it was really a big hat with a brim but you can snap off the brim and have a smaller brim hat also. Love it. It looks like it might even be machine washable. I'll have to check that. But this hat does exactly what I needed. And I get 2 hats in  1.
5.0,Nice material. Large generous size. Fine chiffon material. Lovely print. Fast service!
5.0,the sox wears well; easy to wash on delicate;<br />I have bought numerous pairs of this product in a variety of colors;<br />size is good for me

5.0,Different fabric than I expected but super light and comfortable! Would buy again. Already gotten several compliments!

5.0,This was such a  great purchase!  I created a Christmas Wish List  and added this item to it.  My husband bought it for me and I switched purses right away and it's March and haven't  changed yet!  I love the roominess of the bag and the really buttery softness.  Great compartments and plenty of room.  The added crossbody strap is a bonus too!  Thinking I might try the light blue color for spring/summer!  Love love love!

5.0,Good detail and comfy
5.0,Fit great. Fast shipping.
5.0,Good for cold winter days. I have bought three of these with two different colors. Recommended.
5.0,Excellent and beautiful pair of gloves. I wore them for about a year or so due to the fact that I was a valet driver and needed the extra grip and protection against all the dirty steering wheels. I might say I have abused them very much so and they are still soft as silk and ready to be worn on a moments notice. All stitchings are in place and the leather is still shining! I still wear them when I am in the racing mood ;)
5.0,Very nice but too small for my husband gave it to a family member and he loves it
5.0,This is a very soft and warm hat which fits perfectly - not too snugly.  Beautiful color too.
5.0,The quality of the leather

5.0,"I like the top. Easy to care for I have washed it in the washing machine using cold water and hung it to dry looks very nice with jeans, very comfortable. Might buy one in another color.Thanks Amazon"
5.0,It was good. It came when it said it would and I can adjust the size. My only slight complaint is that it has a weird smell but it’s not strong or anything so overall a very good product
5.0,Bought these 4 years ago for my daughter. Love them so much I'm back for another pair for my mother.
5.0,Great jeans fit great fast shipping
5.0,"The coat is amazing according to my friend who I gave it to.  He absolutely loves the coat, however the coat was a tad high in my opinion."
5.0,"Fits my husband perfectly and he forgets he is wearing it. It’s great for when he’s working and when he’s working out at the gym, especially when he’s lifting."
5.0,On point!!! Just what I wanted. Great size and durability.
5.0,Love this wallet. Cool front pocket design. Great quality.
5.0,"Great product, company, and fit! I have switched all my underwear to them in the last few years. Trust me on this one. You need these underwear in your life. No more awkward leg stretches and readjusting in public. Just pure comfort and bliss for your boys."
5.0,Very nice but extremely small.
5.0,"It's fits a little bit bigger than expected, but she's not swimming in it and it looks fine. The skirt is a silky polyester and wrinkles easily but other than that it's fine. I don't regret purchasing but I don't know if I would buy again."
5.0,I love this shirt and will order more soon!!!
5.0,Extremely comfortable and flattering.  Side slits are very high so had to stitch those a bit.  Very cool breezy and print hides my rear end cellulite and jiggles!
5.0,Live the material love the fit I'm in love
5.0,FREAKING AWESOME
5.0,"Not only is this wallet unique but it is really a back saver. because it only fits just enough, I am forced to prioritize my wallet which actually helps to uncluttered. The other nice thing is I can put it on a lanyard when I go across the pond and wear it around my neck for added security."
5.0,Super cute. Comfy. My last pair lasted SIX summers!!!!!!’
5.0,"They are the perfect size and shape, very lightweight.  I wear them to bed and in the shower.  Clasp is strong and secure."

5.0,"If you follow the size guides the gloves fit perfectly, are very warm and comfortable, and seem very well made."
5.0,Exactly what was described the fit was as expected but is a little tight in the toes. But I'm sure it will break in with wear. Installing the clips was a breeze and they look great!
5.0,Looks great!! Great fit!<br />Highly recommend<br />Go Raiders!!
5.0,I absolutely love my hair bonnets.  They are soft and no slip off in the middle of night when I'm sleeping. It fits all my crochet hair. This was a excellent purchase I made for me and girlfriends as a party goodie.
5.0,Nothing fancy but just what I like.  Holding up well so far.
5.0,"This cloth works wonders. Some of my jewelry was so dark and dirty, but this cloth did magic. It cleaned it so well and made it shiny. I own a lot of silver, not really gold or brass items, so I only used it for silver items and it works great. Bit of work gets put in if it's really dirty, but the cloth makes it look like your items are new."
5.0,"Well made! Stitching is clean, Colors are great. Fits well! My daughter's favorite musician wore the same hat in a photo shoot. She was thrilled when I gave it to her for Christmas :)"
5.0,Like it was large enough to fit my sons face
5.0,Sort of a green grey color. Comfortable fit on a medium sized hand (7.5-8 inches). A good weight for using a keyboard on a cold day.
5.0,"I was fearful when ordering this scarf that it would be like the traditional thin/wrinkly pashmina scarf that can be picked up from any variety of stores locally. This one boasted the benefit of being ""cashmere"" so I was holding out hope it would be one step above. To my surprise, it turned out to be exactly what I needed! I am not sold that the scarf is 100% cashmere as advertised, but it IS soft and it IS warm and it IS thicker than what I was expecting. We are going to Europe and I wanted a larger scarf that I could use for my neck when we are sight-seeing or as a blanket when we are on the plane. For the price I paid, I am 100% satisfied that it will meet my needs."
5.0,"Love this dress, it's classy and accent my curves perfect. Great price also. You want go wrong if you order this dress. Make sure you order one size up. I ordered an( XL)  I wear a size 13-14. Nice material and the right length. I'm short but wore 4 inch heels with it. Also purchased one in black. Wow!!"
5.0,I love this because it looks great. Feels wonderful. Sporty. Good quality. The only problem is that it’s not good for hot days.
5.0,"Yes, I’m on of those who never write reviews but it’s been over a year since my initial purchase of the dress and I’m looking to buy another in a different color because I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH! Purchased July 2020 and then headed off to Denver for vacay.  The compliments never stop coming in from complete strangers and this dress makes me me feel like a BA every time I wear it!!!<br /><br />Pictured at 5’4’’ and prolly ~190 lbs with 42DDD - purchased ***LARGE***<br />((I normally wear XL/Size 14 tops (da boobs and back fat along with liking looser fitting tops) and Medium-large/size 10 bottoms)).<br /><br />I have significant amount of bra/back fat and felt like this dress didn’t exaggerate it and concealed it well enough for my liking without “hugging” to my problem area. The movement of the dress when walking feels fantastic and it doesn’t bunch up between my legs or feel like it was sticking to my stomach. Worn with a black bralette and nude loose shapewear shorts. From the picture, the dress isn’t see-through and has low sheerness in terms of lucency of the fabric.  DID I MENTION IT HAS POCKETS???!!! Besides everything else, the fabric feels soft and doesn’t appear cheaply made, holds up to multiple washes and high heat drying (🤦🏼‍♀️ I know, I know) and it’s just so comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Just do it! Pull the trigger, buy the dress, wear it out and set your heart on fire and then come back a year later and write a review about it 😘❤️"
5.0,I was surprised to find such a lovely dress! I wore it to a wedding and got many compliments. It's loose without hiding too much of your form. The fabric has a nice drapey feel but holds it's a-line shape with the thick border. The length was 2 inches above my knee (I'm 5'1&#34;) and the sleeves right above the elbow.
5.0,Love!  Not heavy.  Just right
5.0,"I love how lightweight and warm this jacket is, the hood is just an extra bonus."
5.0,My girlfriend absolutely loved this necklace!
5.0,Love this bracelet and the price was excellent!  Have received numerous compliments.
5.0,These are adorable and unique. I love the vintage style. I get tons of compliments. The gold is very eye catching. I love the round shape too.
5.0,"Very attractive Fascinator. I had purchased for a Derby party and I received many compliments.  Many of the others looked very cheap, but this was a winner!"
5.0,"Loved this dress! Am 185lbs and I ordered a medium, fits great"
5.0,"Awesome boots. Bought them for my trip to the frigid NE. They kept my feet warm and dry in the 2""-4"" of snow we got during the trip. They are also nice enough i will use the them in Florida. Seem to be good construction and holding up pretty good so far after a week of constant full time use."
5.0,"I am 5'4 and about 158 lbs. I carry the bulk of my weight between my bottom bra line and the top of my underwear. I am always looking for a way to disguise this without looking like I am wearing a tent. This top has a slim (ish) fit and is very flattering. It is not what I would consider fitted as I cannot wear those tops, but it does have a long and more straight fit that an A-Line fit. I have a long waist but short legs and arms. The top comes down to mid-thigh on me. I don't have to worry about my bottom often as there is not a lot there, but the top is not super slim. It would fit tall gals well I feel. The fabric is nice and it doesn't look or feel cheap. It launders well and hasn't shrunk."
5.0,Love sleeping in these warm soft pants
5.0,These are the best leggings I’ve gotten off Amazon so far. So comfortable!! Can’t wait to buy more!!
5.0,Super easy to size and fits the Fitbit blaze perfectly.
5.0,Fits perfectly and comfortable.
5.0,"These are cute and comfortable. They are a tiny bit tight around the hips on me, but I would have bought them even if I had tried them on first."
5.0,"Just found out about Sojo, bought 3 pair and love everyone, and I'm not done shopping! Great variety and great prices!"
5.0,Used in high sun
5.0,If you like Halo you’ll dig the pin. Perfect timing since the Halo experience is coming up!
5.0,Love it! So pretty! As expected!
5.0,Lovely bracelets. Good quality. Arrived in perfect condition and looked just as described. Will order again.

5.0,These are well made and look great! Would buy again.
5.0,Nice shirts for the summer.. love the colors fits great..
5.0,This medal comes with a very sturdy loop for attaching to the collar. It is a perfect size for a 30lb dog. He has worn it for several weeks and it still looks brand new.
5.0,It's a beautiful piece with a good weight to it. I'd definitely buy it again.
5.0,"I really like my new gym bag. I needed the red accent to identify it from other gym bags. The price was great, as well!"
5.0,"Gift for mom, she loved it. Color is as pictured, graphics were great, no complaints."
5.0,"Great belt!  It's so simple and chic, and I love that it adjusts to size so I can wear it at my waist or on my hips. Very versatile. I am going to buy more in other colors!  For all those saying the belt won't go through the loop twice, read the product description.  If yours won't, it says to contact them and they will send a free replacement.  Mine was tight, but didn't take that much effort to push it through.  You don't want it too loose or I imagine it would slip."
5.0,My pair arrived very quickly. They were a perfect 20 gauge. I cannot explain why so many other customers think theirs are larger. I guess ymmv!
5.0,A little long but great product
5.0,"The cat eye pearls were just beautiful!  I purchased these cat eye jewels to go along with a bracelet.  They fit the bracelet very well along with added a perfect accent.  These also come with stoppers.  The stoppers helped greatly because I did not want the jewels all next to each other.  Rather I wanted a small gap between them.  Even while worn all day, there was no shifting off of the stoppers.<br />The jewels themselves were exactly like the picture, pearl with a gold edge.  They fit perfectly right on the at eye bracelets.  They were a similar size to the other types which also helped with paring.  They definitely added a perfect touch to the bracelet!<br />Disclosure* I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,EXCELLENT!!!!
5.0,Me encantan los colores

5.0,Gift for my husband for Christmas- he loves beads and this is light weight and seems sturdy - price is right too

5.0,"What a deal , Had them a month so far so good , great fit."
5.0,"Great support, very comfortable and looks super stylish. I don't have significant bounce and yet it doesn't give me a uniboob. I've recently purchased more because this is a great bra at a fantastic price."

5.0,It's amazing how fast I am now that I have this ring. I wrote this review in 0.00237 seconds. Wow!
5.0,"The world looks better through these sunglasses. Not only that but they look great! These sunglasses hold up to drops, scrapes, and being sat on better than most. I'm really hard on sunglasses so I've bought 4 pairs of these in 6 years and will continue to do so. Great buy!"
5.0,"Absolutely in love with this purse! Perfect size for when I’m not carrying a lot of things! Only setback is the smell, it’s not the usual leather smell that I love so I’ll have to air it out, probably from the staining. Otherwise it seems very durable and sturdy."
5.0,"I haven't used it yet, but really like what I see.  I like a bag to put into my travel suitcase in which I can place items for use during overnight flights.  I also like a bag to carry need daily items when touring.  This seems perfect.  It is secure, which is very important during travel, with zippers closing off one inside center storage space, and a zipper for the whole cavity as well.  There are side pockets for a cellphone and charger, and a wallet.  It seems like it will be a winner."
5.0,Looks just like the photo! I love it!
5.0,this color was cheaper than the others and I really like it. fits really snug around my ears. worth the money.
5.0,Unbelievable how great this looked. So happy I purchased it
5.0,Better than pictures show! Love these!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress!!  I will buy more, you can count on that!!!  Thank you!"
5.0,Great shirt! Great fit.
5.0,Great looking hat.  Fits well!
5.0,Really liked the longer length. It's very hard to find athletic skorts that are not too short. Runs small so definitely order up a 1 or 2 sizes..
5.0,Was a little big but was easily adjusted and I love it .. I just got it so idk about long term quality.  But for now I am impressed.
5.0,this clutch is AMAZING.  saw it on someone at a party and had to have my own.  bought one for my daughter too!  easy to customize and total conversation starter.  thank you so much for creating this!!!

5.0,Beautiful!  Well made and realistic. My granddaughter was thrilled!
5.0,color described perfectly and matched my daughters dress!
5.0,"Liking product a lot. Sturdy, color exactly as expected and easy to open. Would be even better with a automatic open button."
5.0,Very beautiful dress. I read many reviews and most common that I envy is that on the sleeves are a bit snugged. I got a small. I’m 5”4 140 waist 28. It’s perfct waist down. But too it is a bit snugged.
5.0,"my husband was looking for wool ankle socks, hard to find and he loves the comfort."
5.0,I was nervous about ordering them because I have a small waist but large hips.  I was afraid they would not fall right or pull up in the back because of my hips.  They fit perfectly. I'm so surprised.  They are light weight and comfortable.  I will be ordering more in different colors.
5.0,I work in a warehouse and this vest having multiple pockets help. I also love the little pocket for my badge. And its true to size where others I have ordered were smaller.
5.0,Solar energy!
5.0,My husband really likes these. They are comfortable and he can't wait to wear them on the bike.
5.0,"They fit well, are very stylish, and have multiple issues. They are easy to breathe through and look just as pictured."
5.0,It was perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for :-)
5.0,Russell is the best sweatshirt.
5.0,Son in law loved this
5.0,I just love the quality of this sweater! And it’s warm
5.0,"My grandson likes it.  He is 8 now, and is at the early-end of must-look-cool..."
5.0,Perfect fit and the polarization blocks the rays that cause problems and I can still see the dials and LED displays on the dash.
5.0,My style and it's great.
5.0,"they noticed my review was 4 stars not five--- because the collar was not crew but looser<br />maybe European style<br />so they sent me a new one for free-- and they did fix it<br />the collar is now a true crew type-- excellent<br />i am slim 6' 3""  170lbs  and their slim fit is just that-- slim but not too tight<br />arm length as needed for 35"" arms shoulders square correctly<br />well done<br /><br />original review is below<br />sleeves are slim fit-- good<br />waist is slim fit-- good<br />chest is slim fit<br />material is good<br />but the neckline is too loose expected a standard t-shirt crew neck but it was bigger<br />i am going to keep this one, would buy another if the neckline was tighter<br />so suggestion-- offer a tighter neck version and a turtleneck version"
5.0,"I love these purse holders, Gave them to all the women in my family. They loved it."
5.0,"I purchased this necklace after the sudden loss of my beloved 6 1/2 year-old yellow lab, Jake.  It is a simple, but beautiful token of remembrance that I wear every day in memory of my special boy...who is indeed forever and always in my heart."
5.0,This is wacky looking but I love using it and taking it out and someone often comments.  Good Clean Fun...!
5.0,I love this choker. Honestly it's so cute I can't get enough of it.. the pastel colors are just my absolute favorite too 😄
5.0,This cloth worked very well on brass candlesticks.
5.0,I gave it to a friend for secret Santa and she loves it! Wears it all the time. She is pretty petite tho
5.0,"This is so pretty and love the material!! I am 5'1&#34; 128lbs, may be a little loose on waist elastic band but hanging still, skinny person may not be fit well, but I am so glad that I purchased it and will bring it to my trip to Cuba coming up, cannot wait to wear them in Varadero Beach!!! Thank you!"
5.0,"This is a really pretty bracelet. The colorful beads are nice. I love that it's adjustable, since most bracelets are too big on me. This fits me and my younger daughter too -- and she's probably going to keep it!"
5.0,"Hermosos, tal cómo está en la foto"
5.0,"In search for the perfect hats. I have three now. This one, a Jon Deere, and a Carhartt one..<br />This hat is light and a perfect fit for me. Not too big and not too tall. t's better looking than online photo. And it seems durable.<br />I'm very pleased. And as a S&W pistol owner, I'm proud to represent. Would make a great gift."
5.0,"Nice,  but was bigger than I expected."
5.0,"Very well-made. The fabric is good, thick swimsuit material that will not soon wear out. I am beyond pleased."
5.0,Really like these. They look very nice. Don't hesitate.
5.0,"I ordered this in a M listed as us size 10, but it fits like a size 6. Im keeping it even thou it fits litle tighter thant i would like it to, since its very nice and different."
5.0,"This is a dainty watch. The face of the watch is small. You can see the numbers but I would like the face to be a little larger. When wearing this watch, it almost feels like you aren’t wearing it. It can catch on things but it won’t come off the wrist as easily as a cuff watch."
5.0,"I have read reviews for this and similar products, and many said that the size ran a little small, but I am a little above average size and these fit just fine. They are stretchy enough and do fit on my large thighs. Yeah, I get a muffin top look to my legs because they are a little fat -but they fit. I imagine that may be what people mean when they say these run small - but that will always be the case when a stretchy garment stops short over fatty flesh. My plan is to wear these with biker shorts meeting or overlapping the stocking, so that will keep the compression of the stockings even and prevent the muffin top leg look. I would not recommend these to anyone who is very overweight though - not more than 35-40 lbs over the maximum healthy weight for  your height. I'm 40 lbs over. I'm just saying - you would probably wear them as knee high, not thigh high, if you are very much bigger than you should be."
5.0,"Pretty keys for jewelry or crafts project. Lovely charms. Anyone you gift them to should be pleased with them.<br />And they arrived when they promised, and are as described by seller. Very good purchase."
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Wanted something to cover my eyes and not my nose. Worked very well!
5.0,Very cute shirt. Love it.
5.0,"One of the nicer pairs of shoes that I own.  It's tough during the winter because suede, salt, and water don't mix well, but definitely is worth it when the weather improves"
5.0,Super cute and I'm only 5ft tall! Very slimming!
5.0,Breathable and stretchy!
5.0,"I love this wallet - it holds so much, it protects the cards, and my very favorite color is red!"
5.0,Arrived two days earlier than expected. Decent sized and looks like he photo. I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it :)
5.0,"Heavy weight, holds the french cuff tight. Smooth polish. Very nice and high quality."
5.0,Well built and warm
5.0,Was delivered one day early! Fit was good been using them every day now.
5.0,Bought it for my sister. She loved it. Arrived quicker than expected. Items were very nice.  Locket was adorable.
5.0,"Great price point and a perfect, clear view for low visibility days. Performed as advertised and did not fog up."
5.0,My favorite matching set!!! Fits amazing
5.0,"I absolutely love the foot cream. I am in desperate need of a pedicure. So when I first started using it I was scratching my sheets 🤦🏾‍♀️. But now my feet are so much softer that I am no longer scratching the sheets. The hand cream is nice, not too greasy."
5.0,"I have never worn leggings in the past but my daughter encouraged me to try some. I tried some cheap ones that rolled at the waist, you could see through, and I hated them. I saw these when looking on amazon and decided to try again. Love them!  I now have 3 pair of capris (one I gave to my daughter), and 2 pair of full length!  The high waist holds my mid section in so there is no muffin top and it stays in place!  They are heavy enough so not see through but not hot. The light blue color is a nice change to standard black and goes well with tops I have. The pockets are great and will hold my phone and keys with no problem. At 70, short and round, I never thought I would wear any kind of leggings!"
5.0,Goes good with any wardrobe item ...esp. casual dress and golf🏌🏻‍♂️
5.0,Excellent quality and look good. VERY happy with the glasses. The price was excellent compared to other glasses more than twice the price.Will buy another pair.
5.0,"So I got a large as a 5'6&#34;, roughly size 10 woman and it fit very well. It's soft and maybe not like the HIGHEST quality but for the price it is insanely perfect. The color is true to photo, maybe a little brighter but it's hard to say with monitors and whatnot. Pockets are spacious, lining is nice, it worked super well for my purposes! It's warm but not stifling"
5.0,they fit good and protect from scratches very well I crossfit daily and it sustains the torture of burpees and other wods
5.0,"I am a 36 D, I got an extra large, and it fits perfectly, no button gap.  It's soft enough that you can tuck it in in front, it's shorter in front, and falls very nicely in the back.  I love it!"
5.0,Very warm and nice fit just what I was looking for. The only down side was they give up some little fuzz but not bad enough to cause me not to be Very Happy with this purchase.
5.0,Each durag comes individually wrapped which was nice. They’re soft and silk and the strings are able to be tied really flat. Great value for the price!
5.0,The product is amazing I rlly like it a lot I’m gonna order more of them. Plus fits just right and it’s 100% satisfying. Would recommend it to other women
5.0,"For the price, you can't beat this! I have been searching for some tassel earrings but refused to pay the price for just one pair. These are very lightweight and fun to wear!"
5.0,"This is really flattering on. Will look so cute with sorts, capris, jeans, etc. Has a bit of stretch to it, but fits nicely."
5.0,Very nicely made and they wash beautifully!
5.0,Very comfortable for my little one. Fit her very well. Would buy again.
5.0,"So far it's been great. It was so hard to find a small size strap for my watch. They didn't offer a wide variety of colors or designs, so I got the white. I wasn't worried about it getting dingy or dirty because the original watch straps included with the gear we're white and got really dingy after about a week of wearing them, however this watch straps is still just as clean and white as the day I received it. Clasp works fine, attachments work fine as well."
5.0,Really nice quality piece!
5.0,This watch band did not stay attached to the watch face. I almost lost my fitbit watch face numerous times.  Not a good product.
5.0,The socks are comfortable and cushioned. A little thicker that expected but will be great to work in.
5.0,"Looks more like a night gown though, but it feels comfortable<br />Thanks"
5.0,"Very soft and light material, perfect for summer day pool parties or a day at the beach. I really love the color. It fits very nicely and, unlike some other designs, it's not tight in the chest area and I did not have to order a bigger size to have a good fit."
5.0,Great overall purchase but definitely runs a little longer than expected!
5.0,Used for my daughter's mythology project. Worked really great!
5.0,Love the swim suit. So cute.
5.0,"Love!!  It's really pretty and looks just like the photo.  A little heavier hat than I was expecting, but well made."
5.0,Nice feel and perfect fit.  Stayed put all day without slippage.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"It is exactly as described and the fit was perfect! The fabric is not too thin, not too thick. The shirt part is a little short, but still works just fine. I think I'm going to order more!!"
5.0,The fit is perfect and the color is beautiful.
5.0,Great buy. I love it.
5.0,Perfect & as described
5.0,Fit perfectly. The dress looks gorgeous. Highly recommend.<br />I'm wearing size 2.
5.0,"Wonderful Large Shopping Bags, and the design is too great!!!"
5.0,This is a really nice five-pack of panties. They material is soft and comfortable against the skin and the fit is good.  I especially like the broad lace panel across the front - it makes them look more attractive by far than your average high-waist panties. The colors are attractive.<br /><br />They're nylon but feel like cotton and they launder just fine with regular clothes on warm in the washer and dryer. I like them.
5.0,"These are good shots for kids, easy care, not see through.  My son wears a 4T, and the XXS fits well."
5.0,I love these shoes and this line by converse. I’m sad they discontinued just because they’re really the most comfortable casual shoes I’ve ever worn and they look great!  They’re also pretty durable in that they don’t break as easily as normal sneakers. I almost always get compliments when I wear these shoes.
5.0,Well made fits perfect
5.0,Daughter loved this product
5.0,Love everything about them. Use them for work.
5.0,"It was my cousin's favorite gift, everyone took a turn wearing it and took some<br />really funny photo's of her in it. She screamed at the top of her lungs when she<br />opened the box."
5.0,"Heavy duty luggage tags, well made complete with metal attaching cords."
5.0,"Rose color frame pink lens. Wow! these shades are beautiful and elegant. I had to buy another pair. They look very expensive, and well made. Will be updating everyone on my second pair. 10/3 My Violet Quay just arrived. I'm not sure if I'll be returning them. Quay seem to keep sliding off my face, always needing to adjust them. They are very beautiful shades. If you decide to buy a pair try not to scratch them. I don't think these Quays will look as nice if they're scratch. Also, you'll be needing a hard case. Shades come with only a soft case. Hope this information was helpful."
5.0,Covers the back of my hair. I have washed it multiple times and the color does not fade away.
5.0,Nice time piece. Great quality for the price. Product was as advertised. Would recommend this seller!
5.0,"Works perfect, thanks!"
5.0,I have a round shaped face so the glasses were a bit smaller than what I was expecting but they still look great. My eyes were really sensitive from wearing transition prescription glasses all the time but then I got lasik so I needed a pair of shades that provided some protection and were here fast. Also they would look great on anyone regardless of face shape. They are just opaque enough to not be able to see the eyes but not opaque enough to give that &#34;I'm a douche&#34; look.
5.0,"Love the price, the mask and it was a show stopper for my wedding 5/25/19"
5.0,"IT FITS GREAT, AWESOME DETAILS, I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS RING, LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY MORE FROM THIS PLACE."
5.0,"Pretty good, so light and comfortable"
5.0,"This bag is even nicer in real life than in the picture! Great design, luxurious material, great ddeal!"
5.0,"Beautiful, silky & good quality. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"Awesome product.  I had a J. Vander shark mesh a few years ago that I really loved, but decided to cut some links and ended up making it too small.  Decided to go the shark mesh route again and bought this one, and must say this newer iteration is even better.  The buckle is rock solid, the mesh is tight and hefty.  Looks amazing. and really makes my seiko turtle pop."
5.0,Not even a purse kinda girl but omg do i love it. I actually use the inside bag way more than the outside. Scared imma mess it up. But its great material. Seems sturdy and i love the size.
5.0,"Fantastic shorts, would buy again."
5.0,These are awesome and keep my feet warm!
5.0,Purchased an XL but I honestly recommend going a size down! It's extremely comfortable! My boyfriend absolutely loved it!
5.0,"I love them , they are very cute shoe charms , I even placed an order for the Christmas ones right after this shipment"
5.0,"Greet quality and fast! I placed order on March 11th, and it said expected deliver April 10th - May 1st. I received it on March 29th! I am so excited to wear it!"
5.0,"Super cute! There's an Apple logo on the back that's slightly darker, and its protective and adorable!"
5.0,"First of all let me apologize for not including a picture of me wearing these. My camera is not working, and hopefully it will be by tomorrow and I will be able to add a photo then. I really wanted to include a photo, because it shows you how the glasses look with different people's face shapes.<br /><br />As with all the glasses by Wearme Pro, these are great. Stylish, well made, and definitely worth more than you are paying for them. This dog is really cute. I have them in the black shiny frame. They have a very cute retro cat eye shape, yet with a modern twist. Great for glamour girls, or just somebody with a fun personality.<br />I received these in exchange for trying them out and reviewing their quality and performance. As always, this company continues to delight me. They have never let me down with any of their products."
5.0,Product was as described.  I love the pattern and it is a perfect size for my needs.
5.0,"I can't stop buying their dresses!!  They're sO BEAUTIFUL, SO comfy. Love'em love'em LOVE'EM!!!"
5.0,"I love this shirt, although if you are a woman who has a bigger chest size, I recommend getting a size up. Other than that, the shirt is awesome!"
5.0,Very satisfied. Easy to put together. Study material
5.0,"I like the fit, and its well worth the price."
5.0,Love this kimono. Quality is good.
5.0,i have this dress in 4 colors and always get compliments.  light and airy for hot summer days.
5.0,To shortfits perfect go u NG order another one live it
5.0,Great product! Thank u
5.0,Great! Works well
5.0,these are perfect I hope the boys that I bought them for enjoy them as much as I enjoyed purchasing them..
5.0,My son loved this.  He plays football and they keep him really warm.  Great product!
5.0,Good price too. A tad wider than I like but otherwise no complaints.
5.0,Nice looking buckle. My 13 y.o. son loves it
5.0,Just what i was looking for. Its perfect
5.0,my daughter loves this top.I had to help her figure out how to were it.Once we figured it out it became a quick favorite of hers.It comes with directions.Is versatile.Very well made good material not thin and cheap.
5.0,"Oh my gosh,this is the best I've got from Amazon so far.The quality, the beauty,the flowiness,the way it makes me feel when wearing it.Its cotton!!! I paid $16.99 for this in white I think all colors should be this more affordable price.I am so disgusted that people are selling items for us at such high unaffordable prices & 85% of the stuff has only a 4 star or less rating.All sellers really need to try to bring prices down especially if the shirt isn't worth the price in the 1st place."
5.0,"Great fit, good price, washed nicely!"
5.0,"Gorgeous. I'm a US 13/15. 5'7 approx 180 lbs. Curvy.  After looking at all the pics people posted I decided to order a size I never buy... Small! Fit perfect, sits just off shoulder. Delicate wash line dry. If I had ordered a size bigger it would've been way too baggy"
5.0,"I'm short the length was perfect, the farbric worth the price, only the pant legs are done wide. so if you want a slim fit be ready to work on it. Overall people loved it."
5.0,Great quality fit my 3 month old son perfectly
5.0,"Love it! The purse is so classy, sexy and fashionable and easy to carry."
5.0,Bought it for a friend and she's going to get such pleasure out of this!
5.0,"Not too thick, not too thin, they stay up well (and go up to the knee). Socks can be so tricky; I ordered one set to see how they are, and am satisfied enough to order another set!"
5.0,"Nice gloves, they serve the purpose, good value."
5.0,"Comfortable fit, attractive and good price."
5.0,Super soft and warm on the inside. It keeps my ears warm.
5.0,"This tie fits well over my beloved 6'6"" nephew with an ample belly.  It looks much more expensive than it is, the black is a deep, rich hue and the silk luster is has a nice sheen.  It is also stain-resistant (he has a small baby). Further, he consider it his lucky tie as it landed him the job he was hoping for.  This aunt got a lot of points for only $19.00."
5.0,Absolutely love this and now want one in every color!
5.0,"this jacket is exactly what they say it is. It is very thin material so I feel like that's great for the summer. The arms are snug but I think it is meant to be that way as a design, it is shorter in the back with angled front wedges that are longer than the rest of the jacket/ Blazer I love this, and it's very comfortable. Make sure you get a size up, runs small. now I'm looking for the same thing only longer all the way around."
5.0,Purchased to wear for kick boxing so not to have bare feet on floor.
5.0,"I purchased the Polarspex Kids Glasses in Green in the hopes that these glasses would fit my 3 year old son.<br />To my surprise, they fit perfectly and they are very durable. These glasses work perfectly for his seizure disorder, he has to wear them inside of stores, as well as, outside because bright lighting makes him go into a seizure. So Far, no seizures, THANK YOU POLARSPEX!"
5.0,"All around great gloves, fit is just a touch on the smaller side."
5.0,Wear a baseball cap or visor inside to keep the nose expand or else it might collapse on your head.  Makes it a little more comfortable to wear as well.<br /><br />Don't buy if you're allergic to Latex.
5.0,"Unlike my ex wife's soul, this charm is very Pretty. I bought this years ago for her charm bracelet. It fit right onto her bracelet like every other charm I wasted my money on lol."
5.0,"Love it, bought it in 3 colors.  I am usually a medium but bought large because of the reviews.  These are knitted tops, not sweaters. They should be washed inside out, and they will still start to pill after a while.  But in the meantime I will wear them with leggings and look great."
5.0,"Mucha variedad de pulseras, las combinaciones quedan muy bien."
5.0,It was to small for me :( so I had to return it.
5.0,The robe is very soft and comfortable.
5.0,Fits snug. No riding or rolling. Firm waist support
5.0,Used this pin for RN school pinning (graduation) ceremony; perfect size (just about an inch across) and visible in photos.
5.0,Exactly as pictured & expected! True to size! Comfy sole & straps. My daughter runs all over the yard in them with no discomfort. Will buy again for her next summer!
5.0,Beautiful color and fit! I’m 5’4” and 125lbs and ordered small. Material is not wrinkly.
5.0,Me encantaron. Amplia vision. Muy buenas para bucear en profundidades bajas.
5.0,Very pretty. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Love the snap and button closures. Fits me perfectly.
5.0,"Great fit, awesome price and they keep your feet warm on a cold night."
5.0,"We’re going to see Taylor Swift for he first stop on her tour in Arizona, so I snagged this for that day. It’s light weight and big enough to notice. Exactly as expected and fits well. I’m excited to rep 1989 for Taylor!"
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves this nightgown.
5.0,"Perfect, fit as expected and super warm 👌"
5.0,"There's nothing I don't like about this shirt. It's soft and comfortable. When you're in a sling, it's easy to put on and take off. I love the material. It comes out of the wash looking new and there are no wrinkles.  They love it at PT because it makes placing the tens pads so much easier for them.  I just wish it came in more colors."
5.0,Super cute Miami<br />Heat pants ! Fit well and great quality !
5.0,Great for legs that swell when standing too long and warmer than compression hose in the winter!
5.0,Loved thia dress. Wanted something that i could wesr with a jacket and not be too hot. This dress is it. Super comfortable.
5.0,THEY ARE GREAT ABLE TO CHANGE WITH WHATEVER I AM WEARING.
5.0,"Looks great, feels great, and works great. Thanks!"
5.0,Perfect! Fits great and quality product for the price.  Love the style. Nothing else to say...just using required words. Done
5.0,"I found this &#34;Pure Copper Magnetic Bracelet (Universal) by: Mind n Body exactly as described. My Husband **who bought the (L) has been wearing this now for about 3 weeks and found that his Carpal Tunnel Syndrome decreased and my arthritis symptoms have lessened. This fits my husband perfectly. Dimensions: 7.3 (L) X 4mm (H) X 1mm (W). It is though a little too big for my wrist though. I do though plan on getting myself the same exact but, I will be getting the (M), dimensions fit my 6in wrist better. Overall a great product to have for all ailments for the body and I highly recommend. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on personal use and are not in any way influenced by the seller."
5.0,So far so good! Easy to put on and take off.  You can adjust the size easily. Comfortable!
5.0,"These caps are absolutely gorgeous. Everyone at work loves them. They fit great, the draw in the back is much preferred over having to tie it yourself."
5.0,This is great hat. Fits good and looks awesome. New fav hat
5.0,Comfortable masks. They give you room to breathe. Good value
5.0,Very pleased with my order!!
5.0,Love this cardigan. It is simple and stylish. A perfect light cover-up for summer.
5.0,Really cute dress for my husbands mad men themed 30th birthday! I was worried about the white dress with black dots being more sheer but the material was thincker then I thought so that was a huge plus! I did order a tulle to go under it to help if flair out more but couldn’t have done fine without it.<br />* cigarette is fake just made for a fun prop*
5.0,"The material is smooth to the touch and doesn't make you feel sticky or sweaty. Keeps you cool. I like to wear it in the summer while I'm getting ready for the day. It's also very pretty, but I probably wouldn't answer the door wearing JUST this robe."
5.0,"These are absolutely the best. I am honestly not sure how I managed meaty or gross food-prep before getting these. Also, they work great for protecting your hands from other kinds of gross tasks. Also, these work well for going over winter gloves if you're handling a lot of frozen food."
5.0,"very nice bag.  I love the tassels, and the customer service was excellent.  I had bought another bag, but it was too heavy for me to use aftr back surgery, and they offered me a full refund or another purse of mt choice.  This one is perfect.  The gray collar is a little different than the picture, but still very nice!"
5.0,"Gave these to my niece in college, she loves them"
5.0,This is a time saver. I carry large &#34;Mom&#34; purses and I no longer have to search for my keys. Thanks for simplifying my life.
5.0,I bough the blue pair for my 3 y/o son. He has it for almost two years. His feet grows slowly so it was a 1/2 size bigger.  He wears it practically everyday. I just remove the unicorn and rainbow from them. They are just as good as the Crocs brand but cheaper. I love them.
5.0,These masks are comfortable and fashionable. I love them and get lots of compliments. Might as well have fun.
5.0,"We're going on a cruise, and this will be perfect for keeping my sunglasses safe. Love the design choices and it's comfortable on your neck. Haven't tried this in water yet, but the fact that it floats is definitely a plus."
5.0,Super soft. I bought other colors because I liked it so much.
5.0,"Love this shirt! Very comfy, great fit, and have received numerous compliments on it."
5.0,"Love the quality, color, and POCKETS.... but I will size down next time.<br />Must Buy Though."
5.0,"Has an excellent amount of space, around 6 pockets (a few of them have functional zippers), feels like it almost weighs nothing, adjustable strap, it's very malleable, and the light-brown coloring looks good with pretty much any other color!"
5.0,I liked the feel of the shirt!! and the Vibrant colors.
5.0,"This is a good tunic dress that even has pockets. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. Because of the seam at the top of the bust, you may need to size up if you're a larger cup size. Other than that, I found the fit to be true to size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,"I really like this shirt. It will shrink a little. All and all, a good quality shirt. I will be ordering more in the future."
5.0,Gift for my teenage son. He loves it. Wears it everyday.
5.0,The piece for between the toes is soft and comfortable.  The speaker is adorable and they provide an extra pair.
5.0,I love love love theses warmers
5.0,Love these and plan on ordering a few more pair! Fit is perfect. True to size. Great quality surprised me at this price point.
5.0,Great for changing clothes at the beach
5.0,"I like everything about these pants. The pocket placement is a little lower on the hip than traditional pants which does not draw attention to hip bulge. I’ve washed them several times (in cold, tumble dry) and they have not faded and have kept their shape. I will order again."
5.0,Excellent variety of colors. You are sure to find a pocket square to match your ties.
5.0,"This hat and scarf set is really well made. The colors are so beautiful. I got the blue/turquoise one. The hat and scarf are lined with faux fur and are really soft and warm. The hat and scarf should fit most women. The only thing I disliked is that there is a tag on the cap for everyone to see that says ""Sport."""
5.0,"Super cute! Fit well, not too tight."
5.0,"These are so comfy, and I'm so glad they are high-wasted. I don't feel like they are digging into my waistline or I need to constantly be checking if my tummy is hanging out."
5.0,I absolutely love this and it save me more time in the am to get to work on time just place over my beard and off to work
5.0,It's very comfortable and nice enough to use as a house dress.
5.0,"I bought these for my mom for Mother's day and she really liked them, she even got compliments when she wore them out!  I worried that she would find them annoying because they do make some noise when you move but she likes it."
5.0,"I have tons or workout gear.  These shorts are the best in the world for running, leg day, hiking, Ultras etc.  Awesome stretchy, silky, quick drying, and comfy.  Tons of pockets for a 50K self supported ultra fuel needs.  I actually grabbed extra food on the course and overstuffed the pockets and finished with more gels than I started.  Drawstring is stretchy and comfy also.  Buy them."
5.0,I bought these for a friend and he wore them out! He has a lot of issue with his feet and walking but said that these Sketchers felt good to walk in. He got a lot of wear out of them before they got too bad for him to wear anymore (even with how abusive he is to shoes!).
5.0,Love saucony shoes.
5.0,What a buy. My son gave to his wife for Christmas. She absolutely loved it. Picture doesn't do it justice.
5.0,"These block the sun out so well, it’s very hard for me to find sunglasses that can actually block out the sun days for my eyes! I love them!"
5.0,Bought this bag for Mom and she loves it.  The color is just refreshing.
5.0,"These 11-14 size tights fit my almost 10 year old average sized niece perfectly.<br />There is a hole on the bottom.<br />These tights didn't bunch at her heel or anything, they looked like normal tights.<br />My niece did try them with the foot turned up at the ankle and actually, I kind of liked that feature.  Sometimes at weddings, kids take their shoes off and dance, and then I worry about the tights getting all gross and dirty from the dance floor and holes getting in the bottom from too much wear. Also if your daughter is wearing these with A dress and boots/ socks then the convertible foot can help with less bunching.<br />With that feature, they can be pulled up and then no worry about either of those problem!<br />I'm thinking about converting to convertible tights from now on!<br />The 11-14 size fit my 9 year old daughter perfectly, so you might want to size up if you're 13 or 14."
5.0,"INBLUE has never let me down with their jewelry. Whether it's the great look or the great price, they will always get my business."
5.0,I loved the watch.  Both 2 more for family members.
5.0,These are a good size for carrying in a purse or tied to a wallet strap.  I use them for bibs when eating messy foods such as spaghetti or cream sauces because they can be  thrown in the washing machine with lighter weight items; they come out looking fine.
5.0,The center pleat pooches up and makes me look pregnant when sitting but very flattering standing and walking.  Great dress for price.
5.0,very cute and good for what I need
5.0,"I like that the dress is colorful and fits well except for the length. I will hem the dress myself. I usually wear petite cloths because I am only 5' 1"" . This dress is worth buying and then if necessary heming."
5.0,I wore this dress to work on Halloween. It fit well and was very flattering. I received numerous compliments on it.
5.0,Awesome!  Good quality and perfect fit
5.0,"Thick, soft and fits a curvey girl perfect.  The v-neck adds a sexy style and you can dress it up with a scarf and down with a jean jacket."
5.0,This dress is a must-have!!! The first time i saw this dress was at a corporate party on someone else and I fell in love!! Had to buy it when i saw it on Amazon. The lace is soft and the bottom portion of the dress is nice and heavy. Classy dress!! Can't beat the price!!

5.0,Love this romper. Super cute! True to size. Purchased a medium. However be ware it is super short! I’m 5’2/5’3 and just barely able to pull off how short it is.
5.0,"Just beautiful! Bought for my 5 year old, and replaced with a very short chain for her. It is just a beautiful charm, and would work for an adult or child, but was just what I was looking for, for her--just sweet and dainty."
5.0,Best suit ever
5.0,"Love this wonderwomen necklace. Very stylish and a great conversation piece. Although this necklace does look gold in the pic, remember it is rose gold and looks look rose gold and person."
5.0,Great! lots of padding and finally one in my size
5.0,Fits perfect.  Many complications.
5.0,My daughter loved it so much
5.0,"Great bag, perfect...just as described!"
5.0,"I have 4 school aged children from ages 6-13 and this fits them all. My 8 year old girl is autistic, and this is the only mask she will wear. Breathable, comfortable, and best of all they don't lose it because it's on their neck!"
5.0,"Simple design and great chain, it goes with the rest of my assorted accessories. Cant be beat and im considering ordering two more to act as dog tags for my pets."
5.0,As described. Very nice details. My husband loves it.
5.0,This is absolutely gorgeous and we'll made. I will use this seller again! You will not be disappointed.

5.0,Great addition to my Halloween costume.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:11c4525c4ff5a34bace613d28549d960]] Very good quality ,  love It"
5.0,These were great for my smaller kiddo! These ran a bit smaller than the others that I bought elsewhere. They are also silkier and thinner.
5.0,very cute will wear it on Halloween
5.0,White and pink skulls on a bandanna... need I say more
5.0,Buy this product :) It is amazing!
5.0,My daughter loves these and they don’t irritate her ears

5.0,"Just like the package description said, you get everything! They are so cute and I frikin love them so much!!!"
5.0,Love this case. Very simple and fits perfect.
5.0,"I'm 5'3"", 115 lbs, with a classic hourglass figure.  This dress makes me look tall, and simply spectacular. Soo glad I purchased.  Quality is nice, too."
5.0,"Great bargain! leather is soft, almond-toe is beautiful, color is really unique. I have skinny legs and there is some room in the calves area. All in all, i'm happy with the purchase - they look great with skinny jeans"
5.0,All I can say I am very pleased with my purchase
5.0,It's a beautiful ring u would definitely recommend
5.0,I like the band.  However when I received it one of the pins that connected the link that connects to the watch was out.  I had to take to watch repair to fix.  Otherwise seems good so far.  I anticipate it will last longer than the silicone band that came with the watch.<br /><br />I thought it would feel heavier on wrist.  It is heavier than silicone band but I really don't notice it when wearing it.
5.0,Perfect  very nice fit awesome  thanks
5.0,I gave as a gift and he loved it!
5.0,Highly recommended the quality is good i usually meduim i decided to order large am glad i did that it fits perfect...love it planning to order white color
5.0,"Ive been wearing these a week, and Im actually surprised at the support. They are so squishy, I thought my back and legs would be hurting after a while. They actually give me no fatigue after mall walking for hours, unlike my Crock sandals. Will update if things change."
5.0,Love these bands better than the original bands that came with the watch. I was a little leary after reading the reviews but took a chance and am happy that I did. They are much softer and more comfortable than the original bands. Not to see how long they last. But for the price I'll buy several and will switch them out regularly so they should last a while.
5.0,Comfortable. Fits perfect
5.0,These are very nice shirts! They run a little big but are really nice!
5.0,"Love them, so warm & cozy."
5.0,Perfect fit for child.  My grandbaby is a small 4 year old and they fit wonderfully. Breathable material  and much easier then trying to put a mask over her ears.  This is easier to keep up with also.
5.0,good product all around.
5.0,Very satisfied with product and fast delivery
5.0,"One of those rare moments when a cheap dress from amazon actually looks like the photo. Im a size 14 (but a B cup) and I tried both the L and XL. I kept the Large because the XL was a bit too loose at the waist. The dress fits great, fabric is comfortable. Bottom has a crinkly look but I haven't tried ironing it yet. The blue color is so beautiful and refeshing. And there are pockets!!! Overall so pleased. Just the button sticking out at the chest makes the dress less than perfect but I'll deal with it."
5.0,Belt buckle scratches easy - some scratches comes with buckle included
5.0,My Son A+++++
5.0,"I love it,  I received it as expected.  I'll buy more."
5.0,"I liked the colors on my skin tone, I like how snug it is, I like the straps in the back, very good for a low price swimsuit"
5.0,Really like the dress. Simple but cute!
5.0,"Its a great bag for day trips, hikes, or flying with and keeping everything you need in one place. im definitely recommending this to my family and friends"

5.0,[[VIDEOID:abaa91e35b67e12ef5d473b8840f7721]]
5.0,The glasses are exactly what they look like in the picture there even more beautiful in person and very comfortable in it was shipped so quick I got them A-day early
5.0,Exactly as described. Fits perfect.
5.0,"Very attractive watch, a very pretty flower/petal design on the wristband.<br />Comes in a box and with an adjustment tool which was very helpful."
5.0,"We have an uncle who is an avid runner - so we purchased these gloves for him, for Christmas.  He LOVED them! In fact, he said he wished he'd had them that morning, as it was one of those cold winter mornings here in L.A.  I know, I know, it's L.A., we don't know what cold is - but we do get down into the 30's during the winter months - and these gloves were perfect for that temperature. :)"
5.0,Hubby wears them all the time.
5.0,Hermosa y de muy buena calidad.
5.0,"Initially a glitch with shipping. Was supposed to get them on a tuesday, they didn't come till Thursday. But product arrived in time, as good as advertised. Excellent socks, comfortable, held up,well on a 10 mile OCR."
5.0,So very soft.  Held up well during wash
5.0,Just the Right Size! The Colors are pretty on point from the Pictures as well.
5.0,Love the way these socks fit!!!
5.0,"We love this dress! It fits great and is good quality for the price. The pink on the dress isn’t as bright as it appears in the picture, but it doesn’t affect the look enough to be disappointed."
5.0,"Best clothing purchase from Amazon. I'm 5 feet even, and the length is perfect. I've never bought a maxi dress I didn't have to hem."
5.0,Slowly wearing all Keith haring this was a must have to collection high quality though the connector and fabric in back could be better. Otherwise worth the splurge! Thanks Amazon for making my Keith haring dreams come true!
5.0,I was pleasantly<br />Surprised with these. They are very comfortable and are good quality. The price is great too! :)
5.0,"Soft, fun and cute. Great quality for price, no changes ever through the dryer."
5.0,"Great little purse. Perfect for concerts, sightseeing, or just simply if you prefer carrying the bare essentials. The back zipper pocket fits my slim/minimalistic wallet perfectly. The two front pockets are great for smaller items that you may want quicker access to, such as chapstick, scrunchy/hair tie, small key ring, etc. Enough room for a face powder compact, passport, and a few other small items. Light, durable material, with a thin/comfortable strap, that's the perfect length for crossbody wear (I'm 5'7 so I have it stretched out to full capacity). My phone is around 5.8"" I believe, and it fits perfectly, but anything over that, might be pretty snug, or even impossible. Classic darker Minicat interior, that you don't have to worry about potentially staining. This doesn't scream designer, or high price tag, but for the cheap price, it's a really cute, nice addition to have. Definitely do not recommend to those of you that carry half of your life with you, haha."
5.0,Hat was nice and shipped fast
5.0,Love this! I have gotten a lot of compliments on it!
5.0,The cat is beautiful such good quality. Very happy with it.
5.0,Nice Material..........
5.0,Very cute bag. I love Pocahontas so this is a good addition to my loungefly collection.
5.0,"I LOVE MY BEADS STRAND,THEY FIT JUST RIGHT,THANK YOU SO MUCH,JUDY"
5.0,I wore these socks on a hiking trip in the Adirondacks.I hiked trails all day and I did not get any blisters nor did I have any problems with my bunion. My daughter said they were very comfortable for her also.
5.0,Omg these tights are the cutest.  I don't see how short women are wearing it lol.  I am 5'10 180 lbs and these leggings are high high waist on me but I am ecstatic about that 😍
5.0,"It's just lovely, great to wear with another similarly colored bracelet, (I wear my lava beads with it.)"
5.0,As expected. Great price for 925 Sterling
5.0,True to size. I got a XXL. I love this brand. I'm a 38DDD and it fits great in the chest. Only issue is it's about 2-3 inches shorter than I prefer. Stock picture is accurate. I'm 5'5&#34; and a teacher. I will wear a white petticoat to extend it some.
5.0,Looks nice. Fits great.
5.0,Love this dress! Got it for our baby shower. So comfortable and made we feel beautiful at 8 mos. Definitely a little long. I’m 5’1” so needed to shorten it.
5.0,Absolutely love the colors and design on this. Really looks like the photo. Material and sewing is very well made. Previous one still looks great but I had lost weight and needed a smaller size. I think the newer ones use a much higher quality material.
5.0,Loved it.. looks great ... very comfortable.. kept me from getting sunburn. I’m very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish beanie!
5.0,Loved my new Christmas pajamas. Very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"Wonderful, just what I was expecting"
5.0,Wife loves her shirt.
5.0,This is the best thing I have gotten from Amazon! It's short but I have short legs so it's no issue. I am 5'5 and 190lbs and it fits great and is really comfy! I have one other color and plan to get more!
5.0,Good quality and craftsmanship  really nice zise it holds 12 cards!
5.0,"Cute skeleton keys, 9 different styles that I'll be using to make bracelets!"
5.0,Fast shipping.... they a good little pendent holders
5.0,Nice size with an adjustable strap. I am happy that sunglasses fit.
5.0,Beautiful dress with good pricing and fits perrfect
5.0,"Good quality,  don't know about fit.  Son is a Ski Doo Snowmobiler so he will like it."
5.0,"I loved this dress! I had many concerns with ordering my dress so last minute, especially since so little reviews were available when I ordered. I had a strict time limit but the seller assured me it would come in time and that it would not need any alterations. The dress was a little loose in some places but it gave me a little wiggle room for dancing. My only complaint would be that the back of the top was secured with snaps instead of clasps or hooks so the back kept popping open when I moved. The top was beautifully detailed with beading. The bottom was an extremely heavy and great quality material and was very well made. It even had pockets. I couldn't believe the quality I received for such a low price. It's been three months and I still couldn't be happier!"
5.0,"loved this so much when I got the first black ordered two more and thinking of getting more in each color.  great look, feel and the price is awesome"
5.0,Ordered this and had shipped directly to a relative who doesn't &#34;do&#34; computers and couldn't find a replacement wallet insert in stores. She seemed happy with the insert and said it was exactly what she wanted.
5.0,"Love! Might but more. So soft, lightweight.. Just wonderful."
5.0,Sooooo comfy. True to size. I'm a 0 and XS fits wonderfully.
5.0,Beautiful color and so soft.  Would highly recommend.
5.0,"Runs a little big, my son love it"
5.0,"Super cute and chic. Not big, but roomy for one person."
5.0,Should have order bigger size
5.0,"1.) Fits almost perfectly, with enough stretch to smooth over any spots that would otherwise be too snug or loose<br />2.) The Pima cotton is soooooo soft; Touching this is how I imagine  a freshly sheared alpaca would feel!<br />3.) Looks great, I could wear this to the gym, with a pair of stone-washed jeans for a casual look, or as the base layer under a three-piece suit and still feel just as comfortable.<br />4.) ""Made for You"" truly does feel made for me; I would recommend anyone to give it a try and remember with each article of clothing you have 30 days to make changes and request an updated item for free!"
5.0,Use it couple of times for hiking and it's been perfect.
5.0,"We got our 11 year old son this jacket for Christmas. Big Lakers fan. He adores it and wears it everyday. Great quality, vibrant colors. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Super cute. Purchased as a little gift. Wish it was mine
5.0,"Shoes are well made and perfect for a 2 year old. Like all others with velcro closing, he can  remove.  They are easy for grandparents to put on!<br />[[ASIN:B005VLRI9E Pedoodles Eco Friendly Shoes - Wise Guys]]"
5.0,"Nice design, nice weight and  just the right length.  A good buy, Highly recommend it."
5.0,"These fit well , & don't fall out while I'm sleeping. I love them"
5.0,"This suit was awesome! Wore this with my Darth Vader helmet for Halloween and received so many compliments. Nothing looks better than rocking a suit at a party, especially when it's Vader."
5.0,I love these! They are perfect fall colors. They fit a little big when recieved but after they're dried they fit true to size. Will buy again for sure
5.0,The best belt ever..
5.0,Gift for godson. Really liked the fact that this clip opened rather than a one piece that can stretch out of shape over time. He likes it!
5.0,Very quick delivery!!Daughter loved them
5.0,These were perfect for my husbands work ugly sweater contest matched with my sweater
5.0,Was in need of a new wallet and this one was very similar to the one I had. Cards seem to slide in and out with a few days break in. Has a new leather smell but is ok. Good Quality.
5.0,Son loves it! Clasp is hard to get on and off. Replaced with magnetic clasp and perfect!
5.0,"These are too perfect. They have pockets, you can choose your length, they have belt loops, and are very comfortable.<br /><br />I am 5'8"" 175 and ordered a medium. Fits perfect. Stretchy enough to get on and firm enough to hold belly and stay up all day, even if they stretch the belt loops are there. The fabric is on the thinner side but they still feel sturdy enough.<br /><br />Like a cross between leggings and work slacks. Perfect for work. I dont even care if they dont last, I would buy more. I hope they do last though.<br /><br />I expected to be disappointed and risk the chance of buying pants on amazon but they fit better than I could have imagined."
5.0,"This is the second pair of boots I've gotten from this company. My daughter outgrew the first ones, but they've held up so well they got handed down to a family member. The clear soles seem to have a little less traction than the opaque ones, but it's only a problem when my daughter runs on wooden surfaces after a few days of pouring rain. The shark boots have lasted an entire autumn and winter in the Pacific Northwest with zero damage."
5.0,Lovely shirt. The material is a little heavier than it appears in the picture. Very 'vintage' feel. It fits great and feels wonderful. Letting it hang out the wrinkles but look forward to wearing it.
5.0,One of my all times favorite blouses.
5.0,Vintage looking...everyone loves it.
5.0,"this is MRS M ! I am a MAJOR AHELI DIVA/FAN ! with that said, when i saw these earrings, I flipped ! Dancing In the moonlight while wearing these...<br />(just imagine )!!. HOT RETRO EARRINGS !

5.0,"Great socks, well made, comfortable. Love them!"
5.0,This band caught may eye because the design is totally different.<br />Not really sure of the durability so far so good. Multicolored band.
5.0,This picture doesn’t do them justice. Really cute and the lace is really nice.
5.0,These gloves are great! Especially when your working with rose bushes and bougainvillea!
5.0,I received a lot earlier than stated and I am very pleased with the product will even order more. Thanks!
5.0,Extremely stretchy and not baggy! So comfortable to wear in hospital !
5.0,"My 3 year old little boy loved this dinosaur dress on me, he loves dinosaurs. Bought it for his 3rd birthday dinosaur themed party. Got several compliments on it. Arrived on time, great colors. Fit great. I loved this dress."
5.0,Love this product! Works great! But be aware if you use this often and your boots get wet they will start to crack. So after about 6 months strip the boots again and start from scratch with this product!
5.0,great shoes for slipping on and off in winter
5.0,"Before I bought, I wish there was more graphic ts in the set. Now that i have them, i am actually very pleased, looks way better in person. Good material, quailty is good."
5.0,Super adorable! Very comfortable for little ones learning to walk.
5.0,I love these shirts to workout in.  They are super comfy and breathe really nice.  They have a really good fit and allow easy movement.  I liked them so much I have bought two more packs.
5.0,I liked it because it was just how the picture looks and it holds up. It doesn't look or feel cheap.
5.0,"A lot nicer looking than the comfort click belt, but it's a bit heavier. I suppose that's the tradeof."
5.0,My son loved them..
5.0,Great for kids that lose everything. Well priced so you don’t need to worry about missing ones
5.0,Very good for me...thankas
5.0,"very good product! it doesn’t look 100% like the photo but the only difference is that there’s stitching on the mask irl (duh!) it does in fact come with the filters! held up pretty well, and was my go-to mask to use. i washed it once a week (air dryer as to not shrink it) and in the end, like 1 thread came a little loose but it did not affect how the mask functioned."
5.0,I liked the quality and the detail of the product.
5.0,Ítem de excelente calidad y terminación<br />Muy útil para el sol
5.0,Love the ring! It looks just like the photos. Only thing it took forever to travel from the east coast of FL to the west coast of FL. Should of taken one day took weeks. Slow seller.
5.0,"I bought 2 of these, one for each of my sisters.  They loved them."
5.0,good quality<br />looks and fits nice
5.0,"My wife loved it. I found this on-line, ordered it, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gift. The rose was exquisite and the accompanying necklace was just the right touch. The heart-shape was full of sparkles and the blue stone was brilliant."
5.0,"It fit perfectly.  I love my ""Roseanne shirt!"" 😅"

5.0,Adorable little skirt!
5.0,"These do run large. Unfortunately for me I wear an 8.5, the 8s weren't available so I tried the 8.5, too big :( I just ordered a 7.5 since it's my only hope. The shoes themselves are lovely, if you like the picture, get them. You won't be disappointed."

5.0,Girl would live in it if I let her.
5.0,Love the product.  I am very pleased.
5.0,I purchased this watch in one of the Carnival Spirit's ships stores. It has a good weight and feel on the wrist. It stands out with the bold design look. I really like the double latch and adjustment strap that makes it quick and easy to change the wrist size. Best of all I got it for 20 % off and duty free.
5.0,Loved these nice case and cleaning cloth included. I wish they were available in more colors
5.0,Works great! Strings are a little bulkier than other styles I've seen. Runs small size up. Overall great product
5.0,"I have purchased several sets of these perfect masks.  The fabric is the best weave, the layers are not too heavy nor too thin. The fit is fantastic for my face. They hold up very well in the wash and I have washed them several times. Some are in the laundry right now. But took photos of the clean ones that have been washed several times. I have had no unhappy issues with them. The price is more than reasonable. Adjustable ear loops are a must. The soft, comfortable nylon elastic ear loops extend all the way through the side hems, not just stitched to the edge. I have attached some lanyards for taking the mask down in my automobile."
5.0,I love this they work so well and make my legs feel better. They are comfy and so nice love
5.0,Beautiful earings. I wanted something different since was my 1st time buying rose gold. I've worn them with everything from shorts to dresses.
5.0,Beautiful looks just like the picture!
5.0,"This hoodie is very nicely made.  It's quite thick and warm and would be used more as a jacket in cold weather (versus wearing it indoors as a shirt).  It was larger than I expected it would be but we folded the cuffs back and know my grandson can use this for a couple of years, so that's fine.  It's well constructed, too.  I can highly recommend it."
5.0,Grandson LOVES it

5.0,"The material breathes and is just the right length.  I will be ordering more!!!  One thing I did notice, which I prefer, is a bit more tummy control/support.  A friend of mine commented the other day and she's going to be ordering a few for herself.  You won't believe the quality of this garmet!"
5.0,Wow beautiful color. Good material. Doesn't snag or rip. Great scarf!

5.0,"This is my second purchase of this minimalist wallet.  After having my purse stolen and the headache that accompanied that event, I decided to find a small wallet that I could keep in my pocket that wasn't too masculine in appearance.  The first purchase was a navy blue color that I've carried for several months and it's worked well for me.  Today it looks as new as the day I purchased it.  I currently have 18 cards in it and a few folded bills and a couple of blank checks.  The only reason for this second purchase is to have a different color - a vibrant blue- just as the picture shown - that wasn't offered at the time I purchased the navy blue wallet.  It's well made with heavy duty elastic material and strong stitching.  I would definitely purchase again."
5.0,"Great product, I own 2 of them and they fit extremely well. I have a size 32-34 waist depending not he pants and this belt adjusts quickly and holds snug throughout the entire day. I look froward to see what these guys come up with next. Maybe a sliding black and leather skinny dress belt!"
5.0,"I'm a martial arts instructor, the price was good and product works wonderful. Large and loud, just the way we like it in Taekwondo."
5.0,"Great size, looks great, and the straps work great for tote bag or back pack (I was worried how awkward it might feel as a backpack). I’ve only been using it for a week, but I’m so glad I got this bag. I wish the tote straps were at least an inch longer, but they are fine as they are."
5.0,"Great product, great fit, shipped quickly"
5.0,"Very cute for price, I bought a second one bc I like it so much but when it got washed a color catcher did not get put in the machine and made the black go onto the design but at the price it was worth buying again and had no problems when a color catcher was put in machine"

5.0,"Fit perfectly, the size chart is accurate, the jacket designed nicely and feels very durable, i really liked the fact that the pockets are heated inside as well so it warms my hands, tested it on high level during a baseball game and the rechargeable battery lasted for full 3  hours while charging up my iPhone, in the end the battery indicator still shown half full so im guessing it could go another 3 hours with no problem overall very pleased with my purchase and can recommend"
5.0,These were great! I gave some as gifts and kept a pair for myself. They are very comfortable and cozy! They do come as pictured. I was confused on the sock that had the M on it. I gave to a friend whose name started with an M.

5.0,"I absolutely love these camisoles with the built in bra. I have completely given up on conventional bras. These are so soft and comfortable you can wear them to bed. The built in bra provides just enough support and shape for my size. Larger size (D sizes and up) ladies might not find  these supportive enough. But those of us with C and smaller, they are great. They don't have wires or push up support.<br />Loved these so much I bought 2 more."

5.0,"Just got the purse today. I didn't pay attention to the specs of the purse when I ordered it (I did flip through 100 pages of purses on Amazon). It was bigger than I thought it would be, but it's a nice surprise. It had all the right pockets and the big button is cute. I got the khaki color. Just beautiful and for the price, you can't complain. Other reviewers mentioned the odor, which is typical odor from the materials. Doesn't bother me any. Will look into this brand the next time I shop for another purse."

5.0,Have pain in shoulders and lower back. This works quite well and is not constricting.
5.0,"These gloves are very nice and soft, and better than I thought they would be.  You definitely can keep them on and use your phone, as the tips of the fingers allow that.  The cuffs can also make the gloves a little longer for the warmth on a cold day.  Really nicely made product."

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c6b35af785b6d95671de4778c052e9a2]] Just how they look in the photo. Some of the beading was lopsided but I think it gave the eye character! The back of the earring is felt and I couldn’t remember if the listing said that or not, but I love them. They are extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear!"
5.0,"In a perfect world, my closet would be wider and the lowest shelf much higher to accommodate a wheeled laundry hamper divided into sections. Instead; I'm using a huge, existing bag for towels and wash cloths. My new mesh bags are color coded (at least to me). The bold and brightest for colors, the light gray for whites and the black for the microfiber products I use to rid my home of flith."

But, I was looking for a watch or two that would make a bold, different color, statement.  This green really caught my eye.  And the feature set, incredible.  Solid construction, very nice band, perfect wrist feel and weight ( for me ), and mechanical self winding !  I checked the reserve and it's 62 hours !  So impressed I bought both the blue and the green versions.  Never looked back.  Super value for the money."

5.0,Now my husband has several colors
5.0,"I love everything about this umbrella, from the color to how solid and sturdy it feels. However, because of how it's constructed, it is a little heavier than the average umbrella especially when it's closed. It's fine when it's open, maybe because of the weight distribution. But it does seem like it will last a long time."

I can't take it out of my CD player!<br />Only downside: the opening and closing themes are NOT on this album, as they were not written by the composer. They must be purchased separately."

5.0,I bought these for my preteen daughter who's wanting more sophisticated under garments. The bras fit her perfectly and were true to size.

5.0,these are great.<br />of good quality too.
5.0,"I love this apron! I’ve been using it for housework and it’s held up for weeks without a single issue. The linen-y material looks traditional and natural. The crossover back keeps it nice and secure, without bother, and the pockets are an added bonus! IYKYK!"

5.0,"These tanks are great, fit great, last through years of heavy use. Highly recommend."

5.0,It was a beautiful addition to my wedding ensemble!! Does run a bit tiny though!!!
5.0,"This was a gift for my eleven year old son and he loves it. The watch material is good quality and has held up nicely for the last few months, especially considering the daily wearing of the rough and tumble boy who owns it. My only slight reservation about it, especially at first, is the size. It seems to me to be a full size watch and we worried it might be too bulky. But he tried it and adjusted after a week or so. Great product!"
5.0,Boots fit great! Look great! Feel great!
5.0,"I was so satisfied with these earrings!! They are so pretty on, also the earrings light weight!! They lay so perfectly on my ears. Worth every penny, and then some!!"

5.0,"I had a nice pair of expensive riding boots I got last season and they disappeared (I believe at the hands or should I saw paws of my new puppy and my husband may have destroyed the evidence) but not wanting to spend that kind of money again for boots I found these online and they are lovely in person.  Don't let the price fool you, they are great.  I ordered a 9 and I can run anywhere from a 9-10 and they fit fine, I probably could have gotten a 9.5 or a 10 and worn thicker socks, but that's ok!  Cant wait for fall to wear them."
5.0,Very quick delivery...Nice bag...About size of a basic woman's checkbook wallet. But I love the design... Hindu writing on all but the inside and front and after reading about the tree of life it makes it that much better. We should all love and respect mother nature and all the good Lord has provided.
5.0,Very cute. Got this for my niece as a Christmas present
5.0,"Love the fit and style.  Thin, so it will not be too hot when working out."

5.0,This watch is fantastic.  Much better than I expected.  The titanium makes it super light.  I love the purple face.
5.0,I was surprised at how well it fit me based on the comments a lot of people made about it being too short. I'm 5'6 155lbs curvy (34 27 34) and it hits me at my ankle. I wore mine with 3.5 inch booties and a basic tank top and the vest and got several compliments. Love it!
5.0,Oh my goodness. My husband surprised me with this for my birthday. It is so beautiful and classy. I have never seen anything like this before.

5.0,Beautiful top and great quality
5.0,I brought this necklace to accessorise a wedding outfit. The chain is very sturdy and solitaire sits either side of the chain which I thought was a nice design function as often I find the solitaire often travels around the chain and ends up by the catch. Classic design which was perfect for me.
5.0,"Something that can be worn, maybe to run errands."
5.0,"This shirt is nicer looking than expected.  The wine color is a clear, jewel-like tone with a subtle sheen. It washes like a dream. I washed in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle, laid flat on a drying rack to dry, smoothing out the fabric. I expected to need a light touch up with the iron, but none was needed.  The fabric is comfortable, and drapes nicely. Would definitely order from this manufacturer again."
5.0,The dress was great. She felt like a princess on her birthday!
5.0,I love this handbag. It makes a perfect lipstick case! Love the colors. I would highly recommend this cute little bag.
5.0,"Comfortable, durable, easy to assemble, nice colors!"
5.0,"Bought this watch for myself. Love the look of it and the thinness of it. Very beautiful watch and rich color. Fits well, and I have a large wrist."
5.0,I’ve had various bamboo items before. Wanted to add some bamboo socks. These feel like high quality items when you handle them. Super comfortable. Almost like you don’t have socks on as they breath really very. Bought more and will buy again if quality stays the same. Good combination of materials.
5.0,I like the shoes
5.0,Grandson loved it!! Great quality!!
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress.  Wore it to work and got a ton of compliments.  The fabric is high quality but not at all stretchy so it was a bit difficult to get on/off since the only openings are the front buttons and they don't go down to the waist all the way.  Other than having to do a bit of gymnastics to get the dress on and off, I love it and it fit perfectly.  I typically wear a 16 and got an XXL and it fit great."
5.0,ran a bit smalled than expected
5.0,Love this top! So soft and cute.
5.0,Perfect fit! My daughter loved it!
5.0,"Really like it,  softer than I expected too.  Thickness would be similar to slightly thin tee shirt,  white is slightly see-through but not totally sheer.  Perfect w a tan or white undershirt.  Fit is slightly roomy,  but not sloppy. Overall flattering & cute!"
5.0,Me gusta. Excelente compra
5.0,"This kimono is so easy to wear. I bought it to wear over a rose colored linen dress and it is lovely. It is also perfect for a more dress down outfit like jeans or shorts. It's one  of those tops that you toss on, smile at yourself in the mirror and just know it's going to be a fun day. Very nice excessory ."
5.0,LOVE THESE PATTERNS!!! Please do more patterns!
5.0,This piece is so comfy I wear it all the time
5.0,Perfect gift come in cute little box
5.0,Great piece for my keys to replace the old one in had
5.0,I couldn’t as for a better product..
5.0,Just like the pic👌🏼👌🏼
5.0,VERY Cute on. Fits well. Material is a little flimsy. But price was appropriate. Found that when you take it from package and let it hang a few days for the wrinkles to fall out. Did not have to even attempt to iron. Overall I was pleased and would purchase again but the shipping was too long.
5.0,Get them warm feeties going. And share a pair with a friend.
5.0,My daughter wears this like it's a regular dress. It's super cute. Love it!
5.0,"Not exactly cheap, but very nice.  Unlike other places I've ordered from, the gold has not faded.  I've lost soooo many clip-ons that I welcome the snug fit - a bit of discomfort that I get used to, is definitely worth bringing them home after a night on the town."
5.0,Very roomy deep fitting cap!
5.0,"It is a little smaller than what I was thinking it would be so go a size up. That being said, I absolutely love this top. you can dress it up with a blazer or jacket, or wear it alone with a pair of jeans. it is a little see through but not bad. you can choose to wear a cami or not. I haven't and don't feel the need to.  the material seems pretty well put together so I don't see it falling apart any time soon. I'm going to wear this for a couple months before I buy another to see how well it does hold up after some wear, but I see myself buying a grey or off white one before too long.<br /><br />in conclusion this shirt is a great buy, I do not regret it, and will buy another color at some point."
5.0,"Soft fabric, perfect length for a 5'6 lady..."
5.0,love the material and love the fit
5.0,"I would definitely recommend this one, it's very soft and comfortable. It fits well inside your mask, and makes it easier to talk and breath. Stays in place also. Fits women and men."
5.0,"LOVE these! Light-weight, they hang a little lower than I thought they would, but they are SO cute!! I'm buying the black ones next!"
5.0,Design is really nice and stretches! Colors are very vibrant! I switched to this one since the band I had was cutting my skin this was a good alternative!
5.0,These earrings were not disappointing. They are beautiful and a good value for the money. They hang beautifully and look very elegant.
5.0,My white freshwater cultured pearl earrings are beautiful and go with nearly everything.  I love them.
5.0,I love this it fit perfectly 😍😍😍 and very comfortable I will be ordering more soon<br />I am a xl 5'7 190 so I ordered a 3x
5.0,"These earrings are truly lovely and look so elegant when you have them on.  If my neck was longer and thinner I would never take them off.  If you buy them, just take your time putting them on because if you are like me you have never seen this configuration before in earrings and enjoy the great look."
5.0,I love these new brown wayfarers. Super comfortable and very stylish. I've had several compliments since I bought them. I particularly like the tortoise-shell frame. Beautifully crafted. Thank you Eye Love for another high-quality product. You never disappoint.
5.0,"With the demands of using toe stops in roller derby, over the years my toes/nails have gotten so beat up.  I never thought to try ballet inserts. These are perfect if you have little room. Since my right foot uses more force and has stretched out the leather, I use the silicone gel inserts.  For my left foot that is not so stretched out, these are ticket!"
5.0,Fits great and looks super cute! I didn’t have high expectations because it was only $6 but I have to say the quality and fit exceeded my wildest hopes.
5.0,"These are cute socks, bought them for my daughter as a present."
5.0,Still working great and easy to program
5.0,Got it for my coworker during Christmas time. She loved it! Both turtle and chain were very shiny
5.0,Stylish. Flexing on anyone who walks by
5.0,My daughter loved it and will look like a real scientist to her Destination Imagination competition.
5.0,Super cute. Some came a little chipped but can’t help that.
5.0,These are not the most flattering but they’re sooo comfortable and last a very long time without wearing out
5.0,These hoodies were very cute and my granddaughter loves them.
5.0,"Not knowing what to expect when I purchased these, I was pleasantly pleased. They could be worn year-round, comfortably. Having bigger Calves, I was pleased that they were not too tight. They washed up well also."
5.0,They were perfect !!!!
5.0,"The beads are lovely.  They feel cool and have substance.  The only &#34;concern&#34; I have is the elastic feels a little fragile, but otherwise I love them.  I use them as worry beads and jewelry."
5.0,Cute Birthday gift for a friend
5.0,"Bought for my 14 year old.  Looks great, he loves it."
5.0,love it. It is pretty!!!
5.0,I love them. So comfy. I was afraid they would be too long but they flow perfectly.
5.0,"This is a very nice belt that came in a very nice metal box, which would be great for giving to someone! It has no defects. It runs a little smaller than I expected it to but it still fits. The buckle is high quality and it doesn't seem like the holes will rip like a cheaper belt. It seems very durable and well made. I've certainly paid more for belts in a department store that broke from being worn tightly daily. The stitching is well done and has no stray threads that I could find. The buckle feels substantial and the leather is thick. Hard to believe the claim it's real leather at that price but it seems to be with how it's holding up.<br /><br />** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. If my impressions of this product change I will update this review."
5.0,Super cute and true to size. The material is pretty thin but most shirts are these days.
5.0,"If you're a backpack kind of person, this is for you. Materials are very sturdy. There's so much room. I can tell that this backpack will last for a long time. Really WORTH your $$$."
5.0,They appear to be pretty strong
5.0,I got this for my wedding party.  They looked like goddesses.  it is so precious and dainty. looks adorable.
5.0,"These fit my 4 and chubby faced 7 year old pretty well.  Sometimes they creep up into their eyes, but that's just the nature of little nosed children.  My 7 year old wears hers to school pretty frequently."
5.0,Pretty cool top. Love the mixture of the colors on this top and the details.
5.0,They are great look great and fit great and my toddler loves them
5.0,"Been using for 5 months everyday and no creases or sign of wear so far which  I usually see in the traditional belts from consistently pulling and bending.  I love that I can quickly adjust the belt at meetings and in rooms full  of people without anyone noticing or making  it look awkward.  You're probably thinking why  would you do that anyway.  Well , when you sit down after lunch  sometimes it gets a little uncomfortable.  The design of this belt makes it so you can adjust without making you look like you're going to pull your pants off in front of everyone.  Once u get the hang of it only one hand can release the tension.  Obviously you're going to need 2 hands to remove it completely off or readjust but with some practice I'm sure you can do it with one hand."
5.0,Quality bathing suit! Fits great and I love it!
5.0,"This ring was beautiful, I gave it to my daughter and she loved it! Not cheap looking and she wears it all the time!!"
5.0,Very comfortable boots plus stylish and cute!
5.0,"I buy these to sleep in. I have two pairs so that I never have to sleep without them. Better than boxers and even better than sleeping in the the nude! No joke, try it one night as you'll be hooked."
5.0,Works well :) it's for the moto 360 1st gen
5.0,She loves the pin’s more than me
5.0,It fits good. Feels good and never comes off. Not a waste at all.
5.0,Got them for a present he liked um alot
5.0,"My son wears 1.5, but I figured I would go for size 2. I compared the size to his other asics size 1.5, and it's exactly the same. It's my son's most comfortable shoes, and really his favorite, so i'm keeping it."
5.0,These socks are comfortable and true to color.
5.0,This made my mother-in-law cry. I gave it to her at the rehearsal dinner before the wedding.
5.0,Just what I wanted and fast shipping.
5.0,It is amazing! My husband uses it daily and he has no problems with zipper. It has been already 5 months from the purchase. Very satisfied with the product.
5.0,They are really easy to put on and take off...
5.0,"I'm not able to have my ears pierced, so I'm constantly on the lookout for earrings that have a pierced look.  In a hoop earring, the spring clip is the way to go.  This earring is beautiful, can be worn dressy or casual, and absolutely looks like a pierced earring.  This 2-inch size looks good.  I wore them all day in complete comfort, but I will admit that by the end of the day I was ready to take them off.  For me this would be true of almost all clip earrings.  I liked them a lot and would definitely recommend them to women who don't or can't have pierced ears."
5.0,Soft and perfect xmas gift !
5.0,Adorable shoes. My niece loves them and so do her friends!
5.0,"This fan is beautiful and for the money, well worth it!"
5.0,"I wanted a compact cross-body bag that had a space for everything at an affordable price - and non-leather! - and I finally found it. This bag is really cute, and has convenient pockets just how I want them. A zippered coin purse? Yup! Slots for credit cards and my license? Of course! An outer pocket I can slip my cell phone in and out easily? Check! Big enough compartment for my eyeglass case and checkbook? Yes, that too. And yet it's still light, small and stylish enough for my tastes. Will buy this brand again should I ever need another bag, but based on how solidly made this bag is, I think it will be awhile. A long while."
5.0,"The high low is cute, its not a short crop-my daughter has a short waist and this hits just above her jeans---thank you. 16 year old girl loves it"
5.0,"I bought these for a Kurt Cobain Halloween costume. I was actually blown away by the quality and the included sunglasses bag, wipe, and screwdriver. For the price I paid I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the packaging and how well-made these sunglasses are. I would definitely purchase products from this brand again!"
5.0,"I really, really love these slippers. When I get up at night they light up a few feet around me and I can see where I am going. They turn themselves off when the light is turned on. I am getting a pair for my husband. Mine are a little larger because I sized up when I bought them. I will buy my size the next time. I only use these at night for the purpose that I bought them. Before I lay down at night I put these slippers in place so that when I get up in the dark they are there to light up my path."
5.0,"I bought these socks for cycling, which I do in the warm Georgia weather, and they've served that purpose very well.  I imagine they would work great for hiking as well unless you prefer substantial padding in your sock."
5.0,I bought the 8-9B (M) US size and my feet usually fit the 8 1/2 size shoe. Thsee house slippers are slightly big for me but that doesn't bother me and they are so fluffy and comfortable plus I just love the bright blue!
5.0,This is really beautiful. It seems to be holding up well. I was concerned with the thinness of the chain but so far no issues.
5.0,"I'm 5'9, 170 lbs  curvy, and the medium fit perfectly.  I fit between US size 8/10. I really love the fact that it hides all the lumps and bumps. I'm not a fan of the pockets as I am already curvey and the pockets add unnecessary inches to my hips.  Overall, beautiful and would purchase again."
5.0,True to size and exactly as pictured. Love it!
5.0,"Beautiful shirt , high quality."
5.0,The hand of the fabric is great. Stitched well.
5.0,"Fantastic and rugged well engineered design that functions as briefcase, satchel and field bag under worst conditions and all types of weathet. Excellent buy."
5.0,So beautiful for the price !!
5.0,This is a perfect fit and comfortable.
5.0,Bought this for a New Year’s Eve party everyone loved it! Only problem is that it kept riding up at the shoulders. Material is stretchy and easy to move around in.
5.0,"The head is more red than pink - but I love them! Comfortable! I have sensitive ears, but no problems with these!!"
5.0,This watch is exactly what i was expecting. Its all real metal an the leather as well.Came in with the minute hand lose at first then i dont know what i did to fix it but now when i try to fix the minute hand from being 10 min behind it wont go but im sure that its really fixable an ill figure it out soon. But this watch is really nice looking. Get it while its cheap.<br /><br />(so part from what i said that i didnt know how to fix it will i was just an idiot an didnt realize i had to pull the little nob on the sid to fix that problem so that watch was perfectly fine)
5.0,Nice shirt quality for the price....delivered sooner than expected...ordered one more

5.0,Super cute and works great. I love it!
5.0,Very soft and cozy to get in after a bath or shower
5.0,"Really comfortable to wear. I was a little concerned it would be pinchy because of the gap, but it’s perfect. I don’t normally wear jewelry to bed because, but I forgot I had it on and fell asleep with it on. It’s a nice weight and feels sturdy"
5.0,Thank you for honoring we veterans with an honoriery hat.
5.0,I love that's it's oversized a bit...but I'm into boho..so it's perfect for me...very comfortable and my go to dress to put on..( I bought the black)..
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:1ac16edf830a48fc96330e3a971cfdba]] I stop given reviews on Amazon, but I had to leave a review on this nursing head cover, it is gorgeous, very soft, beautiful colors, looks better in real life than on the site. I love the draw string on the end in the opening, there are two openings, where you can totally cover your hair or leave it hanging out; the inside material is a soft white. I wish in came in more colors and designs, where I can match it with my scrubs. I don’t plan on using it as a mouth cover. I may order another as a mouth cover to have as a matching set."
5.0,I have not yet used my D&D money belt but I am very pleased with the product at this time and I am looking forward to using it on my upcoming trip.
5.0,Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES this belt! This is his first ratchet type belt and I don’t think he is ever going back. We will see how it holds up in the next few months but as of now he is very happy!
5.0,"I SO LOVE these! .. I first saw these In the hospital. The grippies (on BOTH sides) are great and greatly reduce the risk of falling. I will have these on hand FOREVER. POSEY's are the BOMB! :) Only wish more of these colors shown were avail instead of just the yellow, but I'll gladly take just the one color!!!!!!"
5.0,For those who believe that masks do more harm than good.
5.0,Awesome. Great milk catchers.
5.0,"This band has worked as I expected, had a little difficulty inserting into my motto 360, with a little patience I got it in. This was about a month ago, so far, no problems."
5.0,Love these shirts. They feel wonderfully soft on and cool in summer and nice for a Fl winter golfing. They wear well and wash and hang to dry. All styles have the great IBKUL style and material
5.0,Warm and soft with two weeks infrequent use.  Very nice.
5.0,Beautiful owl it was a gift for my mom on Christmas she loves owls so she loved it.i also fell in love with it too so in the future I will get one for myself .
5.0,These are SO pretty in person & they were perfect to wear at Disney.
5.0,"simple, plain, black hoodie - so great to wear everywhere. great quality."
5.0,Good and beautiful...
5.0,Purchased these after having surgery because I needed something that wasn't tight or binding.  These work great and give a decent appearance.
5.0,Love this headband!
5.0,Love these electronic massage sandals.  Work well with TENS unit we already own. Helps my husband's neuropathy from diabetes plus gives a nice foot massage!  Thanks for a great product.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9645933526f90f4a4373fee8016a6b12]] With two toddlers and a third on the way my day to day bag has evolved from day one. Big diaper bags are unnecessary and cumbersome. I have two bag types set up with my every day essentials that are easy to swap. Some days i use a smaller cross-body fanny pack. (Yes i use a fanny pack don’t judge, its more practical for store outings and easier to reach if my hands are limited.) I use a small backpack for playground/hike trips and longer outings. This bag is such a nice upgrade from the previous backpack i was using. I absolutely love all the pockets for keeping me organized and able to easily find exactly what i need."
5.0,SO SOFT-LIFE IS GOOD T-SHIRTS ARE THE BEST. WILL ORDER MORE SOON.
5.0,Even though I’m older I am taking this to Hawaii with me because it is loose and  it seems like it  would be so  comfortable
5.0,"In the jewelry I make, I’m very particular in the quality of the products I buy. The charms did not have edges or imperfections."
5.0,Por el precio este traje es hermoso y súper cómodo vale la pena comprarlo
5.0,"I love this case. It's sturdy, does its job, plus it's really cute. I love the colors and the print."
5.0,Comfy and cute. Good buy
5.0,Like the print and design. Comfortable and soft for my son.
5.0,Beautiful top! It fits great. Thought it was a four pack but it’s not.
5.0,"Often when I see Easter Bunny costumes they fall squarely in the uncanny valley. There is just something unnerving about the eyes of facial expression. An underlying feeling of malice behind the eyes. Well this costume has none of that. It’s just really cute, as I feel the Easter Bunny should be. This also was one of the easiest Inflatable Costumes for me to put on, and I didn’t really feel like I was going to suffocate so much. The whole dual sided zipper makes a world of difference. It is pretty easy to see through the mouth. The suit itself seems to have been designed for the wearer to wear sneakers underneath, which I did not do when I tested it out. The spaciousness of the suit creates a disconnect of sort where it feels more like you are puppeteering it than wearing it in the traditional set. Either way I would highly recommend it to parents looking to spark a bit of that Easter joy in their kids. I myself got this suit with the intention of using it way down the line when I am a dad. Overall it’s a great product."
5.0,I loved it. Just right size and it came fast. Good service
5.0,"My granddaughter LOVES THIS!  It fits her head so well, seems made for a child's size head.  Gave it to her for her 5th birthday. I'm sure it will fit until she's at least 7 or 8."
5.0,I received no complaints.
5.0,This is the most comfortable bra .
5.0,Sexy and classy !
5.0,It was a gift and loved!
5.0,This tunic dress fits as expected and pictured. I am 5&#34;4 and it sits just above my knees. Slight flair at the bottom allows for a comfortable wear all day long.
5.0,"Sooo cute! But just a forewarning, this is NOT RED! Luckily, I didn't want red.. it looked to be more pink in the picture so I risked it. But it is legit fluorescent hot pink! I think it's beautiful so I don't mind one bit. I ordered a Large, I'm 5'4&#34; 130lb and it fits perfect. It's so cute and summery, great for my Jamaica vacation! Material is very lightweight and soft!"
5.0,Nice watch. The owner is perfect. For the price this will be the best you can have. Used it for couple days. Everything is great.
5.0,these are great and durable
5.0,I absolutely love this ring!
5.0,It’s very pretty necklace. It was nice to hear from them that they will improve the packaging this July.
5.0,very comfortable shoes
5.0,HUSBAND LOVED...BUT TOO CLOSE TO FACE...SWEAT EASY..
5.0,Buenísimos. Y tienen ese pequeño paño por la zona del pulgar ora la transpiración<br />Lo único que no me gusta es que el logotipo de la marca resalta mucho.
5.0,A gift for a family member who’s been musical inspiration for the rest of us to enjoy. These are very sturdy and perfect for a display. They are exact replica of the original instrument.
5.0,It’s so comfortable got a lot of compliments wearing it. I dressed it up with a bl
5.0,Love the color and the name and birthstones was lovely
5.0,Very nice for the price. It was made well and heavy. I would purchase another if I needed it
5.0,"It was perfect at the beach!  It was a little windy and cool at a northern CA beach, and it kept me warm!"
5.0,These charms were cute
5.0,these are just so colorful . Not to long just the right length. I kept 3 for myself and gave the other 6 prs as gifts my friends loved them right on trend.
5.0,"This is a very high quality product and it was a great bargain with Amazon's Christmas deals.  3 options for outside color choices, black, gray and a black pattern.  It even comes with replacement screws, not in a little plastic baggy but in a metal container with a screw on lid. It also includes a screwdriver.  The screw holes are recessed.  The details on this are amazing!  This was a very classy Christmas gift."
5.0,I absolutely love this wallet. Great quality for what I paid.
5.0,Nice well made T-shirt. Not a thin crappy tee but still comfortable.
5.0,Great quality at a great price. Dress surpassed my expectation. Daughter was very happy. She received many compliments
5.0,Love the material. I’m in the south so it gets hot have to have my mouth covered due to the current situation#Corona. Perfect size shape and breath ability to be in public. Soaked in cold water for 24 hours and there are some loose ends on the stitching but all in all pretty good quality.  Can’t find masks so will buy more for sure
5.0,"I was very nervous about ordering this because you really never know how it will fit. 100% pleased with this dress.  I am approximately 5ft5in and 150lbs and the medium is perfect.  I'd classify myself as athletically curvy ( yes, I made it up lol)<br />I bought it in pink, burgundy, blue and purple. The blue is definitely my favorite! It's so bright and exactly what I wanted. Burgundy is always a favorite color of mine too. The pink is soft and niceee for a spring wedding or formal. The purple is nice, however, the color is definitely more of a fuchsia.<br />Overall extremely happy with the purchase. Waiting for the black and green to go back in stock to order them as well."
5.0,My girl love it . Exactly like described .
5.0,"I cannot attest to the protective quality, probably as much as any mass produced novelty mask on the market. This was purchased as a stocking stuffer for avid Hanson; she was thrilled with it. She especially liked the vintage graphic."
5.0,"This shirt is hella cute, comfy and the material really hangs nicely. It accentuates the nice parts."
5.0,Love these shoes. They are comfortable and the feel is amazing. My only issue is the shoe is hard to get on due to the shoes having no tongue but a sock. You must break them in and stretch out the shoe so they become easier to put on. Breaking in does't take long I was already breaking them in by the second time I wore them. They are awesome if you play street football. One of the best pair out there for futsal or street.
5.0,warm in winter .
5.0,"I was kinda nervous about ordering this outfit being that there were absolutely no reviews, but I took a chance and omg I love everything about this outfit…. I ordered an xl and I’m 190lbs, so order it u won’t be disappointed"
5.0,Travel a lot and needed something that would separate mine from everyone else'.  This does it
5.0,"Little smaller than expected but actually Like the size and the style, perfect!"
5.0,My daughter loves these goggles! She said they don’t fog up and they don’t get tangled in her hair. Worth the money!
5.0,"Bought for my fiancé to take to her new job where she is required to carry her own laptop and personal belongings. Fit her MacBook perfectly, along with a planner, notebook, chargers, and personal belongings. It seems very sturdy, but she has only used it for one day so far. Definitely worth the price!"
5.0,muy bonitos para el verano
5.0,"These packing cubes make traveling so much easier! We use them on every trip we go on. Last year we went to thailand, where we bought way more than could actually fit in our luggages. We used these packing cubes and it helped keep everything organized so it made our limited space more efficient! If you havent used packing cubes yet, you need to! Theyre amazing."
5.0,This product was well worth it!!!! Great quality and perfect size!! I was worried because I have a 2 year old that is tiny ..... It fit her perfectly!! I would recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!
5.0,Great product with fast shipping!
5.0,Very good quality chain. I've bought cheaper chains before and regretted it. This chain is exactly the quality I've needed.
5.0,Awesome sunglasses. Great price.
5.0,Arrived much faster than I anticipated -- which is a good thing considering I ordered them exactly a week before the event I actually needed them for. They're exactly like the picture. Completely opaque and just as bright. I love them!
5.0,Wore it everyday for about 3 months.  The color peeled off of the band guard & started peeling off the band itself.  I ended up ordering a cloth stretch band & LOVE IT MORE
5.0,Fast shipping and just as described.  Absolutely love these earrings.
5.0,"Great fit.  True to size.  Absolute essential for his wardrobe.  Worn year round.  Great layering piece.  Goes from summer right to fall.  Washes up well.  Seams are serged and stitched with a hem, which makes them durable both to boys and multiple trips through the wash.  Awesome color selection.  This 5 pack is kind of a no-brainer as far as quality & price if you’ve got a kid that seems to grow a few inches between breakfast and dinner!!  LOVE these!!"
5.0,"I felt so cute in this, It fits my body like a glove. I have a xxl and it fits true to size. I'm 5'9 and it hits the top of my ankle so I would recommend wearing a heel."
5.0,LOVE THE COLOR AND FIT FOR MY BROTHER
5.0,"Love the color just as pictured, nice fit, very comfortable and perfect coverage for mid section and bum bum. I’m 5’11 145 lbs mostly legs, “long tall Sally” minimal hips and butt, average breast. I will be ordering more for next summer."
5.0,I loved this! I can wear it to work and that’s awesome!
5.0,Great case that is very well made. However the Pelitor behind the head ear muffs fit in the case like a round peg in a square hole.
5.0,"I am absolutely in love with this product, this necklace is amazing and beautiful. It means a lot to me, a reminder of my father. He was a retired firefighter and my hero!"
5.0,"I’m loving these readers. I have lots of other pairs, but these are my go to readers for at home casual wear. They are lightweight for the size of the frame, and so cute. I’m glad I got them."
5.0,Great summer tank! Soft and flattering. Easy to wear and easy to wash. Love it so much I ordered it in another color and plan to order at least one more
5.0,It fit as expected - good shirt!
5.0,very beautiful crystal ring and the fact that it is silver is even better
5.0,"My teen daughter and I travel for her modeling gig from time to time and on our last trip to New York her first, second, and third stops were to the BT21 store.  Needless to say, she's a HUGE BTS fan.  I didn't see these at the BT21 store last time we were there so I decided to get these from Amazon as a Christmas present.  They are true to size and ""cute"", as everyone always says when she wears them out in public.  She's only had them for a couple of weeks now but she uses them just about every day and they seem to be well made.  Will update review if anything changes."
5.0,These are very nice shoes
5.0,"Buying on amazon can be a risk when it comes to clothing, but this dress was spot on fit, and style wise. it's also a very nice material that's a little dressier, so looks like a higher quality dress than what it is. Only issue was the length was kind of weird. I'm 5'6"" and it hits about right above the ankle bone, so it isn't a maxi, and too long to be a midi. I will likely hem mine."
5.0,"When my purchase arrived, I was indeed happy that I purchased, please do not be fooled by the price on any level..these glasses look very expensive and definitely make a statement. I even reordered a second set to make sure I,m always have extras..extremely well made, and very comfortable on the face..It,s like the spring hinge mechanism readily adjusts to your face. absolutely nowhere in the retail market can you find such an awesome quality deal; i get compliments consistently, telling people, I got them from some fancy high-end store. that,s my story and, i am sticking to hit"
5.0,best support I have found
5.0,I always know that anything we purchase from Lands End is going to be good quality and fit.  This jacket was just what I was looking for.  If it is raining and the temperature is in the 50s (or even 40s) up to the low 60s it will keep you warm but not hot.  I also like the fact the sleeves aren't thermal lined.  It is just a good<br />jacket that I am so pleased with.
5.0,Love it! Perfect size .
5.0,I wash my hands a lot at work and throughout the day and wanted to have one that wont move around as much at the end where it supposed to close and since this one is close around is perfect.
5.0,Love these! Easy to put on and wear all day! Comfortable and a beautiful accessory.
5.0,A little long than what I am used to but they are great
5.0,Gift for daughter who is expecting. She loves it and it can work now and when she is not pregnant. Thank
5.0,My daughter loved it and how soft it is.
5.0,Ordered it in a medium had to return for a small. Love the look and fit of it.
5.0,These are cute Minnie Mouse shirts. My granddaughter loves them!!!
5.0,Love these earrings! Very happy!
5.0,"Good value and soft fabric. Nice lace and soft white color.  Purchased small for a 5', 110lb and it was a perfect fit."
5.0,Great pants. Comfy!
5.0,Buenas la chaqueta no me quedo muy pequeña el pantalón si como haría porfavor
5.0,"The linen shorts are comfy, casual, and fit as expected. I’d buy another pair."
5.0,"Super cute and comfy, the pockets also make it awesome !"
5.0,"Fantastic socks. Fits my husband great. Not the highest quality, but lasts a decent amount of time."
5.0,"Ok so I just got these  because it’s hard for me to drive at night these days and I am completely in love with these and can’t wait to see how they help at night.  Not only are they solid they are totally stylish and the packaging alone is impressive with the box then the case and another sock case along with a cleaning cloth. This has got to be one of the best purchases I’ve made in a long time and no, I am not being paid whatsoever I’m being completely honest about this review now if I can get these in reading glass form I would be in heaven"
5.0,This ring is beautiful! I can't believe how inexpensive it is. I Love it!!!
5.0,Just as cute as the photos 👍
5.0,"I can't speak for the other reviewers, as I'm a shorty, but this fits perfectly. I'm 4'11, 105 lbs. and a steady size small. Based on reviews I went for a medium. Honestly, a small would have been just fine but the medium works well too. I just get a more &quot;oversized&quot; sweater effect. Fine by me."
5.0,The best wallet I've ever owned!
5.0,OUTSTANDING!
5.0,im a 38 dddd and fit wonderful
5.0,This product was amazing. I am a huge Pokemon fan and these where designed perfectly. I plan to buy all the others soon enough!
5.0,The dress is exactly as described. Cute with or without the belt.
5.0,Excellence.
5.0,Nice quality material. Fits well although I think they run large. I'm a size 8 in pants and the M (blue) fit but was unsupportive up top. Cut too low. The S (pink) fit better and felt more supportive and secure up top.
5.0,Love these earrings. They are not overly heavy and look great. Seller provided great customer service when I needed it.
5.0,These are super soft and warm. Nice texture on the exterior of the leggings as well. I am very tall (6'1'') and they are more generous than average in length.
5.0,Bought this for my wife and it looks great on her! Very soft and comfy (she says). Will buy more!
5.0,dont know how its nice havent got the bag yet but i love the wokfes on the bag
5.0,Love these I bought 3 more to wear. Many compliments.
5.0,"EXCELLENT PROMPT QUICK DELIVERY!!!! THIS RING IS DAINTY AND ELEGANT AND A GREAT ADDITION TO ANY ENGAGEMENT RING AS A WEDDING BAND OR TO WEAR ALONE!!! SPARLKE AND BLING ARE MY THING AND THIS ONE IS DEFINETLY A KEEPER!!!!!!! THANK YOU LUSTERFOREVER, I WILL DEFINETLY BE BACK!!!!! FOR ALL OF YOU OUT THERE I HOPE THIS RING RETURNS TO STOCK FOR YOU TO ORDER!!!!!!"
5.0,Fit as expected.  I could have gone smaller for that tighter fit. Lots if compliments.
5.0,The clip holds bills together as expected. The number of bills it can control is amazing. Enough closing strength to hold bills efficiently.
5.0,UPDATE: recipient couldn’t wear the earrings for more than an hour before her ears had a bad reaction to the metal and were red and hot.<br /><br />Gorgeous! I have the Kendra Scott abalone earrings and bought these to compare. They’re beautiful! Great purchase. Will definitely be gifting them to someone. Pen in photo for size comparison.
5.0,I've tried many styles of Frye boots and had no luck with fit and looks. Finally! These are the best!!!!  Love them!!
5.0,"I love these pants, I paired them with a top from Maysike and they look like a set of expensive dress suit."
5.0,wear an apron when ever I'm in the kitchen or doing anything I may ruin my clothes. I like this apron because it's very durable and the material washes up great. Would buy again and will be buying more
5.0,They look really nice just seemed to be bigger in the picture then once you receive them they are really tiny.
5.0,"Got this for my 40th birthday party , it's an 80s theme. I absolutely love it. The bracelets were big for my wrist as I am very petite so I'll use them as favors or for the photo booth dress up. The tutu will need to air out because it had a fishy smell. It came fast and it was great quality. Everything was just so perfect, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I love these pants! Very comfortable, the pockets are great and they look professional."
5.0,"Comfy!!!!<br /><br />Go from lounging to riding without changing. These are so comfy. They run large though,<br /> In my opinion, size down.  Not sure these will fit inside tall boots if yours are tight.<br /><br /> I usually wear a sz 2 or 26 in most pants with stretch. This size 26 gave me lots of room in the waist, which I dont like bc then the waist starts to fall throughout the day. FYI, the tag says 38/26. But then the inside tag says GB12 US8, which doesnt sound right at all, not sure why they are sized that way.  They fit just like the Horze active full seat breeches in the same size.<br />They have a 27in inseam on the size 38/26."
5.0,This tank is absolutely perfect! I ordered the black in size small. You can wear it down or you can tie it on the side and dress it up. Super cute! Wish it came in ALL colors. A+++ TANK! BUY IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.  ♡
5.0,"Very comfortable blouse.  I am very pleased with the quality, especially for the price!!"
5.0,I love this scarf.  It's very warm and so decorative.  I wish I would've taken a picture of it.  Very thick and expensive looking.  You can't go wrong with the price.
5.0,grateful
5.0,I'm not a big fan of wearing masks have worn quite a few trying to find the right ones this beats them all for Comfort very comfortable easy to use and with glasses and there is no fogging
5.0,Too CUTE‼️
5.0,Wife loved the oral pleasure very much. But It is big in mouth and felt funny if i closed my mouth to swallow
5.0,This dress was amazing! Any plans on bringing it back? I want it in the other 3 colors.
5.0,Love IT! Absolutely beautiful. everything  looked great on the bag.I can't wait to use it.The Home Show Hostess sent message that it was sent. so fast...
5.0,Great design and good materials.  Satisfied.
5.0,Fits perfectly has pockets is exactly as described length is just right love it!
5.0,"I love this neck gaiter! It is very soft to the touch as well as lightweight and breathable... as advertised.<br />I like it so much, I order another one for my wife. This is going to be my new goto for my face covering needs."
5.0,My wife has a need for this type of hat.  She has this type with many designs and colors.
5.0,Keeps the feet warm! Great buy!
5.0,"Fits as described with all seems well-hemmed and no stray strings upon arrival! The material is fairly soft, which makes this a comfortable shirt to wear both around the house and out, perhaps with an open shirt overtop. It made both my brother and my dad laugh when they read what it said, and so far it's stood up to wear. A solid t-shirt that's worth the buy and seems like it will last! I'd rec it."
5.0,"Just received these today, quick delivery. These feel very high-quality for the price and are pretty comfortable. I'll be purchasing more pairs of SojoS."
5.0,This is super cute! Its very comfy and even has pockets! But there was a string hanging from the seam. Ither than that it was great
5.0,This item solved a real problem for us.  Our sheets never fit properly until we attached these clips.<br />Excellent value and quality.
5.0,Awesome bracelet which fits my thin wrist with room to spare using two of the snaps (I could use all three snaps but it would be snug and that's not how I want to wear this).  A friend of mine ordered his own and it fits his thick wrist with two snaps without issue as well.  The snaps hold the bracelet well and the overall construction looks very high quality and is made of nice materials.  I've had my bracelet about 2 months and had zero issues and lots of positive comments.
5.0,es lo que queria mi esposa
5.0,"It is warm,  exactly as shown, easy to adjust"
5.0,Nice as mentioned
5.0,"The material is thin which allows the cap to breathe more readily, as well as, fits snugly on your head."
5.0,I absolutely love cats.  I now have  3 pair of different cat earrings.  They are light and fun. I will wear them with summer casual.  Well made.
5.0,I've bought 2 they are warm and feel so soft they are not tight or uncomfortable around the neck I've bought other sweaters for $100.00 and they are junk compared to these!
5.0,Originally  ordered a large (I wear 12/14) and it was a little too close in the middle and i could see my panty line. I exchanged for the xl and it was much more comfortable and I wasn’t self conscious about my stomach. Paired the blue dress with pink heels and loved the look.
5.0,"This dress is beautiful but it runs a bit large. Also, the skirt fabric is sheer enough to need a petticoat. So, be sure to have a petticoat or buy one. I found a pink petticoat that was perfect for this dress at childrensalon.com. I bought a size two in the petticoat, as well."
5.0,"will likely have holes in them soon, but super comfy, fun and worth buying"
5.0,it fits get perder size and the best thing I like the fabric
5.0,Great product fit great
5.0,"very nice, as expected. not polarized but it blocks good sunlight. gets nose a little sweaty though"

5.0,We bought this for halloween. Perfect for what we needed them for!
5.0,A great find.  Beautiful in it's simplicity.  It also matches a bracelet and necklace that I own.  Comfortable to wear.  Nice and shiny.
5.0,This dress is very cute.  It is exactly as pictured and described.  It is also very comfortable.
5.0,"This dress is so comfy and flattering! The pockets are an awesome added bonus. It can be dressed up or down, and it is an appropriate length and modest enough neckline for me to keep wearing at work. Just make sure to undo the zipper before pulling it on! I didn’t realize there was a zipper when I tried it on the first time and I heard a few stitches snap while I squeezed my shoulders/chest through it (oops!). The dress still held up fine and I got many compliments."
5.0,Using this product for a trip to Ireland.
5.0,Bought it by accident but fell in love
5.0,"These were fantastic!!! We got them as gifts for my mom, she loved them so much! Good quality also."
5.0,These sandals have great arch support. My only wish is that the top band was a little snugger on my feet.
5.0,"Wore first one daily for 1 1/2 yrs. before needing new one. Very comfortable, soft, inexpensive, non irritating"
5.0,"I wear a size small usually- I initially ordered a medium because I read to size up.... I had to reorder a size small. It’s true to size. Good buy, very cute. Not a thick sweater, but I still really like it."
5.0,"Great thongs, good fit and easy to walk in."
5.0,Even though from china....bah hum bug......very soft and made well.....will try to find USA products next time.  Need to be clear where made!
5.0,I love it and  love the blue lens it so clear to see👍👍👍
5.0,"These are great! I immediately put them on, and they are so soft and feel supportive. That will help with circulation too! The are breathable in the right places, and I am so glad that I got these! They are going to be great for working long hours on my feet!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount rate to provide an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,These pants fit like a glove. Couldn't love them more. I think they are my favorites at this time in my wardrobe. Very nice and so comfortable.
5.0,like the way it keeps its shape after washing
5.0,I really liked these.  I’ve bought some before that were so small you couldn’t see the color on the crystal.  Great selection in the package .
5.0,Love bag very comfortable great for traveling
5.0,"We always keep reader glasses throughout the house and these are a great addition! Correct strength and comfortable! Nice packaging, each pair comes in their own bag!"
5.0,"I love this ring! It looks exactly like it is pictured, and doesn't feel cheap or lightweight. It does feel a bit large for the size, but I'd rather have that than too small."
5.0,Cropped them easily by scissors and lighter.
5.0,My daughters 6th birthday! It was real cute
5.0,I gave these charms to my tennis girls and they loved them! They're super cute on necklaces or charm bracelets.
5.0,Bought it as a gift and my sister said that it was really nice quality
5.0,"Very comfortable,  stylish"
5.0,Absolutely ♥️♥️♥️
5.0,The quality for the price is very good. It's not too bulky and it is comfortable per my lady... but still has good space and useful compartments got a second one in black after the first one in grape for a Christmas present.
5.0,I'm really happy with this shirt!  The material is so soft and it fits really nicely.  It's supposed to be loose-fitting but I still find it flattering.  I am pretty short waisted so the back of the shirt pretty much completely covers my rear but the front hits at about the hip level.  This might not be the case for someone who has a longer torso.
5.0,Out of all the dresses I bought in the website this was my favorite. Fit perfect
5.0,"Once I found this watch on the wrist of my friend From Detroit, I fell in love with it, but could not bought one for myself because of the high price.<br />The first time I made the decision Several years ago, I needed to send it back as I was sent a defective item and not even a new, one though stated as new.<br />So this time is practically a dream come true experience."
5.0,"Love the style, the somewhat soft feel of the denim, love the big back pockets, as well as the cargo pockets just above the cuffs. The back pockets even have small velcro pockets in front of them. Both back pockets can fit two 20 oz. drinks in each one. I wouldn't have anything too fragile in the low cargo pockets though, as they flop around when you walk. They're the first jeans I've worn in years that I needed a belt for, but the waist is only a little bigger than most pants I have of the same waist size.<br /><br />Love wearing these on weekends! :P"
5.0,Fun pj shorts
5.0,"Love it! It's just what I was looking for. Not too big, not too small! Perfect to wear for everyday. Thanks so much! Rate seller A+++ Fast shipping!"
5.0,This dress fit perfect! I order an XL & it fit just right!
5.0,I bought this dress to wear to my son’s HS graduation. I was nervous purchasing a dress online due to past negative experiences. This dress was absolutely perfect. I think I’m going to purchase one with sleeves to have another option.
5.0,Actual joggers not like others that are very thin. Fit good and keep you warm.
5.0,This necklace was a Great Value for the Money!!  It was exactly the look that I was going for (like the Jcrew one).
5.0,Perfect size and quality for my son!  Arrived quickly.
5.0,I wear a size 11 and these fit and look great
5.0,This ran true to size and the material is comfortable no complaints.
5.0,It was amazing and my mother loved getting it for her birthday great purse Thankyou
5.0,These are comfortable enough I have forgotten to switch back to my original garmin band.  My watch is only off for charging and I find these bands to me comfortable and durable for 24x7x365 use.
5.0,Need 2 sizes larger
5.0,Awesome tank! Soft and super cute!!! Runs a little big. But I like oversized tanks.
5.0,Perfect for da my to day and my motorcycle rides
5.0,"I bought size xlarge and the pants fit great but the top was a bit tight at first, however the longer I wore it loosened up a little more.  All in all though I love lunachi sleepwear. I love the feel and the designs and frankly if I’m not going out I wear them all day!  I even bought several in each color that was available so when one wears out I have a new one waiting. Crazy I know but I love them ❤️"
5.0,This tank top is so soft and fits me perfect.
5.0,"Love Jostar the best travel clothes. Get ready for complements, about your outfits. Comfortable, great colors and styles"
5.0,Very nice quality and looks just as pictured. No complaints.
5.0,"UPDATE:<br />2 months and counting! Still no problems, not hard to get off after they’ve been untouched for weeks. Easy to clean around. Still just as bright as when I first bought them.<br />I’m not sensitive to much or allergic to much so I wouldn’t have a reaction to any metals but figured I should put it in here. They don’t cause any irritation.<br />I keep these in my ear lobe piercings BUT I think I’m gonna get one more set for a set of three cartilage piercings I want on my ear that doesn’t have an industrial.<br />*photo with industrial piercing is the first one I took right after I received my first order. Photo of my other ear is 2 months later*<br /><br />Had them for just a couple days and I already love them! I bought 2 sets of 3 pieces for my ear lobe piercings since I never wear earrings or never care to change them out. They are only the second set I’ve tried but one fail was enough for me! So far these have been through the shower and 2 nights of sleep and haven’t even come loose. The opal shine and color is so bright and apparent! I have a stainless steel industrial with blue opals on the ends so I’m VERY happy that the labrets with blue opal match perfectly.<br /><br />If I don’t update my review, it’s likely I just forgot to because I haven’t had any problems with the product bought.<br /><br />Enjoy your new jewelry! I certainly love mine."
5.0,I need another one
5.0,"i felt the energy just flowing out of this beautiful crystal !  highly recommend !! the craftsmanship was just amazing, not cheap feeling or flimsy. great product with a great price. i will definitely be buying from this person again !!!"
5.0,The wallet was everything I was looking for.
5.0,"They are sort of thin and are ankle socks not crew socks which was disappointing, but they grip well.<br /><br />Update (12/1) The company offered full refund because the socks did not meet my expectations even though I wore 2 pairs. Amazing customer service! I would definitely buy from this company again.  I give the company 5 Stars."
5.0,This is very nice watch. The price is fully $60 less than on swatch site. The watch is attractive with clear dial and very nice and sturdy rubber- not plastic band. This a beautiful casual watch it is also water proof  I am most pleased
5.0,"Everything I thought it would be. Great colors, has not gotten dirty yet."
5.0,Purchased a xl. I wear a 12/14 with 38dd bra. Fit perfect. Looks great.
5.0,The earrings came in one day! They are very light weight and a really good size. Love these!
5.0,"Can see the design from the inside in direct sunlight, but they were perfect for the 4th. Design is still there. And thats after leaving them out for a few days because they got misplaced during the 4th of July party. Pretty tough for the price, I'd definitely recommend."
5.0,Beautiful dress color pink so cute and comfortable thanks!!

5.0,Perfect for my son's glasses. He's constantly breaking the cases I buy at the eye doctors office. It's easy for him to use as well!
5.0,I found they weren't too manly .  Fit well over my prescription glasses. I also by the kids frames cuz I feel they fit my face better. I was pleased with them.
5.0,"These earrings add an exotic flair to any look. They even have a bit of sparkle when they catch the light. The backs are a little on the delicate side, but that's to be expected with costume jewelry. Check out the other offerings from this brand. They make good costume jewelry.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,Wife loves the style of them also the material there made of also they are not see through either like a lot of the reviews that has been written. Definitely will be getting her more in other colors 👍
5.0,Soft material looks great ! Arrived fast bought a XL
5.0,Good quality and SUPER fast shipping. I order one more batch right before my LO's bday party they came just in time...literally as I was walking out of the door for the party. Need more Minnie options - those went super fast - at least 5 more in this pack should do it.
5.0,"This was the perfect solution to our problem! My son has an LG Gizmo Gadget smart watch,  and the clasp broke after a month ( a common problem it seems). They have a new version of the watch,  so don't have any replacement parts (TERRIBLE customer service!) for this version.  Thankfully,  this clasp was available,  and at such a reasonable price! Now I'm not worried the watch will fall off.,"
5.0,This is an amazing body harness! The only thing I had an issue with was that the leg holes were a little tight but my bum is a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body so that was expected. I love how this has adjustable straps and was very thankful that the pieces were tied together upon arrival so that I could sort out what went where without having too much trouble. I would definitely buy this again! Great value for the price as well!
5.0,Cute! I wear them for yoga and around the house. Love the floral pattern!

5.0,This dress is so comfortable and flowy! I love the fit and the length and how beautiful I feel in it.The chest part fit great and I love that I can loosen or tighten however I see fit. It’s comfortable and the fabric is soft so I know it won’t be to much for my beach vacation.
5.0,Buy one size larger unless you want to wait for them to stretch - which they will

5.0,You could  wear as a casual or more a more fancy outfits - depending on the rest of your clothes and accessories. Fit as normal for this brand.
5.0,Son says these are sooooo worth the money. He raves how well they fit and how his feet feel at the end of practice or a game. Glad we stepped up and spent the money!
5.0,Love the shirt not sure of the fit yet as it is a gift.
5.0,"They didn’t fit like I expected,but wasn’t to small. I’m please with them"
5.0,perfect springy pastel bangle
5.0,"Slightly oversized for me (5’3”), however I love the classy look! I will just shorten the length. Good quality, nice flowing fabric yet durable."
5.0,These are nice and roomy.  Feel good.  Fit well.  Wash up nicely.
5.0,My son loves his sweatshirt. He is 5’8 and 185 pounds and wears a size medium. Great Quality
5.0,Watch band was too short but I will reorder.
5.0,These fit my skinny tall 7 month old very well with room to grow. These are longer than previous version of carter‘s 12 month size.
5.0,They feel awesome and give me the mobility I was looking for.
5.0,They were beautiful! It was a gift for a friend
5.0,One of the better looking minimalist chronograph watches out there.
5.0,I gave this dress 5 stars because it was beautiful and zipper felt nice and lace and flare at bottom was super cute and sexy.  I did not keep because it was a little too tight for my liking and don't like my flabby arms right now. I am size 14 pants ans xl top and ordered the xl. It would zip but was very tight and not my kinda thing to be that tight. I did wear a spanxs underneath to help with smoothing out the mid section.Because of lace detail it hid those imperfections. I am size 14 bottoms and xl top 37C bra size. It was beautiful but just not what I'm use to. I wish they made XXl !
5.0,"LOVED this dress! It fit me well - probably wouldn't work as well for a small busted woman, the zipper may stick out a little in front, but I'm a DDD.  The bodice is lined and dress well sewn. The fabric is nice and heavy.  This would be perfect for an October day, but I did return it only because the day I need it, will be hot, and I found a different one of thinner fabric."
5.0,"Perfect workout shirt. Doesn’t ride up when you move around. Light weight and comfortable. I would not call them compression though, if you are specifically looking for compression I’d look elsewhere. 5’4 and 165ish lbs I got a medium and it fits perfectly."
5.0,"This is extremely pretty.  I was concerned.  However, it truly is stunning.  Love design and clasp."
5.0,"I received these earrings yesterday and although they are super cute, upon close inspection I noticed that a couple of the tiny rhinestones were already missing. I contacted customer service and they immediately shipped me a new pair free of charge! PAVOI's customer service is amazing and their products are extremely fashionable. I will definitely be ordering from them again!"
5.0,"Cute dress, fits a bit small as there is no stretch. Good quality"
5.0,Fabric is exactly what I wanted and the colors are so vibrant! The fit is great as well!
5.0,The product fits great and I like having the ability/option to wear the product above the nose or resting on the chin below your mouth.
5.0,Love them just fit a little small
5.0,"Took it out of the package and put it on.  The material is better then the 4 other faja's I have.  Love the strap across the girls.  It helps keep the side straps from cutting into your arms and....it really pushes them up and out!!  The looks I have gotten is crazy.  Here is the downside.  As I started out that I took it out of the package and put it on.. Well I was able to put it on the 4th row, or the tightest.  So I know it is limited in time of being good compression.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh between 148 and 150.  After my tummy tuck my waist is 29-30 inches and this is an xs.  I haven't seen an xxs or I would have ordered that since it says runs large.  Love it for today, but will not be too useful in a month or so."
5.0,Perfect for my skater
5.0,Love it! So figure flattering.
5.0,Excellent quality and excellent price..what more can I say
5.0,We got these as a small gift for new home owners and they loved them!
5.0,This is a large size purse very nice inside and out with zipper on back and  my cell phone fits in there perfect this is why I bought  the purse
5.0,I HONESTLY LOVE THE RING TO DEATH.
5.0,"Holds its shape after washing - perfect length and snugness.  I'm 5'5"" 130 and purchased a medium.  I want 5 more!"
5.0,"I am a short woman, just't under 5'4.  I do not wear heels anymore .. comfort is king!  I bought this dress at the last minute on a whim for a wedding weekend.  I ordered on Thursday, got the dress on Friday.  Left for the (away) wedding on Saturday, hadn't even tried it on.  Rehearsal dinner on Sunday comes along, I put this dress on and PERFECT!  I ordered a large.  I got many compliments on it and it was comfy but looked very nice.  The length was perfect on me, to the top of my shoes.  I'm not small, either, I wear a 14-16 dress normally.  It was in the 80's for this outdoor wedding and this dress wasn't too warm for the evening outdoor rehearsal dinner.  It's got a liner and the material on the outside is &#34;flowy&#34; .. very comfy.  Highly recommend.  If you are tall though, you might just want to anticipate a midi-length with comfort!"
5.0,"This is my second purchase of these sunglasses as I recently scratched the lens of my first pair. 😏 Very comfortable, well made,  and the polarized lenses are great for reducing glare and for IV protection. Highly recommend."
5.0,"These are nice, but run a bit small. Still very pleased with them. I'm a curvy chick, so legging can be challenging for me."
5.0,This is a great product. Fits nicely and works beautifully!!!
5.0,Gift for my boyfriend he likes them. The legs are a little on the short side.
5.0,fit as expected.  I think they look & feel great.
5.0,Very cute.  Nice.  Not too thin.  Covers well.
5.0,Love the fit and it has pockets!
5.0,The watch is so great and comfortable....And easy to see...
5.0,"Very good quality garment. Form fitting, the green stripe fabric is thicker than usual stretch fabric. Doesn’t wrinkle."
5.0,Great bag perfect size I love it and would by again.
5.0,"Great hat! It’s just as it appears, arrived in great shape."
5.0,"Love these!!! I've ordered tons of pairs of glasses from sojo, these are by far the best! The frame itself is durable and sturdy, these aren't flimsy at all and they are super cute"
5.0,"I love this, great costume for the price!"
5.0,Nice classic boxer.<br />Cannot beat cotton.
5.0,"Fast (next day) delivery, exact replacement, came with a good charge."
5.0,This scarf is beautiful. I love the embroidery and how delicate the scarf is. I plan on giving this as a gift and I think they will really like it. I’ll also be buying one for myself now.
5.0,"I'm always leery of online clothing, but this is one really nice shirt.  Fit like it was made for me. I'll buy again when I need another one."
5.0,"I am used to wearing brooches that are smaller than this, however, this is a very big but very beautiful brooch."
5.0,Great match to the tie Bogie wore in Casablanca.
5.0,LIKE THE COMFORT FOR AROUND THE HOUSE.
5.0,"This light is really bright. It has a button to adjust it. The battery door is a little difficult to close at first after all the batteries are added. But just a little nudging finally got it closed.  The huge selection of adapter rings is a plus.  Also can be placed on many FD lenses, when used with the FD to EOS macro adapter (no glass).  I love it because I have a lens that can set right on the subject and take pictures with depth of field, but blocks out almost all light.  I have always wanted this type of light. Works just as I had hoped.<br />Works as a flashlight too.  Took the dog out and wore it as a bracelet with the battery part in my pocket. Super bright for emergencies."
5.0,I wore these for my long flight to Vegas. I also wore them while walking around some days as I heard they help. I have small ankles but wide calves. These worked out perfectly. I would definitely buy them again.
5.0,My husband and I do a little traveling outside the United States. We know the importance of our passport. It is very expensive to get a passport so it's only natural to want to protect any investment or document as important as your passport. THIS IS THE PERFECT COVER!!  It's sturdy so it will keep you passport from folding. It's elegant design makes me feel proud to have it instead of the cheaper versions out there. It has big pockets so that you can keep your airline tickets as well. A MUST HAVE if you want your passport to look new 10 years from now when it expires.
5.0,"Awesome! great service, fast delivery, beautiful ring. better looking than pictures"
5.0,"Love these shoes, can be dressy or casual, very comfortable. I usually wear a size 7 1/2 in most shoes, a size 7 would have fit perfect."
5.0,"great fit, great colors and very soft. Have been through multiple washes now and still good."
5.0,It's beautiful and well-crafted
5.0,Just got it today and it was as expected. Great quality and very comfortable. Highly recommend.
5.0,These are beautiful! I need more! I never knew how much green and red/pink that I wore until I tried to match with these.
5.0,I love these watches their fun to collect I have all cool case lots of compliments anyone who likes watches should invest in these.me fiancé thinks im funny but  I let her ware it and now I have two green ones excellent job amazon keep main em ill buy em.
5.0,"This is a great hoodie. It is very oversized. It is lined with a good amount of fleece. It is nice and soft, no stiffness or scratchy seams. The front hand warmer pocket is awesome. It did not fade or shrink after washing and drying. Definitely a warm and comfortable hoodie."
5.0,This keychain is bigger than I thought it would be! Very cute
5.0,"Got lots of complements on this suit, and it feels perfectly comfortable.  Love wearing it."
5.0,I love this tank top! I love handstands so much so this was perfect for my upsidedown world. The fabric is soft and durable. The length of it is so perfect and fits my physique very nicely!<br />Thank you for creating such a fabulous tank top!<br />♡♡<br />Fits true to size I'm a medium through and through and this fit perfect!
5.0,"I liked the fact that it will cover and protect my ears nice and warm. The material on the outside appears to be water resistant,  but the fur underneath the hat feels soft and thick which should help me to keep warm and cozy this winter when the temperatures starts to drop."
5.0,"Beautiful, fit my 11 year old granddaughter, very bright colors and nicely made"
5.0,Perfectly warm and comfy
5.0,Extremely cute! I ordered this set for myself and my fiancé.
5.0,Great plug! I chipped mine after a few weeks but it is still usable. Very attractive looking!
5.0,Very nice Irish pocket prayer medallion.
5.0,It is so cute. I actually wore it and got complimented.
5.0,This is silver plated and the silver wears right off. I have purchased this bracelet 3xs because I love it.
5.0,"Great value, exactly as described."
5.0,I've been looking in the stores and could never find this as I could years ago.  The texture when hydrated is wonderful. I use it a lot.
5.0,muy buena cartera es representable para cual quier ocasion
5.0,Perfect fit shipped fast great quality
5.0,"I bought these in purple and when I came back to buy more colors, they were no longer available. I'm so sad! These are the perfect size for my almost 3 year old. She loves having different color frames - it helps encourage her to keep them on. If these ever come back in size 41, I will buy them in more colors. The 40s were a bit too small and the next size up was way too big."
5.0,Turned out awesome. Sweet and sentimental
5.0,Great colors and sizing was perfect!
5.0,Love how it fits; loose enough but also sits well around the waste.  Would recommend this!
5.0,Wear it everyday. ☺
5.0,It came in perfect condition!  I absolutely loved it. It came just as it said it would. Came in the correct time as well.
5.0,I have them in all colors i love them!!
5.0,Well made variety of Doctor Who themes charms. Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Pleased with the order
5.0,my favorite hat pin
5.0,Gorgeous and fast shipping
5.0,"just as described, shipped fast, color is good, and doesn't bleed"
5.0,"I ordered these goggles because I want to be able to casually see underwater in the rivers and lakes where I swim. I am not diving or doing anything competitive. I've used them in freshwater and thus far they don't fog up or leak.<br />These goggles are the perfect size, not huge like a dive mask, but not super small like swimming goggles, the field of view is large but the goggles still pack up small. They come with a nice hard plastic case. I hike with them and the weight is negligible. Good product over all."
5.0,Great value. My daughter wore these a lot & I was able to second hand them to my niece.
5.0,"I love them, keeps my hair out of my eyes while walking on my Treadmill desk with fans to keep me cool."
5.0,Why do socks need to be gendered? Bought these for my four-year-old boy and they work just fine
5.0,This was the perfect co-worker leaving gift. It was very nicely packaged in a velvet bag in a nice box. Really classy looking.
5.0,"I love these pants and plan on buying these in other patterns. They weren't see through at all and fit great. I do wish they came in a shorter Capri length (I'm barely 5 ft tall). I get lots of compliments at the gym when I wear these. I use them for yoga, Pilates, cardio dance, and weight training with no problems. I normally wear a size 10 so I bought a large and they were perfect."
5.0,My granddaughter loves the slippers. Perfect.
5.0,nice and comfortable. my son like it.
5.0,"This is absolutely adorable! The material is a little thinner than typical GK Leo’s, it’s more like a bathing suit that is unlined. I was worried it wouldn’t hold up in the wash but it has! I would definitely order again:) my toddler is 26 months and still has some baby fat, the sizing is true to size for her."
5.0,"I wore this dress today for my small wedding. It was very lovely, the material is very nice and was the perfect length.<br /><br />I am 6 feet tall and it fall a few inches above my knee. The only downside was the sleeves didn't go all the way down so I had to roll it quarter way. Otherwise, the dress is very luxurious!"
5.0,"Work great, elastic holds up well."
5.0,Lightning fast shipping!! Product as described.
5.0,"Beautiful dress well made. Too small especially in the bust. I ordered a medium and it was too small. I'm a size 10, 36 bust 29 waist and 38 hips. I'm 5 10.  So I would recommend ordering a larger size."
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this, the quality is GREAT!"
5.0,I sent this as a gift. A good find!! She loved it. Good price. Nice gift box
5.0,Can never go wrong with Lane Frost Brand merch.
5.0,"Compact, but roomy inside (yes, that's possible :-)  )  It's well made, the contents are easily accessible and the leather is beautiful."
5.0,Loved this dress! So comfortable and so gorg! Wore to a wedding in January and it gave enough coverage to be warm enough and still be cute! Highly recommend.
5.0,"Purple isn't as vibrant at the picture, but I think its better that way. It's a thick, nice quality beanie, and the shipping didn't take that long."
5.0,Took the ring off and made a necklace out of this and love it.
5.0,"This dress was ordered to be something to wear to work, although I would not wear it for that. The cut is a little low on me, and I would not feel comfortable thinking that my boobs were going to pop out all day. However, the dress is super comfortable and definitely good for date nights with my husband!"
5.0,It’s a beautiful watch. I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for a Christmas Gift
5.0,"I got these as summer PJs. I am 5'5&#34; 145 lbs wearing between a 6 and 8.  Fits a little snug in the bust, mostly because I am still nursing a baby.  The scoop neckline is a tad high, so I have to nurse baby from underneath, which I don't really prefer. Will be great when I am done nursing. The shorts are a soft comfortable knit cotton, not quite a flannel.  The shirt just covers the waistline and the armpits aren't cut too big so a nursing bra doesn't show.  They are comfortable PJs to sleep in. I haven't noticed the shorts riding up."
5.0,"Love this watch band, very easy to put on and so comfortable. I want one in every color."
5.0,Really beautiful dress and accessories! I got a lot of compliments on this at a “Great Gatsby” event. Much nicer than I expected given the cheap price. Looked like I paid triple what it actually cost.
5.0,"Nice dress. Very good price, the dress looks awesome!"
5.0,My son loves this. Actually someone stole it from his PE locker.  I guess they liked it too!
5.0,Great looking watch! Keeps great time.
5.0,It has a lot of space and once I broke it in it was really slim in my pocket
5.0,Perfect fit for my 7 year old
5.0,"Been wanting a cute beanie with a pom that has room for a ponytail/just plain doesn't feel small. This totally fits the bill!!!<br /><br />Comfortable, not tight at all, and the black multi is such a cute color... Cuter than any other beanie I've ever seen!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the pom is much bigger than I thought it would be.. but it's okay I guess. Looks kind of weird, but also blends in well with rest of the beanie.. I don't know, but you can decide for yourself if you like the look!<br /><br />Very worth the money and it shipped to me quickly despite not being Prime eligible (3 days instead of 2 days)"
5.0,These leggings are just the best. We have 4 pairs of these and they are in the regular rotation right now with 0-20 degree days in Wisconsin. They look super cute with tunic tops and boots and my daughter said she stays really warm in them all day. They're super soft inside and out and the colors are nice. Washing and drying hasn't been an issue and they're maintaining their color and shape. They fit well but are a little loose throughout the pant but they look nice!
5.0,"Love these!!! A must have! Soft, not see through and tummy control!! A must buy!!!"
5.0,"These fit well and do not fall down.<br /><br />They have light support so they are not too difficult to put on or take off.<br /><br />They have extra room in the toes so I just pull them a bit higher to make the extra room in the toes fit me.<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase.  They make my calves feel good.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything goes amiss, but so far I really like these socks."
5.0,Shipping took forever but it was worth the wait
5.0,"I want to buy every single color/pattern of this bathing suit possible!! My sister first purchased one and it looked soo good on her, super flattering. So I decided to try one for myself. The suit comes with pad inserts for the chest but in the photos, I’m not even wearing them and I think I prefer it that way. I am 5’9”, 160 lbs, 36 D bra size, with a larger bottom and slimmer waist and top half of my body, so finding a great swimming suit has always been a struggle for me. I wanted something youthful and sexy looking, but also full coverage for my booty. This suit hits all those marks! I ordered a Large as my sister suggested and it fits perfect!! Highly recommend this suit to any woman that wants to look cute and sexy but not be hanging out all over the place. I will be ordering more styles in the future for sure!"
5.0,"These are a fun way to add color to my work outfit (black slacks and black slip ons)! They do a good job of staying on and keeping my shoes from getting that feet smell. I've had them for about a month and they seem to be holding up well! *update: they will wear out fast if you put them in the dryer. 7 months later they stay on ok, but only the ones that didn't get put in the dryer and still have rubber bits."
5.0,"I have been looking around for retro looking cat eye glasses for a while and when I saw these I fell in love with them. They were exactly what I have been looking for so ordered them. All I was expecting was some awesome looking glasses but what I got was so much more. The packaging was amazing. They came in a very nice eyeglass case and inside the case the glasses where wrapped so not to get any scratches. But that was not all, included in the case was a cleaning cloth and a little screwdriver in the even that you may need to tighten or replace the screws. I totally love the extra care that was added.<br />The glasses themselves were better that I could have asked for. I even ordered a few few more in slightly different shape.I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a high quality, unique looking pair of sunglasses."
5.0,"This pajama set is very cute; it's got a sheep on the top and many little sheep on the pants.<br />It's lightweight, so it can be warn all spring, summer and fall. It has POCKETS! I love pockets and many of my friends love pockets, too, so finding pajamas with pockets is a bonus.<br />The ONLY drawback is that it fits larger than expected; I wear MEDIUM and ordered a MEDIUM but it's loose enough that I could have ordered a SMALL.<br />Wear these pajamas and count your sheep and have a great sleep!"
5.0,They stay on glasses arms really well and look good.
5.0,Fits great and are super cute. They come with a case and a bag and are very nice. I love these glasses!
5.0,It’s a little looser then I like but it fits nicely. Not super warm but perfect for fall or a not so cold winter. I wore this at an funeral and a few times to other places and got a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,My grandson love it and it fit perfectly
5.0,love uggs
5.0,They are funny and made us laugh!
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous dress. I’m 5’3” and 105. The extra small fit perfect. The dress is extremely well made. I couldn’t be happier

5.0,Fast shipping. Nice shirt
5.0,"Really love my fabulous stretchy shirt sleeve dress,super comfy very soft and its not tight to wear fit perfectly..color is so vibrant and and the lace is very cute,wore it with my legging and i realky liked it.."
5.0,Looks if hat..warmth
5.0,I love this pendant. It is an exact copy of a diamond accent pendant my Mom gave me for Xmas when I was 13. I am very happy with this pendant and I wear it every day. :)
5.0,They are awesome! I have tried the Dawgs. No comparison. Cheaper brands. No!! Have used Telics for 3 years. I stand on my feet all the time as I am a fulltime hairstylist and caregiver.
5.0,Flattering cut.  Sexy zipper. Looks great with jeans.  Generous fit.  Great deal.  Had to send XXL back for XL.
5.0,Love it fit perfect!!
5.0,"Love this suit! The to has molded underwire cups. The bottom isn't lined, which hasn't been a problem for me but could be for some."
5.0,"Fit me perfectly, very good quality, I am going to order more."
5.0,Nice worm hat well made
5.0,"This was a gift for my best friend. To this day, she tells me she absolutely loves it, and wears it almost every day! Thank you!"
5.0,"As anyone would be when getting a &quot;waterproof case&quot; I was super nervous to trust my expensive phone in this super inexpensive case. If you put it on correctly, the phone is completely airtight....make sure that you hear all the snaps when closing the case. Fingerprint unlocks works without problems and all of the buttons and switches work without problems!"
5.0,"Very happy with this dress! Fit was perfect for me (I usually wear a size 16 with a 40C bra size, I ordered the XL).It is made of light crepe-type material so the dress has some &#34;give&#34; if needed. It happens to fit me perfectly just the way it is, and about 2 inches above the knee. I have worn it several times so far and it will be a favorite &#34;go to&#34; summer dress. Happy, happy, happy!"
5.0,my daughter loved this ring.
5.0,I have owned a few different waist trimmer belts and this one is the best.  I do wish it was a little wider. All in all it is a thicker than some of the others I have owned and the Velcro is great.
5.0,I ordered a women's size large and it fits exactly how I wanted it to. It’s thin but for my costume it’s perfect. It also came earlier then it was supposed to!
5.0,Good product. Hubby liked it. Yours will too
5.0,"I really love the material of these yoga pants, they are very lightweight but still not see-through and are perfect for wearing in the summertime. Unfortunately they were a little bit too big/baggy on me so I probably would have ordered a size smaller than I usually do, but hopefully they will shrink a bit in the dryer. Other than that I think they are comfortable and a great lightweight option for the summer."
5.0,Fits great<br />Love the fabric
5.0,"They run a little small, I returned one and got a size larger. They're labeled 100% cotton but quite stretchy, which is kind of nice. It washed up nice and barely needed ironing."
5.0,"Our teenager loves this skirt... comfy, trendy and cute!  Mom and dad love the modesty level and quality!"
5.0,Nice design  and easy to use
5.0,I'm utterly in love with this pendant. It's big and heavy and finely detailed. You cant go wrong with it. Zero complaints.
5.0,Great fit with a little extra room.
5.0,Fit my grandson perfectly1
5.0,Nice hat. Had stranger compliment within the first hour of wearing it outside the house…
5.0,I bought this raincoat to take with me on vacation. The jacket is made of light windbreaker material. I got caught in the rain and this jacket kept me dry and was also cool enough to wear in the summer.
5.0,Love the quality and cut of this dress. The hemline has interest.  And the print is unique.  The material is more of a smooth rayon than the cheap knit summer dresses out there.  This dress is versatile enough to glam up with chunky jewelry and high wedges or to throw over a bathing suit.
5.0,"fits well, feels good and looks fine"
5.0,Wanted something that was cool and comfortable for hot summer nights.  Fabric is like butter!  Fits true to size and so comfortable.  Really like the below knee length!  Have now bought several for myself and as gifts!
5.0,Looks more expensive than they are. Beautiful!!
5.0,Works fine on sneakers
5.0,This dress is very pretty.<br />It arrived too late for my date but i received a refund and another free dress for 9.99<br />Thank you very much!!!!😊

5.0,I love this purse! It is beautiful! I had been looking at it in Belk’s..but i saved alot of money purchasing on Amazon.
5.0,"Ran thru the wash, didn't srhink in the dryer.  Got praise at the local campout for PS5 console pre-order.<br />Very comfortable fit, fits even long arm guys like me."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Wore my hair up and everyone commented on its sparkle and style. Also asked where I got it so I told them. Great purchase!
5.0,Very pretty got lots of compliments. Good to hide hair loss
5.0,I really like this top. It can be worn as a layering piece or on its own. Its very trendy and looks like it does in the picture. It fit me true to size and it looks great with a pair of distressed jeans. It is comfortable too! I throw this in the washer and dryer and I haven't had any problems with it shrinking or fading
5.0,"Light, comfortable and good quality"
5.0,Fits more on the slim side than the other Adidas style joggers
5.0,Like that it fits perfectly. I use it for work out or when on the go…
5.0,Really light and breathable. Going hiking tomorrow!! Can’t wait to test these.
5.0,"This product is much more beautiful in real, the colors are more vibrant and the material is very nice."
5.0,"The necklace looks great and is well made.  My only complaint would be that there was a very limited number availability when I ordered, but it worked out for me since my number was available.  Would make a great gift for the soccer player in your life!"
5.0,Soft! But extremely stretchy. I ordered a small but could use a xxs.
5.0,Fit well and surprisingly sturdy
5.0,"I bought these frames for my wife and we just loved them. Right now we let it to the doctor so She can put the glass my wife needs, later I up date the review. So far, so good"
5.0,"Fits a little big which I expected, just needs an insole. It looks amazing and the quality is great!"
5.0,While I would never purchase this at the original price (due to the material) it was well worth the 60% off. Very happy with this dress and POCKETS!
5.0,Size was what I needed very nice rain suit. I will by this again.

5.0,"Wasn't too sure about this buy, but I'm glad I bought it.  We go to Mexico a couple of weeks in the winter, and I will be sure to have this charm on my purse to &#34;fit in&#34; with my theme of expectations on our next trip down there.

5.0,"Thank you ! These boxer short are just wonderful for my husband. These boxer shorts are a bit longer than the norm.......they are very appropriate for him because he finds himself with his pants down and lying on the couch almost every Saturday and Sunday.......he can now wear his awesome and very comfortable boxwer shorts. He made his Mum grouchy because he said that he's never had such comfortable boxer shorts and I bought them for him...tee hee hee...nah, all good......."
5.0,Love these sunglasses. I have a few events to attend this summer and they will look AMAZING.

5.0,"I have a Fender Stratocaster (Okay, technically it's a Squier, but it's the same thing) and ever since my wife Got it for me, I've been wanting more Fender gear. i got a hat a while back, but I got it dirty, and I'd had an eye on this one anyway. I mean, it's a hat, so it does what hats do, but with that said, it's pretty cool, and I got a decent deal. I'd recommend it for all the dads out there."
5.0,I got the three feathers necklace and the earrings. I did think the earrings would be a bit larger but they are cute and so lightweight I can barely tell I'm wearing them. I have a lot of clothes that they will go well with. I have only worn them around the house so I have not had any comments from others to tell you about. I'm sure I will enjoy wearing them.
5.0,This was a gift for my Nephew. He loved it.

5.0,"I was giving fleece lined leggings a second chance as the first pair was very disappointing, more like tights!!! This pair is amazing. Super soft inside and out.

5.0,"Perfect fit! I love this mask, light weight, breathable and comfortable. Snug just enough for protection. Elegant look! I just ordered the black one."
5.0,The colors are so cute the only thing I did notice about them was that they’re a bit skinny compared to the original ones but if you don’t mind that it honestly is worth it and looks amazing on!
5.0,Love it! Size is as expected! You can dress it up or be casual!
5.0,I love these pants!!!
5.0,I love this shirt!!!!!  It was a little stiff when I pulled it out of the package but softened up when I tried is on.  I am 5'7&#34; and weight 148lbs.  It fit me perfectly!!  To me it looks like it came from an expensive boutique!
5.0,"This shirt is very high quality. Soft and fits my husband perfectly. He has a muscular build, about 220# and the large fit him like a glove. We are huge Guardians of the Galaxy fans, and wanted him to have a nice shirt for our Disney trip. We received compliments on it several times. The design is really cool too and printed with high quality materials. Highly recommend this company and will be looking into making other purchases from them."
5.0,Fit as it should.
5.0,So happy to have found this beautiful pendant.  It's an absolute treasure!
5.0,Really comfy and higher quality material than I’d anticipated! The inside feels like a really soft cotton. I will say the green I bought looked a little mossy at first but with the right styling I am a huge fan.

5.0,Works very well as a medical mask - lots of compliments too!

These shirts are an incredible value with impressive  high quality material, suburb workmanship and they are extremely comfortable. I an very pleased with these shirts and I highly recommend this product and the seller. One other thing to note, these are the brightest, most vibrant neon shirts that I've ever owned. The pictures do not truly show just how good these shirts really are. Thank you for such a great shirt at an affordable price."
5.0,Great second pair love them
5.0,Exactly as described. Perfect.
5.0,cute and is as picture

5.0,"Lo compre a mi hija de 9 años, y ella está fascinada."
5.0,Actually very impressive!

5.0,I have been looking for a nice silver style bracelet and love this one.<br />It is light and comfortable.  Just what I wanted!!!
5.0,Ordered for father in law in nursing home. He loves it
5.0,Perfect for my groceries
5.0,So sad this style was discontinued! Such a cute fit and great quality
5.0,"Love the dress, it fits perfect."
5.0,"How old are these for myself, they were boys size 8 to 10 I think and I am a female that wears a 7 1/2 shoe and they fit perfect I wish I would’ve bought more packs"
5.0,"I’ll admit, I’m not big into dresses. I like them, but I almost never wear them in public. I don’t like to stand out. This one caught my eye though, because it is cute, casual, comfy, but the lace up A-line neck makes it different and adds interest.<br />You can adjust the strings to be more modest or show a little skin. The arm holes are purposefully a little large- just the style of the dress. It gives a little bit of shape, but is not form-fitting- it is loose and flowy in a flattering way. The length is appropriate-not too short or long. I actually like the fabric a lot. First, I love this shade of grey. Second, I think it is soft, stretchy, and thick enough- I had no issues with anything showing through underneath. Everything seems well-made. The stitching looks fine.<br /><br />If I can’t gather up the courage to wear this dress out, then I can definitely lounge around in this. I think it would even look good with leggings if you wanted. I think it would even look cute as a beach cover up, especially if you open up the neck line more.<br /><br />The only issue I can think of is that you would need to pick out a specific bra that won’t show, but that isn’t a big deal. Also, I can’t tell you how this holds up with regular washing yet. The tag says to hand wash in cold water and hang to dry. I would just treat this as a delicate item and wash using a gentle cycle with cold water. I will either hang this to dry or put it on a low heat setting for a little while prior to hanging.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’6” and currently about 145lbs wearing size 6-8 pants. I ordered the medium and I think it fits the way it should. I think a small would fit me well too, just be more form fitting.<br /><br />Overall, I’m definitely happy with this dress, and would recommend it. I’ll be sure to update this review if any issues arise. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so I would love to know-thanks!"
5.0,I've always had to wear black tights to cover a big black tattoo on my ankle at work but these allow me to wear open toe shoes. You can't go wrong with anything Spanx and this was a great price.

5.0,like for comfort!
5.0,Great classic watch just wish my boys would wear them!
5.0,Super pretty and fits great. A little long but that was expected. I am 5'3&#34; so most things are too long.
5.0,For a little bigger then expected but still loved it!
5.0,I ordered 2 dresses with 3/4 sleeves and the dress fits but I’m short so they are easily 6 inches too long.
5.0,So cute.  I get compliments every time I wear them. Cheaply made but I would expect that with the price.
5.0,"I just kept coming back to this moonstone when I was searching for a new pendulum, as they said its not quite as pictured because every stone is a bit different...but I love it.  I was trying to find a pendulum for my husband, but, this is one is mine... he will just have to get a different one :). I appreciated they send information that came with it and a pouch."
5.0,Love them! I got the tiny one for myself because I have small wrists  and it fits perfectly.
5.0,This is an awsomely cool bracelet!! And its pretty too!! Its my favorite. Would recomend to anyone!!
5.0,These really help my husband whom is always fixing fences that have rusted & break. Keeps him from ripping open his arms. Good product. Highly recommend.
5.0,I ordered this ring for my daughter for Mother's Day it arrived on time and she Loves it much prettier than the pictures!!!
5.0,"My only problem was the size, its not available on medium size, but the quality it’s great no doubt of that"
5.0,"I have trouble finding plastic frames that fit because my eyelashes rub on the lens.  These fit beautifully.  Now the biggest problem I have is not losing them.  Since these are priced so reasonably, I don't mind so much when I have to replace them."
5.0,"very nice and affordable product! of course since they’re shorts, i can’t wear them during the winter. fit just right on me and came in the mail really quickly! will definitely be shopping again! (will be adding a photo soon)"
5.0,"I bought the bracelet for my friend’s birthday. It is as beautiful as it looked online, she loved it!"
5.0,"The boots were pretty, I needed them for a bridal shower, my toes were squished n I have petite feet. I gave them to my sister n it fit her perfectly, but although they didn't work out for me, it was gifted to someone n that's all that matters cos I love the hassle free shipping of Amazon prime!"
5.0,Nice bag. It held a lot of Halloween candy!
5.0,Bought for my grandson.  He loves it.  Fits as expected and good quality.
5.0,These maxi’s are so nice and comfortable.  I bought 4 more and thy are great for work or just a day out.
5.0,I love the color and it washes well.
5.0,I bought 3 more of these. Very comfortable and stretchy. I never liked wearing anything snug on my waist while at home but I changed that after buying this. Now I wear shorts all the time
5.0,Bought after reading reviews on sizing ect! Love the style color and comfort!
5.0,Thin and comfortable material. Nice red. Feels like it will be good for all seasons. My wife likes it.
5.0,Pretty little summer dress. The material is a little heavier then I expected but the fit is perfect. I usually wear a 14-16w and the XL fit perfectly!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:653313529f9768595008e2ebb241f4df]] [[VIDEOID:6b01be84b9f75034d5d78b7bec682bb8]] I’ve been trying to expand my wardrobe and even go a little outside of my comfort zone and this shirt is perfect for doing just that.  It has the zipper on the front and the back, so you can decide just how risqué you want this shirt to really be.<br /><br />It’s a very well-made shirt and I haven’t found any flaws with the seams or the construction of the shirt.  Both zippers work very well and go up and down with ease.  I think the one drawback to this shirt is that I have a very large bust and I don’t think I could comfortably wear both the front and the back zippered up.  I’m good with that as I prefer the look of the shirt with at least the front unzipped a little.  It’s a very versatile shirt and you can really come up with a bunch of different looks just by adjusting the zippers.  The sleeves can also be full length or ¾ sleeve lengths, once again adding to the many looks you can achieve with this shirt.  I’m pretty pleased with it and would definitely purchase in another color.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
5.0,"I like them , much easier then tying your shoes and much easier on my foot that I've injured 2 years ago"
5.0,"Haven't purchased yet, no reviews, and I dont buy anything without positive reviews. Perhaps in the near future."

5.0,"Love this material, and love how it fits. Very true to size!"
5.0,Love the frame! It makes the Fitbit blaze look chic and more like a luxury watch! I hope you continue to make more colors with more band options! Golds and tan colors would be appreciated!
5.0,I love the fabric and the style of this bathing suit. It’s very flattering and the stomach gathers to hide flaws. I received a lot of compliments because It was such a beautiful shade of pink.  Highly recommended
5.0,My wife really enjoys the design and comfort of the shoes - and the price is great.
5.0,Bought this for a trip to Disney and it was perfect! Outside zipper pocket just right for phone and inside fits a water bottle and small wallet.
5.0,As described. Great bands.
5.0,"I purchased these for my 15-year-old daughter. She picked them out and told me she HAD to have them and ALL the girls were wearing them. Hahaha! I ordered her normal size and they were too small, so those went to her sister. I ordered one size up and they fit perfectly. Both daughters love them. Both pairs have held up to several washings so far with minimal shrinking and fading. So far so good! I HIGHLY recommend these! Oh, and they arrived VERY  early!!!"
5.0,Great quality my daughter loves it great buy
5.0,"I absolutely love this skirt.  I am 5'4"", 117 lbs.  The length is perfect in a size 6 or size 4 for me (about 3 inches above the knee), and the fabric is light weight and great for summer, spring or fall.  It is also extremely comfortable and flattering.  And the woven belt is terrific--substantial, durable and attractive.  The skirt does wrinkle and you might need to touch it up with an iron after washing and between wearings.<br /><br />The biggest problem, though, is with sizing.  The smallest size I was originally able to find in the colors I wanted was a 6.  I ordered the 6 in khaki.  When I first put it on, it was a little loose but not too bad; and the style was exactly what I wanted.  After wearing, though, the skirt had stretched and become quite large.  When the olive color became available in a size 4, I ordered that one.  Holding it against the worn and stretched size 6, there was a 2 1/2 - 3 inch difference in every dimension, even length.  Out of the package, the size 4 fit well but maybe a little snug.  After wearing it a short while, it was perfect.  Both skirts after washing did return to roughly their original size.<br /><br />I loved the skirt so much that I re-ordered the khaki in a size 4 when that one became available, even though I could no longer return the size 6.  Sadly, though, while the new skirt says it's a size 4, it measures exactly the same as the newly-washed size 6, so  I had to return it..  The olive color does stretch, but it does not seem to stretch as much as the khaki color did.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this skirt and I love both the olive and khaki colors.  But the size marked may be misleading and you should  be aware that you may experience a significant amount of stretch in the fabric after wearing."
5.0,"Excellent for the price,  I loved."
5.0,she loves her wings she wears them all the time and they are very sturdy
5.0,"Bought it for my husband as he works outdoors, we were afraid it would be too small but it fits great and helps cover from the sun."

5.0,"Nice silicone band. This particular band is on the thinner side, not a wide band, just what I was looking for. I used this instead of taking my wedding set to Mexico since we do a lot of snorkeling so I didn’t have to worry about losing my rings or stones in the ocean. Great quality, no rashes or color fading. Ring size requested  fit perfectly. Quick shipping.<br /><br />Would highly recommend for someone who doesn’t want to take the chance of losing or ruining the wedding set."
5.0,"LOVE this top! Its gorgeous! Its perfect crop not too big not to small, its just perfect! Cant wait to rock it with jeans or shorts! I got a Medium and im  a 32 D!!"
5.0,I wasn't too sure if this is what I wanted but when they came and I gave them away. Oh all I got was how nice they are and that they were really happy with them. I realize that it is just a piece of stainless steel but they are really nice.
5.0,Its a nice bangle but it broke the first time I wore it.  Im trying to put the piece back on and hopefully it wasn't a defect.<br />Update: the seller replaced the bangle at no charge. They ere easy to work with and very prompt and polite. Love how this bagel looks like jewelry and not a fitness tracker.

5.0,"I got this Hair Headband for a relative who is going through therapy now.<br />Since it was not Prime Eligible, it took it about a week to arrive. Arrived in perfectly wrapped package giving it beautiful gift look. I actually also ordered Fringe Wigs for that. And they both were inside the same gift package.<br />I am gonna attach some pictures to show you.<br />And the headband fit perfectly both for the wig that I got and head as well. She really liked the idea of being them kinda gift wrapped all together. Also she mentioned that the headband is like lifesaver for her since she was having a hard time with attaching her other wig on her headwears.<br />It looks pretty well made headband, and the picture is true to the color, meaning beautiful off white color.<br />In general it is recommended product who's looking for something that will go perfectly with any fringe wigs. The one I got is also from the same company by the way, from the &#34;Headcovers Unlimited&#34;<br />And they have perfect customer service that is ready to help any time.<br />P.S. I received this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.<br />Which is IT IS REALLY MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW, no matter what price I got the product.<br />I am not obliged to write only good about anything. And I don't have to accept whatever I get offered. I get only what I really need for myself and my family. And it is important for me to write maximum honest review, cause I myself shop online based on reviews.<br />If in the future, the product will give me trouble, I will definitely update my review, which is if you go to my profile you can see that I have done it many times.<br />If you feel like my review somehow was helpful to you, please, feel free to give thumbs up :) million thanks in advance!"

5.0,"I was skeptical about a couple things after reading some of the 3 star reviews. I purchased them alone, it was shipped wrapped in a bubble wrap bag inside an insulated envelope! No damage and in perfect condition! Also I am very sensitive to cheap earrings and my bf recommended surgical stainless steel.. I have been wearing them for about a month straight and my ears have never felt better! They have yet to loose shimmer or tarnish! I love the size options. Def recommend and will purchase again if I lose them/become broken. Great purchase! :)"

5.0,Bought for 14 yr old Granson he wears it everyday
5.0,"I bought this as part of a Halloween costume, expecting it to be a bit loose and baggy. The drawstrings on it are a little strange in terms of placement, and it was a little more sheer than expected but otherwise it was just what I needed :)"
5.0,fast shipping - item as pictured
5.0,sexy product.  will buy again.
5.0,These are nice bands. Nice fit and colors.  Wasn't sure about the texture look in the pic but in person it really looks nice. I would buy again.

5.0,Its a keychain
5.0,The shorts are nice. Fits my bf well.
5.0,"So soft and gorgeous.  It fits perfectly, and it's not as sheer as you think it is.  I have a feeling this is quickly going to become one of my closet staples during the fall and spring."
5.0,Just wish it was a little tighter. It is okay because I'm between sizes.
5.0,bella!
5.0,"I was genuinely impressed by the quality of fabric, stitching and fur of the costume.<br />It made Halloween so easy! And made me look awesome 😎<br />10/10 would buy again and recommend"

5.0,"My 90+ year old mother loves ""bling"" but she hates fiddling with the little clasps on the jewelry.  In fact, putting on the jewelry and dealing with clasps is the principal reason she stopped wearing any accessories.  This little stretchy cord style banded bracelet is just perfect.  The 18K coating is lux looking and the stones are very sparkly.  When my mother got it, she just loved it.  So much so, that she didn't take it off all day!  It's perfect for any age, and it's especially good for those with fine motor skill issues because the stretchy cord design makes it easy to put on and take off.  I'm (and my mom) very pleased with this little bracelet!!"
5.0,I followed the rest of the reviews and ordered a size up from what I normally would wear and it fits perfect. The sleeves are long enough and this shirt is tapered in at the rib cage and is loose and flowy the rest of the way down to really show off the hourglass shape. I have gotten many compliments on this shirt and absolutely love it!
5.0,The perfect jacket!  It is light-weight but keeps me warm.
5.0,great deal of the day
5.0,"I am 5'0"" and 165 pounds. I have a little tummy but mostly my curves sit in my hips and my chest. This dress is to die for! So incredibly soft and thick, I wear this all the time now on really cold days. The only drawback to this dress is the fabric retains any pulls you make on the dress (eg: if you pull the dress down from the hips, there will be a little hand-sized lump in the dress until you fix it, I have just started pulling it from the very bottom to fix this issue, but seriously it's not a big deal.) this dress goes past my knees, and it's so stretchy so don't worry much about the size! I believe I got a M or L and I would actually suggest going down a size for a slimmer/bodycon look unless you want something chunky-looking. Overall, love the dress."
5.0,"Took a long time to arrive, but it is very cute."
5.0,I have another pair of these shoes in the white and pink which I love and couldn't pass up this $ deal for the gray ones.  Usually I wear a 5.5 Wide and that is hard to find.  But with the Ryka brand I can comfortable fit into a size 6 regular width.  The shoe is flexible and I wear them to walk around the neighborhood and to work where I'm on my feet all day.
5.0,"Fits well, easy to care for. Husband gets a lot of wakanda salutes. May have to use it in a cosplay."
5.0,"As an avid watch collector, this watch is one of my favorites. The timepiece is gorgeous and is quite comfy. Looks more expensive than what the price is"
5.0,Gorgeous. Fits great! Adore the pockets.
5.0,A good edition to my growing star wars pin collection. A must have for any rebel fan!!!
5.0,It came just as pictured and fits really well!

5.0,I love it was compacted and has lots of pockets
5.0,Stylish and comfortable!
5.0,Very nice necklace. Bought it from my sister.
5.0,I like the look of this bathing suit.
5.0,I have been using this for almost a year now and I love it. It hasn't worn out at all.
5.0,Seem to be nice quality. Bought these for my son to wear under AFOs that come to his knees . These are a good color for boys and solid color as well.
5.0,These are so elegant..the picture doesn't do them justice!
5.0,Everything was as advertised. The product was shipped promptly. No problems what so ever. This is an A++ Seller IMO.
5.0,"Love it, better quality then I expected and fits well. It's a suttle way to be a big kid"
5.0,Looks great  I wish it had a chain rather than the string. Other than that I am very pleased. Thanks
5.0,The color and size is just as described. It goes perfect with the dresses I have set up for spring. The quality is awesome. Would buy again.
5.0,"These are my daughters favorite shoes, she wears them everywhere.  We have them in 2 colors plus 1 in the next size up, so we are prepared."
5.0,I really liked the pijamas super comfortable
5.0,I liked that I don’t have to wear a belt anymore with a buckle that hurts when u sit or the problems with regular belts! I love how easy this item goes on and I’m ready to go without that annoying old fashion belt!!!<br />I will NEVER wear a reg. old fashion belt ever again!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Love these boots. Super cute and comfy. I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They fit great over leggings or jeans and don't feel tight or constricting at all. Ordered my usual size and they fit perfectly.
5.0,actually really good quality.  Thick and sturdy.  I still have these almost 2 yrs later.  Feel good
5.0,Sturdy cotton and accurate size
5.0,I couldn’t get into this even though it was the size Amazon recommended based on past purchases. Gave it to my sister and it fits her just fine! I didn’t want to give it to the Goodwill right off. Quality far exceeded my expectations!
5.0,Great value sturdy product.
5.0,Love these pants. They fit well and have just the right amount stretch to them.
5.0,"I got this watch-band for my grey smart-watch to give it a bit of contrast and to have something a little bit dressier than what came with the watch (non-leather, more suited for sports). I definitely wasn't let down by this. The quality of the leather is excellent. It feels durable but also pliable and comfortable to wear. The contrasting stitches give it an elegant look. I also like the contrast between the brown leather and the grey accents on my watch. The quick release mechanisms make switching it out a breeze (maybe 20 seconds to change both sides out). All in all, this is a great watch band that I highly recommend."
5.0,"Just got the bandanas there super soft, really good quality. Print on both sides. Very satisfied with these. There not hard and stiff like normal new bandanas"
5.0,Just as described.  Perfect tutu for my daughter.  Will purchase from again
5.0,"I purchased these for my new born daughter… the quality is exactly what I expected; they look expensive, and not cheap."
5.0,Beautiful material but rather long.
5.0,Really cute party dress!
5.0,Perfect color! Love the style!
5.0,Really well made time piece.
5.0,Sturdy Glasses for a great price
5.0,"I love this dress.  I bought two at first.  Fell in love and bought two more.  I wanted something comfortable while working remotely from home.  Great alternative to my pjs and sweat pants.  They look summery and cute.  if I need to run out, a nice pair of sandals works it!!!"
5.0,"My grand daughter loves it I think it will last a few years too,"
5.0,"I loved this set! The fabric is amazing and fits really well. The shorts fits more like a long bike shorts if you’re wondering, but I like it!"
5.0,"Love the shirt should have went up a size, a little snugged."
5.0,Nice fit love color
5.0,"Fits perfectly, and I am 6'. Lightweight. Great, unless you'll be snagging tree branches or working really hard. I hike with these. I tend to prefer an impermeable material to waterproof breathable membranes or DWR finishes. The only area where these will maybe allow water innis along the front opening. Beyond that, if you keep them intact, they will keep you dry."
5.0,"Stylish, fantastic looking watch. I've had loads of compliments. Thank you!"
5.0,Good quality product and fit as expected. Provides good support
5.0,"Well made leotard with beautiful pattern. Great material and stays in place, my niece loves this!!"
5.0,"A great and beautiful ring.  Everyone who sees it, wants it.  Hreat quality and fantastic price."
5.0,"I’m 5’2” tall & 115lb and I ordered a small. It fits perfectly and comes just to my knees. As a busy mom, I wanted something cute and easy to chase kids around while wearing. This outfit works perfectly for that and looks cute with some navy sneakers.  I’m very pleased with the purchase. The material is thick and good quality. This dress also works for spring, fall, and summertime."
5.0,I ordered this for my 12 yr old son and got a mens medium because the size difference being so much smaller than US sizes. Fits him perfectly.
5.0,The nightgown is comfortable and a good fit. I find the neck to be a bit too low but other than that it works for me.
5.0,"Absolutely love this bag. I carry it everyday. It's sturdy, it looks great. Very good quality"
5.0,"This organizer fits perfectly into a Vera Bradley Classic Campus backpack.  I love all of the pockets; it makes it super easy to organize all the little things I carry around every day.  The only downside to this organizer is it does limit the space you have for carrying books/notebooks.  I can fit my laptop and maybe one notebook behind the organizer (and the organizer does not have a pocket big enough to hold these).  I would say this is a better product for people who use their backpacks as purses or for students who only carry around a laptop (no books or notebooks).  It's definitely not for people who need to carry several books and notebooks.  Besides this though the construction does seem to be sturdy and it can hold a good bit.  One of the pockets on the inside is the perfect size for a Moleskine notebook and the zipper pocket is great for holding little odds and ends.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,"Wear this all the time.  Comfortable, soft and cute!!"
5.0,"The product was amazing quality and great for the price! I got them because I am obsessed with stranger things, definitely satisfied!"
5.0,GREAT Purchase
5.0,You can see how much I love this band from how dirty it is😂 I’d say the only flaw is that it does get dirty very easy if you get a light color. So I’m going to order more in darker colors because I love it that much. It’s super comfortable and easy to adjust and slip on and off
5.0,I have got so many compliments about this skirt.
5.0,They fit Perfectly ...my son says they are Great..Will order again
5.0,Nice product the size was a perfect fit
5.0,9 yrold daughter  loves she thinks she is so cool. pretty cute for play
5.0,I bought these for a Jurassic Park themed birthday party. They were fun and easy to use as well as disposable!

5.0,"Bought a gift for some one,He loves it"
5.0,Effective!
5.0,Used for a baby shower.
5.0,Everyone loves this dress. This is one of my favorite.  Fit perfectly
5.0,Love this shirt for my girl!
5.0,Good quality little watch.
5.0,"I've used this many times....it's been in checked baggage, overhead compartments, with bell hops, thrown in the trunk, dragged through snow, and nothing has broken!  It's the easiest bag to find!"
5.0,So cute on! For the price I couldn’t believe how cute it looked on.  I just wish there wasn’t a button in the back.
5.0,"These gloves exceeded my expectations. They’re warm but not excessively bulky, they’re comfortable and stylish. I would definitely buy them again!"
5.0,Awesome! The material is great! The measures were just perfect! I love it!
5.0,"Takes some practice to get both sides the same, but well worth it."
5.0,My daughter loved the fit and vneck to wear under her softball jersey. She already requested other colors!
5.0,ITS A VERY SPECIAL T-SHIRT FOR ME ! THANKS A LOT
5.0,It's a gift she hasn't opened it yet... But the quality is beautiful
5.0,Perfect fit!  Very comfy and Best Holiday pants I ever bought.
5.0,My 9 year old is obsessed with fnaf. She loves the hat.
5.0,A really nice necklace!
5.0,greatb
5.0,This necklace is absolutely beautiful
5.0,I had no issues with the glitter falling off like other reviews. For the price I am very happy. The blue is bright and gold color is perfect. Far the best costume jewelry I have purchased. Didn’t need anything fancy. These do the job.
5.0,"I was skeptical at first because my calves are huge, so I didn't think the sleeves would fit properly. I was wrong! I love them and they fit perfect. I wore them all day today with no problems, my legs felt great. I didn't have that tired feeling, and my legs didn't feel heavy. I will definitely be ordering more."
5.0,"This hat was stunning, It fit perfectly. I so love it, I felt powerful and elegant wearing it!! Must have"
5.0,"These are soft, comfortable and warm."
5.0,"I sent back ( returned) I bought size M but did not fitted me, has to be Xl."
5.0,"I'm vaccinated so I really don't need a thick mask or anything like that. I decided to go the gaiter route and haven't gone back to traditional masks yet! I can finally breathe! These gaiters may be a bit pricier than just getting one of those big packs of 10 nylonish ones but they are worth it. I like the build and quality along with the strap that prevents it from sliding down which is such a pain sometimes. They also look pretty cool as well. Overall, great product."
5.0,Quality outstanding.
5.0,These are gifts for my grandsons. I think they will like them very much.
5.0,Gave as a gift she loved it. And I was proud to give it as a gift.
5.0,This dress is gorgeous.  My daughter loves it!
5.0,Very nice bolo
5.0,Enjoying my watch.
5.0,The product worked!
5.0,Boyfriend uses this on his keys at work. His buddies apparently love it too.
5.0,Love them so far. Fit great.
5.0,"Love it. Super warm, comfy and cute. Definitely worth it."
5.0,"These socks were exactly what I wanted. The material used for these socks are awesome and very breathable and I generally like the feel of them.  It feels like about the same thickness as dress socks, but definitely feels more breathable, so win win for me.  I didn't think about it once i put my socks on, and so I guess it did it's job. The heel grip inside of the socks is pretty clutch. I helps keep the socks from slipping down your feet, and so there's no constant need to adjust it. I wear these for casual wear, and so I havn't worked out with them. I tend to use thicker socks when I work out.<br /><br />Also, it successfully did not show when I wore my shoes. I wear  Nike Roshe's on the regular, and the socks don't show.<br /><br />Also, forgot to mention that my feet size is Men's 10.5, and it fits perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some no-show socks.<br /><br />And unlike some of the other reviewers, I took a chance and bought them without any discount. So I have no affiliation to these guys.  This is a genuinely well made product. Get and try it yourself, you won't regret it.<br /><br />I still have yet to wash them, and see how the grips in the back heel hold up, and so I'll be sure to come back and update my review after I wash these socks for the first time, and probably a month later to see how these socks held up."
5.0,"Very compact, perfect for a small clutch bag or a pocket."
5.0,Perfect for any time of year. Looks great on..
5.0,The fit is perfect I am 5’0 tall and very petite.  These leggings are so soft and fit just right.  I ordered an extra small.  I am so happy with them.
5.0,I love this dress. I highly recommend it. It hugs your body in all the right places.
5.0,Sometimes I like a plain ball like these instead of a sparkly nose ring.  These are very comfy.
5.0,"This is an awesome bag if you want a smaller gym bag. It is perfect for my needs because I I need a bag for is to hold a weightlifting belt, jump rope, straps and chalk. There are are small pouches on the out side and one on the inside, I use them to hold my wallet keys and headphones. The material of the bag is strong and I think I will have this bag for quite a while.<br /><br />One thing bad about the bag is it comes these un need buckles on the side. In one of my photos you will see that I just cut them off to make the perfect bag!"
5.0,"well-made italian boots , To Boot New York shoes run a little big , but overall it worth the money"
5.0,They loved it! Very excited to put it on the tree - looked great.
5.0,Bought these for my dad for Christmas. He pointed them out to me and said he's been wanting them so he could read small print things. They work really good and are a good price!
5.0,"I am 5'4"" and 125-128 lbs and size M fits perfectly. I'll get another one."
5.0,"I'm a mom to two small children (1 and 3).  This bag is perfect for all of the stuff that we need to bring to the beach/pool.  It's very roomy but with my kids we can fill up that bag pretty quickly.  Lol.  The many inside pockets are perfect size for sunscreen both mine and the baby/kid ones, wipes, sunglasses, etc.  There is one inside zipper pocket that can hold keys, phone, money, etc.  I like the pockets because everything tends to fall to the bottom and I can never find the things I need especially since my kids are ready to get in the pool the second we get there.  Here's a few pics of the bag.  I was hesitant on buying this because of the size and was going to spend a little more for something smaller but I'm glad I went with this because we'll definitely fill it up."
5.0,"Excelente producto. Me encantan, son cómodos y se quedan a la perfección."
5.0,I love this dress!  The fit was perfect and the material is soft. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"These are functional but fashionable. You can operate your touch devices. There warm, comfortable. True to size. Well Made!! I hope this has helped. Thank You"
5.0,Perfect dupes!
5.0,Love it. So cute on!
5.0,I got it in medium and I love the oversized fit! Getting a second one in a different color
5.0,I’m assuming that the review is correct as it was on the wish list.
5.0,"I'm sz 18 ordered 5xl, slightly large but stoked that it was large and not sized for a doll. I would recommend hand washing and air dry.I'm happy."
5.0,Beautiful piece. Catches light and shimmers
5.0,"These are super comfortable and fit great!  I usually wear a size 6-8, and these fit just fine.  A great bargain for two pairs of thick, comfy leggings!"
5.0,"I loved the variety and they are exactly as pictured. There’s only one tiny problem I had, was the ribbon popped off one of the masks as I was putting it on my daughter’s face. I didn’t even pull hard. But overall they are great"
5.0,"Fabric is thick, soft and warm. Great construction and quality!"
5.0,Was perfect for what I needed.  Was soft and great for the price.
5.0,The cover didn’t fit well. The material caught in the wheel so it wouldn’t roll and it tore a hole in each side.  The other one i bought for another suitcase fits perfectly so not sure what happened with this one.
5.0,Gooood quality! Definitely will buy again! Doesn't look cheap.
5.0,It fits exactly as size chat measurements. I love this tux. My only complaints are the vest v neck hangs to low and the comer bum is to lager. Defiantly would recommend buying this tux.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! The shipping was fast I can’t wait to have her wear them as a flower girl for the wedding!<br /><br />They match my wedding shoes!!
5.0,Loved it. Size is perfect
5.0,Keeps me cool on hot California days.
5.0,"A bit small, but nice!"
5.0,Overall these shoes are great but a little large for my 6-month granddaughter yet.  We will update our review later possibly when it is right for her.
5.0,"Exactly like picture, does hurt a little but that's expected"
5.0,Love this jack makes a great accent piece. I was it inside out so it doesn’t snag
5.0,It was a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loved it. Wears it all the time.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, I love it! YOU DO HAVE TO SIZE UP! I usually wear a medium or small (medium more often than small) and I ordered a large, it fits great except the sleeves. They are a little tight, but not so tight that they are going to rip or that I can't move my arms around so much, just a little more snug than I'd like. I am very short at 4'9&#34; in height and am always worried about buying long dresses online. I worried this would be too long, but after seeing where the dress fell to on other review pictures I decided to risk it. It's the perfect length for me! Comes just down to my ankles."
5.0,Love the patterns and the pure cotton.  Also feels really comfortable too.  I just wish there were more colour pattern options.
5.0,Great pair of shoes for the price.
5.0,Bought this for my wedding in April. My son is 10 and everything fit him well.
5.0,I luv this piece! So happy!! Everytime i wear it the compliments are endless. Worth adding to your cart.
5.0,"It fits exactly as it should. The embroidery is nicely done and I love the buttons in the back. I can dress it up or down, but I love wearing it with jeans. This is one of my new favorites!"
5.0,fit like a glove nice that i dont have  to keep pulling up my sleeve! so thank you
5.0,Got this for my Fiancè as a push present. Inside the front flap is a list of things needed in a diaper bag. Is high quality and looks great.
5.0,Received lots of compliments on this dress!
5.0,Comfortable and good quality pjs. We have a happy paw patrol fan now.
5.0,Very comfortable under my scrubs. Will be ordering more.
5.0,"I bought this for my wife.  She likes it so I am happy with the purchase.  Quality seems pretty good, so I would recommend to a friend"
5.0,Love it. Will be buying again!
5.0,My grandson loves them. The colors are spot on.
5.0,Best model from Dieswl. Not too slim at bottom and perfectly fit on top. Love it!
5.0,Very cute Christmas pjs for kids. It’s very soft and looks just like the pictures. Will be buying more!
5.0,"These are weirdly comfortable. They're boots that you can wear like slippers. I don't own a pair of shoes that I consider more comfortable. Like all the Mini-Mils, they run one size large and have an oversized toe-box, so I'm an 11W, so I ordered 12R, and they're prefect. This is my third pair of Mini-Mils, the other two pair being the 102's in Black, and these 115's are an improved design which is perhaps thicker in the soles, but more padded all around. Somewhat hard to over tighten the laces, but that's a bad habit anyways. I use a Bar-Lace pattern on the over-arch area which makes them even more comfortable, and they look good."
5.0,"Well design, and awesome! Everyone I’ve meet has given me wonderful compliments about the jewelry!!!"
5.0,"Grandkid hates masks, but he loves to wear this one!"
5.0,"Very cute wallet - everything you need to know is in the pictures. I've got enough room to keep my cards, a few bills in there, and with a little coaxing, I can squeeze my phone into the exterior pocket too!"
5.0,"ITS SO ADORABLE!!! at first when it came in it looked a bit small, but it still fit my iphone11 and its super cute! a bit short and reaches to about my waist and im 4'11, no complaints though! would recommend if you have that pinkish/blackish type of vibe :))"
5.0,Absolutely in love with this dress. I followed the size chart and it was perfect it has a little bit of a stretch. And extremely comfortable and movable.
5.0,They are great and we’re a great price!
5.0,"All parts intact, looks cute on me. I got a medium instead of a small and fits perfectly. I'm 5'2 and 110lbs for reference."
5.0,It provided a lot on compression to my feet
5.0,"Loved this dress! Bought it for my daughter's birthday party she LOVES wearing long dresses! It shipped quickly, washed well and looked just like the photos. My daughter is a tall 6 year old (49"" tall & 75lbs) and as 10 fits right at her ankles. The deep blue was spot on for fall paired with silver ballet flats. I'll be looking for more fall dresses from this company."
5.0,The price was perfect
5.0,Good looking bike outfit. Short are only 3D padding but it is for exercise bike with very comfortable seat so not a big deal for me.
5.0,Bought this as a GoT gift and it looks phenomenal. The moon isn't as noticable on the design but the rest looks fantastic<br /><br />Feels just like similar bracelets (Alex & Ani). Would definitely recommend
5.0,My child was over the moon with this dress! She acted the part and felt like a queen in it!! The dress was good quality and washes great! I've washed it twice and it holds up its shaped.<br />Looks like new after washing.
5.0,Beautiful but a bit small
5.0,I was really surprised by the quality of the necklace and chain. The design is nice and necklace is not too lightweight or heavy.
5.0,Daughter was very happy
5.0,product has broke her out yet.  So far so good.
5.0,My husband picked out this tie to go with a solid red collared shirt. It compliments his shirt perfectly and looks great.
5.0,Fit's her a tad tight but she's a full-figured gal and sizing is tricky for her.  I went with the largest size and it is snug on her.  I'm glad I bought it.  Looks great.
5.0,"Cap is very comfortable, and light weight. This was a great buy. Thanks"
5.0,got in black. really like it. tried another color--fabric was different... terrible. but the black one was great.
5.0,Excellent band. Gave the exact look I was hoping for to my Seiko dive watch.
5.0,Ordered for a United Way Turkey Trot fundraiser.  Made a great hit!
5.0,"Fits well and super cute! Thin, lightweight material."
5.0,"I was reviewing my orders and I noticed something...I ordered the wrong size! I feel AWFUL. I ordered these in the correct size and they're wonderful.  I'm keeping my completely wrong review under this one in case someone read it. It's wrong.  The whole thing was 100% my fault.  These are wonderful.<br /><br />I'd like to note that I really tried with these. I have been a size 0 for more than two years. My ears are not scarred. These are HUGE! I have been tapeing my regular size 0's since I got these, stretching gently in the shower, I have tried lube... I'm almost a 00 now and these things STILL won't fit. I am incredibly frustrated. Between my toddler and my cat I'm down to one pair of gauges and I really needed these to work. They shipped quickly and seem like good material but I shouldn't have to go up two sizes."
5.0,Replace my magnetic band with this one easy to install. Wrist don't sweat with it on very comfortable adjustable and stretches.
5.0,Good product to buy they don’t fall out
5.0,"I really love this shirt, super comfy and fit perfect. Ordered my normal size."
5.0,"Very cute, great quality, and true to size. I received many compliments while wearing."
5.0,Most striped ties are really boring.  I didn't want the same thing many other men are wearing.  This one has an very interesting combination of colors and I like the way the colors mingle as they change from one to the next.  I'm very happy with this tie.
5.0,They fit well. Light weight and comfortable.
5.0,"My twin's favorite Auntie bought them these shoes for Christmas.  At 18 months my girls are shoe-hounds already.  They are so colorful, well-made and cute, my girls love them.  And the squeakers are a bonus.  They love stomping around the house just to make them squeak.  And in a quiet store or a restaurant everyone comments how cute the shoes are too.  I will definitely look to Rainbow  Steps for future shoes instead of over-priced striderite.  I don't pay full price for anything...but will for Rainbow Steps.<br />One small negative - I wish the hook-n-loop was a bit stronger.  Small toddler fingers can very easily escape from them.  But that is just a very minor issue as all toddlers constantly run around like hillbillies without shoes & socks."
5.0,They are perfect.  Never loose your mask
5.0,Love the fit and thickness of this dress
5.0,Thank you my son love it.
5.0,Perfect! Good and durable for my 9 year old ballerina. Very soft and the foot holes make it versatile.
5.0,Super comfortable for work.  I’ve noticed a difference in stamina and lower leg pain.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS! I got size B (I'm 5'7&#34;, 165lbs) and this cover up is absolutely amazing. It is more open on the side than I realized, and a little more sheer than I realized as well but these are both great things in my opinion. If I find myself swimming more I would honestly just buy other colors of this because it is a short length while still being a bit modest, and the fast drying fabric is great after a swim.<br /><br />This makes me feel cute while also being covered chasing around my toddler!"
5.0,"Of course it doesn't look and act like leather......it is NOT!  Spend $300 and get leather.  A great, fun little product that fits.....if you are already built for tight clothing"
5.0,"I really love how this looks, and everyone told me my outfit was very ""serious"". I paired this with a plastic Cold Steel practice katana. I bought size L because I'm a 5'10"" man who wears Medium shirts. The Chest was right, but the pants were oversized. I pinned up the legs by about 6 inches. Thank you!"
5.0,This dress was perfect it was sexy and sophisticated!!
5.0,The dress is exactly what I thought it would be and I really like it!
5.0,"beautiful item, perfect fit"
5.0,I was totally surprised by the quality and comfort of these bands. The one that came with my apple SE watch was too tight. I have large wrists and needed a larger band. These worked perfectly and also gave me choices of colors.
5.0,Sooo cute for little girls and fits perfect and even easier to put on !!
5.0,My 13 year old daughter loves these. They were a better deal & sock than the 1 pair (another brand) that I purchased for my 8 yr old. These I would repurchase.
5.0,This is totally awesome! I love its angel's wing design and its sparkle that made it so elegant. I'm so loving it.
5.0,Have not worn them yet but they are made of comfortable material and are pleasing to the eye.
5.0,"I was a little skeptical at first buying this but it turned out great! I went out dancing in this dance and it was easy to breathe and move it. The fabric was better than I had expected and it’s lined with a silky fabric on the inside. I received a lot of compliments and it was very flattering. The size was true to size, I’m 5’2 and normally fit into small size clothing."
5.0,"Bought as a sympathy gift, she loved it. Arrived quickly and safely"
5.0,Cute little belly button ring
5.0,"Cute and functional. Straps take some effort to get on to glasses' bows, though"
5.0,"I’ve looked everywhere and couldn’t find a desert storm vet hat.  I thought why not try this one.  At very least, I can just hang it up.  Turns out, it’s a great hat and I bet it will last a long time."
5.0,Great dupe for the ones we know.... if ur 5’ y’all and have a small head they are large ... I don’t mind it hides my skin so no sun damage

5.0,I love this it is so comfortable and I love just relaxing in it
5.0,Colors are vibrant and beautiful. I normally wear a XXL so I ordered the XXXL and it fits great. I would order again.
5.0,"This dress is stunning. So simple and the ruffles add so much cuteness. It runs a rad smaller and short. If you are taller you might need to wear something under it. Im 5'3. This is a must dress, so comfy and super cute. Dress it up or down."
5.0,"Cup my eyes rather than pressing on my eyes.  Just what I wanted.  I have used this product several times.  When I find something that works for me then I don't deviate.  They are perfect for me.  They are comfortable and adjustable.  They last quite well.  They are the best sleep masks I have ever tried.  The first time I ordered sleep masks, I ordered 2 different kinds.  EyeSnugs won hands down."
5.0,"This swimsuit runs much the right size, I have a 36 waist and the large fits fine. There is a nice pouch in front that keeps the manhood together just showing a nice bulge however when wet they will show a clear outline of the penis."
5.0,Bought this tie for my 5 yr old son to wear with a button down shirt to a summer wedding.  He loves riding his bike so I thought this was perfect.  I've never bought a kid's tie before and didn't know what to expect since there were no other reviews.  I'm glad I took a chance because it's well made and so cute!
5.0,decent socks

5.0,"Dress is exactly as pictured. Made very well, got complements all night. Stretchy material hugged my body perfectly. I’m 5 4, curvy and ordered a M, highly recommend!"
5.0,I bought this for my grandson.  He loved it.  But it is breakable as he threw it and it broke.  We were able to superglue it back together.
5.0,I bought these goggles because my CPAC mask would blow air into my eyes. My eyes would be really dry the next morning and with these goggles I have no more problems. I have been wearing them every night since I received them. They are comfortable and I am able to see through them at night if I have to get up. I also choose these because of the Amazon rating as well as the description of these.
5.0,la calidad es buena solo hay que tener en cuenta el tema de las tallas ya que son pequeñas
5.0,Perfect ring for my daughter
5.0,"I love these boots(the brown Camilla style)! I bought them for a cosplay I'm putting together and they are exactly what I hoped for. They fit well and are incredibly soft. I'm also very happy with the heel height which is sexy, but not too high to walk around in for a few hours at a time. I wear a 9.5 shoe and went up to a size 10 in these because reviews said they were narrow in the toe."
5.0,I used this for a prayer meeting at church.  Loved 😍 the quality.
5.0,Hat was exactly like the picture and got here quick!
5.0,"Our son's pre-school recently announced to hold a cultural day where every kid has to wear their traditional outfit. Since we are from Austria, we needed to get him traditional leather pants asap. Glad to have found Bavaria Trachten! The smallest size (3T) fits our son (he just turned 2 but is tall for his age) because the pants are easy to adjust in size. They are heavy and made out of real leather. They are beautifully designed. As someone who knows Trachten, I can report that this is the real deal. Worth the buy and happy to have found them on Amazon!"
5.0,Exercise and Lounging in!
5.0,Fit great n look great for tall 10 year old

5.0,These are adorable and will be the perfect little Valentine's Day gift for my daughter.
5.0,"This is a well made scrub hat, plenty of room for all my hair, adjustable, buttons well placed, and comfortable. Will be buying more!<br /><br />Update: I received  a free stretchy hat from Abamerica, it’s a little tight, but I have a big head and lots of hair. The bouffant style is best for those desiring a looser fit and have abundant hair. I’ve received a lot of compliments, and it has worn well. I did have to move the buttons back so my mask fit correctly, an easy fix."
5.0,"This goes well with my other rings, I love it and I will tell everyone about this ring and let them know that I got it on Amazon and I give it 2 Thumbs up and a 5 star rating thank you for letting me get it at a big discount."
5.0,I got these for my sister to wear on her wedding day. They look soooo expensive. They are beautiful. We love them! So happy.
5.0,True to size. Great for hot weather. Well made.
5.0,"I was skeptical when I first saw this product. I do a lot of traveling and have never thought of putting things in individual compartments. However, I just packed for my first trip and was quite surprised how much each cube held. When I was finished I was expecting the luggage not to close well. Boy was I surprised! Everything fit well and the luggage closed perfectly. What a wonderful idea! I'm very pleased with this product so far."
5.0,"Well, these are NOT shoes so not sure why they are asking about fit..  I love these little bags though.  I plan to give some for gifts.  Nice pouch"

5.0,Great quality and fast shipping. We couldn't be happier with our purchase

5.0,This is a gift. The quality is very nice.
5.0,Very comfortable. Can sit without the back of the pants dipping low. Fabric is nice and thick for winter wear..
5.0,good coloring
5.0,VERY NICE ITEMS......DEFINITLEY GOOD FOR PRICE I PAID FOR THEM
5.0,"It hasn't been warm enough to wear this yet, but it fits as well as looks and feels nice."
5.0,"I love these!!! Totes adorbs totes comfy. Will buy a second pair in another color, and probably several more for Christmas gifts. Recommend."
5.0,"Very nice, Took a long time to get as they come from China, but very nice pendant."
5.0,The dress is very comfortable and I love that it has pockets!
5.0,It's a damned good looking hat! I wish we would have had the camo uniforms when I was in. A huge upgrade from those hideous dungarees and chambray shirts.
5.0,"Awesome poster! Gift for my 11 year old who has just discovered that girls can get little crushes on celebrities. I love the size, it is perfect and much better than having a full sized poster taking up 1/2 a wall. Poster was perfectly packaged and looks great."
5.0,Bought for catholic school uniform. Son loves belt. Looks good. Keepig up with daily wear and tear.
5.0,I have only tried it on but the material is super soft and it appears to be well made. I really love it! I ordered it in a different style as well. I am 5'4 and 125-130 lbs I got a medium and it fits perfect!
5.0,"Love this top, will be ordering other prints!"
5.0,"I love them, the size of them is perfect"
5.0,"Definitely a retro dress, and needs a petticoat in my opinion, which i got and makes it look even better. It fits snugly but like other people have said, the material has some stretch to it. I needed help zipping it up and initially thought it wouldn't zip but after it got going it was fine. Very comfy with the added stretch - I got an XL and usually wear a 14-16, fits well. I'm trying to decide whether to wear it to my garden party or to a &#34;hat&#34; luncheon fundraiser. It would work for either. For the price it is a great dress. Prime shipping got here in 2 days."
5.0,Its just what I wanted.............however the zipper was a little weird at first and it does have a musty oder when opened. But now it's just fine. I really like.
5.0,Absolutely love these workout shirts
5.0,It’s a good fit I usually wear L but I got an XL just to be safe. I am considering on buying every color.
5.0,Love this dress! It fit perfect and felt great in it
5.0,"Love it1  Have already  purchased 2 and will probably buy another two.  Buttons are still very easy to depress and work (lock, trunk, etc...) but it feels protected.  Keys are $500.00+ so spending $20.00 to protect it is definitely worth it!"
5.0,Worked quite well for my daughter's dance recital. She was pleased with the fit and quality. What more could you desire?
5.0,My daughter wore this to a cosplay convention. She received many compliments. She was happy with it.
5.0,"Fit as I expected it to. I'm short (ish) at 5'3, and while it started out a perfect length, as the day wore on, I noticed it got longer and I had to tie it up to keep from tripping over it. This is pretty normal for me with maxi dresses, so I'm not surprised. The material is soft and the cut is is comfortable and flattering. I especially love the colour I got, which is a kind of periwinkle blue/lilac and very unique."
5.0,Great sizes for travel. Already used it and held up very well so far.
5.0,Cute key ring
5.0,Exactly as shown and advertised
5.0,My legs swelled with these socks it has stopped the swelling
5.0,Nice sweatshirt for the money! Middle weight and nice@
5.0,I really like this Hachimaki.  I worked for 56 years and had to shave everyday and keep my hair well trimmed.  I am fortunate that now that I am retired and in my 70s I still have enough hair to let it grow long.  This hachimaki helps me to keep my hair out of my eyes and blowing all over the place.  The price is right and the length is perfect for tying off (even though I have a larger head than average).  I have washed this several times and it retains its size and color.  All in all a very well made product as are most products from Japan.  I am glad I purchased this product and have in fact purchased several more.
5.0,Beautiful! My boyfriend likes it a lot!!
5.0,My husband has ordered these twice because he loves them so much. And they look great in him!
5.0,"I love dresses with pockets!! This dress is thin and light, nice for summer days to the beach or to wear as a nice breathable layer when its warm outside."
5.0,"Bought these specifically for my upper ear piercing which is quite sensitive.  I've been wearing these for several weeks now, and my ears have had no problems."
5.0,Exactly how it looks in the picture very pretty
5.0,"On time, as described. I was expecting, cute, but flimsy for this price/quantity. Nope, they're surprisingly heavy, like the good jewelry. It's oddly satisfying to shake them gently in your hand, (to feel the weight). I haven't wore them yet, so I'll update if they turn me green. If there's no update, they don't turn ya green."
5.0,Nice fit. Great price
5.0,"Got this for my mom. Who burns so easily under the sun. Got this for her, fits perfect."
5.0,The dress is just as described - material is comfortable and it seems to be well made.  I followed the suggestions for sizing based on past reviews....bought a small and returning for a medium.  Seems to be more true to size.
5.0,I got them for a costume to be barnacle boy from the show spongebob for Halloween and they look perfect and the fit is just right!
5.0,They are pretty and comfortable
5.0,Very nice pastel colors
5.0,The material and quality was great.
5.0,"I love love love my scrunchie band. I have gotten two of them from this brand. I tried buying a different one that was a different brand and it didnt even compare to this one at all. i have tiny wrists, the other brand kept causing the watch to slide around my wrist and not stay on top of my wrist. These scrunchie bands do not do that. They stay in place and are not too tight. 100% worth the buy. Trust me. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,Super similar to the Kaosoftwear or the PYHs skin thin tunnels. Fits comfortably and doesn’t fall out when sleeping.
5.0,Fit as expected and really great for a costume! Fabric is thin but I didn’t have issues with see through undergarments. Will purchase more colors
5.0,"I have so many maintenance items to keep close. (with-in reach) + a 3 story home. (needed pockets!)<br /> I can wear under or over my clothing. Don't need a purse, now can relax just carrying my cane;<br />at 80years, makes life simpler..<br />Too, can be seen, while slowly crossing the streets...."
5.0,Great quality for the price. They were large enough to fully block sun.
5.0,I love it! Lots of fabric so you can do lots with the scarf. definitely buying it again in other colors. really and not itchy.
5.0,Just received these lovely earrings. They are perfectly sized and very sparkly. Purchased to go with my snowflake pendant which they coordinate with beautifully. I plan to wear them throughout the holidays and winter season as they are a go-with almost everything.. With all of the choices of snowflake earrings offered on Amazon I am so happy I chose these!
5.0,love the style and fabric of the jumpsuit but it is a bit too large(small). Extra small would be perfect.
5.0,fit was as expected but I returned the suit. I did not like it on me as the bottom looked like I was wearing underwear and the top showed my armpit fat way too much.
5.0,"I have back issues and for that reason, do not buy leather bags anymore.  I like the Sport sac type material instead.  I was looking for a new shoulder bag with a decent amount of compartments and this is just perfect.  There are so many zippered storage compartments on this bag, it is incredible!  It is nice and lightweight with an adjustable shoulder strap.  It also looks nice and makes a good presentation.  I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Deuter quality
5.0,"look great,  tie well."
5.0,"I like the look of these boots<br />I'm size 10 for all shoes and these are large that I solve with thicker socks, next time I'll order 9.5.<br />I used them to ride my motorcycle and are very comfortable, I wish they had a protector for shifter wear. Very good ankle cushion on both sides."
5.0,"This was the first time I purchased a LIGE watch. This is one of the best deals going on watches. The quality is great. This is a very sporty but handsome watch. It has a sturdy weight but not to heavy. It even came with a link adjuster. I have never seen that, even with very expensive watches I have purchased. I received my order in less than 48 hours. I'll be back for more."
5.0,"I bought these for someone special, they want more of them."
5.0,Thick and nice material.  Cute style and fits well with adjustable neck strap.  I bought 4 and wrapped some up as stocking stuffers for family
5.0,Very comfortable to wear as well as very beautiful
5.0,"The zipper in the back is really sticky and cheaply made, but for 14 dollars the quality as still everything I was hoping for.  I typically wear around size  8 pants so I was nervous the small would be snug but it's perfect."
5.0,Love them and fast shipping
5.0,Loved my new boots
5.0,It took a while to receive these pins but the wait was worth it. The pins are really well made and beautiful. I use them to keep my scarves in place and they add an extra touch of elegance to my classic look.
5.0,I really love all the pockets in this bag! It will be great for travelling.
5.0,Nice shirt true to size. Got a lot of compliments and people asking me where i got it
5.0,"The band that my Fitbit came with was silicone, and it bothered my wrist so much because it trapped sweat and water which caused my skin to break out. These replacement bands are a stretchy fabric that are so much better for my skin and overall comfort. They are sleek and not bulky, so I don't snag objects as I walk by. Love the color options"
5.0,"I want to say that I just love this maternity/nursing bra and recommend it to all pregnant or nursing mothers. This is the most comfortable of all the bras I have tried. You need this in your hospital bag! It has just enough support to wear during the day, and very comfortable (and easy to nurse!) at night. I actually bought 3 (and won one from the company in a giveaway to a deserving mother!) Highly recommend the company too, I can tell they make quality products and truely care about the customers!!"
5.0,The receiver loved it!Washed well too.
5.0,love my new lambswool MacDuff Tartan cape.  Soft and warm...colors are beautiful.
5.0,This was very comfortable while walking around comic con. It didn't shift at all during the day and wasn't snug. Great beanie!
5.0,"Nice colors, good quality. Now is being used for almost a year. Still in a good condition. although it might seem a bit small, it has also a coin pocket which is very important."
5.0,I got this one and the sunflower one and they work great and clip in like the Nike/apple bands.
5.0,"Strong, durable, shiny and pretty!"
5.0,"With the exception of getting a size too big, this ring is perfect. It feels smooth to put on, and is virtually scratch resistant."
5.0,I love these bracelets! I use them to diffuse essential oils and have not had any problem with them
5.0,"Good quality, longer than other from competition."
5.0,For the price just what expected. Love it!
5.0,Easy to put on. Husband loves it. Fit perfect
5.0,The material is very soft and the fit was just right! It was the perfect gift for our camping buddy.
5.0,"A VERY beautiful tote for a phone, although much larger than her phone. Very bright and colorful. I bought the white one with blue trim. Very nice! She'll love it, thank you! The packaging was perfect, although I'm going to take it out of the plastic when I wrap it, as it has a really large 'Made in China' ruining the view of the tote. Otherwise a very beautiful product, well made."
5.0,"I have abnormally thin wrists so most bracelets like this don’t pull tight enough and hang all loose. Not this one! Fits perfectly, easy to put on yourself and doesn’t loosen throughout the day as you wear it."
5.0,"Exactly what I needed for reading in the sun. I do not wear everyday glasses, just readers so it took some time to get used to these.  It is difficult to wear these for everyday activities outside but that was not why I purchased these. The bifocal lens is not too noticeable from the front."
5.0,My son wears sandles all year and these give a little warmth when needed.
5.0,Love this  wish it came in lots of colors I would buy every one of them and washes like a dream.
5.0,always the best
5.0,"A bit big for my head (and I have a big head...lol), but easily adjusted. Dual satin sides allow for my hair to be protected and for me to not worry about putting it on the wrong side!"
5.0,Item was true to size and was exactly what I wanted!
5.0,Fit beautiful love them
5.0,"Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loved it, scored major brownie points with this one."
5.0,"I'm hard to please, but these are perfect length, quality and they're attractive."
5.0,Love this dress. It is stretchy and soft. Fit perfectly. I just ordered another one. You can’t beat the price.
5.0,"This came super quick. I followed the advice of the seller and I ordered up two sizes. I'm 5'7 and weigh 145lbs with a B/C cup size. The chest was a little tight, but not obnoxiously too tight. I ordered a large and it fit perfect. The shirt was better quality than I expected, but it is definitely a hand wash item bc of the beading on the collar. It is somewhat see through, but nothing a cami can't help. Really happy with my shirt and the speed of shipping, received it in less than a week."
5.0,nice fit and look! I get compliments on them all the time
5.0,Perfect fit and beautiful and unique
5.0,What a hit with my grandson! So much so that my daughter cant get the pants or the shirt off of him!!!
5.0,"This was purchased as a gift for my grandson and he absolutely loved it until he lost it at school.  A few days went by with no luck in finding the lost pendant, so I ordered another one.  The universe does work in mysterious ways, the day I ordered a new one the lost pendant was found and returned by a class mate.  I cancelled the order but the new one was already sent out (that was fast), so I figured that I would return it when I received it. Well, customer service sent me an email rejoicing in the newly found lost pendant and since the new one was already on the way they told me to keep it as a gift from them and that they would also credit my account. I am humbled by their generosity.<br /><br />I would also like to say that the pendant is make extremely well.  It is just the right size and I was so pleased to find something that was masculine looking for a 16 year old young man that did not have the likeliness of a skull. Even the name, &#34;The Source&#34;, has positive intonations to it and many compliments have come along with him wearing it.  Thank you for an excellent pendant!"
5.0,"Stylish, light and looks so much nicer than pushing your glasses up every other minute!<br />So many choices, who knew?<br />This is a quality product!"
5.0,Very nice scarf purchased as a gift my friend loved it perfect length and material was beautiful very nice
5.0,"Love it, it’s diff and so cute. I get stopped every time I wear it and get asked where it’s from."
5.0,The only dresses that help my figure look flattering! And super cute versatile they go with anything!! Very comfy too!
5.0,Remember when buying inexpensive jewelry in bulk that not all will work properly but only lost about 4 so not bad at all.  These are stainless steel & not surgical steel so may contain nickel.
5.0,Small package packs and repacked well wore all over Paris...stylish and kept the rain off
5.0,"Fits perfect, and cloth wise it is awesome"
5.0,"I love, love, LOVE this beach cover up!! It's super cute and versatile because you could easily rock this cover up on a date or girls night out with a cute pair of jeans."
5.0,"I was hesitant to order this piece without actually seeing it in person - but so glad I took a leap of faith. This piece is beautiful. It is large and eye catching (in a good way). the chain is sturdy as well. I used the 3 initials of my children, so it is a piece I will wear with sentiment and pride. If you like larger jewelry, this is definitely the piece for you!"
5.0,"Love this dress, lightweight material so colorful and the drawstring for the neck and shoulders makes it easy to change up the look a little"
5.0,I really needed these and they work great. Love that I have colors for every outfit except hubby stole the blk one. I will have to get more :O)
5.0,"I like it, I want more colors for Wear to work"
5.0,"Update:<br />Even better than I thought! I have used this not just as a scarf, but as a blanket, a pillow, a shawl, and a towel. It keeps getting softer, and I love it so much I'm ordering another, because I will use this forever!<br /><br />Incredibly soft! I ordered this for a fall trip to Italy. It is perfect! Large enough to double as a blanket on the plane, thin enough to not look ridiculous when I wear it as a scarf (I am 5' 3&#34;, so I don't want to look like a toddler). I washed it right out of the package and had no issues. If anything, it just made it softer. I love this scarf."
5.0,Leather is nice and the bracelet is really solid - bought this for my daughter who wears it everyday - still in good shape a year later
5.0,Fit better than other cheap safety glasses
5.0,"This is just a spectacular watch to look at.  I have had a lot of nice compliments from people who noticed it, wondering the brand.  The date is a little finicky to get right, but it keeps time very well."
5.0,"This is very nice top - can be worn as a workout bra medium support.  Very nice design.  Runs a bit small, but about right.  Order normal size but if you're close, then go up 1 size."
5.0,Worth buying. Fit beautifully 5'5 128lbs fiancé didn't want me to take it off. Hugs curves in all the right places hides stubborn belly and love handles. Fast shipping.
5.0,"Very pretty shirt. I ordered the small and it fit perfectly. For context, I'm 5'3&#34;, 100 pounds, and have a 32DD/DDD bust(kinda in-between)."
5.0,"Honestly I love these leggings! If you want a cheaper nice quality pair of legging go no further! They feel nice, look great and are squat proof! I'll never buy any other leggings."
5.0,They are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly and the material is very nice and soft and thick<br />I love these there my new fave
5.0,"Good clear view, easy to wear for long periods of time."
5.0,"I'm the type of person that researches things, checks out you tube and ""original"" claims which really may not be the best quality.  Since I'm an old guy I have had my share of wallets... about 6 so far.  I have to say that for this price this is an incredibly good quality wallet...regardless of the BMF embroidery.  First off it is all leather, the only plastic I find is the clear stuff showing the license. Which contains a two sided ID flip holder which is really cool, I keep the Sam Jackson or should I say Jules Winnfield, California Drivers License (included with the wallet) in one and my real license in the other...and being that I'm a white guy I have gotten tons of laughs, which is great! The zipper in the middle is quite useful for a spare car or house key...I even put a micro SD card in it for safe keeping...or an emergency $100 bill.  I like that it has two compartments for paper money and 8 compartments for credit cards. What can I say I love this wallet.  Also just to add about this company that sells this wallet on Amazon has outstanding customer service.  The first wallet I received has some very minor issues with the stitching, they quickly replaced my wallet trusting me that I would send back the defective one...now who does that today?  Don't buy wallet from the Pulp Fiction movie people who get a cut and their wallet looks plasticy...if that's not a word then fake.  This wallet is a great wallet that just happens to look like the original from Pulp Fiction....just in black which I like better."
5.0,Good music Quality
5.0,I really like this scarf.  much prettier that I expected.  It's always a nice surprise when you get something that's better than you thought it would be.  I wish I had ordered more.
5.0,"Love this free people look a like. Comfortable, a little oversized and easy to wear"
5.0,"These glasses fit my head (female) perfectly and are so comfortable.  They do a great job of cutting glare, so good in fact, that I wear them when playing tennis on bright, sunny days."
5.0,I Love it! ❤️
5.0,I put these in my work boots and after a couple of days it made the pain I was having go away
5.0,Great shirt makes a statement. One get noticed in this little number.
5.0,Single best belt i have had.  Only issue i see is that you will form a groove in the belt where you typically keep it.
5.0,"My favorite hat.  Well made, great price"
5.0,They are soft and stretchy and very comfortable and I like the different colors they come in
5.0,"They are too large but that's okay, they are for my grandchildren she's going to love them on Christmas morning they are soooooo....cute."
5.0,"Gorgeous, matches our dress perfectly"
5.0,Feels great on my wrist.  Band is soft and flexible. Latches seem solid. Going to put it through it’s paces in CO next week.
5.0,Very comfortable to wear while I exercise. I really like the inside mesh which allows me to wear this without additional briefs for support. The army green color is unique as well.
5.0,Sister liked it thought she looked cool or something like her fellow k pop lovers
5.0,"I ordered seven different styles and colors of hats from this seller. They all arrived promptly and in excellent condition. They far exceeded my expectations because they were incredibly reasonable.  I used them for a Downton Abbey tea party and everyone was thrilled with their ""fascinators"" . they were comfortable and they give you a choice of either clipping it onto your hair or sliding a thin head band through an opening to wear it as such.  For this price and quality you can not go wrong. They would even be perfect for a wedding party."
5.0,"I purchased these earrings because I wanted to add a classic simple option to my collection. You get 5 pairs of earrings in 5 different sizes. I like that I have a few options.  And even though it is the same earring in different sizes each one can add a different statement. I have included pictures of me wearing the largest and smallest for reference. In my opinion the smallest would be perfect for a second hole piercing.  Or even a top cartilage piercing since it is pretty dainty. The largest earring option is personally a little to large for my taste but that is just my own opinion. I have been wearing the middle options mostly. I would describe them to be a deep grey, dark silver, or even almost black in color. They are comfortable to wear and have not irritated my skin. I am pleased with these and have not had any issues.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is solely my own personal and honest opinion.  Not affected or influenced by any discount that I received."
5.0,Love it ! Super soft and strechy material very comfortable to wear and perfect to wear with a pair of legging ! Will defenetly pick up in the other colors as well ! Very satisfied with this product !
5.0,"I have it 5 stars because it has lasted a month with no problems. It's beautiful and the quality SEEMS sturdy but maybe a little flimsy from the crank up. When the wind blows it wobbles. I am not sure if that is what it suppose to do because the umbrella is so big. If it were any stiffer and the wind blew i would think it'll probably break in half but instead of wobbles a little so it would break. If you see it you'll know what I mean. Another thing is the nylon that is used to open the umbrella doesn't look very strong since the umbrella is so heavy. Not sure if that'll hold long. I think that's what I'm more afraid of because of that does bust, I'm out an umbrella but for now in 100 degree texas heat it's holding up."
5.0,I am trying to build a little collection of tree of life items & this was just perfect to go with my ring. Love it.
5.0,Good material and fits perfectly!
5.0,This was a great collection of pins. We are going to Disney in Feb and this is the perfect start to my kids collection. They are all in great shape and all official disney pins with the mickey backing. Kids will love trading the pins they dont decide to keep!
5.0,Awesome shirt highly recommend
5.0,"Really awesome. Looks exactly like it does in Galaga. Super neat, not too big and not too small and quite sturdy."
5.0,"I got 2 different sizes in case. I normally wear size 8-10 but looking at the size chart & other reviews I got a Large & X-Large. It has so much stretch in them I should have gotten a Medium to get a better skinny fit.<br />Other than that they are super cute & comfortable. They have 4 deep pockets which is really nice because you really don't get that normally with athletic wear. I wish they had other colors available I would buy them too, just not black. -Fireman’s wife"
5.0,Wow! My son will love this. Great present.
5.0,I’m 8 months pregnant and ordered the dress in a Large for my baby shower & it’s the perfect fit & the cutest dress. Truly happy
5.0,Nice scarf easy to fold to put in a middle purse
5.0,"The fit is great, light weight material kind of like football jersey. I personally don't like it, but I can see the appeal that it could have."
5.0,Only issue is it reset itself in my pocket while at work. Found it funny but easy fix. But lots of compliments otherwise. I love it.
5.0,This dress is beautiful and so flattering! I got the green and it is perfect for An upcoming wedding. I am 5’9 and a size 4 and the small fit perfect in size and length. A small could easily fit a size 6 or 8 due to stretch.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter who is 4 months pregnant. She loves it!!
5.0,"I have been buying Gloria Vanderbilt jeans for years, but this time I tried the shorts . They fit as good as her jeans do. I bought them in different colors and they keep their color. They are comfortable through the whole day."
5.0,"My daughter has a size 12 women's shoe. Yet she loves these no show socks, but sadly, finding them in her size is a challenge. She loves these and they don't fall down into her shoes."
5.0,I LOVE these leggings. They fit like a glove and are perfect for working out in
5.0,Very pretty.  Very blingy if thats what you are going for.
5.0,"Pretty, comfy, washes well."
5.0,"I loved the details on the hat, great fit!"
5.0,Awesome keychain. Satisfied buyer.
5.0,"Bought these shades because i needed some clear glasses for nightime cycling. They ship from China so obviously it takes about a month to get them in the mail, but once you get them they are excellent. They come in a case where you can neatly place all the lenses plus glasses. It also comes with everything seen on the picture. The lenses are not your highest quality lenses and have a plasticky feeling to it. Though i only bought them for the clear lenses they're good enough for the price. I have no idea what the white inner thing is supposed to be nor do i have any idea how to put the straps on, but they seem well made for the price and you can have some nice looking and useful shades that won't cost you 80 dollars like others with interchangeable lenses. Definitely recommend them, but be aware of the shipping time."
5.0,I've worn this tunic a lot since receiving it.  It's very soft and fit true to size.  The details on the side make it more interesting than most.  I would order again.
5.0,works just as ordered
5.0,"Love it! Great for the price. Got the Navy, it’s only slightly see through when it stretches. But I mostly sat behind a desk in it so it was fine. Got lots of compliments on it."
5.0,Love this romper. So comfortable yet stylish.  Fit was perfect.
5.0,"love it, great price"
5.0,Very stylish and warm .love it.
5.0,Beautiful robe and so warm; love it!  Great price and fast delivery!
5.0,Great tank top and work out shirt.<br />Fits perfectly and the light material is awesome
5.0,"A little small, id recommend one size larger than what you’d normally get"
5.0,The product was exactly as described!  Very cute and durable along with comfortable!
5.0,Love it keeps me warm ..
5.0,"This wallet is exactly everything I could ever want and need in a wallet. It's small, adorable, and has plenty of slots. I would recommend it to anybody looking to purchase a cute, yet practical wallet. :&#62;"
5.0,"I needed something to keep my pins from getting yanked off of my lanyard at school. I'm a teacher and my students enjoy checking out my new pins so I needed an effective solution to keeping them secure. These pin locks are perfect, easy to use, and you get plenty of them for the price."
5.0,awesome mask!
5.0,Nice inexpensive tie. Cheap..Larry
5.0,Great cooling back gaiter. Light weight and when it is dampened with cold water. Helps you keep even cooler. Easy to move up and down over nose and mouth. Definitely recommend!
5.0,Usually wear for yoga
5.0,Was just what was wanted and needed for the Halloween party
5.0,It looks sweet on me. I like it!!!
5.0,Amazing price for the trendy cute look and fit perfectly!
5.0,Was as advertised lightweight easy to put in ears many compliments
5.0,"Love this belt, i have a few"
5.0,"Just what I wanted, and pretty, too."
5.0,Product just as advertized.
5.0,I liked the material and weight and that you can remove links. I would like it if you capfuls remove a few more links. My wife had to take all removabylinks out and watch is still a little loose but otherwise great product.
5.0,Cute she’s gonna love it for christmas
5.0,Very nice style and lovely dress. I received lots of compliments. Always good to buy a color that suits your skin tone. This color is perfect for me.
5.0,"I received this bracelet as a gift and I love it even more than the picture.  The real color is even prettier than the picture in a good way.  The red is darker; more like a wine/burgundy so the turquiose strand really pops!  And it does adjust small enough for my super tiny wrists!  I will probably end up re-knotting the end to make the strings shorter, but that's not very hard.  Overall, I'm super pleased!"
5.0,So cute! I almost like the black ones more then the rose gold
5.0,I love this purse! It holds everything I need & more than my last one of the same size!! PLUS I have the added protection for my credit cards!!! I haven't had an issue with the zippers at all either so far which is what I feared so Thank you so much a great product at a great price!!
5.0,These are nice quality and I love them!!
5.0,Nice middle of the road hoodie. Not to heavy and not super thin like some other brands. Good Price too.
5.0,We added these in gift containers. My daughter had a space Cowgirl party. These turned out really cute . Great price for 12 pairs too. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"Soft material. It’s not slippery like satin, more like a flannel/poly blend - it’s not as fluffy as fleece, but it will still pick up dog hair. It’s pretty easy to clean. Not exactly the cutest or sexiest looking pajama set, but there are plenty of other options out there if that’s what you’re looking for. These are basic, warm, comfy pajamas."
5.0,"I’m 5’2”, 186 pounds and ordered a size 14 (same size I wear in jeans) and it fits great! Has a little stretch to it, which is nice. I like to wear thick leggings with the fall season so that little bit of stretch accommodates the added padding nicely. At 5’2” this skirt hits right at my knees. Very modest and pretty. I received lots of compliments. Great quality. Have washed it a handful of times In the two weeks I’ve had it and it’s held up well. Very soft and comfortable to wear. Plan to order in more colors!"
5.0,Me encantó ya que mi bebé está empezando a caminar y se había caído en varias oportunidades y ya con estás medias no se resbala y además no le da frio la mejor inversión para mí bebé
5.0,Are usually don’t order prints but decided to try this one based on photos and reviews from other customers. I’m so very glad I did. This dress is extremely flattering and I receive a ton of compliments when I wear it. I am 5’7” tall and approximately 170 pounds and ordered a medium. I would definitely order this dress again in another print or solid.
5.0,"I am in love with this dress. I was skeptical to buy something like this online, but was so impressed. Not only did it fit perfectly,  but the color matched the pictures.  The lace was not itchy and the waistline actually sat where it was supposed to. I'm 5'8"" with longer legs cmvs torso and the length of the dress was perfect for me. I'm debating on buying another for my next special occasion."
5.0,"It is cute, soft and just what i was hoping for.  Capable of holding a decent bit without being big.  Ended up buying another one a few days later so my daughter could have one too"
5.0,This is a excellent night shirt I love sleeping in it
5.0,Amazing product. One of those rare moments where the actual product came in an under-promised/over-delivered state. It is even better than described. I found the elastic weatherproof sleeve on the inside of the calf portion so innovative. It clings tight over your boots and stops most anything from entering. The materials used are tough and durable and man do these OTB pants look cool.
5.0,Did the job for my son’s glow party!
5.0,I love the fact that they are light weight. I love the look of them in my ears too.
5.0,Beautiful watch and great packaging
5.0,I purchased this directly from Speidel and I love it. It's much more comfortable than the original band and looks great too.<br /><br />Their customer service is impeccable. Highly recommend!
5.0,This is a beautiful bag.  The quality of the leather is excellent.  The size is perfect; it's big and strong enough for my laptop and other stuff.
5.0,"was too small for me, but fit my daughter.  She loves the feel and says it is very comfortable"
5.0,Love it great buy
5.0,"Nice shorts, medium-heavyweight not too thin, ordered a large which is what I wear in shorts & these were  snug fitting but the quality is very good"
5.0,"very beautiful! The clicker jewelry is a bit bigger on my face than expected, but I'm very happy with this set"
5.0,"This is a fantastic dress that I absolutely love! The material is thin, but doesn't look cheap. There's a side zip, but I just put the dress on over my head. There's enough stretch to do so. This dress really enhanced my curves and I'd pretty much buy it in every color just for that reason. The pictures speak for themselves. If you have a similar shape, you need this dress!<br /><br />For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large."
5.0,"I bought this to replace an older Russell Athletic sweatshirt that I had used for many years until it finally wore out. It's a good quality, medium weight sweatshirt, but keep in mind that the sizes run very large on these. I normally wear a size large in shirts and sweatshirts, but based on other reviews I ordered this in a size medium and it fits perfectly."
5.0,Stitched together well
5.0,Very nice shades!  😊
5.0,I’ve purchased other gloves in the past and none of them lasted me as long as these did.
5.0,I have received so many compliments on this sweater.
5.0,"The dress was amazing! It was a gift for my aunt and she loved how it fit her and how well it was with the material!!! Definitely best dress to buy, I’m even gonna buy one for myself!"
5.0,I love these glasses!  They are so durable!
5.0,"My granddaughter is into Pi and loved, loved, loved this necklace.  Nice to have something for girls (or anyone, actually).  She has memorized the first 40 Pi digits.  Nice to motivate her interest in mathematics."
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  I'm very small (4' 7"", 80 lbs) and I'm not big into wearing dresses, but when I do, this is my style. I'm used to it being hard to find things in my size so I knew it wouldn't fit perfectly,  but I  like it. It's a little loose around my waist but fits well around the bust. Length falls a little longer than shown on the model, between calf and ankle length. The material seems nice, not too thin or see thru. Will be cute to wear with booties and cardigan this winter and sandals this summer. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Brought this Brooch Pin for  Christmas gift.  She love it...Great gift purchase.
5.0,It could have a little more material in tje chest area otherwise beautiful
5.0,I am very impressed with the quality of this hat.  Good quality material and craftsmanship.  I have a XXXL size head and it fits perfectly without pressure.
5.0,"Great style, excellent fit !"
5.0,Pretty and good fit! I’m pleased!
5.0,I bought these for a family and she said they fit great and they were comfortable.
5.0,"I purchased for my daughter, she looked amazing for her Halloween band costume performance."
5.0,"Its a little bit larger for my head, but its pretty awesome and gets tons of complements!"
5.0,"This waist trimmer was exactly what I needed, easy to use, sturdy and ships quickly."
5.0,"First off, the scarf is NOT cashmere, so if that is what you are expecting then buy something else.<br />Anyway, this works perfect for my Mikasa cosplay. It has a nice dark red color and is rather long. It is wide too, wider than the average scarf; to get it to look right you'll have to fold it over lengthwise a couple times. Very soft and drapey, it is great for cosplay and everyday use!"
5.0,LOOK SUPER HOT ON MY HUSBAND! HE LOVES THEM! VERY CLASSY AND SMALL AND VERY GLOSSY! THEY LOOK AWESOME ON MY MAN!!! :)<br />VALERIE B.
5.0,"The color was very nice, and the color we were looking for the fit was good."

5.0,My Rick Riordan loving daughter... was THRILLED and so excited to get this shirt!!
5.0,Loved this keychain. Got it for my sister for part of her going away gift off to college. Nice little reminder to her!
5.0,"I discovered these about a year ago and love, love them. My only disappointment is that I cannot find them at a neighborhood brick and mortar big box store where I originally found them. I like them because they fit my curves, prevent chaffing from my curves and are a wear them and forget they are on . ..no binding at the leg like a brief occasionally does or anywhere else."
5.0,Awesome panties. Love them!
5.0,"Super cute. Sizing is very forgiving with the smocking. But I recommend sizing up from your regular size. These are meant to be easy breezy summer shorts, and they are! Not to mention they go with everything. Perfect for wearing over a swimsuit to the beach, with a linen button up shirt, or a simple tank. Might have to order a second pair!"
5.0,It was very dainty - petite.  Perfect size and really pretty!
5.0,If it is perfect it's nice that it doesn't have tails the straight cut bottom text in nice it's great for tall and long and big guys shoulders fit perfectly
5.0,Great sunglasses!<br /><br />They look very nice and fit my face and nose very well. The ear hooks hold the glasses on very well. I would definitely recommend.
5.0,This belt feels quite sturdy.  The weave look is attractive.  It's easy to use the buckle.  It is both wide and thick.  The width may be too wide for some belt loops.  It's a nice belt.
5.0,Supper soft
5.0,I'm super happy with my purchase! The print is even more beautiful in person and it feels like it will last me a long time.
5.0,This assortment of gauges met my expectations 100%.  The variety of wood and stone was great!  I also loved the added bonus of them coming in a reusable plastic case which will make traveling with an assortment of gauges a snap.
5.0,"Great, good for body builder leg workout"
5.0,"Exact fit and the material is fantastic, my niece loved it !"
5.0,muy bonito material y buena calidad fue. Para un regalo les gusto mucho gracias
5.0,Me quedo regio
5.0,I love this braclet. But it is bigger and heavier then I expected. I wear it anyway. Maybe more for a Man
5.0,A little smaller than I expected but perfect none the less. Quality was great!
5.0,Very cute necklace.  I purchased it for a birthday and I am sure my little one will love it.  It is very good quality and I am totally pleased with my purchase.

5.0,"Just received this dress today - it fits perfectly, and its a unique piece to liven up a wardrobe. Definitely will purchase more from this company!"
5.0,"Congratulations to the seller, satisfied with the product!"
5.0,Perfect fit. Took a chance on ordering this without even trying on but it paid off. Pants are very comfy and stretch enough to never get that overly tight skinny jeans feeling. Definitely will be buying more in different colors
5.0,The kids loved these . I will buy some more again for trick-or -treat for when the kids walk from house to house.<br />The used these in the summer nights. Luckily we got a set for each grandchild
5.0,"Easier strap to manage than stock. Has been very durable, no issues, looks great."
5.0,I LOVE this necklace!  The bar is really nice sterling sliver and is solid.  The stone/crystal is subtle but classy.  The quality of chain is really good as well.  I love this necklace and would recommend it to others.  You won't be disappointed!  Really great quality for the price!
5.0,It's warm and comfy. My son really loves it. He brought it for camping and keep him warm.
5.0,I got these for my husband to wear. He works for the city and has to wear face cover. But he works outside and its really hot and the case mask covers the city gave them make them sweat really bad. They look the same but different material.<br />My husband loves these no sweating and great coverage.
5.0,"If you are seeking warmth in a short jacket, then this is it. Because of my short stature, I was having problems finding jackets that stopped closer to my waist or just a fraction beyond. Others seem to hand lower and cut me off making me look that much shorter. I am happy with this one! The versatility, the warmth! I am very hot-natured and this one really makes me sweat, BUT that is not a negative comment by far! I am assured of warmth with this for sure and would 'warmly' recommend it! 👍🏾👌🏾"
5.0,"Well it's 100% better than a purple card board box, lol  it's way better than a controller that has no case n u just paid $600 n Xbox can't even throw in a case or a something (Xbox xcloud doesn't work)<br />G-stadia n luna work perfectly with ozzly cases. Also fyi if u got Luna at start u would only b paying $4.99 not $12."
5.0,Bought it for my son he loves
5.0,"Love the charms!!! Great quality, shiny, and fun!!!! Will definitely order again!!!!"
5.0,Great service. Product exactly what I expected!
5.0,Nice color combination.
5.0,I really love the t- shirt
5.0,Adorable. So summery! Fits well. No complaints!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d85987623e4e22c4be468f9a880cf048]] The GUIYING Cuban Link Bracelet is the best affordable iced out bracelet. The video shows this quality bracelet sparkling in sun and shade. Notice how the highly-polished surfaces reflect the ambient light in the early morning light; with CZ stones exploding in color. Wow! As you can see, the GUIYING Cuban Link Bracelet is a great choice for iced-out style without spending a lot of money. I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend GUIYING’s excellent Cuban Link Bracelet to everyone."
5.0,Very sexy shirt but tight in the chest
5.0,was a gift  they liked them
5.0,"This made a great costume for a Christmas party!  It's good quality materials for a costume and looks great in person.  Only two down-sides:  First, the vision out of the mask is extremely limited.  Be carefully walking around in this.  It's do-able, but your peripheral vision is limited and it's easy to bump into things you don't see.  However, it's great for having kids sit on your lap and tell grinchy Santa what they want for Christmas.  Second, the mask gets hot over time.  Not a huge problem, and in my opinion it's a small price to pay for such a wonderful costume."
5.0,Bought 2...one as a gift and one for myself...arrived on time and very pleased with product..
5.0,"Warm, cozy and pretty oncie!"
5.0,Best PJ Pants ever they are freaking sweet
5.0,Son unas sandalias super comodas. Mi sobrina no las suelta para nada. Gracias
5.0,"I love the case!  The screen protect was easy to place,  but it's not exact size to my On5,  but if it's placed centered then the case does cover the little edges.  Oh,  a side note,  my package came with an extra product,  so before you throw the package away,  make sure it's empty!  I will recommend this seller and I will be coming back!"
5.0,"I love these glasses, they are good quality for the price. I have a large round face and love &#34;cat eye&#34; glasses. These are great and I have gotten many compliments on them. They also work well blocking out the sun. The tint is good durability is great."
5.0,I was also skeptical about buying this bikini because of other reviews but I am so glad I did. I am 115 lbs 5'4 size 32C and bought a size small. Favorite bathing suit I have so far and you can't beat the price.
5.0,I'm so happy to have found a light gray husker tee. Fits great. I love long shirts and this one fit the bill.
5.0,Very soft and my niece loves it!
5.0,"I love these socks. I like to wear cute socks for my kindergarteners to see something fun each day. I didn't notice the words until later. But my kinders didn't ""get"" it either."
5.0,Arrived on time and its better than I thought it would be! I love it! And it fit perfect 👌
5.0,Awesome quality. So pretty and priced well. Would recommend ordering a size up for a smoother fit.
5.0,"These work well and are well made. They are heavier than I expected, which I like because I think that makes them very durable. You're lying down when you use them, so the weight is no problem. I've only used them for TV viewing, not reading. I keep them sealed in a plastic ziploc bag when not in use so the mirrors don't get scratched and stay clean. Very reasonable price. And I use them over my regular eyeglasses without any difficulties."
5.0,Perfect plus size inclusion! I'm a thick 2X and the comfort and fit was awesome!<br /><br />The quality is great too. Even after washing/drying it did not shrink or frey.
5.0,BEAUTIFUL earrings!!!  I will be wearing to another wedding next week!!
5.0,My grandson loves tge facemasks

5.0,Liked them very much.  Lite weight and very clear.
5.0,attractive yet small
5.0,"The chains are a little weak, but these are heavy pendants. A great gift for a daughter headed off to college or younger. Comes with a necklace and a keyring."
5.0,"Love it! I am pretty pleased with this bracelet. I originally ordered it for a friend, but it's such great quality, I'm ordering one for myself."
5.0,Very light weight stylish look .  Love them .  Very clear leans sharp images !! Just what I wanted.
5.0,This is a very attractive piece. Different which I like very much
5.0,Awesome product & faster tham expected
5.0,A nice hawaian shirt.

5.0,Perfect for my daughter’s high school gro

5.0,Very comfortable and stretches well for comfortable workout. Love the pocket! I use it for my car key when I go to gym.
5.0,"This seems to be authentic and well made. It was just what I was looking for at a good price. As I had hoped and presumed, it is a navy blue color. The image here is lightened to show detail but isn't the exact shade of blue of the cap."
5.0,These are amazing socks!
5.0,Very cute keys!  I was very pleased with these.
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical at the quality of this product, but it turns out it's a pretty nice cuff! The chains are metal and the cuff is made out of a leather-type material. The skull and swords don't look cheesy at all, and I've been wearing this for over 6 months and it hasn't broke! Pleased with my purchase!"
5.0,"Great quality keychain! You can tell by the construction of it that it is very well made. No skimping here! Heavy weight metal and the strap is very well made. I like that the chain has a clip for easy removal of keys or other key chains, but is also made so that it cannot be easily opened so you don't lose anything by mistake. Comes in a nice bag, would make a lovely gift!"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. It looks amazing. Simple and stunning.
5.0,Love this! The material is great! So soft and comfortable. Love the collar detail so much!
5.0,Super cute! Looks exactly like it did online.
5.0,"I'm a woman around 5'6&#34;/130lbs and this size fits me perfectly. Just roomy enough to allow some flexibility and a layer or two underneath. Additionally, it cuts a great figure for anyone looking for reasonably priced cosplay coats for First Order officers from The Force Awakens."
5.0,Had high expectations for the price.  Not disappointed.
5.0,Works but is a little uncomfortable with the mesh in the inner part of the chin strap.
5.0,"My granddaughter and I both love the Cowboy Kickers, soft, warm and quality, she looks like a cowgirl riding her rocking horse...heehaw"

5.0,This is a fun and cool mask. My son loves it.
5.0,Love the material and fit! Wish it came in more colors.
5.0,"bought this to have a nice house gown during this particularly cold Chicago winter and it's an opulent, sumptuous alternative to a robe or a onesie. super long!! but I like that. It's almost like walking around in a velvet blanket. I'm no small...but bought a small after reading the reviews, sleeves are tight but that relaxed with wear. the rest of the dress fits very loose and flows behind you as you walk."
5.0,"The perfect &#34;jean&#34;! Well made.....fits great......For those of us who are always on the move, this is the pant to have......I just wish it came in more colors! (especially browns/sand)"

5.0,Nice weight/thickness and looks like the real deal! Great price and quick delivery!
5.0,"Got these for my niece who wanted simple, gold earrings. So pretty! Good quality and packaged nicely in a box."
5.0,"I bought this watch band to replace the one that came with my The Horse watch.  The band width (14mm) is the same, but it is thinner/slimmer with tapered edges that suits the watch better.  The band length is also shorter than the one that came with The Horse watch, so i like this one better.  The color combination is pretty close to the band that came with the watch (gray + rose gold) and the rose gold tone is not too different from the tone of the watch face.<br /><br />While one end of the band was easy to snap in, the other side took a lot of frustrated, muttered expletives before it snapped in.  A pair of tweezers might help with the installation if you're having difficulty.<br /><br />Time will tell as to how long the band's paint will stay and it's durability, but it's a very affordable band, so I wouldn't mind replacing it again if I need to."
5.0,"Beautiful finish, highly polished.  Way more beautiful than the photograph.  Comes in its own pouch, which for me makes this gift easy to give."
5.0,I love these.  I have very fair skin and sunburn easily.  I have used these skin coolers for years. I have spent hours in the sun and never gotten my arms sunburned.  I find I am cooler than when I don't have anything over my arms.  I have worn mine hundreds of times.  I would highly recommend them.  I did not buy them from Amazon but will buy my next purchase here.
5.0,Beautiful watch band great style.

5.0,"Great baselayer for keeping the cup tight to your body and in place. Seems to run a little large, I’d order a size smaller than needed to get a snug fit."
5.0,"Ordered Size M and the fit is perfect.  The purple, green and coffee brown colors are lovely and make a great combination.  Overall workmanship quality was top-notch. I am ordering another color today."
5.0,"The gloves left and right, were each in a waterproof bag, an essential feature when living in the Pacific Northwest. They arrived before I ordered them, or so it seemed. But the most crucial part was the fact that my wife loved them."
5.0,I got so many compliments!!! Was too long for me so I had it hemmed. Sleeves are scratchy but the look was worth it.
5.0,Very good product. Protects my hands well. A little tight in the fingers though.
5.0,"Took a chance on this bra it is perfect. Very lightly padded for shape and concealing, and has 4 adjustment hooks vs the normal 3 so this allows for more adjusting to size which is great when you are small and have a hard time finding 32 in the store that actually fits like a 32. It’s just perfect and comfortable and I still look like me but supported and concealed."
5.0,I used these as the base for making custom hats for my family and they were perfect for that!

It is vibrant, so if your kiddo doesn't like these colors or isn't fond of them, I'd suggest not buying it.  Otherwise, it's a great gift!"
5.0,Like the material and the size. Lots of divided storage space for the size.
5.0,"After years of trying to find a band that fits my wrist, I FOUND ONE AND BOUGHT IT!!<br />Can't tell you how satisfied I am with this purchase!!<br />(gonna keep track of this vendor!)"
5.0,If you work in the dust you need this wallet.  My credit cards do not look like complete garbage in a month anymore.  Money clip use nice.  I can pack most of my essentials in this.
5.0,"Great product and doing well so far. Hopefully it holds up for a while, but it brown leather looks very clean on my new watch!<br /><br />Update: After four months, this is still my favorite nato band to wear on my watch! It has been holding up fine and is very comfortable."

5.0,super comfy. love the color.
5.0,"I recently purchased this hat for a trip we took to Mexico. It didn’t come as pictured and the flower that did come on it fell off along with the plastic piece to tether. We made it work. We came home and purchased another hat. Today, I received another one with a letter from the company! They saw my review, apologized for the mix up, and sent a replacement hat.<br /><br />Customer service means everything! Even if we hated the hat (which we don’t) I’d still note just how amazing the company as a whole is!<br /><br />A million thumbs up! Thank you!"

5.0,"So I am a 36 y/o female and I've had 3 kiddos, lately when I wear no bra or a no support built in (like around my home or to run small errands) I notice mild sagging. I get I'm no young perky kid anymore but I don't want to just give up and look (and feel) like an old lady just yet (probably not ever) so I decided to give this product a try in hopes I can give my 'girls' some support without having to wear a full bra every single waking moment. I bought a full size larger than what I am bc I wanted more coverage and they were perfect! Nothing crazy drastic but there's support and a little cleavage and I notice the 'sides' of my boobs were less saggy. All in all I am really loving this product! DEF the mild change I was looking for!!!"
5.0,"Love this for pregnancy. I’m 35 weeks and it’s perfect. The black is a dark grey but looks good, doesn’t look like a faded black. I really like it. Warm and super soft."

5.0,They're very cute and seem well made. Sizing was spot on.
5.0,"I love Snoozies! Very comfortable, soft and warm.  I wear these, and other colors, around the house in winter.  Allows me to be confident and secure when going up and down steps as the non-skid bottoms keep me from slipping and falling down the stairs."

It comes with a sterling silver magnetic clasp, which also has an additional closing mechanism, so the bracelet stays closed while wearing.

5.0,My son loves this wallet. I would recommend this to anyone.
5.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend who has mother issues and is obsessed with the cookie monster. He broke up with me and then the package arrived.

5.0,"I'm really glad I finally tried this wayfarer style for reading glasses. I usually like that style for sunglasses, so I figured why not try it for reading glasses. It's retro and great. The white bamboo color is like a light wood/slightly peach color. The lenses have a touch of amber tint, and they work great for computer reading."
5.0,"I love this dress.  The material is kind of like basketball jersey , which I didn't care for at first, but now really enjoy.  It seems less cheap, it's shiney, won't wrinkle or pill, but I can see where some reviewers would think that it is too warm on hot days.  The fit is just right.  I purchased the Large - I'm 5'8', 170lbs (and pregnant) and this fits in the placed I want it to and is loose in the right places too.  Perfect length.  The flower pattern is not exactly the same as the picture, I'm guessing the flower placing is different with every dress depending on the fabric roll."
5.0,"I just love this necklace. simple and elegant necklace The quality is super. Actually I was surprised see the quality of the necklace. The pearls are also of good quality.great value for money. The fishtail pendent is movable, it was nicely packed . I am very much impressed with the product, I ordered this for my friend and now I would like to buy one more for my self.

5.0,So far it works great. Lots of room and survived a couple of flights so far with no problems.
5.0,VERY NICE QUALITY
5.0,Material was nice. I ordered a size up and it was a little loose. It's very comfortable and I wore it for most of the day. I like the 3/4 sleeves and wish more dresses had them . I'm 5'2&#34; and the dress came just below my knee . Love that I can wear it to church !
5.0,"My daughter loved these!  Unlike traditional slap bracelets, these have a soft lining so they can be worn comfortably!"
5.0,"El producto llegó en una semana, es realmente divino  el color me cautivó"
5.0,It's a a tentacle hat. What more do you want?
5.0,"This is a very nice little set of earrings. It comes with a lot of extra backs which I love, because I'm constantly losing them. They look very nice on me, very comfortable (barley even notice them), and I've gotten a lot of compliments. They also shipped and got delivered faster than expected."
5.0,"My daughter loves these! I bought them for a Valentines Day photo shoot. She said they are so comfortable she wants to wear them to school (She's a little wobbly on them so that won't happen :) overall, great fit, color and comfort!"
5.0,Love this shirt and every shirt that part of the money spend on it goes to help my fellow veterans.
5.0,Love theses bags and the bag that comes with them to keep them all together!
5.0,I love this ring doesnt turn your finger a different color or anything.
5.0,Great gloves at a great price! They're super soft and still allow use of touch screens. They did leave a little fuzz behind on my hands after the first few wears but they fit great and seem to be good quality.
5.0,I love it and its warm
5.0,"Great deal, nice product."
5.0,Looks just like the pink sand band at the Apple Store but at a Great price. Delivered on time!
5.0,very good-not to sweet
5.0,Cute go to boots
5.0,I've worn these for months now as my everyday so I don't treat them the best... I throw them in my purse or sling them on the table and they have not scratched or broken in any way. They are much darker than regular sunglasses. Don't try to wear them inside.
5.0,"This is the perfect storage and display case for my ever growing collection of wrist watches (working and non-working). Light weight, plenty of room and handsome enough for front room display."
5.0,"These fit perfect! I love that the high waist is compression, so it smooths me out and holds in my gut tight. I love the pockets on both sides, but most importantly they are NOT SEE THRU!!! Will be buying more of these."
5.0,My son loved it. Used for soccer and trips.
5.0,"Bought it for my wife. She used it, which should say a lot..."
5.0,these worked great for us on our recent 16 hour flite to Asia 2018 legs felt great and were not to tight..
5.0,Love this bag.  Use it for my nurse equipment. I like that it has so many pockets. It's a good quality can as and good zipper.  The strap is comfy too.
5.0,I was looking for something nice and not too big as I have very small wrists and this fit perfect!! They also provided the tool to take out the links which made it so much easier to change the size of the band. I would definitely recommend this watch!!
5.0,This set just knocks my eyes out.
5.0,"I love this dress! I wore it to my graduation.  It's not cotton so don't iron it, rather steam it or hang it in the bathroom while you shower.  It's a little short on me (I'm 5&#34;5') it comes a couple inches higher then the back of my knee."
5.0,"Extremely comfortable.  Washes well, holds shape and after many washes color is still vibrant. I love the feel of fabric. Lightweight but still warm enough to wear year round."
5.0,Sweet shoes! Love them!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5ab78e2338f446bb3abe3e32b492715a]]
5.0,"Very cute and good quality shorts! The waist ribbon fits like a belt with little slots for it on the sides and the back. Modest length, and is high waisted. (i'm about 5'0&#34;) Good material for the summer, and comfortable! A little poofy and kind of looks like a skirt when you stand in certain positions, but other than that I totally recommend!"
5.0,This is a very nice wallet but the magnet clasp does not securely hold if using an iPhone 6/6s. It would fit an iPhone 5/5s. I contacted the company & they are ordering additional sizes & told me to check back in the future.
5.0,Love them! Amazing quality and color. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Love this product! Simply beautiful.
5.0,"This stainless steel watch band is very attractive, solid, comfortable, seems to be very well constructed, and is an amazing value. It was a bit fiddly to attach to my watch, even with the tool, but not really a problem.  (Be sure to do this over a surface where you can find the pin if it comes shooting out.)  The band is a bit long for my rather small wrist, which means that the clasp is not directly opposite the watch, but up the side a bit, but again not a significant problem.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase."
5.0,These are exactly like what the images are. They are a little see through as you stretch the material however I recommend you buy the the size that you normally wear as I ordered a size up and they were kinda too big.
5.0,"There colorful, shiny fuzzy and warm. My 7 year old loves them!"
5.0,"Well made, looks great. A tiny bit short for the sharp car key it was bought for. My fault - make sure you measure!"
5.0,works well and priced well
5.0,My hands have never felt so good when wearing theseYou basically have two choices on Amazon when it comes to these types of gloves and this is definitely the better choice bigger thicker metal strands less glove the other one is more glove than metal these ones actually do some thing and help my hands feel much much better they may not deserve a five star review but compared to the other only option on Amazon these things kick ass metaphorically speaking of course
5.0,Great sock very durable
5.0,The size it perfect. The ring looks just like the picture.
5.0,Actually prettier than picture. Perfect size.
5.0,"Perfect fit, not too big not too small"
5.0,"I sent this ring to 1 of my daughters, she says it's beautiful and fits perfect!!"
5.0,These are classic Tingley toe rubbers.  Will protect your shoes in rain or light snow.  Good traction.  Look good and don't detract from your shoes.
5.0,"I absolutely love my hat.  It's very feminine and looks delicate, but isn't."
5.0,I love this dress....the material is thick and it's not cheap.
5.0,"These are my current favorite boots. It’s hard to find barefoot boots that look like something an adult woman would wear, and not giant duck feet made for casual wear or exercise. These fit the bill though. They’re classic enough to go with anything, and the buckle detail gives just enough of an edge that you don’t look like you’re wearing orthopedic shoes you borrowed from grandma.<br /><br />Fit was perfect for me, and my feet are loving the freedom. I have slowly transitioned myself to all barefoot footwear and can’t say enough about how doing so has helped with foot and leg pain. I can walk miles in these boots and have done so more than once. They were comfy out of the box and will accommodate a wool insole for added warmth if you need it. The only thing that needed a bit of break in was the elastic, which was a little sharp on the edge at first and required wearing the boots with tall socks for the first few wears. Now it’s no longer uncomfortable but still feels sturdy enough that it won’t stretch out of shape.<br /><br />I was concerned about some reviews stating that they were hard to get on and required a shoehorn but that wasn’t the case at all for me. After a week of break in, I can slip them on my feet without even bending over. But they’re not loose or floppy, they have a nice tight silhouette on the foot and don’t look baggy at the ankles.<br /><br />Overall best boot I’ve bought in a long time, way better in look and fit than the Fordham boots by vivo, which look like enormous bulbous duck feet. If you, like me, have second and middle toes that are longer than your big toe and have found vivo boots to be too short in that part of the toe box, leading to uncomfortable toe rubbing, you most likely won’t have that problem with these boots. They have plenty of room for a barefoot toe box while not looking excessively wide, and don’t cut off too short across the toes.<br /><br />The leather is soft but thick and feels like lasting quality. They are easy to clean and so far have not leaked water around the seams where the sole attaches, another problem I had with the vivo boots. Overall they are well worth the money. Also, they are completely genuine, so if you have hesitated to order straight from groundies website due to the conversion rate and long international shipping but have worried the ones on Amazon might not be real, you can feel confidant making this purchase.<br /><br />Buy these boots if you want comfy barefoot fit without sacrificing style. You won’t regret it."
5.0,"These boots are comfy and cute, sometimes I wear them around the house because of how supported my feet feel"
5.0,"I was positively surprised about the good quality for the price and that the item was packaged in such a stylish, beautiful gift box. This makes a perfect gift for the birthday or Christmas. I am sure my younger sister is going to be happy when opening this Christmas present. The necklace with this pendant can be easily used with everyday outfit because it is not too striking and the size is perfect, not too small, not too big."
5.0,Amazing quality for the price!! I’ve bought several sequin dresses much more expensive than this and the quality is almost the same!
5.0,Amazing dress! Super cute!
5.0,love the harry potter socks. super cute
5.0,I loved it so much I gifted it and they love it too.  Who wants a big wallet? It good if you don't have a lot of stuff in your wallet.
5.0,Great fit and perfect for biking and kayaking!
5.0,SO cute !! And super warm
5.0,Very nice. Is small 2 sizes!!
5.0,Very good! Recommended
5.0,"Great shirt! Bright colors, holds up in wash, true size"
5.0,It is a beautiful shirt!
5.0,"This is darling and great quality too, My son loves dinosaurs he just doesn't know it yet. :)"
5.0,This was purchashed as a gift for my 15 yo grandson. He survived being ejected from a car during a rollover accident. I had it engraved with the date of the accident.<br />We are very pleased with the quality of the items and the speedy delivery.
5.0,It's cute and comfortable and good quality.
5.0,I ordered this 1 size bigger than normal because I like a loose fitting sweatshirt. The other reason  I ordered bigger is because over the years I've gone cheap and bought those cheap Walmart sweatshirts for $6.00 that are thin and shrink to an infant size. These shirts are thicker and hold up very well when you follow the washing tag.<br />Order the normal size you wear with confidence. You will be satisfied.
5.0,"Can't say enough about these sock~beautiful, soft, sexy, feel great on my feet! They are prettier in real life than on the page~I have never had socks like these before~I wear a SZ8 shoe and these fit me to a T~ They are light-weight which is great for me~ You will be glad you purchased these~I will be buying more colors~ I do have the black ones too ~Took awhile for them to get here but knew this before I ordered them, well worth the wait!"
5.0,"These are extremely comfortable to wear and look nice. Good, quality, product."
5.0,I love this case!  Philly girl!  Loves my Eagles.  The Eagles logo is understated and case is lightweight
5.0,Awesome! Fits Perfect! Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"I love this dress and the color and the style. The bride don't want me to ware this dress because match with her wedding dress, so I have buy some thing else. Every time I go on line look at the Amazon side my eyes on this dress all the time. BEAUTIFUL dress and the price. OWESOME"
5.0,"This is such a flattering and versatile wardrobe piece.  It goes great with fitted tops as well as those with a little volume (for us pear shaped ladies), both tucked in.  The band is thick enough and lays nice and flat so I don't feel the need for a belt with any of my looks.  I find it looks great with both heels and flats.  I've washed them on the gentle cycle and hung them to dry and the pleats have remained intact.  The material weight is really nice; I feel comfortable on hot days and cool days.  I think it's at least a 3 season skirt here in Virginia, if not year-round.  It has nice bounce and movement w/out being flimsy.  I get compliments every time I wear them!  I'm 5'3&#34;, 118lbs with 36&#34; hips and 26&#34; waist and the small fits me perfectly.  It's a high waist skirt so I wear it just over my belly button."
5.0,Not a deal breaker but great for the price.
5.0,Great clutch for a wedding! So beautiful and sparkly- I was really impressed with the quality for the price!
5.0,I have a few sets by this brand and they’ve held up pretty well. Size up because they run small and for me a looser fit is more comfortable anyway. The material is very nice and the sets are very comfortable.
5.0,Love them. Just as expected
5.0,Great looking & very well made.
5.0,Great gift for an animal lover!
5.0,Love it just as described! :)
5.0,"These hats fit adult-sized heads and are made of plastic. We used them for a jungle themed gymnastics meet and had the staff members wear them. They are silly hats, but they add a nice touch to the theme. They can also easily be decorated and used as a craft!"
5.0,I liked what I ordered.
5.0,"My daughter thinks they are beautiful.  I bought her a size large, but an X-large would have been better. (5’4 and 172 pounds).  They are fancy enough to show under some shirts, but she will most likely use this in summer with lower cut shirts."
5.0,Fits well and is very pretty!
5.0,"I really enjoy this mask! It is lightweight and comfortable to wear, especially for long periods of time. Helps not make wearing a mask in the dead of summer not so miserable"
5.0,"Great Jersey, piazza was a beast."
5.0,I am very happy with the quality and color. I love this dress.
5.0,works amazing
5.0,Very soft and fit my daughter well! She loves wearing it!
5.0,Beautiful. Great size and the stones were vibrant. Also appreciated the gift bag that came with it. It was a great gift.
5.0,My daughter wears this all the time.  It's been washed several times and holds up great.
5.0,"This is a very well made and highly visible jacket. I couldn't believe the price I got it for here; maybe the hi-viz one wasn't selling well. Plenty of ventilation for riding in warm weather, without sacrificing protection. There's also a lot of adjustability in the fit. This size (XL) fits me well and isn't too short in the torso, like some other jackets I've had (I'm 6'04"" and about 210 lbs). The liner that comes with it is substantial. Looks like it would provide good protection from rain and probably keep you comfortable in cooler temperatures. I haven't used the liner yet myself though. The liner could also be used alone as a light to medium weight jacket while not riding."
5.0,"I love this wide pants. I bought green flowers one at first. It looked exactly same as a photo.<br />So, I bought orange flowers one as a 2nd one. Well...I thought it was orange.. its NOT. But, i still like the stylish."
5.0,Good quality and arrived on time!
5.0,It’s a great onesie
5.0,It was nice and it fit me just right.
5.0,I love the pendant... Chain too small
5.0,"Love this Dead Pool mask especially if you are a fan.... fits well, comfortable, good mask for COVID 19, excellent purchase!!"
5.0,Very flattering.  Fit as expected.  It is perfect.
5.0,"Get a lot of compliments when wearing this unique looking pair of earrings, I have a long neck and this are about 4 1/2&#34; long."
5.0,"I bought this necklace as a birthday gift for my friend. She absolutely loved it, she scared me because she said ""That's not how you spell my name"", i could see by her face and the way her eyes were shinning that she was really happy with this gift. It is a well made product and looks very elegant."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4e1a139ed7e1f1e4db422a77f663b04e]] Nice bag. I have also included a video review which I hope clarifies some of the written portion and/or augments it to allow you to get an idea of the ins and outs of the bag. As I mentioned in the video, Prottoni has to garment bags on Amazon, both of which are very well made and well thought out designs and I believe made with different consumer needs in mind.<br /><br />Features:<br />-2 Large Pockets<br />  &#60;&#62;These pockets are deep and extend the length of the bag. Each is zippered shut and each is wide open meaning it does not contain additional<br />  organization features you may have seen in similar type luggage such as extra pockets for organization .Functionally this makes sense as<br />  anything in this type of pocket would fall out when the bag is hung in the open position and you would thus lose the organizational benefit.<br />-Shoulder strap with comfort guard<br />  &#60;&#62;Unlike the 44 inch model, this trap attaches to opposite points of the bag on the same side. This is made possible by the reinforcement<br />  location along the top side of the bag.<br />-Dual Clip closure (in folded position)<br />  &#60;&#62;This is a key difference between this model and the 44 inch model. This models is opened much quicker and easier with the dual clip design<br />  (see video) as opposed to the 44 inch model which has a 180 degree zipper.<br />-Single hand carry rigid strap<br />  &#60;&#62;Another key difference between this model and the 44 inch. This handle is rigid plastic and looks very elegant and professional. It is situated<br />  along the reinforced metal side which maintains the bag shape when all of the weight is focused on the center during hand carrying.<br />-The main hook that the entire bag hangs from in the open position is a single nylon strap (seen in the photo at the bottom of the bag) and is attached via two metal latches. The other model has a metal hook connected to a nylon strap that serves this purpose.<br />-Full internal zipper closure with snap on flap<br />-Strap on inside that keeps items in place with snap clip closure (the 44 inch model has a strap which is closed via two loops (see video)<br />-A bottom reinforcement which maintains the bag in its rectangular form while hanging from the wall so that the contents remain more viewable and less deformable.<br /><br />I don't believe there were any drawbacks to this bag. I have used both this model and the other on trips and think they were both made well with different users in mind. So please also check out my review on the 44 inch Prottoni bag to compare and contrast the two and make an informed buying decision.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review."
5.0,"These look just like the photo, and they came on time, packaged nicely in a bubble wrap envelope. As others have said, the post were bent,so I gently straightened them back without breaking them. I want to say they came with backs, but I found only one earring back. It wasn't on the earring, it was separate in the package, so maybe they just forgot to put one or it fell out before it shipped. No big deal, I can use backs from another pair of earrings.The edges of the petals are a bit sharp, so this may not be suitable for children. They are very adorable though, and I hope I can wear them out soon :)"
5.0,"I like this pendant very much,good good good!!!!"
5.0,My son loves these and is 11 years old and not a big kid.  They do fit him though.  Might be a little loose in the legs.  I wish they made these in a kids size but the smalls work for him.
5.0,These compression socks are great. They fit nice and stay up all day and night. I wear a size 11 shoe and my legs swell often so it's hard to find compression socks that are long enough and stay up and don't pinch. These are perfect. I highly recommend them.
5.0,"A beautiful statement ring that can go either with casual or dressy clothes. And for the price, you can't beat it."
5.0,queda como se espera
5.0,Super cute on. Pants are soft also.
5.0,Item just as described. Fast shipping

5.0,MY dad is a huge dead head and went nuts over this hoodie.
5.0,I love the quality of this top. It is exactly as described.
5.0,I chose this rating because the set is beautiful. I love  the navy blue and white pearls and the matching earrings.  I like the size and shape of the pears. I also like the length of both the earrings and the necklace. I do have other pearls but this is my first blue and white combination.
5.0,loved this band. it arrived on July 13th but by August 2nd it was broken. one of the screws holding it together came out and i discovered this when my watch fell off my wrist and hit the floor.* UPDATE* was able to return and get a replacement with no problem. The replacement is perfect and holding together well. i would also like to mention that this sellers customer service is top notch!
5.0,Wife loves it. Wears it everyday. Thank you
5.0,The look says it all!
5.0,comfortable and gorgeous
5.0,may want to size up.
5.0,I bought this for my karate crazy 12 year old son<br />It is a solid beautifully constructed piece that will be able to be handle being worn by a 12 year old boy<br />I was very happy with the quality
5.0,i love the size & the way they fold up so easily
5.0,"These mask are very thin and comfortable for my grandchildren ages 8, 11 and 12."
5.0,Fit was a little big but I was able to work with it. Material was a higher quality than expected. Length was perfect. Super comfortable to wear.
5.0,Cool socks! Right between dress sock and athletic sock thickness.
5.0,This ring is beautiful.  The detail is amazing.  Love this ring.
5.0,"I love these silicone bands. I have owned several different sets as a nurse and they are fabulous. I love that they come in a variety of colors and that they are comfortable to be worn. My husband and my professions make it hard to be able to wear our wedding rings and this is important to us. As a nurse I can't be wearing rings that can scratch or tend to harbor germs. I also sometimes take them off when I wash my hands so I am at risk of losing an expensive band. These watch so well not having crevices. I can also match them to my scrubs and if I lose one then it's no big deal. My husband is a mechanic. After years of bent rings, one day his ring got smashed on his finger. He almost had to have it cut off so I said enough is enough and bought him these bands. He loves them. No more worrying about scratching his wedding ring at work either. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Do I give every product 5 stars? No I do not. I'm an avid online shopper and base much of my purchases on others reviews so my reviews really are honest. If this review has helped you please click the bottom below."

5.0,great product and great price. covers all waist types
5.0,This dress was DARLING! Totally looked like the pic and was an excellent quality. Wore it a few times over the summer and got lots of compliments!
5.0,Good band. Fits ok with Garmin15.
5.0,Love this cardigan. The fit is perfect. If you like doloman sleeves this is a must buy.
5.0,"bought this a few weeks back and LOVE it!! it fits really nicely, gets a lot of compliments and truly makes me feel like a goddess when I wear it!!"
5.0,perfect to wear with my leggings. Love the lace around it.
5.0,Not true to the size. I recommend going a size up as it was too tight to wear.
5.0,This scarf is so perfect for my granddaughters Easter basket this year. I know she will get hours of use as she does with all her Sarah’s Silks.
5.0,"I use these bras everyday. Colors are great. No support just coverage. Surprise the lace is very nice not scratchy perfect stretch. I just use them to have something cool to wear under thinner blouses and t-shirts. If you don't need lots of support just a little coverage these work great.  Nice lace cover in the front looks like a cami but without all the extra material, just covering the essential part of your breasts. Very light weight, very light padding in cups(removable) just enough to keep them from being see through. Mine have been washed in the machine, gentle cycle then air dry. They are still looking like new. I would buy these again. I am 5'5"" weight 105 lbs. bras are one size, they stretch very little on me so the fit is not loose, not tight. Since they are pretty lace seeing part of one under clothing is no big deal, you might just want to show off part of one."
5.0,"This bad is awesome, I love it. I might even a second one to keep around. I give it an A+++++++"
5.0,"These are the cutest sunglasses, they came with a little cute black cloth case, and a mini screwdriver thingy that was a life saver because another pair of my favorite sunglasses were coming undone and I thought they were a goner, but they saved them! I really like how these look on me, I used to think this shape was wierd but for females i think its really flattering. would buy in another color !!! probably the coffee or reddish color"
5.0,"This is by far the best WWE shop replica belt, that isn’t a a Deluxe or Elite, that has ever been made. It’s big, it’s thick, it’s detailed, the strap is not as stiff as other WWE replicas, and it’s heavy. Beware! It isn’t for large waist men. I wear a 42” waist pants and it snaps on the last set of snaps. This replica is the first one to rival Fandu made belts.  If you like the belt on TV, you will love having this one around your waist or on display.  For the price,  it is well worth the money."
5.0,"This mask has to be seen as pictures can't capture the awesomeness.  It captures attention, yet doesn't appear intimidating.  It's a mask that provides great fun.  Quality and fit is great.  Comfort might be an issue for some, but hasn't been an issue for us."
5.0,"Decreased glare from incoming lights.  Light, good fit for my face.  Well finished."

5.0,Comfortable to wear. Like the color also.
5.0,Love this product! Excellent quality and a must have!
5.0,These are the cutest little shoes!!! Grand daughter loves them! They get lots of compliments! We ordered the next size up for when she outgrows this pair!

5.0,Keeps you hands extremly warm
5.0,Its foam material not plastic but it works !
5.0,"Beautiful, light weight, great movement."
5.0,We gave this to my sister-in-law as a birthday present.  She LOVES dogs.  This one looks a lot like one of her current dogs too.  The picture is cute and she was thrilled.
5.0,"I took a leap of faith, this having zero reviews and all, and just went ahead and ordered it.. because it was the type of dress and color I was looking for on short notice and low budget.. and y’all I’m so glad I did! I got the size 4, I’m 5’9 and 120lbs and it’s perfect for me. Comes down to the floor when it’s on, which is great because I’m tall, so usually dresses will be a little too short, which would look awkward. I like the material, it’s kinda stretchy which I wasn’t expecting but happy for. You can’t see my bra straps or underwear line. This dress is great. If your thinking about it, do it!"
5.0,"I'd had a similar dual eyeglass case for years, but my new glasses didn't quite fit.  I didn't want to carry two cases, one for reading and one for sunglasses, so I was thrilled when I found this product.  It's functional and attractive; just the right size to hold both pairs of glasses.  The product was delivered within just a couple of days of placing the order, so I would definitely order from this seller again."
5.0,Great sign for our favorite driver!!  Love it!
5.0,great fit at a great price!
5.0,Beautiful skirt! Wore it all night and I didn't have to keep adjusting it!
5.0,"Love this watch. I'm not a watch geek by any means, but I like well crafted things and this watch is that. Like the blue dial as well. Seller shipped really fast and it was packaged extremely well. Thought it might be a bit large but it's not. Seiko puts out a quality product for sure. Might have to get a Sumo next. Am I becoming a watch geek???"
5.0,"Bought this for our 15 m/o to help protect him from the brutal desert sun and I am so glad we did. It has helped save him from sun-burns and brings a smile to almost every persons face. The fit it pretty true to size, our son is a small fry so the arms are a little long but other than that it fits great. I love the hood and how covered it keeps him. We put sunscreen on under his suit as a pre-caution but I feel like the UV protection of the suit itself is very strong. It's a great suit and we highly recommend it."
5.0,Loose and silky. I have more of these loungers in different colors. Love the fit and texture. Easy care...wash and I hang mine to dry.
5.0,perfect necklace to dress up or down!  Very Pleased!
5.0,Fits my iPhone watch perfectly
5.0,"This bag exceeded my expectations in a couple aspects:<br /><br />1.) Construction is very sturdy and has held a good deal of weight without any issue.<br />2.) I was originally concerned about the size of the bag and if it would hold enough. There is a ton of room to pack items in this bag, numerous pockets for organizing and it's easy to carry with the shoulder strap.<br /><br />It had a very distinct smell when I first started using it, but after a couple trips it had gone away completely. I would highly recommend this bag for those looking to have a solid quality weekender at a very affordable price."
5.0,gifts..people liked them a lot
5.0,get a lot of compliments
5.0,I love these shoes. I have them in every color
5.0,Perfect fit; perfect color combo.
5.0,"they block the sun and look awesome, no need to say more"
5.0,"This adorable fox is exactly as expected. It's a good solid weight, and the detail is just beautiful."
5.0,"Looks so high end, was not excepting the necklace to be made that well and beautiful casing for the stone."
5.0,"Love this band. Im huge on the holidays and everyone gets a kick out of this. The band does not seem to be made out of durable material, (cracks in the color) more of a softer plastic rather than a leather type feel. But in the end will last me for this holiday season and hopefully more, as i use this watch all day."
5.0,"Perfect weight fleece for me. I tend to run on the hot side, this robe is perfect. I wish it came in a tall size, it hits a little below my knee (I am 6 foot tall)."
5.0,Beautiful watch.  Great price and it looks expensive.  Love it!!!
5.0,Unicorn print leggings are cheap Black Milk knockoffs that look like the real deal. Super bright and cute.<br /><br />I'm a size 10/12 and these one size fits most are pretty snug. Just wore for a few hours to a concert and paired with a flowy tunic top just in case I burst the seams but the seams made it through. I think these are sturdier than the look. These would fit a size 8 and under much better.
5.0,"I love France (wish I could speak the language a lot better than I do now), so I get the charm."
5.0,"I like having a variety of watch bands for my Apple Watch. I purchased the leopard double banded elastic band and I love it. Fit is so comfortable, right enough to that it does not move around but also loose enough that sometimes I forget I have it on. Plan to purchase some more!"
5.0,Works very well easy to use easy to Put in and take out.
5.0,"love this brand the material is soft and nice and the price is really reasonable, washed them both regular wash did not shrink, doesn't need ironing<br />its just awesome."
5.0,This is a really great tie for the price. Its just your standard length and width... what else can I say!!!
5.0,Fits perfect and nice big hoodie
5.0,"I got these in about 3 days. When I opened up the package there was the shades and also a black pouch. To me it feels like I got my money's worth. Also, The shades don't look cheap at all, In fact if they would of have Ray Bans on the side, I would have mistaken them for those :D Ohh almost forgot, these are sunglasses so of course its going to look dark when you look through them so don't use them in the night."
5.0,16g 12 mm perfect for eyebrow rings
5.0,I love this sweater. It’s like a poncho with sleeves. Loose fitting but fun to wear! I got a small and am 5’6 and 115lbs. The sweater hits my hips.
5.0,Fits helmet perfectly and great tint.
5.0,Nice sweatpants
5.0,Perfect though too big on me I’m 5’8 and 148lbs I got large
5.0,"This is a wonderful piece. The details on it are awesome!  It does say &#34;I am a Catholic, please call a priest&#34;  This is not shown on the description.  It is a very heavy piece of Sterling Silver for the price I spent.  I am very happy with it!"
5.0,I got these today after just ordering them maybe3 days ago. I got jack which is why I ordered these and yeah some of them don't unscrew but all of the ones I got I would wear so one or 2 unscrewing isn't a bug issue with me. The issue really was wether or not I got jack lol but I also got to to kernel and Minnie Mouse which aren't pictured. Oh and the superman logo! To get 30 of these when 1 is $15 at my local mall is unheard of. Even if I only got 1 that unscrewed it was cheaper than I would have paid at the mall! So happy with this product
5.0,Just what THIS fat man needed to make his vest FIT!!
5.0,Nice! It is a crop top with a skirt. It might not be high quality but to me it is simple and perfect. 😊
5.0,lenses fit perfectly. would defiantly order again.
5.0,Beautiful!  Ordered an orange and turquoise necklace to go with it and it matched perfectly.  I love it!
5.0,The shirt is as advertised but was too tight around the bicep and chest
5.0,They work great for pulling weeds
5.0,"They’re cute. Perfect fit. Nice material, pleasing colors."
5.0,Arms run small but baby I ordered a size up Xl and I'm in love sexy!!
5.0,This shirt/bra is great! Day 1 I wore it all day! It’s great material and fits amazingly! I will buy more just to have more colors! Definitely Buy it!!
5.0,Love em! Bought them in two colors!
5.0,No more chasing (and giving up on finding) captive beads.  No more snagging the ring in a comb and then chasing that dang bead again.  18g 18mm steel
5.0,Great color combination. Sits nicely in the neck!
5.0,My daughter loved it. It was a birthday present
5.0,Beautiful sandals. My girls loved them!!!
5.0,"These are really beautiful just like the picture- but they were a gift for a very petite soon to be bride & they were too large when actually tried on (petite ears too). Regretfully, having to return- I do not like returning, ever! Even the bride to be loved them and found them to be gorgeous! But the seller doesn’t deserve a bad rating-it identifies the size (bc some don’t) & I love double sided earrings- they’re ingenious! But I’m not a white pearl kinda girl🙃"
5.0,"Just here to balance out the revi3ws. Three (or one) people think this website is somewhere they can express their political frustration, instead of product reviews"
5.0,Very nice quality with pretty marled yarn.
5.0,fits really well!
5.0,Cute keeps legs warm. Highly recommended
5.0,"I bought them while they were on sale so they were a bargain.  The gel inserts feel more like a stiff foam, but they're comfortable and protect well for my daily rides.  They seem a tad small to me, but spandex stretches so....<br />All in all, I'd definitely buy again."
5.0,"I was looking for a dress for a fall wedding and thinking it will still be warm weather I bought this dress-so glad- it is not ""the same old thing""  elegant and vibrant  I am  5'1 and wear 14-16 and  XXL is just right"
5.0,Worked as advertised on a tarnished silver pill case.
5.0,"Adorable. Understated and classy while showing love for all things bunny.  Took a few weeks to arrive, but that's a-ok!"
5.0,Love the Pockets while still be simple! Very functional!
5.0,Works 3
5.0,Very warm and comfortable jacket
5.0,"First, I love this dress so much that I bought two, and might buy more. Second, very flattering on basically everyone. Third, perfect for hot weather, warm weather, breezy weather, maternity, postpartum, too much pizza… you get it. I was super worried when I read all the reviews saying this dress shrinks after washing, even with cold water and air dry. It doesn’t. But I thought mine did. Like I thought it shrunk several sizes! What happened? The fabric is crepey, so it’s actually just bunched up, though it doesn’t look like it. I promise, it’s not permanently shrunk. And even if you don’t believe me, try this anyway. Hand wash cold water, lay flat to dry, but don’t dry it completely. Next, iron it while still a little damp on the highest steam setting on your iron (if it’s all the way dry, just mist the dress with a spray bottle). I don’t have an actual steamer so I don’t know if that will work. I did this and my dress went completely back to the original size. Et voila! Now I don’t have to buy a new dress!"
5.0,its Beautiful
5.0,"They are really good bags, pleased with my purchase. The handles feel strong and the folding  is really convenient."
5.0,Very good quality and style for the price.
5.0,The shoes were obviously for my husband. He says he loves them and ordered another pair.
5.0,I love the comfortable material and the cute style. I bought it for a family Christmas gathering and am very anxious to wear it!
5.0,Only 1 light was bad out of the set. The 3rd grade class loved them for flashlight day.
5.0,Super cute! Perfect for Derby brunch
5.0,This is a great watch for teaching kids how to tell time. It's helping my son a lot.
5.0,Love this very comfortable. Would purchase again .
5.0,"Love these gloves.  Beautifully designed with just a touch of frill at the wrist.  Material is soft and a bit stretchy.  What I love the most is the design on the palm.  It's slightly raised and provided a light grip for driving, etc.  I bought black and pink I loved them so much."
5.0,Amazing accessories organizer. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"These are very nice to wear with an over shirt or sweater. They are on the small side i am 5,5 and 125 pd and they fit tight that's good for me if are on the bigger side i would not go with one size fits all.."
5.0,Love these!! Stylish and comfortable. Fit perfect. Not too tight and not baggy!<br />I saw<br />It said they have pockets; mine do not have pockets.
5.0,"I was looking for a non-leather wallet and originally ordered one that was canvas, had velcro c;losure and was too small for dollars.  The price as right.  This wallet is perfect, is normal size, fits cash and credit cards, loosened up after a few weeks and folds flat for front or back pocket.  Very nice."
5.0,"Coating not as strong as the original Oakley but it's $50 cheaper.  They work, fit and look fine."
5.0,I love it. It’s just like it was listed if not better. The material is great for a baby. Would definitely purchase again
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my mom, she loved it!!! If this is your style I recommend this purse for you!!!"
5.0,"The buckle came very quickly, it fits and has various option bars included and looks great on my strap, only good things to say...."
5.0,"These have easily become my favorite no-show socks that I own. I have four different brands. I’ve bought them all over the place, and the previous ones that I bought online are maybe my least favorite. You just don’t always know what you’re getting, and sometimes you read a bunch of good reviews and it still just doesn’t work for you. I am a size 8-9 (my second toe is longer than my first and throws me off, that’s why the range), and that’s on the larger side for women’s feet. I often find one-size-fits-all socks to not quite fit me, but I was really pleased when these did. There’s a little hint of toe cleavage, but way less than my others, and I would say these fit me near perfectly.<br /><br />I think these socks are so beautiful. I love the five different colors, each one right for a different occasion or show. I recommend getting the variety pack. They’re very neutral, but the little hint of lace peeking out from the edge of the shoe is never offensive to me. I think it’s really cute. There are little nubs under the toes on the bottom of the sock to keep your foot from sliding around, eight of them, shaped like flowers. Around the edges of the lace, there’s that sticky tape that also keeps the sock securely on without leaving any residue or anything. I find the heels really comfortable. The whole sock is comfortable. They’re just stretchy and soft and adorable, and I couldn’t be happier.<br /><br />I received these socks for a discount in exchange for my honest feedback, but my thoughts are my own. Thanks!"
5.0,"Nice slim wallet, wish the ID holder was a tad smaller, maybe with leather instead on full width plastic. A lot of great areas to put different cards. currently holding 8 cards and my ID.<br /><br />Leather does seem to scratch easily. Hi Looch"
5.0,it really lives up to crushable but a foam liner will help to prop it up
5.0,Great dependable simple time piece
5.0,"I love my old 5610 to death. Retro look, atomic syncing, built like a brick, the list goes on. Was pretty confident I could do without what outwardly seemed a minor update for $50 extra MSRP, but I read several reviews and decided to pull the trigger.<br /><br />The switch to LED backlight with a 1.5 or 3 second run option alone is worth the $50. Much clearer nighttime display, and will last for eons with less power draw.<br /><br />The second goodie improves the World Time function to offer up to five user-selected preset time zones to cycle through. The secondary time is displayed in the date window and (brace yourself) can be swapped with the primary time with the touch of two buttons. Fans of the classic G-Shock modules will be pleased to learn primary time display in all modes has returned.<br /><br />Be advised the product I received was the Japanese market model which included only Japanese documentation. You can find the English manuals on Google. I do not feel any exaggeration with some other reviewers claims that this is quite possibly the best watch ever designed. I'm still keeping my old one around as a ""super-beater"", but I have a new daily wearer, which will most likely out-last myself."
5.0,Great sunglasses! You can’t beat the price either!
5.0,I like very much!<br />The handbag is exactly same the pictury.
5.0,love the price and the product
5.0,Use it for Substitute teaching
5.0,Fits well and sits nicely
5.0,Exelente!! Súper cómodo y muy lavable y duradero
5.0,This is a wonderful piece. I adore this bracelet.
5.0,Great alternative to 160 for new RayBans. Excellent fit
5.0,The noise this cute fox makes sounds like a Dinosaur and makes us crack up.
5.0,"very nice, thanx"
5.0,"I love it ! It fits perfect ! Washes up nice, no ironing needed !"
5.0,This shirt was really nice and fit perfectly.
5.0,I bought this for my ten yr-old & we both loved it. It was easy to put on and was the perfect length for his height.. very good material..didn't have any smells or issues I am very pleased
5.0,"Great variety, and very comfortable. These are for my newly acquired Apple Watch, easy to change out and there is one to go with everything. A great buy."
5.0,"Very happy with these plugs.  Even with no groove for the o-ring, they do not slip off at all, and it allows more flexibility based on the thickness of your earlobes.  While they sortof look like they have a matte finish in the picture, they are actually nice and shiny.  Would definitely buy again."
5.0,These are perfect for keeping my dogs from getting bound up from jumping and turning .
5.0,"This belt is just overall a fantastic product. It is a very solid build and has a very quality feel. The buckle is a solid metal and the belt itself is a quality feel, though I'm pretty sure it's fake. It's really simple to use. And it's adjustable!"
5.0,for my grandson he wanted it for Halloween. He loved it
5.0,"Shipping was fast, and I love my new belly ring! :)"
5.0,Good quality. Perfect fit True to size
5.0,"Love this t-shirt. Others have commented on it after watching the TV show. If you're a fan of Peaky B's, then you'll like this.<br />Washed it numerous times already and it's still going its colour and shape very well. 6"
5.0,Not for short girl
5.0,Use these all the time
5.0,I love this watch.  It's attractive yet sturdy and can be worn both with dress and casual attire.  The nylon strap takes a little getting used to as I'm more familiar with leather or bracelet straps.  The second hand moves so smoothly much like a sweep second hand and the watch keeps great time.  I will likely buy another Seiko 5 to add some variety to my collection.
5.0,What can I say? They are as cute as they look!
5.0,"I have several Ninaqueen charms, and this one is by far my favorite. Really nice! Worth the price."
5.0,"It's a nice vest, looks good, the fit is good. No complaints with the vest. There was a 8% coupon on the item and it showed in my cart but was not applied to the purchase. I believe that's an Amazon issue and when I responded to the seller they responded immediately, indicating the same thing. So far I have not been able to resolve with Amazon but will keep trying."
5.0,"It has plenty of space for all my cards, and they're very easy to access. The only issue I have with the wallet is that the cash pocket is way too big, but I guess it'll be good when I travel and the currency is bigger than ours."
5.0,Just as pictured...will be the perfect gift.
5.0,Just freaking cool. Love that fact that you can recharge. Weird noise but cool enough to forget about it.
5.0,I got the blue and I love it. It fits as expected. It is comfortable as well.
5.0,Husband looked great in them!
5.0,"These are great to wear when there's a quick change in temperature. Being out and about is cold, but then you enter a heated room full of people? Yeah, this is for you."
5.0,ordered my normal size and sandals fit as expected
5.0,beautifyl hat!!!
5.0,These socks are awesome. Big difference between these and run of the mill socks. I wish they came in white! I find myself wanting to wear these every single day and sometimes I need white or brown.
5.0,This product came really fast and it is a cute dress and it is good quality.  It is small for an extra large.  It's actually a size medium to large
5.0,Perfect. Fit exactly as expected.
5.0,Todo bien 👍
5.0,Heat
5.0,"Such a unique and pretty blouse!! I hand wash and hang to dry. I would not machine dry, ever. You might get away with washing it in the washing machine if you use the “hand wash” or “delicate” setting...or put in a lingerie bag. Looks good with jeans or leggings."
5.0,My husband loves these sleeves! They protect his arms from the harsh FL sun and keep his arms cool. He has several pairs and prefers this brand. (Niki stretches out of shape and won't stay up.)
5.0,Good fit and looks nice. Arrived quickly.
5.0,I like it very much!!!!
5.0,"Confortable, sturdy, and vibrant. Recommended for athletes or costumes. I’m a dancer and love the compression."
5.0,Very comfortable flowy gown!
5.0,Size was correct good looking feels good
5.0,These socks fit very well. They are comfortable and just what I was looking for. I wanted yoga socks without the toes and these work great!
5.0,LIKE THE COLOR<br />IT PRETTY N BRIGHT.<br />THEY NICE N SOFE.
5.0,I get a lot of compliments on these!
5.0,"love this dress. It is very long so I had to hem it up a pinch (& I’m 5’9”), but it was still perfect. Lots of compliments on my Morticia Adams adaption"
5.0,The U.S. Polo French Terry lounge pants are perfect for chilling around the house. They are comfortable enough to sleep in as well as be able to leave your home to run errands  WITHOUT LOOKING like you are in Pajamas! Love them!
5.0,"Nifty design, although I have not been able to master the &#34;hands free&#34; manner in which the model holds the umbrella."
5.0,"Really beautiful shirt. Fits perfectly and got so many compliments on it, so glad I bought it"
5.0,Fits / looks better than some of my $200 sunglasses
5.0,"I LOVE these shirts, I have 3 in different colors. The lace does not fray like other lace shirts I've received. The lace is very durable like fabric but still looks nice, I get complements every time I wear it. I usually wear a 2x, or a 1x in department store womans clothes, and I purchased the 2x and it fits snug like a fitted t shirt. The tag says ambiance, which is a brand I have purchased at Ross before, I think its like misses sizes."
5.0,"This is exactly like the picture.  So pretty, but it runs small.  Should have ordered a large for a comfortable fit.  The colors are deep and rich, I am glad I ordered it.  Great buy."
5.0,I bought these earrings in pink for my 8 yo granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves dangling earrings and the colour pink and I'm sure she will love these.
5.0,This is so cool.  Entertaining really; people love it when my husband flips this down and sets a beer bottle.  Good conversation piece.
5.0,Great sweatshirt! Terrific fit and a great weight. I'm going to order more in different colors!
5.0,"This hoodie is super cumfy! It fits perfectly, and arrived early! Super happy with this product!!"
5.0,"Pros:<br />- Very light weight shoes.<br />- The &#34;Boa&#34; lacing means you twist a knob to tighten the laces.  Nothing to come untied, and no spare lace ends to flop around.<br />- quick to put on and take off.<br />- Wear with the laces loosened and they feel like slippers.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the material at the heel is very flexible.  It takes some getting used to.<br />- minimal cushioning under foot.  I happen to like it, but not everyone will.<br />- they look a little odd."
5.0,Loved it! It took longer to arrive and I thought it was lost!
5.0,Can easily be taken on and off most comfirrabke
5.0,This was a great hon I just lost a hat that I turned it on
5.0,"I LOVE this bra. It fit me perfectly and it was a great wardrobe item for a photo shoot. I got this as a gift and I'm a 34C, fit great on me. I've had no problems so far with any of the pieces falling off, but I would still be careful just in case (it did arrive in bubble wrap). :)"
5.0,"This item was ordered for same day delivery for my granddaughter to use for a costume in school.  We watched the clock, waited anxiously and, OMG, Amazon cane through with an A++ delivery and quality product.  The hat looks amazing and put a smile on all our faces!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend to others if their child has to be an airplane pilot or just need a warm unique and fun hat to wear!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!!!"
5.0,I love them perfect color
5.0,These masks are perfect! My favorite part of these is how there is a button amd they come together at the back. They also offer good but breathable coverage so it's not too hot under there.
5.0,This dress was perfect! So cute!
5.0,"Cute, fit me perfectly"
5.0,Large size and heavyweight construction make it an ideal bandana !!!
5.0,"I liked these socks for my son, he has no issues with them. they fit him as they were expected to. There are three kinds of socks you can purchase, which i bought the set without the grippers. These had two pairs of white socks, a light and dark blue, red, and black. These fit as a crew and my child said they are comfortable. The socks can stretch if needed, which may may them look thinner, but really there not to thin.The only issue that i did have with these socks,(and it was my own fault) they got a snag in them because i did not cut the part to separate each sock, but i pulled them apart. So i recommend making sure you cut the tab that keeps them connected. I would buy this item again. I have received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are from my own experiences."
5.0,Nip
5.0,"I truly cannot be any happier with this necklace. The cut of the chain is beautiful and sparkles like a diamond. It is a nice length and the way it is designed, you can make it longer if you need to. The necklace uses a lobster claw closure, which is really easy to do yourself. Plus if you look at one of my photos, you can see how many extra loops you get and that also at the end is a small tear drop which gives it a nice finished look. The heart pendant is as beautiful as the chain. I took photo both on green and black material so you can see how well it sparkles. The purple center stone has a gorgeous cut, the color and clarity is really nice. The surrounding stones sparkle and like the center stone, makes it look like a quality piece of jewelry. It looks like a higher end piece of jewelry. I would be happy giving this to anyone as a gift. I received this item at a discount in exchange for a honest review and it in no way affected my opinion of the piece."
5.0,"Nice soft sweater! Neck is a little bulky, otherwise fits great.Not as heavy as it looks in the picture."
5.0,True fit! Love it
5.0,I love this band. It’s very comfortable and it’s glittery once light is upon it!
5.0,Love these socks for wearing around the house.  Better than walking around in bare feet.
5.0,Beautiful and came with a dust bag.
5.0,"Very comfortable, wish I brought this a long time ago. I just might buy another pack because there so comfortable"
5.0,"Bought and wore this dress for my bachelorette party! I LOVED IT, MY GIRLS LOVED IT ON ME, MY MAN LOVED IT, OTHER MEN LOVED IT ON ME! It was made very well, and it is has a very classy sexy look! The fabric is very thin, and I was unable to find a bra to wear with this dress due to the deep plunge v-neck and it being backless.  I used the nipple petals and it was perfect! I am a natural 36 C(small C) in my breast size, and would not recommend a larger breasted person to wear this dress unless you are also blessed with the ability to combat gravity, you will not receive any additional breast support with the halter top. (Just my opinion) I cannot wait to find another reason to wear this dress again!"
5.0,Bought this for my 9 year old grandson and he loves it!
5.0,This is just perfect!!!!!!
5.0,These pants are perfect. Very soft and light. Waist is stretchy. I got an XL they fit perfect. They’re not too long. Can wear year round
5.0,"fast service, great fit, made very well"
5.0,My daughter loves these slippers. She tries to wear them everywhere. She says they are very comfy and cozy.
5.0,"You get 8 extenders in this set, 4 silver and 4 gold toned. They seem sturdy, time will tell if they las . I also had a bonus item in my bag, I think it is a stylus. Not sure what the point of it was, but hey it was free. Would purchase these again."
5.0,Powerful message! Got one as a gift. Just as described.
5.0,Exactly what we wanted for a Gala party.
5.0,Such a cute bag  love it !!  Couldn't make up my mind between that color or the burgundy  Chose the tan  has a little burgundy in it !!!
5.0,"Pretty not too ostentatious, has a nice classic look, goes well with any outfit"
5.0,"This watch is simply phenomenal. I love ProTrek, because of all the features these watches come with for the price... This watch is solor atomic and triple sensor. This is the creme de la creme of outdoor watches."
5.0,Es muy bonito y llego como lo esperaba
5.0,"for the price you can't beat this gi. I actually prefer this one over the other Elite Sports gi because of the minimal branding (sorry Elite Sports, i like a minimal design)."
5.0,Loved it. Use it for going out.
5.0,These are my favorite pair of sunglasses ever!  The fit the best of any I've ever had. The are light on my face and the style feels perfect. I loved them so much I ordered another pair in another color the day theses arrived. I know think I'm going to reorder  the white ones again so that I have a back up in case I lose them. I'm getting lots of compliments. A great bargain for the great quality they are! Totally recommend.
5.0,"Perfect dress and color. Exactly as seen on the  picture. I wish they had  larger sizes😔. Arm sleeves are a little small and don't stretch, everything else does."
5.0,Very nice. But a little hard to menouver so the chains hang correctly when putting on.
5.0,"I've bought these before from another retailer - appears authentic and as well constructed as Ive obtained before. I used this os a slight larger watch - was a challenge to install, but works great for causal use. For underwater, I might go with the original rubber design - more effort to strap it up, but perhaps more rugged in rough conditions."
5.0,Great dress.  Fit well.
5.0,I love this dress and received lots of compliments. I typically wear a size 8/10 dress but ordered a Large in this dress and it fit great. I will definitely be getting more dresses from them. There was a very strong smell coming from the dress upon receipt. The smell seems to be gone now
5.0,These pants are very comfortable. I used them for after surgery and bought 3 pair. I love them. I wear them to appointments and around the house. They have a good stretch to them and are long which is great. Wash great as well.
5.0,Bought this as part of a custom gift box I'm creating for my best friend. She moved to a different state several years ago and we still talk every day. This keychain really falls in line with our friendship and the road it has taken. I am very happy with it.
5.0,I have purchased several of these I really like the way they flow and they wash nice
5.0,Great socks! Although a little small for our son who is 16 but on the small side.
5.0,Very nice.  Holds full bag of popcorn.  It helps that our team is doing well.
5.0,Bought this shirt for my daughter and she loves it. It has been washes several times and has kept its shape. She loves the fit. The sizing fits as expected. I will.purchase again in the future.
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt! Bathing suit material though.. still great!
5.0,"Very pretty, came packaged nicely"
5.0,Great shorts and well made.  I wish they had a size between the youth large and the smallest adult size.  It is a quite a bit difference in size between the two.
5.0,These are perfect for my granddaughter!  They are cute but as she loses them it won’t be any big deal!
5.0,Great quality and the color so nice
5.0,luv it it's what I expected.
5.0,"You need a dremel (or a dremel like product) with a polishing wheel/tip to use it, but it does work well.<br /><br />My wife heavily abused the crystal while working (I suspect she was mining) and couldn't find any one local to repair the crystal face. Being web savvy and good with a dremel I set out to repair the watch myself.<br /><br />Mind you, this is a slow process, and that's a good thing. You don't want to remove too much, too fast. Take your time, take breaks every few hours, and your dedication will pay off."
5.0,good but not fit pandora charms
5.0,I love these boots they are very comfortable and light and i get alot of compliments on them all the time and of course they are timberlands ah haah ha but yes and very fashionable to boot ha ha ha get it ok but you will love these boots
5.0,bra fits perfectly
5.0,I wear this everyday and I have got so many compliments one it. It is very comfortable!!!
5.0,"Literally the best boxer briefs I've ever owned. They are so comfortable. They've been through about 10 washed and they're still as good as new.<br /><br />They don't work well if you plan on getting wet and I wouldn't work out in them (go for a spandex-cotton blend for that), but they are perfect everyday briefs, even in humid Georgia. I'll buy these until they stop making them."
5.0,"this pendant is amazing.  It is solid enough to tolerate my active lifestyle and stylish enough to show my true feelings toward any type of religious doubt.  If you are shy about your doubt, most ""christians"" won't understand what it is, so don't worry.  I wear it as a necklace but it can be adjusted to be a choker.  It's a bit heavy, but with my heavy heart, it doesn't bother me.  Great pendant and wonderful quick shipping.  Thanks Dan"
5.0,Best whipped 100% argan oil.
5.0,"I love these pants so comfortable!  They look great,they got great, I want to order another pair!!"
5.0,Good product. StoreVIP is the best seller providing me the best service.
5.0,"I have worn Cocoons for over 8 years now. I love they have models to fitover any size eyeglasses I have. They provide cover for the top over my eyebrows and down the sides around my eyes. They are very well made, light, durable, easy to clean and the temples adjust very easily.<br />I tried this new (to me) blue mirror style. They're much cooler looking than standard gray lenses, at least for me!<br />The only downside for me is that they show fingerprints and other smudges immediately.<br />I wore them with a pair of blue cotton Chums (rocking my GS Warriors!) through Disneyland/ California a Adventure for 5 Days. My eyes feel GREAT! But I don't know yet how the finish will hold up to the very gentle cleanings recommended by Cocoons."
5.0,Used it for weight loss and it works great
5.0,Super comfortable and cute patterns.
5.0,"Probably the best mitts i could ever hope for. If i had to nit pick something on them id say they are maybe a little too thick? Gripping poles while skiing might be harder than usual, but im sure itll be fine. Cant wait to use them!"
5.0,Love it!<br />Exactly what I expected ❤️
5.0,Nice. Light Weight. Thin. Good length.
5.0,"I ordered the forearm one. I'm happy with it. It does not slide down your arm during vigorous activity, and your cell phone doesn't slide around either (I have a Nokia 730).<br /><br />I am a size 14-16 woman and ordered the large. I wear it below the elbow. It fits like a compression but I don't mind that because I want it to stay in place.<br />I like the black and white color contrast.<br />I like the no-slip band at the top that prevents it from sliding down my arm, no other sleeve has that!<br />I like the small pocket size, it perfectly fits my cell phone.<br /><br />The only con is the quality of the zipper. It's cheap plastic and difficult to zip back up while it's on your arm. They could make the zipper thinner and more streamlined, and make the tag a loop or short string so it's easier to pull."
5.0,It's well made but it runs a little small....would order it again just a larger size
5.0,"I love absolutely everything about these shorts. The fit, the softness, the color, the style are all perfect for me. I'll need more."

5.0,This is a great quality product.  I bought them for my 13 year old daughter.  Good size and appropriate for her age.  She can wear during P.E. and not have to take off becasue they are not &#34;loops&#34;. I recommend.
5.0,"Very pretty, just as I expected it would be."
5.0,Great bathrobe.
5.0,"I. Love. This jacket. It's so warm and comfy, looks great, and I get compliments on it all the time! It is kinda big but it's still a great jacket. Definitely reccomend."

5.0,"I love it! My friends love it! Social media loves it! It's a really great costume! It JUST fits me, though. Thank the stars I'm not bigger than I am!🤣I can't wait for Zenkaikon in March! I'm in a group that does Disney Princess stuff and this year it's Super Princesses! I'll be going as Doctor Mulan Strange with my assistants CriKee and Mushu!"
5.0,Wears snug around the chest and arms. Consider size up if your a big guy. Very light and breathable. Awesome for work and going out. Im 6ft 300lbs. I purchased the 3xl. Im stocky build and short fits awesome!

5.0,"Fit my GD-350-8 perfectly. I bought it for the aesthetic, but seems like it definitely soak up a direct hit to a flat surface. Would like a gold or pvd black option too.<br /><br /> Thanks!"
5.0,My niece loved this good quality for price.
5.0,Fun for the kids - and it does double duty: Halloween and Christmas decoration.

5.0,GREAT ANTI GLARE GLASSES I CAN WARE THESE ON A CLOUDY RAINY DAY ALSO
5.0,"This is a very comfortable dress. I ordered it in larger; I’m 155, 5,3 and curvy. I think I could have used it in medium, I’m ordering another one I that size to see how it fits. I still am keeping the larger because it still fits well. I love the colors and can’t wait to see if they add anymore. This dress is very soft and is very very comfortable. I saw a review that said it wasn’t flattering, I think it is. It didn’t not have a bad fit in the way it lays on the body."
5.0,"I really love this crop top! It is very attractive! The material is soft, comfortable and stretchy. It is super lightweight. The bow knot makes it very unique. The size fits me very well."
5.0,Nothing fancy but got the job done
5.0,"This bra arrived very quickly and fits PERFECTLY! I am an A cup, it is pretty easy for products like this to fit strangely or to look very artificial under my clothes but this bra looks so natural. I just wore it all day at work, it held in place for 9 hours - including a 40 min walk outside in July heat. Still didn't budge on my chest all day. Taking the cups off was painless and they are ready to go for another round. I'll definitely be buying these again."
5.0,"Wore this dress to a formal wedding and got so many compliments! It is true to size and I am saving it for another formal occasion. Does need dry cleaning before wearing but that was expected. Great color, too!"

5.0,Love it! Very comfortable to wear!
5.0,"To be honest...I didn't thought too much about this purse... However, when I open the package...I was greatly amazed by its beauty and details...Very well done. Looks 100% better than the picture (the picture doesn't make any justice to this beautiful purse) I am glad I ordered. I love it!"
5.0,"The real deal right here. It can model, swim, whatever you need. Pics are fun but swimming like an actual mermaid, there's nothing like it! This fin is powerful! I AM FISH! Worth every penny. (Would've spent more too!)"
5.0,Nice fit. Really nice with a jacket.
5.0,Fit really good and so comfortable 👍
5.0,This necklace is BEAUTIFUL and arrived way before the date it was saying!
5.0,"You can't tell it's a mask from 10 feet away - it looks very real. It's a high quality product. That being said, the full head covering means it's also very hot and sweaty. Be prepared to take some breaks from it and stay hydrated (I live in Phoenix - those in cooler climates may not have the same experience)."
5.0,"These say medium impact, but my bra is more like high impact. I wore this to Zumba, HIIT, and piloxing. My chest did not move. I didn’t expect this bra to be so nice. By the bra!!"

5.0,"My duaghter is 24, an athlete, and lives in leggings.  She just adores this pair, she thinks they fit correctly and feel great.  We would definitely buy again.  The shipping was extremely fast, as well.<br /><br />For sizing, we went with the size clothing she usually wears and not the size suggested by her waist measurement. They are a perfect fit."
5.0,"Been using these in my gum shoes. They take the impact off the feet. They are firm and not “gel” or memory foam. They are very comfortable and keep my feet from hurting. Doing sprints and squats, these inserts make me feel stable and comfortable. If nasa uses it, it must be good ! They are cheap enough to try, get a pair especially if you’re into construction or police/ems/Fire"
5.0,My family tends to have long hair. One thing to keep in mind when using these is to not have your hair tied up in pony tails or pigtails. It'll make putting on the hairnets much harder if you do.
5.0,"This bracelet far surpassed my expectations.  It was a gift, and my friend loved it."
5.0,Machine washable and air dried. True to size. Good purchase 👍🏼

5.0,muy buenaa hay que tener cuidado para sacar un eslavon

5.0,These glasses are awesome. The clear colored frames make this very stylish. Fit feels nice .
5.0,"This ring is beautiful! I was looking for filigree dome rings for my mother for weeks and ended buying a different stainless steal one for three times the price of this. I wish I had waited til I bought this for myself! At just over $8 this ring looks fabulous, has gorgeous detail, and was shipped and received in no time! One of my best, if not the best, amazon jewelry experience yet!"
5.0,"Recently saw this movie, and order this for my child's 5th birthday. She just loved it!!"
5.0,I honestly though it was going to look like a potato sack but I gotta say this dress is beautiful and hugs all your curves in the right spots.  Buying it in every color!
5.0,"Great item that works as described.  Stretched the livin' daylights out of a pair of jeans that shrank in the dryer.  Excellent construction; very sturdy.  This one won't break under the pressure of stretching the fabric.  Wonderfully helpful seller, too.  Others might be cheaper but this one works and will hold up to repeated use."
5.0,Love the compression socks. My legs don’t swell so bad. They don’t feel so tired at the end of the day.
5.0,"I initially ordered a medium in this skirt, but ended up ordering a large since it's not a stretchy material. It's a very sturdy white denim, high quality! I'm 135 lbs and hourglass figure."
5.0,so cute and so soft!
5.0,"Luv this.  I was not disappointed with it at all....and I don't think you will be. When I wear it, I get compliments on it.  It is a bracelet that I end up wearing alot...and I double it with other bracelets."
5.0,Used to the Chinese sizing being off so I ordered a 3X as I wear 14/16 usually. They fit just a little tight but still comfortable enough to wear. Very stylish and they look just like the photo.
5.0,It's awespme
5.0,"I love Winnie the Pooh, but this case honestly makes my phone much bigger than it already is :/ and it feels like it would just fall off of my phone really easily. I love the case and Winnie the Pooh it's just a bit too big for my personal liking."
5.0,"I changed out the necklace to a silver chain and now just love this Lotus pendant. It does feel delicate, so hoping it holds up. For the money, it seems like a good value and is striking."
5.0,Muy buen producto q la medida
5.0,"Very soft, cute pj's"
5.0,My husband loves this robe. It is a light weight waffle fabric that can be used year round for a light coverup and over PJs in the winter without being too warm. Good quality.
5.0,I love Nike Blazers and could not find this print in the stores.
5.0,"I love this color and find the size perfect! The leather is soft and well made. It does not have a lot of width to it so if you need a wide depth handbag, I would not recommend this one. Perfect for me! LOVE it!!  :  )  The price I got it for was awesome! Very spendy elsewhere!"
5.0,"This is cute. Not too short. I’m a large woman, normally size 18/20. I think it’s flattering."

5.0,Just as described. Love them!

5.0,Fits great for our 5 year old. Quality outfit and looks super! 😜
5.0,"These are really nice bathing suit bottoms.  I love that they are high waisted.  These definitely cover my belly button and cover my butt.  I was nervous that these wouldn’t fit me in the way that I hoped when I initially took them out of the pack, but after trying them on they fit perfectly.  I am really pleased with these and I highly recommend."
5.0,"Haven't worn it yet, but I tried it out and it was great!  nice material and elegant look."

5.0,Loved it perfect for 40th bday
5.0,Very nice and wear well
5.0,Love this robe! It’s like wearing a super warm sweater. I bought matching robes for my husband and I. I’m 5’2 and it comes to about my calves and my husband is 5”10 and it stops right below his knees.  I haven’t washed it yet so hoping it washes well!
5.0,Amazing. 100% worth every penny. I have very very heavy periods and I can wear a pair of these for 12 hours before needing to change. Definitely worth it.
5.0,"Nice piece of leather, the ratchet works well, and does take some getting used to."
5.0,"I got this for my husband for Christmas,its such a gorgeous watch! when we got it we thought it ran on a battery (oops,never had one that didn't before) and that the battery was dead but thankfully my husband's friend owns a watch like this and he knew all we had to do was wined it up! it works amazingly well and its been keeping the time since we got it working,feel kinda silly now knowing that it doesn't run on a battery but oh well learn something new everyday!"

5.0,fun suit and good quality for the price.
5.0,Works better than expected. A good purchase.
5.0,"These are quite huge rose earrings and the large firm backing is necessary to keep them from sagging and it works well. The ONLY thing is that the posts SEEM to be a bit thin, but I'm not sure of that, they can hurt a bit after a day of wearing them. I can't deduct a star because I may be wrong, and just because they bother me sometimes doesn't mean they'll bother you. They are just like the photos and description. Good seller, packing and Blessings!"
5.0,"Wow, this wallet is just great.  Lots of slots, visible and not so visible for cards and other item.  Money clip works great and AirTag holder is perfect.  Man, I am glad I bought this."
5.0,"I ordered crush from other website, I loved it and decided to buy another, I found $2 cheaper on Amazon and more color options. It is perfect by itself or under a wool ski cap. Anything tight on my  head would give me headache, this one fit great and very comfortable. Keeps my head and ears warm."

5.0,Great quality and easy to wash
5.0,"Update!:  September 9th, 2021, and I'm still extremely pleased with this mask!  Compared to my others, I tend to always reach for it, first!  As to whomever engineered the design, re how it fits one's face so comfortably....kudos to the them!  I wish I had encountered this specific brand and version of a fabric mask at the on start of the pandemic!  I realize that a mask can be worn for many reasons, ie avoiding pollens while outside, and virus/illnesses while both inside and out, of course.  It's evident  via how it rides/fits my face that much thought was put into the design of this mask.  Kudos to its creators re it's comfort and breathability..  I think my favorite thing of all, is the built in head/neck strap---it's an added treat in that I don't have to scurry around locating one of my extenders  to place on it, when it's attached permanently. The only drawback to it, imo, is that I wish it was available in colors alongside the very basic black, but then that's a personal preference picadillo.  Overall, this mask ranks as one of my favorites and nope, unlike others who allege that they will toss/decimate their masks when the pandemic end---I consider this mask to definitely be a ""keeper""!  (I mean, ikr? None of us can determine what the  lies ahead."
5.0,These aviators are so nice! Quick shipping and a really nice ice blue color. I would definatley buy these again.
5.0,"Great shirt, washes well, easy to care for."
5.0,"Awhile back I had to retire my favorite slippers and ever since I've been on a quest to find the perfect slipper.<br />I may not have found the perfect pair yet, but these slippers are really close.<br />My slipper criteria is Warm, Comfy, Soft, Non-slip soles, Quiet when walking on hardwood floors. I'm very pleased with these slippers and I would order them again."
5.0,Great lenses. Wonderful polarization and great fitment. Perfect replacement lenses to keep my favorite sunglasses alive!
5.0,"The best purse I've ever had. Size, number and location of pockets, quality of zippers, weight, quality of manufacturing -- all PERFECT."
5.0,"This is a great shirt! It’s super soft, the image is exactly as pictured, and I didn’t realize that it had cuffed sleeves, which makes it even nicer, in my opinion. Bought this as a gift and I am very pleased! I know she’s going to love it!"
5.0,"Love these goggles. I have been buying them for years. I swim laps for exercise. If you are like me, and hate the feel of goggles pressing on your eyeballs, these are the ones for you. If you have a problem with them leaking, you are probably not use to a mask, and have over tightened them."
5.0,Great quality dress. Good material and well sewn. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Love this case.  Beautiful and functional.
5.0,Las alas son muy bonitas y de buena calidad. Me encantaron. Excelente 👌
5.0,It's really nice looking and my boyfriend loves it.  It's really cool how the chain matches it!
5.0,"Arrived just as expected - good quality, super cute and lightweight for summer!"
5.0,Great shirt and was a perfect gift to give!
5.0,I never write reviews but this cap deserves one. It is perfect and super cute! Great purchase.
5.0,I’m obsessed with this necklace! I was a little worried about the quality but I’ve been wearing it almost nonstop and it’s not changing color or turning me green! The length of the chain is absolutely perfect as well!
5.0,I was really surprised at the quality of this product. This shirt first off came in a really nice storage bag. Second when you take it out of the package it did not have the awful smell that some clothes do when first bought. When it was put on it fit snuggly but stretched in all the right places fit comfortably. The wool is not the type that is scratchy or uncomfortable on the skin and it is really soft on the inside. This also keeps you very warm but also dry because it seems to wick moisture away. Altogether this gets five stars because it really is a nice shirt. I would recommend and would definitely order again and in fact I am headed directly from this review to purchase a few more for gifts. I was given this shirt free in exchange for my honest review and can say that I am very pleased with it and would order again.
5.0,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this. The fit was as expected bc she’s ultra tiny, so runs very small. However never received the pink version. Or a refund. Or even a reply. Tried to insist the item wasn’t delivered even though it says it was (first time that’s even happened) and cannot get an answer from Amazon or the carrier. Based on that unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this product"
5.0,They really help.  Less pain in the morning.  I wear them under my gardening gloves too.
5.0,"This is a lovely top!  The color is the same as shown. I ordered a size medium and it fits just very nice.  It is helpful to me to see other customers tell their height and weight.  It gives me a better idea of which size to order.  I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh about 160 pounds.  Even though I'm losing weight, this top will still fit nicely for a long time and look great with my  jeans.  The fabric has a nice feel.  I would order this top again."
5.0,"Looks great, packing is great, and shipping was much quicker than expected. I'd purchase again and recommend"
5.0,"For the price, I love this. Our daughters do not wear jewelry very much, and this is for the oldest one(a teen). My husband loves science as does she. So having the caffeine molecule necklace was the perfect fit for her, and made her father happy too."
5.0,"Tight, uniform weave pattern in the toquilla straw contruction of the hat."
5.0,The fit is perfect and they are comfortable and stay in place.
5.0,Exactly as described. Beautiful with a large face. Simple but elegant. Shipping was super fast.
5.0,"This is a great boot, very well made and very comfortable.  I will look fo rmore styles because these are a find!"
5.0,"I  used this to stretch some 36"" waistband Duluth canvas work pants, to 37"" so I could wear them again.<br />Dampen the waistband for easier stretching."
5.0,"The side ventilation is that I’ve ever had in a shirt. It goes all the way down the side and down the sleeve. I bought it in winter, so no chance to use yet, but I won’t be disappointed. Great quality, as always from ExOfficio."
5.0,It fit perfectly and right length considering I’m only 5’2 so I was worried it would be too long. Love the stretch
5.0,"incredible price, fast shipping, Thank You"
5.0,"Love these, bought 3 pair!"
5.0,"This dress is BEAUTIFUL. Buy, buy, buy."

5.0,Love this suit! Follow the size chart and it will fit well.
5.0,Highly recommend! I will buy from this seller again.
5.0,"What a gorgeous ring. I have real quality diamonds and they don't sparkle like this one. I wear it everyday. I clean, wash dishes, cook and I never take it off. It's still as beautiful as it was the first day I got it. I would definitely order again ."
5.0,Can't comment on durability as I haven't worn it much yet but its very soft and seems like it will keep you warm. The face andcdetaioscare so cute and it looks so great forvwgat the price is. Would definitely recommend
5.0,"This was pretty inexpensive considering all the others I've looked at like this were at least $30. It's VERY soft!! Fits as expected! Loose, but long enough to wear with leggings. So far so good! Haven't washed yet, so I expect it will shed some, but very happy with it as of now!"
5.0,Love it so soft.
5.0,The dress was very well made and comfortable.  Got lots of compliments on it.
5.0,My daughter had a lot of different mask through the last school year. But these are the most comfortable for her. She said the straps are very soft on her ears.
5.0,"Love this shirt! I have a shorter torso, so most shirts are super long, but this one is the perfect length for me. It is so soft and great for all the hiking I did last week. Love this shirt so much that I bought three on different colors."
5.0,Thicker material so it doesn’t matter what bra you wear with it! Will be buying again in other colors!
5.0,"This is exactly what it says it is a loose 3/4 sleeve T-shirt, love the fit and feel of this shirt, it makes me more fasionable, and I would recommend this product to my sisters for the price and quality."
5.0,"Love this ring, wear it every day."
5.0,She loves the sparkle of the stones.
5.0,fits perfectly! I love these shorts as well.  My apologies about the incorrect answer above.  The pockets are Velcro but its cool because it gives the shorts  a cleaner look. Now if I can get a pair in lime green and orange I would be ultra excited
5.0,Very comfortable room material. I wore it to the beach. I love the way it fits and feels. Great fabric. Purchased a white one as well.

5.0,Gorgeous skirt<br />Looks like designer<br />Needs to come back into stock so I can buy more colors
5.0,"As soon as I opened the package and turned this bad boy on, I knew that I got what I paid for. I was expecting it to be a liiiiiiiittle bit brighter, but I planned to use it inside of a mask so maybe it was for the best that it wasn't blindingly bright. I'm happy with what I got."
5.0,GREAT QUALITY!! Well made! Absolutely love it.
5.0,The scarf is more like a blanket it's huge and wonderful!!! It was a gift for my aunt and she loves it. She uses it around the house and brings it to church for her shoulders when she's cold. Great gift!!!
5.0,"They look good, first of all. They are very nice sunglasses and are very comfortable. My head's a little big and it is often difficult to find sunglasses that feel good on me and look good as well. They provide nice shading from the sun while I drive, without being so dark thatit makes everything else difficult to see.<br /><br />If I need to replace these glasses in the future, I would buy these again."
5.0,"I love these earrings. They look exactly as pictured. I am looking forward to wearing them to the office so, I can sparkle on a gloomy Monday!"
5.0,It’s the perfect gold bangle bracelet! I love it
5.0,Make me feel so sexy! love the hug
5.0,"This is the best sports bra! It's really comfortable, cute straps and it does not give u uni-boob. I wear a 38C, I followed the chart and ordered XXL. It fits great. I will wear this as a regular bra because it's so comfy. It's a little tricky fastening it yourself. But the struggle is worth it. I'm about to order a few more!"
5.0,Great quality and the size meets my needs.
5.0,"Esta hermoso en cuanto a tela y calidad, lo malo es que talla muy pequeño y eso que escoji 2 tallas de mas!."
5.0,Exactly as described.. fast shipping! Thank you!
5.0,"Anything pattyBoutik is great products! This sweater is cute, thick and very nice material! I love it!!!!"
5.0,I've been looking for lightweight masks with a nose wire as I wear glasses and my workplace is EXTREMELY warm and thicker masks (while they certainly serve their purpose better) are a potential health hazard.<br /><br />These are great. Not my favorite patterns but can't complain for the price and the amount you receive.
5.0,Nice way to dress up black boots.
5.0,"Great shoe, great price, on time. 😁"
5.0,Impressed with the quality.
5.0,"Great for keeping all those small items, chargers, and cords organized in a backpack and suitcase! Started with one for my everyday backpack. Then ordered another for my suitcase and one for my girlfriend!"

5.0,"Got many compliments , durable fits well got an m size."
5.0,Phenomenal!
5.0,So soft and fit as expected. Washed it and hung to dry. Liked it so much I ordered one for my daughter.
5.0,&#34;Leadership Excellence&#34;
5.0,Love this dress and it has pockets
5.0,Very nice material fast shipping got a large for daughter
5.0,very cute.  nice addition
5.0,The size 7-8 fits my daughter well. Cotton material feels thick and soft. She wears them for the weekend soccer games and likes the pair so far as the waist size fits her that doesn't need to be tightened too much. They have gone through several laundry cycles and the color doesn't fade. I would recommend it to others.
5.0,"This dress is beyond adorable!! It's very comfortable and has a great design and colors. The slit is done in a class way and not so high it looks trashy!! I love this dress, it's exactly what I wanted!!!!"
5.0,"This scarf arrived quickly, in perfect condition, no bad smell, and is exactly as described.  The fabric feels silky and nice against my skin.  The green is a pretty Kelly green.  It will go perfectly with my cardigan sweater."
5.0,"Money is tight for us so I'm always looking for affordable ways to get my wife something special for those &#34;just cuz&#34; moments. When I saw this on line I liked it at first glance but then when I caught a look at the filigree etched into the smaller ring I knew she'd love it. It's hard to buy jewelry on line as you can never really be sure what you've purchased until it arrives. This one was WELL worth the risk!!!<br /><br />It sparkles and shines as much as some of the diamonds my wive has. The silver is quite brilliant and fits her hand perfectly. I probably shouldn't say this but after seeing the ring I'd gladly have spent $20-$30 MORE! You can buy the band as a separate entity for about $20 and I plan on getting another for my wife so she can have a band on either side.<br /><br />She LOVES this ring and as far as I'm concerned that's the highest recommendation I can give it. Happy wife = happy life afterall, lol. I would buy from this company again and plan to."
5.0,"Love the variety, got fuchsia, tan, black, blue, and leopard (a fun one I wouldn't necessarily buy). Am very happy and you can't beat it for value."
5.0,Beautiful and very feminine! Looks delicate on my finger!
5.0,Wear it in the shower
5.0,"I needed to replace a bag our daughter gave me years ago but found it was more expensive than I expected.  However, I found EXACTLY what I needed here and it works perfectly! Large enough to carry what I need and has several pockets. Deep enough to hold taller items. Strong carrying strap. Extremely happy with it!"
5.0,Fit right in
5.0,"I have received a few comments noting how nice this watch looked.  The band is soft and comfortable.  I have accidentally hit it on the side of a car, and a door jam, and it did not crack or fall apart."
5.0,These decals were fine but I’d prefer a decal I can attach from the interior of the window.
5.0,"Great cycling gloves. Well made, form fitting but not tight. Padded inside to allow me to grip the handles on my bike tightly and be able to handle all terrain comfortably and like an expert (despite the fact that I am a relative new comer to doing cross country off road biking. I really like these and actually bought another pair for my husband as well. Highly recommend"
5.0,"Nice bag, no cover for it though for special care."
5.0,Good quality priduct. My daughter LOVES this purse. Perfect sized small purse. Great for kids or just Disney fans in general!
5.0,Thought it was cute
5.0,Cute comfortable spring look.

5.0,Bought a size up and I LOVE it! great quality!!!
5.0,My best friend loved it 🥰 her soon to be husband mother passed so she put a picture of her in it with my dream catcher charm I carry around with me everyday for luck 🥰 it has a  blue charm on it 🥰 Something New Something Blue and Something Borrowed 🥰💗💕 She plans to attach it to her bouquet 💐💗
5.0,Great fit & overall great quality.
5.0,Originally bought this for a costume I was doing but it’s so soft and it wears really well! It was a bit wrinkled at first so I did have to iron it
5.0,Perfect for jogging and gym
5.0,"I love, love these tanks. They fit great, keep me cool, wash beautifully and dry fast. They also look great with shorts and jeans."
5.0,"I am really picky when it comes to socks. If they are not soft and comfy, I am not happy. I am so glad I bought these socks though. They are super comfortable and I like that they have a L and R on them. Something not a lot of other sock companies do, but I appreciate it. I like the 3 colors that come in each pack. I cannot recommend the enough. Great socks."
5.0,Product was exactly as advertised
5.0,I’m 5’5 I wear a 12/14 in bottoms I read the reviews and they were a big help because I was about to order a XL but after the reviews I ordered a Large and I think a Medium would have been ok as well but I will be ordering more colors and the fabric is awesome
5.0,"Item arrived promptly in excellent condition. It's a little tricky to set up, because the voice menu instructions are a little confusing. If you listen carefully and don't rush the process, everything works out fine. It's very handy for the wife who's legally blind and always wants to know what time it is."
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, well made, very sparkly. Packaging left a lot to be desired--they came in just a tiny plastic zip top bag."
5.0,"I was give to my nephew as a gift, he love it!"
5.0,Fabric is thin but not clingy. Colors match online pictures.
5.0,Buy a size or half size down. I went a size down and they fit perfectly but no room for any growth.
5.0,Black one ripped on first use. Love to use because of comfort and quick snap.
5.0,Beautiful. we had to put a button for the scarf so that it will not be loosely put. Thank you!
5.0,Very nice product. Looks very pretty.
5.0,Light weight!<br />Super pretty!
5.0,"on the pictures it didn't look as refined as it did in person.  i bought this watch for my wife and as it turned out the color is silver, not grey, meaning there's a bit of shine to it.  and in person, the watch is a lot more detailed than the way it looked in pictures online.  my wife loved it.  she was looking for a watch that she can wear while doing home improvement with me, something she won't have to cry over if she loses it or damages it.  the size is just perfect, and just enough functions for her to use.  couldn't be happier."
5.0,I can't wait to wear it!
5.0,Bought for my sister.  She loves...loves...loves it.
5.0,"Very soft and simple. I'm 5'8"" and doesnt drag perfect length"
5.0,"This is my second one. First one lasted 5 yr before resin strap split. It is inexpensive, has easily activated timer function, gives day and week - very helpful, low profile."
5.0,Very stylish earring but too heavy & pull down on your earring hole-
5.0,Love my sexy thigh high boots!!!
5.0,"I have installed this foam in three hats so far, and they now fit so much better. The only difficult part is removing the white strip from the adhesive backing. Overall a great solution for me."
5.0,It is so Beaumont
5.0,I am really pleased with my shirt. It fits good and the fabric is soft.
5.0,"I have an XXL head, understandably the one-size-fits-all beanie cap is a little bit on the small side for me."
5.0,This hat fits great and isnt to warm but warm enough. It was just the right touch for the chilly FL nights.
5.0,This has is very soft and comfortable. The inner lining does not cause pain on the forehead like others have in the past. I love this hat!!
5.0,On time and met our expectations!
5.0,"Great fit, and do not ride up at all! I have already ordered 4 packs!"

5.0,Beautiful cactus earrings!  Well description and picture is exact.
5.0,"Very cute! My daughter wants to wear it already, but it's still winter so she'll have to wait a bit longer, but she's already excited. They're just as pictured, and the material is light without feeling cheap - perfect for hot weather."
5.0,Best price and quality.  Ships quickly.
5.0,Light weight. Held up to a light rain no wind. Color is pretty.  Comes in a pouch but dont expect to put it back in. Pouch is the right size to carry my tablet in though.
5.0,Great shirt for a great price
5.0,Very cute .I loved
5.0,"These gloves are wonderful!  Soft, smooth, perfect leather with very warm lining.  Fit well and look very good with any type of coat."
5.0,"Just the right size so you don't look like you are all shoulders,<br />The Velcro doesn't last as long as I'd like."
5.0,"Soft fabric, but wears and washes well."
5.0,The band on my favorite watch finally broke (https://www.amazon.ca/Fossil-Mens-Watch-JR8209/dp/B0000ZB9E6) and they don't make any replacement bands for it any more.  This band worked great and matches the color perfectly.  You will have to punch two additional holes in the leather which are covered by the additional leather piece but it can be done really easily.
5.0,"I had these in the past, got 7.5 since no wide available @ that time, were always a smidge big but ok w/sox.  This 7W is PERFECT and so comfortable, since 1st pair lasted a long time I expect the same here.  Yay vegan sneaks that look good:)"
5.0,I bought this for work (I am a waitress). They last long (through messy work). Very comfortable. Very cute. They fit well. I bought them twice I liked them so much.
5.0,"Perfect for capri leggings in Summer but you can also wear a sleeved shirt, cute jeggings and coat/boots for winter. VERY cute pattern and chiffon feel fabric. It fits well, well made and arrived on time and well packaged. I like it and it is what I wanted.  Thank you."

5.0,great top fits perfectly. I am a golfer and will be perfect--I have ordered more
5.0,"I purchased this directly from the manufacturers website and not from Amazon.  This is the most comfortable hat I have ever put on.  I highly recommend it.  I don't like that it has words around the brim, and can live with the LW drawing.  I'd love to find similar hats that have other logos on it instead.  It has an elastic fitting and not velco or a metal buckle.  So I love it and so will you!"
5.0,My  fiancé loves it definitely Great quality and materials to make it.
5.0,Extremely well built nice watch for an incredible price. I highly recommend this watch. Looking forward to trying more watches from Chenxi.
5.0,This dress is so pretty and feminine! It has beautiful detail at the bottom -- and inside the pockets - very cool!<br />I just love it!!<br />Definitely wear it with a darker bra - white will show through ;)
5.0,I love these earrings! They are even better in person. I bought for myself because I love plants and their leaves. It would make a wonderful gift.
5.0,"This is a beautiful pendant, and I love the Bible verse from Proverbs.  It gives me a great feeling when I wear it, and causes me to want to do better!"
5.0,Fits just right and is really cute! I love lounging around the house in my new PJ's.

5.0,Every day use I like the way they feel they don't rise up your leg
5.0,Great watch at such inexpensive price. This was a gift to my sister and she loves it!! Fits great; looks much more expensive; it does run snugly for average wrist (9&#34;) just FYI; I do recommend this watch.
5.0,Great bag. Durable & cute
5.0,Perfect thick flannel mask for fall and winter. I am a Stormy Kromer fan; and this mask does not disappoint. I added adjuster beads that I purchased on Amazon to perfect the fit for my smallish face. This review is for the Navy plaid which I purchased on Amazon.
5.0,"I am between a medium and large so I just got a large, and it fits well. Not tight."
5.0,This is the perfect beach hat. I bought it for protection on the beach since I don't really sunbath too much.

5.0,Loved these boot laces. Right size and good colors.
5.0,"My husband wanted these to protect his eyes from wind and bugs when he's riding his 4 wheeler or side by side. He's really happy with them, and said they were comfortable to wear. You can use these to protect yourself from a multiple of things. He said they helped him see better, too when he had the sun in his face. They are a really great product to have for men who hunt, play any type of paint ball , or just about anything you would think you would need eye protection for."
5.0,"#GOHUSKIES! Fit my phone perfectly. Its not a &#34;defender&#34; type case, just more for looks."

5.0,very beautiful and elegant
5.0,"Wore this for an event. They were a hit. After having lights on for a while, lights will just blink red."
5.0,Perfect. Great quality. Speedy delivery.
5.0,Bought it for a friend so that her shoulders and upper body would stay warm while she was watching TV.  Does exactly that and she loves it!  Excellent purchase!
5.0,Got this bag on clearance and I really like this purchase. It's real Leather and soft to the touch. It also keeps it's shape and is easy to clean.

5.0,I am a Topfoxx junkie! I have loved every single pair I have gotten and these didn't disappoint. Quality is amazing! Stylish and sleek yet edgy.
5.0,"Very well made, however it is much longer than I thought (I'm 5'5&#34;) It goes down past my knees to mid shin.  It's still lovely though and looks great with boots."

5.0,"I formed a nickel allergy and unfortunately could no longer wear my gold wedding band.  I have been looking for a nice alternative that was not gold or gold color and found this ring.  I LOVE it, i have received so many compliments and inquiries as to where i got it!  Ended up buying my husband a new stainless steel comfort band too so we still ""match"", funny thing is we both now have comfortable, stylish new bands after 15 years, and we spent LESS THAN $30!!  That just makes me smile!"
5.0,"Great product for the value. Small, durable, inexpensive. I've noticed that on this model the light button does not light up the entire display like the older models. When you press the light button, there is on a yellow light on the left side of the display. It does not completely illuminate the whole display, but it still works. Do I like the light? No, but I bought this watch for its other characteristics like its size, durability, and price. Would I buy another one? Yes"
5.0,Love this dress! The color is gorgeous and it fit according the the size chart.
5.0,Super cute dress and very affordable. Had to re-order bc the first one didn’t include the belt but am glad I did.

5.0,"Purchased for my sis-in law and she loves it.  It is very shiny and good quality and has held up well.  The band is wide, but its appropriate for the design."

5.0,Really comfortable. Stretchable and fit great around the wait
5.0,This shirt is so cute and I love the fabric!
5.0,Love these sunglasses! Can’t wait to wear them on the boat this summer. The color is beautiful and they are so different with the blue frame and lense. The are unique and very well made. Definitely would purchase again.
5.0,"Good quality, but it doesn’t look like beautiful with Garmin movie hr gold"
5.0,"Socks are one of those things that I think people fall into two categories. The first is a person who just thinks socks are socks, an item of clothing meant to cover the feet - no big whoop. The other is a person who takes the opportunity to adorn themselves with fun prints because they can and its FUN! I am of the latter group and myself own all fun printed socks. That being said, it’s natural that my kids wear fun socks too. You won’t find a pair of white socks in my house. While that means, sometimes we lose a matching pair, my kids don’t mind being mismatched either.<br /><br />I picked up this set of baby girls ankles socks and I love just how little itty bitty they are. Here’s a rundown of my thoughts.<br /><br />Fit and Size. This is a 6-24 month sizing. I wouldn’t think too hard about the size as long as your kid is in that age group because socks are so stretchy that unless you have little tiny newborn feet, these will fit.<br />Prints. The prints are true to what is depicted on the product page. The colors are vibrant and sharp. There are also grips on the bottom of the sole which come in handy with my tile floors. The stitching is very nicely done and there is uniformity of design and size from color to color which speaks to the quality of the socks. There is a lacey trim detail at the top for extra cuteness. Depending on the size of your child’s foot, this should hit ankle to slightly above. We live in Las Vegas and it is hot, but I don’t necessarily want her barefeet all the time. This is a perfect lightweight sock.<br />Laundering. These can be washed and dried as normal. They did not bleed or shrink.<br />Extra details. Each pair of socks come individually sealed in its own bag which makes it easy to gift. There is a free gift of a baby bracelet included which I probably won’t use but it’s a nice extra touch by the seller.<br />Price Point. At 8.99 for getting some designer socks, I think this is a fair and competitive price. If you went to any baby boutique store, you’d easily pay double that.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with these adorable socks and can’t wait to put them on my daughter when she’s a bit older.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Came on time. Fit student actor just fine.<br />Price acceptable.

5.0,Everything was as expected and it came a day early.
5.0,Excellent quality at a very affordable price. I own five pairs which I keep arround the House and Office and I use them all the time.
5.0,"Love the shape, personalized name and birthstone, and the chain is dainty,  foot pendant with chain just wish it was a.little bigger, but that's on me.  My granddaughter wanted.it for.her new baby and she loves it.  would.definitely buy again"
5.0,This shirt is so cute! And it's a soft material for baby's. I would definitely buy it again

5.0,I absolutely love this watch!  It's such a nice watch for such a good price!  I love the two wooden bead bracelets that came with it too!!<br />The little box it comes in is so cute as well. N

5.0,soooo cute!
5.0,Fits as expected. Nice tummy support. Long enough to prevent chafing and doesn't roll up on the bottoms. Pockets are deep enough to hold phone.
5.0,Comfy and geeky! Does it get any better?
5.0,"This bag has held up well. It is well-made, its materials are of good quality, and it holds enough things without being too large. It is a good buy for its price."
5.0,I was looking for an inexpensive piece to wear all the time. I have a baby and won't risk her yanking something pricy and breaking it. This necklace is perfect--looks more expensive than it was and also holds up to little fists. I'm very pleased.
5.0,"Soft, warm, beautiful!!"
5.0,"Works well even wit my fake rolex ""Invitcta"" I love it"
5.0,It's so pretty! Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,"I must say I am over the top impressed with these adult swim goggles! From the lenses to the strap, every inch is great! They even have a clip in the back so it is much easier to put them on your head before swimming and remove them from your head after swimming. That is my favorite part, I do not have to worry about snagging my hair. They are adjustable and the straps are strong but stretchy. They fit comfortably. I got the black set and I love that the lense is mirror finish. It is a sleek look. The suction cups fit perfectly around my eyes and they did not let any water in when I swam. They block UV rays and the are anti-fog. These definitely meet all my standards and go way above and beyond! I would recommend to all adults since here are so many color options to choose from.they even came with ear plugs and a locking plastic container.  I received these goggles at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the seller in anyway. All reviews are based on my own opinions."
5.0,I have really enjoyed this set. Great price. I love having them apart of my bracelet options.
5.0,"These rocks were larger than what the photo looked like online, but the white was very easy to paint over. The paint didn't keep soaking into rock at all. Very easy to do and they turned out great."
5.0,"So thrilled to have found these! They are adorable & fit true to size! My son has wide feet, and the double strap sandal is the only sandal that fits him comfortably. Great price & product 👌"
5.0,"I have decided to give the bags as a gift, so my friends and family would stop using plastic bags. The only complain is that the bags are not biodegradable..."

5.0,It is easy to wash. It covers all the top & her lap.
5.0,"Love this blazer. Was looking for something light and semi-professional that I could wear to either an interview or just a day out. It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable, and it went through the washer and dryer with no problems."
5.0,I call them my “excellent Ben Franklin’s”...as it was he who created the crescent 1/2 moon style spectacled. These are even better with the scoop center point in each eye piece. Looking over the lens is not a problem like in many readers. I only wish you offered us the other two readers made by this company for Amazon. They’re absolutely unique @ the case they come with is perfect. Thank you!
5.0,"Fit as expected, color is true to pictures online. Very soft and comfortable to sleep in."

5.0,"want to replace the band my S2 active came with. This one is cheap, lightweight. works well, we will see how long the velcro hold up. but heck for the price I wil just buy another"
5.0,"The size is exactly what I hoped for, and the colors were great!  The material is a stiff”ish” felt, which works well for my smaller glasses and some fancier larger frames.  They stay in the pouch well, and I don’t have to worry about them sliding out in my purse.  I’m happy with my choice!"
5.0,It works perfectly looks great!
5.0,Perfect for small wrists.  Great looking band!
5.0,"This bag is going to be perfect for my travels, should fit right in my suit case and be helpful."
5.0,"I can’t begin to RAVE enough about my new Bossanova leggings! The quality, the FIT, the comfort, AND AFFORDABLE! At first I had my doubts because it seemed too good to be true, but after wearing them weeks on end, washing them 4x and seeing how well the quality remained, I had to give it to them. The investment was well worth it. I highly recommend every person owns a pair and experience that special joy of finding the right pair of leggings! Happy customer!"
5.0,I LOVE this eyeglass holder. Beautiful yet sturdy. I'm never without it. Highly recommend product and service.
5.0,"This was exactly what my son wanted! It was very easy to put up and it looks amazing in his room. It stays on the wall, I would recommend this product."
5.0,This is a  measuring tool not a shoe.  It does the job and I now can order on line for shoes for Granddaughters.

5.0,Very cute. Fits great and arrived very much in time.
5.0,These are the most comfortable leggings I have bought! Would def. Recommend
5.0,I like the scarf but I did not realize that the only warming part is on the back of the neck. For some reason I thought the warmth would be all over. I still love it and it does help keep you warm. The fabric is super soft and high quality.
5.0,Super soft with snug waist. Does not ride up.
5.0,These will be will used well. They fit perfectly and go with so many shirts that go over them. They class an outfit up.
5.0,Fits my 9 year old great
5.0,Its a knitted beanie... really cute just needs to be stretched... and i was expecting them to come in January but they came the week after i ordered it... cant wait to wear...
5.0,"Beautiful, my girlfriend loved it! good size and look. Nice presentation."
5.0,Took my usual 45 minute power walk in 90 degree humid (VA) weather and for the entire time my neck and into my head was cool. Looking forward when the Mission cooling gaiter becomes available again. Jay
5.0,"I love this romper, slightly see through but I wear a long lace shawl so you can't tell. I wear a 36D and I have a great bralette I wear under it, there's no way you can wear a conventional bra because of the open back. Perfect when paired with a belt, and a pair of wedges :)"
5.0,Cute t-shirt for work!! Very comfortable. Doesn't need ironing. Super easy to wash and wear.
5.0,It fit as. Expected and is of good material
5.0,My daughter in law load it!
5.0,My daughter loves these pants! Might have to buy her another pair! She says they are super soft and comfy.
5.0,"These bracelets are beautiful. They go along with everything and are thin enough to stack on your wrist without it feeling heavy. Even though these bracelets are cheap, their material is not. These bracelets are highly durable for normal wear. I would compare these bracelets to something that you would see in a department store glass jewelry case."
5.0,Me encantaron están súper lindas
5.0,Good quality at a cheap price. Perfect for college sporting events that require these.
5.0,Very convenient to wear within the workplace
5.0,"Much larger than I anticipated.  The detail is fantasic and the medal itself is extremely durable.  Very,very cool.  If you are looking for a Benedictine Medal, this is the one."
5.0,Excellent quality hat. 2-year update: the hat still looks good. Still holds it shape and has been cleaned with a wet sponge many times!!!
5.0,Very cute and seem like they'll hold up well. Great for my narrow feet. Little more arch would be nice.
5.0,"I love this bra but it's hard to find.  Thanks for the excellent, fast service."
5.0,I bought these for my teenage son for a Christmas gift.  He wanted Black diamond post earings.....he doesn't have pierced ears.  So this looked like the next best thing.  I tried them on and they look and feel nice.  I hope he likes them....because he can't get his ears pierced until he is 18! :P
5.0,"I have a curvy, hourglass figure and this dress did the trick for me! Nicely hides flaws while respecting my curves. The length is perfect. The fabric is silky and it looks more expensive than it was. A great find! I'm ordering more colors. I am a 10/12 and I ordered a large, but a medium probably would have been fine too."
5.0,"This is a beautiful pendant with significant meaning. The string it comes with is usually removed and replaced with a chain. I wear one and gave one as a gift. As a result of my friend wearing it I have had to order another for her friend and expect to buy more over time. It is admired and desired by everyone who sees it, Male and female alike. the large integrated chain loop easily accommodates any chain, large or small very securely."
5.0,"Asa we need face masks these are a great option,  Hope we have a quick turnaround to this virus so there is no need to take such precautions."

5.0,"My wife is a panda fanatic. I have bought her many panda inspired products, but never a ring. I was always hesitant about buying her a ring online because of not knowing if the sizing would be correct. I bought her this panda ring and it was perfect for resizing a small amount. It looks great, all of the pieces were in perfect place when it arrived, nothing loose or missing. Great seller. Definitely recommend this seller!"
5.0,"Love this skort. Cute and Silky, light weight and moves with your body, love it"
5.0,So amazed a real watch can be purchased at this price. I wanted a watch without batterys and would keep time??? amazing but must be wind twice a day if not wearing.
5.0,"The feeling of the fabric. I love how it hugs my skin and show off muscle.<br />I'm a size medium in womens so I purchased a small and it's great for me.<br />Very much a casual shirt, it's not for work. Especially of you're doing hard labor."
5.0,Perfect for my hobby
5.0,Exceptionally well constructed slipper.  Good solid materials and good looking.  A little heavier than most other slippers because of the build quality.  I just bought a second pair.
5.0,"The only bad things I can say about it, and it’s not really “bad” is that mine is pink and gets dirty pretty quickly..I just put it in a sock, tie the sock with a hair and and throw it in the wash and it comes out perfect! The other thing is that the attachments to the watch are plastic…so far they are holding up, but…..🤷‍♀️<br />Otherwise, I LOVE it! Quick and easy to adjust and just slips right on…no fussing with having to latch the Watch…def gonna purchase more in different colors!"
5.0,Gorgeous! I love it!!
5.0,"In the reviews a lot of people mention sleeping in this cap. I purchased this cap because I was tired of walking my dogs on those foggy/misty/humid days, and having my natural hair shrink and frizz up!! This was perfect. The band is not at all tight around my hairline, and the satin doesn’t tug my curls. I would totally recommend :-)"
5.0,Beautiful lacy scarf.  Very happy with purchase
5.0,"The product is exactly what you see online. Good quality, nice and thick material, and the colors are true to the online photos. This material is thicker than the rectangular bags that are about the same size. Super dope!"
5.0,Have received many compliments on these earrings and have been told they are very unique and distinctive and I found these to be versatile.
5.0,"Great for the price, looks good. I like how it came with the extra red string."

5.0,I like the jogging suit comfortable and true to size and the pants right length I can say the best suit I ever purchase exactly my size and fit.

5.0,Sweatshirt was just what I wanted
5.0,Arrived on time and very nice look
5.0,Are the best!!!!

5.0,It was engraved exactly the way I wanted it and I received it very quickly!
5.0,I bought this for my 16 year old son for school formal homecoming dance.  It is a lot better made than I expected it to be.  He felt so fancy and much cheaper than renting a tux!
5.0,"looks great, soft strap and stitching is really nice."
5.0,These like all leather is a little tough to break in but I love it and the colour. I love that it’s not huge n bulky like most other Apple Watch bands
5.0,my fave

5.0,Looks just like the picture. Fits perfect- true to size
5.0,Changes my mood when I put it on.  Makes me want to do the soul train strut!

5.0,Our great granddaughter loves this watch we gave her for Christmas!
5.0,Perfectly beautiful.  My daughter loves it!
5.0,My husband started using one of these as a high school football referee to keep his shirt in place throughout the entire game. Now he wears it with all his business/dress clothes. It does the job. Shirt stays perfectly tucked and neat!
5.0,"I bought this product in a discount in return for my honest opinion, I love it,it's very pretty and the colors look beautiful ,and the length is just right.....I will highly recommend  it to my family and friends.....Thanks"
5.0,I love it so much.<br />It is a practical accessory for those combinations that need a small accent detail and that's it.
5.0,A Bit Smaller Then I Expected. Still Love Them Though.
5.0,"I had none of the problems that other reviews stated.  Belt should outlast any older belt with holes.  So far I love everything about it, but time will tell."
5.0,"Me encanto! La tela buena calidad y queda hermoso! Me queda de largo perfecto! Ya q soy pequeña me queda en la mitad de la pierna ya q mido 5"" y no me gusta mas arriba de la rodilla. Lo recomiendo 100%"
5.0,I absolutely love this sweatshirt. Its soft and I can sleep in it. The material is soft and stays soft after washing it multiple times. The colors are still in tact.
5.0,I am very satisfied with this toe ring. A little thin so it is not easily seen. Therefore a little pricy for the actual amount of gold used. But would still buy again.
5.0,Fun design and serves the purpose
5.0,Fit perfect will not fall ogf your head
5.0,Beautiful dress for the price. I loved the fit and it was perfect.
5.0,Amazed at the quality of the leather ant the construction for the price. The color was as the picture in the website. It is very spacious too! Great little bag for traveling and shopping. Love it!
5.0,Love it.  Also received many compliments!
5.0,"This top fits well, is very soft, is pretty and flattering.  I like the rounded edge; sleeves are comfortable and a good length."
5.0,"Very pleased with this product, good quality, looks like the photo."
5.0,Great Product Very cute to wear. Can be slightly awkward ay first but one you get it on there right you will never want to take it off. Plus the sellers are very helpful
5.0,Great weight for my hot climate and the colors are awesome.  Also like the longer “sleeve”.
5.0,"I love this ring; however it is very heavy and because I had to get it a little larger to go over my knuckle it spins on my finger, and that is annoying, but if you have a perfect fit that would not happen to you.  These rings do run a little large."
5.0,Too cute fit perfect
5.0,Couldn't believe the price and quality. I thought it would be a piece of crap but took and chance and ordered it. It's a good quality belt that should last 10 years.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:3876216f35a08a8a8d2964293920620f]] Super sturdy, love them."
5.0,I'm a teacher and it serves its purpose. I think it is worth the money I paid for it. Would buy it again.
5.0,I love this shirt!! I bought for family pictures and it looks great! So soft and fits great. I plan to buy more in other colors!
5.0,"This dress is so adorable. I bought an xs. So I intended it to wear as a shirt with leggings and because the front material is flat I thought it would for that way. Surprisingly it fit absolutely perfect that I could just wear as a dress with tights and ankle boots. I'm 5""2 138 pounds and 36dd girls. My arms are not really small but not big either. I can't believe the xs fit me so well like this. I wonder if I had bought a medium it would have been waaay to big. I guess it's the material. But it's the cutest dress ever."
5.0,Beatiful dress! I loved it
5.0,"This top is beautiful. The material is thin and will show bumps/lumps underneath in case you're trying to cover that - but nothing a tank top underneath won't aid with. I was reading some people saying it was too small and ordered one size larger than my normal, but like another reviewer, wish that I hadn't. I will be keeping this and ordering another in my normal size. It really all depends on your body shape. I suggest going with your normal size and then trying one larger if it doesn't fit. Prime means free returns, so why not? Overall, LOVE this top."
5.0,"I love the earrings they are beautiful,The color is a very butiful blue, they look better in person than on the screen. I usally have problems with gold in my ears after about an hour, but I have no problems with these. Thank you, Nancy"
5.0,Great price and great products.  I kept one myself and gave the other as a gift.  Definitely recommend this purchase.
5.0,Great value. Easily interchange lenses. Five sets for the price of one.
5.0,Love these socks. Extreme comfort for those long 12 hour shifts.
5.0,Bought these because I had ankle surgery and needed compression socks to help in recovery.  These were much more comfortable than others bought at a pharmacy.  They were easy to get one and off.  Only discomfort is where the Logo is printed on the side of foot rests against my scars.
5.0,"Love how bright the colors are! Was nervous at first but I definitely do not regret ordering. I've had so many compliments since the purchase! Also would size down, it's a pretty loose fitting shirt, I normally wear medium but got a small."
5.0,Love this dress...<br />Good material
5.0,"These are the best! I have never had headbands stay put as well as these! I wear them for spin class and they stay on and absorb all the sweat, perfect!"
5.0,I ordered these masks for my 13yr. Old son.<br />He loves them.
5.0,My daughter loves these and they look so cute!  They even last all day and night my daughter is 3 so they hold up to a lot!!
5.0,Love these! Don’t turn my skin green and they’re beautiful!
5.0,Love how they feel on. Makes me feel aexy
5.0,"I absolutely love these socks for my three year old boy. They are thick, return to form (good elastic), soft and durable. They wash up well and have a classic style. The colors even compliment each other well enough that I'm not embarrassed to mix and match should the need arise. These are my new go to socks for my boys!"
5.0,"Lovely stone, lightweight, delicate yet sturdy. Love it."
5.0,"The Polarspex Kids Sunglasses are great! They arrived on time, we’ll protected in the package, with a nice wool or felt eyeglass case in which to store them. They are very comfortable and my grandson loves them!"
5.0,"This was ordered for my son-in-law, so I can't really review it, but he seems to find it satisfactory."
5.0,THEY ARE COMFORTABLE will let you know how they hold up
5.0,"The gloves fit as expected, are very soft, & warmer than I expected (which is great). The microfiber material also keeps the gloves from getting extremely damp from the snow when cleaning off my car."
5.0,fast shipping. good quality
5.0,nice boots....
5.0,Unique and adorable piece.
5.0,The title says it all. Worth every penny. Very pleased. Highest quality and beautiful fabric.<br /><br />Worth the price and worth the wait for K shipping.
5.0,"Look great and are nice and dark. They are a bit big unless you have a big head, like me. You can't really see the eyes of the wearer. They definitely are polarized like they were described. I took them to Bermuda and they worked great. The only problem I had was with the nose pieces. They were kind of sharp. Nothing a bit of sand paper or a knife can't fix."
5.0,"I purchased this for my upcoming wedding in May. It's exactly what I was looking for. Plus, I appreciate the extended clasp being that I have large and wide hands and small wrists. It also come in a velvet baggy for safe keeping."
5.0,This version is very shiny but Mil Spec. Good product and good vendor
5.0,"These are so cute and comfortable! They look adorable with every outfit. Very stable, nice and flexible, without any weird tripping edges like a lot of sandals have. My toddler can run in these without tripping. Love them!"

5.0,Super fast shipping! Product is awesome!!!!
5.0,I like it! Recommend it
5.0,It is a very cute shirt. I love all the Patty boutik shirts. Fit great. Soft material. Great for work or play!
5.0,"I bought this for when I ride my horse on those hot summer days.  I have cooling bandanas that I use but I liked how these have the slip tie bead on it. No need to tie it on. Just slide the bead. Been using this for 4 days so far and it's working out great. I put it in a baggie of water to soak and put the baggie in my cooler. The bandana soaks on my ride to the barn. When I get there the bandana is ready to go. After about an hour, the bandana feels dry, but it still keeps me nice and cool.  Love this product and  I do plan to buy more.  Oh, I also ride western and this has a bit of a western look to it......perfect!!"
5.0,Lightning fast.
5.0,"These are incredible!!!  I was worried that they wouldn't be as good as the original FITBIT bands, but they are so much better than I expected.  I love the colors!!!  Now I can color coordinate my band to what I'm wearing.  LOVE THEM!!!"
5.0,Perfect fit just right!!!!
5.0,"Love them for night driving and for early morning driving with rain and smog. A big 10.<br />The only thing one thing, they scratch really easy."
5.0,really funny
5.0,I love these leggings! I purchased two pair - black and gunmetal. I've worn them for various holiday parties and they look awesome! Great purchase!

5.0,"I was worried that these wouldn't fit, surprisingly they do, they stretch pretty darn well."
5.0,"Very well made, but definitely runs small. Order next size up.<br />Chart shows how all the pockets are to be used."
5.0,"awesome for the money, very difficult to find glasses for my big head.  These are nice and big."
5.0,"It’s a beautiful dress, well made.  It was too large, but my granddaughter put it on and refused to take it off."
5.0,Absolutely a GREAT watch band....and the quick pins that were included made assembly a breeze
5.0,Just as described. I love it
5.0,Om Mani Padme Hum
5.0,Love it using it in rehearsal & on Sunday for choir.  It keeps everyone happy much better than regular masks you have space for your lips to move.  Still a little warm but you learn to deal with that
5.0,"Small size is roomy, not tight. Fabric is really soft and comfy. Super cute!"
5.0,"Very elegant but also alluring and very flattering!  I'm a 36D, and weigh 136  I took a large which fit just perfect!  Also bought in white!"
5.0,I am a big fan of Fender products and this hat reminds me of my visits to the visitor center in Corona. Love this hat. Just with is was fitted like a franchise hat instead of open in the back
5.0,I bought it from my boyfriend and they are a very comfortable slipper and he looks very good in them.
5.0,A little cute message to the ones you love! Thoughtful and budget friendly!
5.0,Great matching set and quality.  Wore for my wedding and got a lot of compliments and matched my wife's ivory wedding dress perfectly!
5.0,These are well made and attractive.
5.0,So excited to have a little black dress that has POCKETS!! They are deeper than the photo makes them look. Sleeves are a tad tight and skirt is a bit long but overall very pleased.<br />Updated to add: I wear this everytime I work at a wedding and it is perfect. I get so many compliments when I  wear it!
5.0,"The grey cap is 100% wool with a plaid quilted lining. Really a high quality cap and looks great on this old bald head. As it is 100% wool, it keeps my head warm. I expect to have this for many years. Apparently some of the colors are wool blends. This one is the real thing. Love it. Fits just right (L)"
5.0,Right on!
5.0,"This product not only makes you feel pretty and feminine but it wraps you in beautiful comfort. I never thought I would say this about pajamas. I actually felt so comfortable that I had a better night's sleep. They are true to size, luxurious and for satin, they do not overheat. Truly a product worth trying."
5.0,I love this. Fits really well and very comfortable.
5.0,Beautiful skirt!! Has gorgeous high waist and can be used for the most dressy occasions. It's totally my favorite skirt this season! Highly recommended!!
5.0,This is a great handbag.  I will be honest and say I am not usually a person that walks around with designer ANYTHING!  So you can imagine the people commenting on this handbag when I am out and about.  I will say that this handbag is my favorite and I believe I may be spoiled and will never buy a cheap handbag ever again.  This is one of the strudiest purses I have ever owned.  Stitching is phenomenal and I found no imperfections.  Material is very thick and very durable.  The inside of the purse is just as impressive as the outside with pockets to store all your belongings in.  I love the handle size as you can easily throw over your shoulder or pack on your forearm and still look fantastic.  This even came with a nice storage bag or dust bag to store the purse in while not in use.  I am so impressed with the overall quality of this purse.  I am now spoiled with well designed purses.<br />I received this purse for testing and reviewing purposes this is my honest unbiased opinion by using the purse myself.  This in no way influenced my review in any way.  This purse does NOT disappoint
5.0,I’ve bought two of these pants and I love them! Super flattering and comfortable. Love the pockets and material. Best part is that my dogs hairs don’t stick to the pants!!!! Must need if you have pets that shed like crazy!!<br /><br />Only downside I will say is that these pants can give you a slight camel toe. Not too bad though to just wear around the house or to workout in.
5.0,"Quality bracelet. Great for any proud Scot :) Identical to the light blue flex bracelet I commented on, but wider, which I prefer."
5.0,"I needed a heavier weight bib for the colder weather and I just finished my first 7 mile ride in 48F weather. With wool socks, a base layer, and a windproof jacket I felt just fine. My legs never got cold, but they didn’t overheat either. These will probably work well down to 30F or so. The right side zipper keeps snagging on the seam, but it seems to function just fine otherwise, so it’s not an issue. Time will tell if it holds up to continued use."
5.0,Perfect accessory for my toad stool costume!
5.0,"I got these for my fiancé and oh my god!! They fit him perfectly and they are SO warm. Sometimes I steal them👀 we live in a cold area of the world too, think -degrees in the winter. Perfect gift for anyone who’s hands are cold💕"
5.0,"Great fit, pretty colors not too thin. Love to wear for yoga. Plan to purchase more. Thank-you Neleus and Amazon"
5.0,This sweater is oversized I use a size Large and ordered a Medium. I love it!!!
5.0,Very beautiful color. Loved the light flowy feel of marerial. Perfect for spring and summer. Low price but does not feel cheap.
5.0,A very comfortable shoe and warm on cold snowy days. They may be to warm for the summer. Time will tell.
5.0,Was having a hard time finding Russell brand sweatshirts in the stores. These sweatshirts were just what I was looking for .
5.0,Fit and good quality. Very happy with the product.
5.0,"Nice sweatshirt. Roomy, but not oversized. Washes well with no shrinking!"
5.0,Better than expected at that price. My son loves them and put them on as soon as we opened the package!
5.0,No problems with item. Fit great and looked so good on me.
5.0,"This watch is exactly the same as the regular F-91W, except for the silver case and clear wristband. The clear wristband keeps my arm from getting a tanline where the watch is, since the sun can get through."
5.0,Great slip for those shorter dresses.
5.0,"Nice, great value."
5.0,I bought it for a wedding and it looked great for the price. It fitted well. Not the high end item but it looked nice.
5.0,"I bought it a bit large so it would be loose. I'll have to take in the arms, as it looks goofy with loose arms. True to size. The inside feels very muxh polyester."
5.0,I love the variety!
5.0,Ibroghter it as a gift for my grand son for Christmas don't know how it fit yet
5.0,Very cute pjs for the money
5.0,"The hat itself is great, very versatile for hiking or beach trips. It came with different strings for security and attachable hat tighteners if needed. The fact that a shield could be added very reasonably, and that it's easily removed makes this such a great choice!"
5.0,I got more compliments on this cheap dress than anything else I've worn this summer. Makes the boobs look good.
5.0,Was very pleased that it fits.
5.0,So far so good I keep them on all the time color is still looks great
5.0,"Love this Dress , it looks amazing on my girlfriend.  The perfect summer dress."
5.0,Great watch. The copper is a nice alternative to rose gold and the dial is unique enough to be interesting without being gaudy.<br /><br />Purchased from Premium Japan and was delivered in 4 days to the east coast.
5.0,"For my children's joint birthday party this year, we chose a Middle Earth/ Medieval theme. I bought this dress thinking it would be a cute costume, but I was so pleasantly surprised when I put it on. Not only is it very flattering, but it is made from an amazingly comfortable fabric and is well made. I have worn it many times after the party and always get so many compliments on it. I may just order it in another color. Because this dress it very stretchy, be sure to order it in your true size. It's also very long, so if you're shorter than 5'4"", you may want to hem it or wear high heels with it."

5.0,comfortablr

5.0,like so much I bought another pair.
5.0,"These are perfect for my helix piercings as well as my lobes. I was concerned they would be too thick of a gauge but they went in without any resistance. Nice quality, fast shipping."
5.0,Fit's great!  I ordered a 2X. Lots of room.  The colors are bright and have not faded after washing.
5.0,"Great pin, the style and quality is great."
5.0,"I truly like the Dacia crossbody bag, I have it in both colors. I have received many compliments. It looks really expensive well worth it for the price."
5.0,"They are beautiful, I love them. My grandson will love it with the cross. Thank you."
5.0,"MY INITIAL REVIEW (One Star):  ""Was expecting shades for daytime use.  These are yellow lens for night driving.  Not happy but not worth returning.  Will not buy again from this manufacturer.""<br /><br />MY REVISED REVIEW (Five Stars):  The vendor reached out to me, apologizing for the error, and offered to replace, at no charge, the yellow-tint (night driving) glasses with the proper darker-tinted version (day driving)... which he did expeditiously. With such excellent service, all is forgiven! Thank you, James, for your conscientious attention.<br /><br />NOTE:  I have purchased (""As Seen On TV""  in-store) several pairs of these sunglasses (designed to fit over or without prescription glasses).  They are the best sunglasses I have ever worn and I do intend to acquire extra sets."
5.0,Low profile wallet and my third of this style. This one is my favorite and the magnet clip is awesome. If you get too close to an appliance like a dryer your butt will stick as the magnet is so strong 👌 Cards can be a pain to remove at times.
5.0,Very cool I like it a lot.
5.0,Perfect for my 10 year old!
5.0,My snake-loving son loves these!
5.0,These skirts are super soft. Feels really light against the skin. I love the length as well. It can be worn as a skirt or a tube dress. I'm very pleased

5.0,"One comment said these pants were lined—they are not. The material is lightweight. Not sure how they travel with respect to wrinkling, etc. Nice looking. I like them a lot."
5.0,"Amusing mask, depending on who is wearing it. Quality is adequate for the sort of mask these times require."
5.0,"Very sturdy and feels nice, works for what I need"

5.0,Works great for a very low price
5.0,"This blue dress is SO pretty! I got so many compliments on it! I normally wear a 4-6 and am 5’4” and the small fit great. The slit comes just above my knee and the v-neck needed a little cami under to be comfortable. The arms are flowy and will show under your arms but I had a cami on. Super flattering, I love the drawstring waist!"
5.0,Exactly what I expected and very prompt.
5.0,Fit great & stylish!
5.0,I was nervous at 1st because I didn’t know how it was going to come out. But! I love the dress!!!! I got a large and it fits  comfortable. I’m 5’8 and it goes to the ground w/o heels on. I am wearing it for my bday. Thanks!!!!
5.0,"I was surprised this fit because most of Allegra K clothing is small. I am a Large in US clothing, bust is 34 B and my arms and shoulders are semi bigger so I was worried. This is perfect. It's 100% see-through, so I wear a white tank top under (of course)  and the neckline is a bit itchy because the sequins touch my neck- but worth it. I wear it to work and I love it."
5.0,"Cute and comfortable. Adds cleavage when tightened, but a good bra for anytime."
5.0,Good quality fabric and beautiful print
5.0,Very light and cute

5.0,This nightgown is so soft-great for sleeping-love it.
5.0,These were a gift for a crazy cat lady and she loved them
5.0,Really nice quality and light weight. A little loose for my face but I still decided to buy another.
5.0,This necklace is super cute and exactly what I wanted! Perfect for my Dapper Day Wendy Darling outfit. Thanks!
5.0,"Exactly what I want for work - looks professional but feels like I'm wearing a T-shirt. Got lots of compliments. I'm 5'1, 102 lbs, bought size S. Fit is great in terms of width. It falls about an inch below the knees on me."
5.0,"I bought the 6 pack, item as described, fast shipping, really like the extra large size of these bandanas, make sure to follow the laundry instructions, these do fade a little the first couple of washes."
5.0,"I had been wanting to buy uggs to warm my feet for the cold Wisconsin winters, but didn't want the sloppy look of the ugg boot, so I decided to go with these instead. I think they are really cute, and comfortable, however they are NOT shearling lined like the Ugg. I will keep these, but will still be getting the Ugg for more warmth."
5.0,I have six of these purses. What more do I need to say!
5.0,A little tight but nice
5.0,Just the jogger you need for every day activities…
5.0,"These are comfortable compression socks with really cool designs. I’m an average-sized woman and wear size 8.5 shoes in most brands, sometimes I need a 9. Anyway, I have an aversion to tight socks on my toes, so I got these in Large/X-Large. These left plenty of room for my toes and provided a nice amount of compression. I don’t need super compression, as I wear these for comfort and fatigue relief. I love the designs and have a lot of fun with crazy compression sock patterns. These aren’t your grandma’s compression socks!<br /><br />One note: wash these multiple times before wearing as they have a chemical order which diminishes with washing. I assume it’s from the fabrication process, as I’ve had similar experiences with other brands of socks.<br /><br />Very pleased with these socks, just the type I like most.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

5.0,Husband liked them but then they were OU  socks!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3b66e25a0a36d12f4e3792c881e7662f]] I purchased this set for me and my sister’s. I didn’t know if they would like it. I was totally wrong. They loved it.
5.0,Beautiful. Runs slightly smaller. Very fitted. High end quality fabric and design.
5.0,I like these pants well enough. Warm. Cozy. I’m 5’3” 116 lbs. bought a 26x30. Pants are generous. I wish they sold a size smaller with a longer inseam.
5.0,These fit my 4.5 year old great. They adjust easily behind the ears and the peice is nice and small so it doesn't bother behind the ear. The nose also has the metal peice to help keep the mask in place. No complaints from my kiddos!
5.0,Breathable and comfortable! I love the leather feel! The most comfortable sandals to walk around in the house or in the pool area :)
5.0,it really make a difference!
5.0,"I like the different feature with the snow flake. It could be interpreted in different ways. What I would also like to see is a silver and gold and a rose gold set made. This would complete my collection. I hope you agree. The face of the watch could use some change. Both the bronze and the black have black faces. The black has regular numbers and the bronze has roman numerals. On the gold watch an off gold color with roman numerals on the face, the numeral should be shiny rose gold on the silver a buffed dull aluminum face with roman numerals and shiny number in silver, on the rose gold it should have  of color of the rose with shiny gold roman numerals, On those 3 being a finer look, shiny gold, silver, and rose gold hands on the designated pieces."
5.0,Fits great.  They are the right weight.  I will look for other colors to order.  They travel well without wrinckles.
5.0,Love this dress!! Great price!!!
5.0,Its a lot bigger than it looks
5.0,This shirt is amazing I love it!!!! Doesn’t feel or smell weird like a couple of shirts I’ve ordered from amazon before. It’s perfect I will be wearing this alllll the time for sure!
5.0,This is a very well made shoulder shield. It really reduces the felt impact of any file/shotgun without being too bulky. I really like this product!
5.0,I love this ring wear it all the time it does get caught on things sometimes!
5.0,Cute sandals to play In or even dress up with a little cute dress
5.0,They where a Christmas gift .
5.0,"Beautiful shirt, fits nice on my fat short body.."
5.0,I bought this pendant years ago and I still wear it to this day. Its a solid product even though it rarely gets stuck on loose strings on sweaters but that's alright. It's a really solid well made product. I get lots of compliments on it.
5.0,These are all around great set of swim eye wear.
5.0,Nice bracelet-chic goth
5.0,"Pendant as pictured. Arrived well padded and a day early. You can tell from the veins it's real shungite. The string it came with was very thin, so you might want to restring it when you get it. But otherwise, very nice design, and finish."
5.0,The black lab keyring is very nice
5.0,Tal y como se ve en las fotos.
5.0,Very nice ring. It replaces my wedding ring when I'm out and about . I received several compliments on this ring .
5.0,Used it for my Dog lol. Color of my sisters wedding. Attached it to a ribbon. See pic of him totally looking like a boss. He was annoyed by my photo 😂 he was in the middle of eating a treat 🙄lol
5.0,[[VIDEOID:da7ea72b204a4d87b13c304357483dca]]
5.0,Bought as a gift.  She loves them!
5.0,Cute dresses going to wear for my birthday with my daughter ❤
5.0,I love these bands.  They don't feel so heavy on my wrist like the silicone bands.  It's even better to have so many choices of colors with this set.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"The best watch ever! At least that is my not so humble opinion. I got one of these when I was six years old as a birthday present. I was enthralled with it at the time. It was the coolest thing that I owned and it maid me feel like a grown up wearing it. The battery lasted well over seven years and I wore it almost exclusivly until the band broke (due to extensive rough use). I just bought myself another (25 years later) since I am not a watch wearing guy, who would like to wear a watch but finds every watch too big, complicated, and attention grabbing, and expensive. This watch was made for me. And I do not think myself singular in assesing this watch as simplistic in function, resiliant, reliable, and classy (for a sports watch, of course)."
5.0,Smaller than expected which is a nice surprise to me. Kinda hard to open if you're accustomed to a thinner post but makes me believe it won't break when changing them out. Using as a daith ring. Very shiny and cute.
5.0,It's a nice winter hat. It keeps your head and ears warm.
5.0,"If you like snuggly pajamas that are stylish, you'll like this set. The fabric is soft and has a hint of stretch. It gets softer when you wash it (in a laundry bag) with fabric softener. There's a lace tuxedo stripe down the leg and one down the arm. The sizing runs a bit small. You can get your normal size for a bodycon fit or size up for a relaxed fit.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,Excellent product! Very nice size and weight and the colors are exceptionally bright and vibrant. I gave one to my Pastor and he absolutely loved it!
5.0,I love Lucy and this wallet it pretty sturdy and it's a great for your check book and shipping was really fast
5.0,choose this hat because my brother bought the mala which is the black one by peter grimm quality made and a looker
5.0,The belt that comes with the dress runs a little small.  It could be a couple of inches longer.
5.0,Very nice sunglasses. Fit perfectly and look amazing on.
5.0,Love rhese SB Sox! As a RN i work 12 hr shifts — and they are perfect. Will use for hiling also.
5.0,I like how convenient it makes going to meetings and restaurants. I no longer need an additional chair for my purse. But the best part is how it takes the weight of my book bag. Thank you for such a great product. I will bel purchasing them for Christmas presents.
5.0,"Great date night earring or just want to rock it at the grocery store. Love these earrings! It was long and brushed against my shoulders. Also, slightly heavy but I only had it on for a date night evening.<br /><br />Inexpensive and great quality! Seems like it will last for years.<br /><br />Looks exactly as pictured."
5.0,I love this antler rear view mirror hanger!
5.0,Product is very great for the price
5.0,I bought these for my wedding. I love that it came with 3 different sizes.
5.0,"I got this for my tiny princess , and she is smaller than small. I ordered the small and it looks like a great fit. It’s long sleeve and soft fabric, but it’s thinner than a winter sweatshirt. It may be perfect for Spring and Fall , or maybe as a sleep shirt in the winter.  Cute design, but more of heartbeat than a wave to me. It’s an easy price and a nice color blue too ."
5.0,"excellant deal, good product, I plan to buy more"
5.0,These were perfect as a birthday gift! They look as advertised.
5.0,I liked it because of quality and fast shipping
5.0,Love this dress! Very comfortable and I love that it also has pockets!! Super handy. Highly recommend this adorable dress.<br />- Laura
5.0,LOVE my Canadian key chain. I put it on my purse as soon as I took it out of the package.
5.0,"Due to my large chest and curvy figure, I have hard time finding trendy plus size dresses that don't break the bank. I wore this for my annual dance recital and I received so many compliments! It is very light, the ""v"" neck isn't too deep, and it made me feel so cute! The slits on the sides were a bit high when I sat, but it wasn't a deal breaker! I will definitely purchase again in different patterns!"
5.0,Love these yoga pants I wish they had more colors
5.0,Beautiful dress! I wore this to a company Christmas party.<br />The sizing was accurate according to Ther size chart. I went a little bigger than recommended just so it wasn't skin tight.
5.0,"I ordered these for an upcoming vacation with family. I ordered a 4xl bc I wanted it loose. Very true to size. I hate pajamas normall, buy these feel like butter. The are so comfortable.  They are thin so very light. I love love them.  Will be ordering more! I'm normally a 2xl or 3xl on top. 4xl fits great nice and loose"
5.0,This belt is a great fit and quality.  It is not real leather but it doesn't look cheap. I wish the metal was a silver color instead of gold. I can live with it though.
5.0,Very comfortable and soft. In 5'8 I purchased a large and it fit beautifully. It reached to my ankles. I definitely recommend purchasing.
5.0,"Love, light weight, I get lots of compliments on them"
5.0,"It's good, not slash proof but for the purpose I'm using it 4 it work great!!"
5.0,Fit is as expected
5.0,"Very beautiful. Looks expensive, and sparkle in the sun like a real diamonds."
5.0,"Nice, just wish I'd have paid attention to size. Kinda small for a tie but worked out fine."
5.0,Needed the visor for sunrise and sunset on my commutes. My Giro Synthe doesn't come with a visor. It works perfectly with it.
5.0,This figure eight / eternity design detachable keyring is the best! Solid metal - great looking gunmetal gray. The hinge/spring mechanisms are tight and secure. Extremely handy and fairly compact as I have to use valet parking frequently. Terrific value and highly recommend.
5.0,"Well made, fits great. Quick shipping."
5.0,My 5yo absolutely loves this hat.  Keeps his ears warm and he loves the dinosaur design.  Seems to be made very well and very warm.  5 stars from both the 5yo and his mom!
5.0,"This dress is super cute and comfortable, and the color is beautiful. For sizing reference, I'm 5'4"" and 135 lbs and the medium fit perfectly, hitting just above the knee. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Producto de muy buena calidad 100% recomendado
5.0,Ordered these for an outfit for a wedding. Got complements. I wear them all the time now. I love the backing. It is slightly bigger then a traditional gauge piercing but is ok. It did hurt a little getting them in but no problems since. I have sensitive ears and no issues.
5.0,Love these! So worth the value
5.0,"I purchased these two bands with exact watches in mind and couldn't be happier with the result. The blue/black/gray goes perfect with watches with blue dials. The orange/black/gray is great for watches with a black dial. They really add color to your wrist, as well as the watch. It's almost like having a new watch when I swap to one of these bands. Glad I made the purchase!"
5.0,A little tight but hubby loves his Seminoles
5.0,This dress is so cute and comfy 💖 I love getting complements when I wear it!!! Highly recommend it I even ordered it in black too 😆
5.0,"Zebras are the mascot for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, and I'm going to their convention the end of June in Baltimore, MD.  I have a necklace that was given to me as a gift, that this bracelet matches exactly; except the necklace doesn't have rhinestones.<br />I can't wait to wear it at the convention.  This will be my first time attending one, and I want to &#34;shine&#34; with my zebra dress and jewelry.  This bracelet is very special to me."
5.0,"This is a really nice purse that just fits a cell phone and some other necessary items so you don't have to be weighted down. It looks like leather and it's a really nice design that is quite cute and I've had many compliments on. I love the zipper to put a credit card or cash in,  I love the decorative buckles on the front and I like the length of the strap. Red is my favorite color so this person spoke to me."
5.0,Great product 👌 awesome material 👏 great prices 👍
5.0,Great quality. A good buy! They seem to have more quality than the silver and gold ones
5.0,Bought these for my son & he loves them.  I'm buying more.
5.0,My favorite part about this product is the bumps on the two bands to hold the extra strap down as they keep it in place. Bc I have a small wrist this comes in handy.
5.0,Very warm and washing machine durable
5.0,"Let me begin this review with two qualifying statements.  I am a large man 6'3&#34; and 235.  I am also very &#34;picky&#34; about things I wear.  Having stated those things, I must say that the bracelet (8.2&#34;) fits my right wrist perfectly (and I am right hand dominant with large wrists and forearms). Secondly, I really like the style, look, magnetic clasp and everything about it.  At the price, I think the thing is terrific!"
5.0,This dress is true to size. It fits well and hugs my curves. Its also very comfortable.
5.0,So pleased with this dress! It looked more expensive and fit welll when I was pregnant and got married.
5.0,The jacket arrived quickly. It fits perfectly. Extremely comfortable and stylish too. Very well priced.
5.0,She really got a kick out of them.
5.0,"I bought these to wear after my bilateral carpal tunnel release to cover a tender scar, and they do the trick.  I bought two pair so I can wash them every other day.  They are slim enough for any of my daily tasks and they really do provide good coverage over that area.  They look okay, too.  Good buy."
5.0,Super cute pins and well made.
5.0,I love this watch band! It looks just like the picture. Bi complaints on my end.
5.0,The product is very nice and functional just as described by the seller. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others.
5.0,"Very comfortable, put a belt on it and you can dress it up or leave it loose for more casual. Either way, you'll love the comfort"
5.0,Purchased another bifocal pair & everything was blurry looking thru the top.  I decided to try this pair & I Love 💘❤😍 them.  I can see clearly thru the bifocal & looking thru the top of glasses.  Fit was comfortable. & they send the glasses in a nice case that can b clipped to ur pocket or purse..  these are wonderful  I just purchased another pair today
5.0,Slick design and fit very comfortably.  Great price.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I use this hand bag for my everyday use.  I love it!
5.0,"This looks amazing on my fossil watch. I wasnt going to pay 30 dollars to buy an original fossil leather strap just so i can ruin it the same way i ruined the one that came with the watch. I work in a hair salon, my hands are always in water or dealing with chemicals. so my original leather strap got ugly and smelled.I decided to buy a silicone strap, and its amazing. I should of bought one sooner. This strap fit perfectly on my fossil watch that uses a 14mm band. And it has the quick release on the strap which is useful. I highly recommend this product to anyone who works with water, or simply wants to replace/preserve a leather strap. Silicone is the way to go!!"
5.0,Husband is IN-LOVE with these boots. He wears them for all our outdoor projects and his feet have never been warmer. Never going back to traditional snow boots (lace ups)
5.0,Me encantó la textura y la talla me quedó perfecta.
5.0,Great jersey. Great quality. Perfect gift.
5.0,They are just lovely.
5.0,"I love that this is a set of two rings at a decent price. The rings are very smooth and comfortable to wear, but the edges are sharp when inserting them (which happens with all of the segment rings like this). I wear these for my slightly stretched earlobe piercings since I love not having a back or a bead to deal with. They are comfortable to sleep in and easy to clean your ears without removing the rings. I did need pliers to open the rings and to replace the segment, so please be warned if you purchase these and don't intend on using tools. It's hard to do alone, but can be done! Your piercer can also help with inserting the rings if you have a problem and don't mind paying a bit."
5.0,"So comfortable, will buy these in more colors!!"
5.0,"Really cute, soft, and comfortable to wear! Definitely 5 stars!"
5.0,Its very Beautiful too long I just don't what I'm going to do maybe wear it pulled up to my bra.. Lol the material is So the Colors are vibrant maybe I can have this one taken in..
5.0,Very slick on the botton but besides that great
5.0,So these worked out great for a cosplay costume of Jester from Critical Role.
5.0,Good quality. Exchanged for a smaller size.
5.0,this is such good quality for the price
5.0,"This is the first pair of compression shocks that I have tried, they fit really well and seem to be very good quality socks and they seem to reduce the swelling in my legs and feet, thanks."
5.0,"Fits well, decent hat for a cheap price."
5.0,This hat is Fantastic!  It also says &#34;Green Arrow&#34; on the back of the hat.  Just an Awesome Hat!
5.0,I got these for a 20's outfit. Nice!
5.0,"I was surprised at the thickness of the material, which is a good thing in my book. The color is good and has not faded.  The 16 is a perfect 16 for my body.  All my jeans are Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda's."
5.0,"I waited over a year to write this review. this band has held its elastisity, looks amazing still, its the best thing I have bought in a long time."
5.0,"These glasses don't look as expensive as they are rated but they sure do look stylish, classic, and super comfortable.<br />Personally, this one is a nice piece of screw free sunglasses. Suits my face, look great and actually contours my face really well. Everything seems crystal clear with the lenses and they are sturdy and really don't feel like you have anything on at all which is my favorite part.<br /><br />These are the only sunglasses that actually stay on when I'm running or playing sports. I purchased these when I decided to finally buy my first pair of aviator metal frames. Didn't want a traditional aviator but wanted something that looked flashy and these were perfect.<br /><br />I have also been using it for driving and its really cool to wear. They feel very light on your face and offer full sun protection. I don't feel strain on my eyes during bright sunny days. The frame is highly flexible, shatterproof, adjustable and with extra strength, made from 310 stainless steel. They have rubber tips inside the ear stems for added grip.<br /><br />If you are looking for all the things mentioned above, in a timeless cool look then buy these. You won't be disappointed.  It comes with  Sunglasses Box, Sunglasses velvet pouch,  and a Cleaning Cloth.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend these to a friend.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review."
5.0,Such a beautiful dress n soft fabric.
5.0,"I bought 4 of these belts and they are great. The fit is super and they are so cute! the only drawback was that a couple have a very musty smell, but they're adorable enough to not take away a star. I sprayed them with vinegar and will see if that helps."
5.0,I adore these comfortable and stylish skechers sandals.
5.0,Love these glasses! They are stylish and sturdy and very reasonably priced!
5.0,"These are awesome, I bought two more pairs, size up. I am a 7 or 7/12 and I purchased an 8."
5.0,This was made well.
5.0,I get so many compliments on these Helen Heart  shoes ! Casual but fun !
5.0,Very comfortable masks with filter sleeve. Good material with adjustable ear straps. A recommended purchase.
5.0,My grandson liked them
5.0,"When I got this wig I was sooooo excited. I put it on immediately and was NOT disappointed. Asdhjfgkocdjfm. It is BEAUTIFUL. I even went out in it to watch a movie and people stared at me. XD<br />I will definitely be buying a second one when the first one is no longer any good.<br />I'm 5 ft 3 and this thing reaches the bottom of my butt! So long, so beautiful &#60;3"
5.0,Love love love! Perfect tiny hearts. Bought them for me and I love them so much I bought them for my niece. I have sensitive ears and these don't bother me at all.
5.0,A perfect spring/summer top or for layering during cooler temps- will be buying more!
5.0,Love them inexpensive and durable
5.0,Perfect for summer pool parties!
5.0,Love this dress! Perfect for vacation!
5.0,This dress is extremely flattering and super cute.  I was nervous when I took it out of the package because it looked flimsy.  But when I put this on it was a different story. The dress has a good weight to it and fits good.  The front opening is low but I used fabric two sided tape to keep in place.
5.0,"Excellent dress. Wow. I wore this on my vacation and it was beautiful. I will be keeping this dress for a long time! Super flowy and flattering, but not revealing or too low-cut/high-cut. I wish I could wear it now, but it's too cold ;) looking forward to the summer to wear this dress often!"
5.0,Wore this over my bathing suit for hangout music fest and felt like a badass! Super cute
5.0,These boots are so comfortable! They're a soft leather so they were easy to wear right away. So glad I purchased these!
5.0,Great dress. Got so many compliments
5.0,love this wallet!
5.0,"They were stiff and awfully scratchy and I was ready to send them back - but, they fit. I’m a big girl with a pear shape and no waist, and they fit comfortably, so I ended up throwing them in the washer and dryer and the material softened right up. They’re crumpled now but I don’t really care, I stopped ironing more than twenty years ago and I fold/hang stuff warm out of the dryer and that works well enough for me. It took a little close inspection to find the drawstrings sewn into the sides of the pants legs, I fold the strings over and tie a knot in them and they stay up. They look great with boots, booties, Birk clogs, barefooted, gladiator sandals... even leggings. Another one of Mordenmiss’ terrific multiuse “I can wear this with anything” items. These pants go great with one of their long asymmetrical tunics - for example. Material is too heavy to wear in the tropics or summer, but pants are versatile enough to wear just about anywhere else for anything. The beige ones I got are made of thick material that isn’t see-through at all, not even if I’m standing in front of a lamp."
5.0,Fit perfect and well made!
5.0,"Purchased this for my daughter to wear for swim practices, and at the beach.  It fits her very well and is durable.  It is also easy to adjust unlike some of the other goggles we purchased in the past that broke easily when adjusting it around her head.  She wears this all the time and is happy with it that she no longer uses the other goggles she had."
5.0,Used these socks for several long haul flights and I feel they make a difference. Calves and feet feel less achey afterwords. I’m a very athletic person and recommend them.
5.0,The best pair of underwear I have worn in my life. They are light and they don't ride up. Fit is good make sure to use the size chart for this product specificity. Will order again
5.0,My 12 year old loves this!
5.0,"Cotton underwear is what our parents would buy us as children.  We grow up, and for some reason as adults, we're still wearing the same.  I live in a hot climate.  Cotton doesn't breathe or support as well - with these Nylon / spandex briefs it feels like wearing nothing at all and yet wearing something that won't let anything slip through - the package isn't going anywhere which is NICE!! Nothing worse than having to constantly &#34;adjust&#34; during the day due to loose fitting briefs. During the day if you're wearing cotton briefs you're constantly aware that you're wearing them .. but the silk material on these avidloves (I don't care for the name) hold everything in place no matter what you do, and breathe extremely well.  I'm swapping out ALL of my cotton briefs with these new nylon / spandex bikini briefs.  If you live in a hot humid climate, it's so much more comfortable ..  I wish I had only known about these YEARS ago.  The ladies I've dated lately liked 'em too!  Ask your wives if they really like the old Fruit of the Loom tidy-whiteys..  it's a no brainer.  Order the XL size if you have a 36 inch waist."
5.0,"The chain seems a bit dainty, but this is a beautiful piece overall. I opted for the bigger diamond and it is the perfect size to not distract from the beautiful pearl, but adds just the right amount of bling.<br /><br />I hope the seller will sell replacement chains in the future as ive read in other reviews the difficulties some have had getting a repair/replacement when their chain broke."
5.0,adorable and warm
5.0,This cowl is just adorable.  It is extremely soft and comfortable.  It looks very stylish and is extremely warm.  A complete and total win.
5.0,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my nephew.  He liked them there too short.
5.0,"I LOVE this wristlet! Pretty enough for night or day use. The material feels a little like linen and the colors are beautiful! Like a sea foam green and gold. I bought this to hold my credit cards, a small change purse, and my smart phone - it sure does and with a  bit of room to spare. I would definitely buy this product again or as a gift for someone else!"
5.0,"Cute. Simple, not too long or too short."
5.0,"Beautiful bra. Ordered the 30 GG, my normal size is 32G, because Freya is usually has stretchier bands. The 30 GG worked perfectly and is comfortable. My shape is short root, round and bottom heavy. This bra works well for my shape, because the cups aren't tall and it is slileghtly padded (very little  extra cloth padding). Also have a flared rib cage and the long-band  is comfortable because  its sort of pushes in my cage, instead of like a normal band riding up under the breasts. It stays in place and doesn't move at all. See some customers have some flip up issues, It only happened when I first wore it but haven't had issues with it flipping up at all since then. I LOVE this bra and plan on purchasing other Freya longlines. The company sending this out is in the UK. At first it was listed to arrive in about 3 weeks but received it in about a week from the UK. Fast delivery for a UK company."
5.0,"Worked great, look no further.  👍🏽👍🏽"
5.0,Bought for wife for work. She loves it!
5.0,Great sweater and holds up well after cleaning.
5.0,"I'm pretty familiar with my normal size and compression fit clothes, so I bought 2 sizes up and it fits great. I usually wear size small clothes (38"" chest) and just guessed that Large would fit great and it does. The arm holes are fine, and it wraps around fairly tightly without completely sausage-ifying me.<br /><br />I hope any prospective purchasers are familiar with compression fit--it will definitely show off your definition, whether it's abs or round belly. But it's comfortable, and I'm looking forward to someday wearing it at the gym after this lockdown is over."
5.0,It’s soft and warm. I ordered a large and it fits perfect
5.0,I love these glasses. The slim design is perfect for reading and still being able to see far.- just remember to take off the plastic lens protection prior to use.
5.0,Stays in place<br />Very soft and comfortable to wear<br />Goes thru the wash well
5.0,"I thought this was going to be one of those stiff cheap print fabrics because the price was low, but I thought the print was so cute I'd deal with the fabric not being the best. I was so pleasantly surprised to find that it was soft, adorable, and MUCH higher quality than I expected. I would have been happy with this dress if I had purchased it from ModCloth or similar at twice the price. I am usually a 16-18 and got a 16 Plus and it was true to size. Fully lined, just awesome. Love."
5.0,"My favorite piece of jewelry ordered from Amazon. the item was heavy, well made and makes a great statement piece for the perfect outfit."
5.0,"I love wearing baseball caps and generally rotate between a few.  Many times, when I pick a hat that has been sitting unworn for a while, a lot of lint will gather and I can't wear it until it is cleaned.  I've tried the tape method where you pick off the lint using the sticky side of tape but that just places more adhesive on the hat and more lint will surely gather.<br />The brush is great and works fast.  Every time I want to wear a hat, I run the brush over it and after about a minute, it is clean and ready to go.  It is sturdy and I like the wood handle.  The bristles are strong but do not damage the hat.  I use this only on baseball hats and do not know its effectiveness on other types of hats although I am sure it would work just as good."
5.0,These movies add hours of entertainment.
5.0,"My daughter loves this cute rain jacket. It's basically a rain poncho, so don't expect it to keep you warm, but it will keep you dry."
5.0,Update to my previous review...my shirt arrived. The tracking showed it arrived Wednesday but it was in my Saturday mail so just happy I got it :)
5.0,Perfectos! Cómodos
5.0,"I got this beautiful swim suit in 2 days. amazing shipping speed! it fits good and with fine materials. I usually  a size 6, however I ordered size 8-10 this time ( Medium) according to size chat. I would suggest to order one size up what what I did if you'd like a bit lose fit. Hope it helps."
5.0,"Wind 'em up and the little watchworks runs.  The escapement runs and the gears turn.  It goes for well over a day.  And how much fun is that!?!  Little machines actually ticking away on your cuffs.  I love it.  They look great.  The finish is really top-notch.<br /><br />These are perfect for mechanical watch enthusiasts, engineers, mechanics, &#34;gearheads&#34; of all sort.<br /><br />Mine were shipped within days of placing the order and arrived about ten days later.  Customer service was great.<br /><br />They do come with a nice, blue, velvet-like bag, but not in the bag.  So, if you're planning them as a gift, you might want to take delivery yourself and repack them."
5.0,"It was a present for my best friend, and i liked it because it had the clock inside! :D had NO IDEA!!! it was sooooo cute though! It came pretty slow (shipping wise) but oh well it was so worth it! SHE LOVED IT!"
5.0,A bit large  but that's my fault company was quick to deliver its very cute on
5.0,Love them. Looks so pretty in person
5.0,I feel like such a bad ass wearing these
5.0,"Great material, quality zipper and soft inside."
5.0,Love them! Exactly like the picture and they’ve held up pretty good so far!
5.0,"Simple, pretty, and worked for the occasion. True to size."
5.0,"This suit is super cute! I'm 5'7&#34; and usually wear a 12/14 in pants (I have thick thighs) and I ordered the XXXL (3XL) and it fit comfortably. I do prefer a suit with a little more &#34;tuck&#34; in the belly area but b/c of the peplum top my problem spot was undercover...literally. The top is cute, but I'm also very wide-chested but small-chested (like 38/40A) so it fits me around nicely but there is a little gaping...which I expected. It's not the suits fault, it's just my body type. Though it would be nice to be able to mix and match tops and bottoms sizes. I would definitely recommend this suit to anyone looking for something cute but conservative (from a two-piece stand point)."
5.0,Used for a party and loved it
5.0,Beautiful and affordable. I bought them for my 17 year old daughter and she lost one so I used the buy it again feature!
5.0,It's well made and being a huge harry potter fan I get to show my Gryffindor pride every day!
5.0,Great eyeglass case. Sturdy and true to description. Arrived quickly. Stellar communication from friendly seller. I unconditionally recommend this seller.
5.0,Fits great. Dries fast.
5.0,heated  socks  are great for anyone that  got to work outside allday  long like my  husband does he  love the  heated socks because there  last his  whole  shift and on the way  home from work  he works outside in the cold and snow he will also wear them while he is out snowmobiling
5.0,This is a very nice bracelet.  I didn't realize that the beads are translucent but it will be fine.  It is difficult to find yellow jewelry.
5.0,"What can I say?<br />I absolutely LOVE this band! I was looking around since Apple made their own pride bands, but Samsung didn't, so I went on here since thankfully Samsung watches use normal watch straps.<br />This strap fit perfectly on my Galaxy Watch Active2, and I really couldn't be happier<br />The band is made of Nylon, and it's a little stiff when you first get it, but you'll break it in over time so it's not a problem for me.<br />Ordering this watch band was a huge deal for me, because I wanted something more subtle to show my pride, and this is just perfect. It's even got quick release pins so installing it was dead simple<br />Thank you guys so much for this, I'm really grateful it exists 🏳️‍🌈❤️"
5.0,Took them to Jamaica for a beach wedding they were very pretty and did not break.
5.0,I like the color and the style.
5.0,I realized I ordered the wrong color it should have been black but I thought you can never go wrong with Buxton.
5.0,Love the socks help when I am on my feet all day and when my feet are swelling.
5.0,Beautiful and my daughter loves this!!!
5.0,"I work in industries, where any kind of metal jewelry is not allowed. I found this and really loved it. It a cheaper option for having expensive wedding band. Good thing is that you can change the colors every day. Nice thought.<br />The silicone quality is good.<br />It comes in many many sizes variety.<br />Available for men and women."
5.0,Pleasantly happy with this purchase. Low price but not cheap feeling. The material is pretty soft and lightweight yet at the same time doesn’t feel too thin of material. I got an x-large and I usually wear a size 14 in things and it fits just right. Happy with this purchase!
5.0,I love this. It'seems cotton and good designeducation. Just get one size down. It runs big.
5.0,I loved the style and the fit.  It was just worn for normal everyday wear.
5.0,"These are seriously AMAZING glasses for the money. Very dark, which is what I wanted, but you can see fine still for driving, etc. My phone screen looks green through them, which is funny. They're simple and perfect. Not crooked or anything, like some glasses can be. They even came with a little bag to store them in, for your purse or whatever, so they don't scratch! When I lose these, I'll buy them again."
5.0,Loved it. I'm a bigger girl and the fit was fantastic I even wore it out on the beach. Yayness for a two piece. :)
5.0,Perfect to finish a fancy dress outfit!
5.0,liked them so much brought more!
5.0,"These are worth the money, very cool!"
5.0,"I was a little skeptical of these working , but I was surprised how  they worked. they definitely make a difference in night driving in the rain ,knocks off all the glare. I would definitely recommend these glasses."
5.0,The perfect purse!
5.0,Earloops are adjustable and the product seems very well made. The nose piece adjustment is really good as well.<br /><br />I will continue to restock these masks as needed.
5.0,"These are a little snug because I measured improperly. They will however last a good long time because I have so many of them. Very pleased with the quality and the quantity and the shipping A+, I would recommend that you do business with this company quick shipping great packing no hassles."
5.0,Beautiful craftsmanship. Very light and comfortable to wear.
5.0,Love The Shoe !
5.0,Sweet ass watch!  Very surprised by the quality and luster.  The facet cut face is very unique as is the clasp.  Well worth it
5.0,They’re so super cute!!<br />And the metal feels nice and sturdy
5.0,"I purchased the Enamel Chain Link Carabiner Necklace (in Classic Gold) for my college-aged daughter, and she just loves it! The necklace came beautifully packaged with a sweet note from the company owners and in a gift bag in a gift box that had a monogrammed wax seal. Clearly, this company offers “champagne taste” in jewelry (without charging high end prices!), and the packaging matches in tasteful elegance. The necklace itself wears well with a variety of looks and doesn’t feel heavy or bulky ... it just feels fun and different. (She swears no one else on her campus wears anything like this, and she’s excited to be one of the first.) Can’t wait to get different colored carabiners to add a fun pop of color."
5.0,"This messenger bag is a terrific bargain. Holds a lot, lot of compartments, well made and durable, and for $15.99 a steal. This is a can't miss purchase."
5.0,Perfect. Washed well.
5.0,"Watch as described, very cute! Make sure you remove the plastic piece under the stem to start watch movement. Works perfectly;)"
5.0,just right!
5.0,"This Celtic necklace is much bigger than pictured.  Got it for my sister for a gift, and she loved it (being of Irish background).  I would purchase this product again nicely made."
5.0,"Super cute Mickey ears to wear at Disneyland. Unfortunately, the ears sold in the park are too tight and too long for me. I can’t wear them. These are lighter weight and are comfortable to wear all day in the park."
5.0,Really decent quality and carefully packaged
5.0,My daughters ears are very sensitive and these are the only earrings we have found that she can wear.  I ordered these based on other reviews and these have saved her ears.  We have bought so many other pairs of earrings and Everything else we have tried causes infection but these!  If your little girl has sensitive ears try these you won’t be disappointed!
5.0,Perfect for my daughter to wear under her horse back riding helmet. Very comfortable.
5.0,Perfect size to shop with!

5.0,Super cute! Love that it’s longer and looks more like the one from the movie ❤️

5.0,I love this dress and I use it as a gown! Very comfy!
5.0,"Bought for my brother as his other socks were getting very worn, these have held up and the designs don’t get horribly stretched out like others."
5.0,"They are a lot larger than I was expecting, but extremely cute and seems well made."
5.0,I bought these for myself.  I have got a compliment on one already.  They have very secure magnets.  The only downside is soetimes you have to work at them a little to get them off.  Am quite pleased with my purchase.
5.0,Arrived on expected date in excellent condition. Easy on/off. They even have their own drawstring carry bag! No more searching all over the gym for collars!
5.0,Great quality. I normally wear a large but it runs a little small so I sized up
5.0,"I searched fabric stores for something like this and thought maybe Amazon might have something. This bandanna is perfect, as I cut it in half and used each side for pillow cases to add the perfect touch to a well deserving Vietnam Veterans Quilt of Valor. Thank You Amazon 🇺🇸"
5.0,Very nice glasses bought these for the hubby and he absolutely loves them and looks good in them as well they fit his face perfectly very stylish and durable for the money pay for them.

5.0,I'm a teacher and our mascot is the unicorns so this lanyard was a must!  Great communication- love my lanyard and plan to purchase more for Christmas gifts.  Thanks!
5.0,"Madly in love with this stunning and unique dress. I ordered a small, and it's a bit snug but I think medium would have been too loose. The material is better quality than I expected. The hem and seams are even and well sewn. I got the purple/black/red one and it is beyond gorgeous. I will order more from this company."
5.0,Perfect fit.  Shoe size is 9.5
5.0,I got all the pieces and it arrived fast. The pieces are well made and beautiful. It's also the best deal for the price on Amazon.

5.0,Fits great and it's pretty stylish.
5.0,"I LOVE these earrings. I had  no idea that Amazon  carried them. I just put in the search engine ""statement earrings"" and up Amazon didn't let me down!  The detail is beautiful and I get so many compliments  when I  wear them. I have short hair and I  they really add bling!"
5.0,"I really like this watch. It looks nice, the face is big & easy to read. The band is small but so is my wrist."

5.0,i love it so much thank
5.0,I Absolutely love these shorts and i was surprised to receive a belt with these shorts.Due to great Quality i am going to absolutely buy every pair of shorts that beverly hills polo club makes AWESOME !
5.0,Bought these for swimming with the kids in the pool. Overall they fit nicely and get a good suction. Experience some fogging hear and there but overall work as intended.
5.0,Love it! I’ve had this for so long and I’ve had no problems fits perfectly!
5.0,Love the look! Looks great and fits well. Material feels a little different than I thought but I still love it.
5.0,Very nice feel!
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for in the winter. It’s super cute and fit her great!
5.0,Es hermoso! Igual a La foto.
5.0,"I love this item and was going to reorder another one in a different color, but it was out of stock.  The only thing I was iffy on was bathe color.  It was supposed to be red, but it’s really a dark fuchsia  color.  I still love it."
5.0,"Looked swag, is swag."
5.0,"Great! Super durable, love the handle it’s easy to grip and it’s in my fav color and it’s super easy to use."
5.0,I had to have varicose and spider veins removed. These are very high quality hose. I highly recommend.
5.0,"I love this shirt. Its comfortable, with a perfect length, for working out. Love YoungLa short sleeve shirts, but these long sleeves are great for winter months"
5.0,"This bag is way more useful than I thought it would be!  It has 5 different compartments and can hold quite a few items before it becomes bulky.<br /><br />The three interior pockets can be closed off with a zipper. And one of the pockets has 3 card slots. That pocket is so hidden, I didn't realize it was there at first.  No one is going to slip their hand into your bag.  Two more pockets are on the outside. One pocket is large enough for a cell phone and is closed off by a flap with a magnet - so you don't have to go into the zippered section to retrieve your phone. The final pocket is on the back of the purse and is closed by a zipper.<br /><br />I used this for shopping trips and it gave me the security of knowing my money, cards and phone were close to me while my hands and arms were free.  It's also thin enough to be good for theme park visits when you don't want to drag around a purse or backpack. You just can't wear this on the thrill rides (coasters, etc).<br /><br />I have the brown bag and I think it looks fairly attractive. The strap is adjustable. The different compartments are all lined and the compartments are about as deep as a woman's hand is long - so you won't lose items inside them."
5.0,Santa made Granddaughter very happy with her purple suit!!!
5.0,I love the colors!! It came out great and fits to size on me. It is thinner than expected but not see through. The cutest lounge or relaxing outfit!!
5.0,Good material. Color as shown the pic.
5.0,"Shirt fits great, my son loves it"
5.0,Love these! Fit great! I've ordered them twice.
5.0,"As the heading says, this piece of jewelry is simplistic yet beautiful. The delivery was on time, the packaging seems carefully handled. The card that comes with it is wonderful and inspiring. Truly is a great investment. On top, the customer service was amazing. They stay in contact with you the moment you order it until the package arrives and confirm you love the jewelery; they are helpful, approachable, and do care about your satisfaction. I would definitely recommend this jewelery as it's beautiful and affordable.<br /><br />***NOTE***<br />They DO provide you with instructions on how to clean the pewter metal and stainless steel necklace. The jewelry will need to be cleaned and handled properly due to the metal characteristics, usually most jewelery need to be well maintained because of it's exposure to air over time. So please be aware that this is natural and to acknowledge the help they provide on cleaning the item."
5.0,"I use these liner to play hockey, All of a sudden, I started experiencing a skin allergy with my new hockey gloves. I came up with the idea to use liners. So far, it works great. I wash them after every game. The work nice and seem to last long."

5.0,Worth so much more than cost!
5.0,"Not as big as the others I have and, there is a little more light seppage around the bottom and sides. I think  that is because the larger shades  shells come back to the face further from the front of the frames, therefore hugging the face more and, so closing off the unwanted light. However the smaller shades do work."
5.0,"Very cute dress. I'm planning on wearing it with tights and boots this winter. It's a little low cut for my taste, but I frequently wear a camisole under deep V tops so I will probably do that with this dress as well."
5.0,"Not top of the line panties, but great for the price! I have ordered twice."
5.0,My wife makes this look good
5.0,Exact quality I expected from this brand in terms of fit and craftsmanship.
5.0,Nice item. Comfortable plastic grip for those who need extra holding power. Same non trademarked item without the frills available at 1/2 the cost. Still this Hounds Bay shoe horn is reasonable in price. Appears to be excellent quality. 19cma50@gmail.com
5.0,Cute little rings! Came as a pair of 2 rings.
5.0,"My favorite mask by far!! Easy to breath. Filter insert. Love the color and image. Only down side was, because it comes from outside the u.s., it took forever to receive."

5.0,"If I could live in overalls I would.  Especially these comfortable, pinstriped little shorts. Well made, look good, seem to run true to size.  The crotch is a bit baggy, but that's the case with most overalls isn't it?"

5.0,Amazing brown bag came right on time willing to buy more.
5.0,"Love how cute this are but the major bonus is how comfortable they are as well! The ties do slip a little bit on your legs, total life hack I sprayed them with a little bit of holding hair spray and they don't slip at all anymore!"
5.0,"If you know what this is and what it’s designed to do then you can stop after the next two words – it works. Much better than the old rubber band method or wedging your hat between a drawer or in a wide cup or some other MacGyver inspired solution. Helps you get a consistent bend across the bill of your cap. Two sizes provided. Fair price. 5 stars because it works, has a simple design and is better than homemade solutions."
5.0,Excited to get my new earrings! They are even glitzier in person. I like that I can wear them with anything.

5.0,I like the silver with black; not so heavy looking against face. Versatile for different skin tones.  Very Comfortable
5.0,They did tell me to order a large size based on shoes I had previously purchased (8.5 m girl) and they are big enough for my dad (size 11 men). I wear them anyway for working out at home - but the heels are at my ankles. But they are nice and thick that I like (versus thin socks)
5.0,"I wear an expensive ankle bracelet that my husband had custom made for me years ago, and I was looking for an anklet for my other ankle.  This looked exactly like what I wanted, and it is.  This is beautiful and well made.  It is a close second to my more expensive anklet.  I love it!"

5.0,"Great product, on time and correct."

5.0,💓
5.0,"Very cute and stylish, and I received my package right on time."
5.0,Darling shirt. I ordered in medium and it was tight so I returned it and ordered l. It fit perfect. I normally wear a medium but had to go up a size for this top.
5.0,It makes my waist smaller! I love it.
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from these, but I really like them.  I've worn them a few times now and they are perfect for squatting, deadlifting, and whatever else you're doing.  I like the high waist, because I'm not yanking them up or worried about my backside showing when I'm bending over or squatting down.  I like the material for summer, because it's lighter weight and I don't feel like I&#34;m dying from heat.  The pockets are nice for putting anything in.  I am 150 lbs 5'6&#34; and got a small and they fit great."
5.0,"I really really love this dress! The color is gorgeous, and it fit so well! Better than I expected. I have very long hair, so to avoid static electricity [due to the material], I just put a safety pin on the inside of the hem..."
5.0,This is a beautiful apron.  I love the fabric and it is well made.<br />The only thing missing is a pouch pocket.
5.0,Lovely band!  But too early too determine how fast or stable the color is.  And too early to see if the mesh will fray and stick me.  Which often happens with mesh bands.

5.0,"Amazing price for stylish earrings that don't look cheap or tacky, even up close. I don't know if they will hold up to A LOT of wear but they very classy. And even if they don't hold up, at the price you can easily replace them! Lol"
5.0,Beautiful.  Just as described and better.
5.0,Very easy to put on the chickens by myself. The chickens can’t get them off. My girls are heading up finally!

5.0,Absolutely marvelous  fits perfectly  and beautiful to look at
5.0,"The yarn that was used to make this hat is the BEST!! It's a very soft black yard and it has flecks of so many colors! It is sized really good and isn't too big or ""slouchy"". I would say I can't wait for it to get cold but that is the furthest thing from the truth BUT....at least when it does get cold I will get to wear my new favorite hat!!"
5.0,It arrived today; 1-3 weeks earlier than expected and it is very pretty. Just what I had hoped for.
5.0,This fabric is a little hot for a summer but that is what you get with polyester.  It is very durable and washes and dries well.  No noticeable shrinkage and you can't see my bra lines through the shirt so huge plus!
5.0,"I purchased for my daughters Harry Potter theme Birthday party. She typically wears a size 14 she’s petite and skinny. Pajama dress fit her perfectly with room to spare. Not to tight or too small or too big and bulky. For reference, She is about 4’10”, 80lbs soak and wet."

5.0,"fits great, looks good"
5.0,Slippers fit as advertised but the arch support can be improved either with better inserts or built with a better (higher) arch support.
5.0,The screw in stainless steel loop is awesome.  Very strong and screws in to lock.  The tags themselves are good and the Lettering is a nice touch.  Thank you

5.0,"A very warm and versatile scarf! Lengthy enough to wrap around your head, cover your shoulders, or wrap around your neck warmly.<br /><br />Super soft and comfy!"
5.0,"This is a nice set of gloves,  hat and scarf. They are super warm and comfortable.  I like the gloves as they have the texture stuff on the inside of the hand to grip.  They also have the black tips to use on smart devices such as my phone.  The glove fingers do work on my phone.  The scarf has the black fur lining which I like.  Nice set!"
5.0,I was so surprised with the great quality and fit of this dress. Made so well. Not see through. Fits perfect. Bought it in black and now going to buy it in white bc I love it so much! It’s very similar to the Naked wardrobe but for half the cost.

The silver and black together make a great combination and look very safisticated. My son loves wearing his braclet and has gotten lots of complements on it. I would gladly pay full price for it and have thought about buying my other sons and husband one also. I got this for free to review, but would have paid full price. Thank you for making such a great product! Keep up the good work!"

These shorts fit the bill on all 3 counts, and I discovered the Ben Hogan long pants first at Walmart online, which are lightweight and have a crease and look dressy. Highly recommend both."
5.0,The exact color  wanted.  Glad I purchased it.
5.0,"i'm 6'4 280lbs built like a linebacker and it still fit pretty good. people at the party loved it, the only complaint i would say is that you have to walk sideways or else you'll be hitting everyone and everything with your fake legs. other than that i'm glad i got it and will be using it multiple times throughout this month."

5.0,Great fit and soft fabric.
5.0,We purchased these for our son who wears glasses. He does IT work and spends a lot of time on his laptop and sometimes works from home. He has a blue light filter on the laptop but said these clip-ons are great because he doesn't have to change glasses.

I live in a cold climate and I spend a lot of time outdoors working or hiking, so these socks are perfect since they have moisture wicking capabilities.  I wear a size 10.5 (men's shoe) so I ordered the XL size based on the sizing chart.  They even come with their own small delicates laundry bag. 5 stars!"

5.0,"My second pair. The fit is not tight at all, I have plenty of room, unlike other brands in the same size. I love these and I buy a new pair about every 7 to 8 months for work, (I walk about 8 miles a day at work.) and these keep my feet and ankles form screaming at the end of the work day."
5.0,"This dress is perfect and exactly what I was looking for. Has a nice stretch to it, but not too clingy and great length hitting at the knees for my 5'6&#34; height. The color was as pictured as well, a nice dark green."
5.0,"This is super cute! I’m 5’5, 170lbs, hourglass shape. The large fits me perfectly. It’s a little longer than my knees, but I like it, because when I sit it doesn’t ride up my legs. The fabric is so soft and comfortable! I definitely recommend this simple dress. It matches everything!"

5.0,"It's a decent polyester material, like most sweats are. I ordered a xxs they estimated would fit a 8-9 year old but it's very long. I was worried about negative reviews... But I'm happy with the set overall. The color is vibrant and the numbers are centered nicely."
5.0,"They are exactly what I needed to complete my look for Star Trek Las Vegas! Wonderful addition to any sci-fi look especially considering the cost, quick shipping and color options. Looking forward to future versions! I have the blue and orange ones, super fun visor! Got loads of compliments. Thanks!"

5.0,Honestly impressed with this buy. Fit perfect
5.0,Tiene muchísima suavidad. La probé y es ideal para regalar ya que tiene una excelente calidez
5.0,"Ordered the black. Color is black, the silver parts are silver with minor scratches from the chain rattling around in the packing. The stones are not super sparkly. But it's a Chinese bag for cheap. So for what it is 5 stars."
5.0,Very comfortable and quality materials
5.0,Nice fit. Really cuts glare and sharpens images.
5.0,"The comfort,warmth and the softness I really glad I brought them been getting a lot  compliments."

5.0,"I purchased this set for my boyfriend, and he loved it! It's gorgeous and looks great :)"
5.0,"Works great for my Sordin Supreme, Black Pro-X (MSA) carry storage. Neck style.<br />Zippers could be better for long term rough use. But they do work!"
5.0,Very cute!  Lightweight and soft!
5.0,"Fácil de usar, de buen tamaño, es delgado,"
5.0,Good Sunglasses for the price
5.0,I've been looking for socks for a while ... spent about $100 in the last couple months looking for the best ones and this is def the Best Buy ! Great quality and they stay up ! Love them! Buying another pack now!
5.0,I looked at many yoga Matt straps and finally found this one. It was the right price and I loved the pattern. I love this strap because its velcro and doesn't have clips like the last one I had. It's simple to use too! The service was great and it was shipped right away. It was a delight to work with this company and I look forward to doing business with again. Would highly recommend!
5.0,"I love my Avidlove Sexy Lingerie Strap Semi-Sheer Lace Teddy Heart Dots Mesh Babydoll even tho its not my perfect size, but I'm totally giving this sexy hearty nighty a perfect 5 stars as I was the one that chooses the medium size despite of me knowing that I am always a small in size.  I am a 5'0 tall 90 lbs asian petite woman with 24 chest size. The medium size wasnt too bad after all, great feature that I love about this lingerie is, the shoulder strap can be adjusted which actually helped mine still look good. It was only the chest part which is noticeably loose, other than that, it has the perfect length. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I had my perfect size. I love the lacey style and the gorgeous little heart dots all over it and even the matching thong has it. As per always, good job Avidlove and thank you!<br /><br />*** I received this complimentary lingerie and G string for survey and review purposes."
5.0,"The red is more like pink but that’s not a big deal. And the arms are pretty tight, they make a squeaky noise when opening and closing. Otherwise I love them"
5.0,I have several old casio dive watches in my jewelry box. The old plastic band had crumbled apart. BlueShark had the best reviews. I purchased two James bond NATO straps. They look fantastic just like the James Bond watch in Dr No. l’ll be purchasing more BlueShaek straps for my other watches.
5.0,Fit my 7 lb little peanut perfectly and is very cute and soft.
5.0,The quality of this dress is super. Definitely will purchase from this company again. Highly recommended.
5.0,"Great luggage, handles stresses of travel (bumps and bangs) well. The large bag is giant, it holds everything (but is within the normal airline specifications allowed).  The lock is a little flimsy, but it functions.  You can easily put your own lock on the zippers if need be.  My only problem with this set is the smallest bag is a little too small to be a good carry-on, and the middle is a little too big.  I ended up using an old carry-on that holds more stuff.  But if this isn't a problem, this luggage set is great!  Its very generic looking, it looks like a lot of other bags, so I recommend putting some sort of identifier on the bag (a ribbon, sticker, or something obvious) to make it easy to spot at baggage claim."
5.0,fit perfect and its a kohls item that is so high online cant beat this price
5.0,"Love, love this bathing suit. Just order another one hope it will be as good."
5.0,"Great quality and makes your boobs look great! The shorts do ride up a little and don’t look the best from behind, but still worth the price. Would recommend!"
5.0,My sons favorite shirt!
5.0,Size and workmanship were on point
5.0,I absolutely love these earrings. They are well worth the cost!! Fast shipping too!!
5.0,It fits perfect. Love it
5.0,"I love these! I have four piercings in one ear and five in the other, and I’m always looking for earrings that are small enough to fit. I’ve been crazy into opals lately, and I love these! They’re a set of three earrings, from super super small to a more normal stud size. I got the white opals because they came in the smaller size, and I have no regrets. You can see the size progression here (all but the bottom blue ones); they fit really well. They have a post that’s a little bit longer than the ones I usually wear, but that’s not a problem at all. These are super cute, and I expect they’ll last as long as my current obsession with opal."
5.0,"I had to come back and write a more detailed review because these socks are soooooo awesome!!! They keep my feet from getting sweaty and gross making my shoes feel newer longer, they also prevent my shoe from rubbing the back of my heel while having a low profile and staying in place and they are super easy to wash I just throw them in the laundry and then let them air dry! I highly recommend these!!"
5.0,I absolutely love my scrub top!!! 😍❤️ Already got so many compliments on it!
5.0,Fit in my watch
5.0,Wife loves it... great with leggings
5.0,"This ring is adorable. For the price you seriously can't beat it. It doesn't look cheap at all and it has some weight to it. It doesn't feel like it's going to snap in half if you try to resize it a little and sits well on my finger. The little angel wings are adorable and detailed. I have some chubby fingers so i got this hoping it would work as a midi ring. It's a little loose for that but it still fits great. The best part is that you can adjust it a little. It isn't made to be adjustable but since it's an open ring it works. I would guess that it's around a size 7 going by how it fits my fingers. Like i said i have big hands and i would say my ring finger size is an 8/9. This JUST fits my ring finger if i loosen it a little bit. It fits much better as a midi for me but if you have smaller fingers this can be used as a regular ring. I love doing my nails so I love to find little accessories to add to my manis. This ring looks great on and for the price i couldn't be happier with it. It didn't turn my fingers green or anything and feels pretty well made for the price. I was honestly REALLY surprised how much i loved it. I mean for a dollar you just hope for the best and it really went above and beyond my expectations. Midi rings and the open rings are pretty popular these days too, so this would be an awesome gift for the ladies in your life if you're on a budget. I guarantee no one would EVER think this ring was a dollar! I would guess at least $5 if i saw it in a store in the mall."
5.0,"This bag is quality. So many compartments with more inner storage smaller compartments.  I particularly like the anti theft compartment on the back of the bag. It's great for holding cash, credit cards, documents, etc. First class bag!"
5.0,"This is a gift.  I loved it, but wish I had more colors to choose from."
5.0,"My son loved it,  is nice and soft and cozy for a bit that always manages to kick his blankets off in the middle of the night"
5.0,I used the mask for a dummy and it worked perfectly. Added just the right amount of creepy to the dummy!
5.0,My new favorite socks
5.0,"Working great for me. only that my shades fog up, i recommend buying some anti fogging solution along with this"
5.0,Love them fit great and look great.
5.0,This is a great scarf clip to enhance more formal attire!
5.0,"Cute, nice size (doesn’t look bulky or too small) and looks like it’s made from a nice metal material doesn’t look plastic like some other chains🙄"
5.0,"My kiddos are both WAY into power rangers right now. My daughter of course has deemed herself the Pink Ranger so these are her absolute favorite pajama's - Two washes in there are starting to be some splits in the white detailing, but that's really to be expected with any shirt of a similar material.<br /><br />Very soft fabric, and didn't shrink in the wash/dry process, even in hot water."
5.0,Nice apron heavy duty.
5.0,"Love!  They fit me perfectly and wash up very nicely. I let them air dry. So far, so good."
5.0,Charm was very nice and fulfilled my needs
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE! super cute and fit perfectly and I've already ordered another pair
5.0,"real leather,very good!"
5.0,"100% cotton, so awesome"
5.0,"Purchased for our granddaughter for everyday warmth and comfort. They are really well made, cute and comfortable.  Colors on the animal prints are bright and hold up well after washing and drying several times."
5.0,"Very cute with the open back and twist.  Comfortable, soft fabric.  Fits true to size. Maybe a little cropped."
5.0,"Very happy with this coverup. The length is perfect at 5’7”.  Great material, holds up well when wet and dries fast. Super comfy!"
5.0,I literally get complimented on these earrings every time I wear them. So pretty and super light weight.
5.0,"Cute scarf, light weight fabric."
5.0,These are by far the coolest leggings on the planet. You will loveeee the dual fabric combo!!! Leather in front and smooth knit in back. My co-workers all plan to order a pair!
5.0,"Works great. I had these briefs about a year ago and ended up buying another pair recently after I lost the old pair. They have updated the pocket's elastic band at the top so it now sits about an inch under the main waistband. This works well to hide that there is a pocket. I will definitely be purchasing a few more pairs. The pocket is huge btw. If I had to guess, I would say you could fit about 2 full ziplock bags of cooking spices, for example, in the pocket and wearing skinny denim jeans, you really can't even tell."
5.0,These pajamas were what I was looking for.  Seem vey nice and comfortable.
5.0,she loves it fast shipping
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous on a dainty silver chain. Matches my mother of pearl ring very well. Love it.
5.0,"Wow, what a great classic style for a dress. Love it so far. Love the length and coverage. Very comfortable and elegant. Wish more dresses were made like this. The only change I would make would be the buttons. They are wooden and very difficult to get through the buttonholes....maybe a plastic button would be easier on the fingers. I will change the buttons myself, but other than that a wonderful dress. Also, I haven't washed it yet, but will wash gently in cold water and am hoping it won't shrink like it did for the other reviewer."
5.0,"This was purchased as part of a gift for our church organist, who celebrated her 40th anniversary in January.  She loves it!!"
5.0,"Friends loved the product, very cheap compared to craft stores, about the size of a half dollar"
5.0,This product was everything I hoped it would be.
5.0,"This shirt feels really good and is light weight. I will purchase another one soon. I wear this shirt to car shows when driving my Scat Pack Charger. I wished it came in other colors, preferably Plum Crazy Purple."
5.0,"I just received mine today. They're great quality and seeeeem to stay in place and sturdy on my nose although I have yet to wear one for more than a few minutes, so we will see. I mean, you get 20 and for the price??? Great deal! All gems were in place in all of the pieces that had gems and they are gorgeous. Honestly, it looks pretty genuine to me. I was hesitant to get my septum pierced for real, now, not so much because I know I can rock it! These will be fun to wear without the commitment, agony of changing a piercing (I have my nose pierced and the first few times changing my ring was tear-inducing!) and price of a piercing itself. I would recommend, all in all!"
5.0,This scarf is so beautiful and big! You can wear it SO many ways for different looks too. I looked up some tutorials on YouTube to figure out the best ways to wear this.
5.0,Socks are soft and not binding or tight on calf.  Feet dont get sweaty. I work retail and stand most of my 5 hrs. At work.  so they are comfy all day. Wash good too.
5.0,Love it! Perfect scarf for my husband and cold Michigan weather!
5.0,"Easy to wear, comfortable, made of nice materials. Would definitely recommend"
5.0,My 9 year old loves to use these to give her tshirts a little bling and cute accessory. They are not too heavy but well made.
5.0,Great band. Good quality. Locks in good to watch. A lot better than the original bands.
5.0,"These Sandals are adorable & comfortable, just love them!!"
5.0,Great fit for my size 12 foot with extreme adema in both feet even fits over my unna boots no problem! Great non slip traction on bottom helps keep my feet planted on the footplate of my wheelchair.. My only complaint is I with they came in black.
5.0,super cute. it was a little smaller than i expected but they make a perfect little heart and the string is adjustable. they also glow in the dark.
5.0,"Very solid and feels quality. Its bigger then you may think, but still works on a key chain. Looks dope as hell too. Youll like it. Worth every penny."
5.0,Bought this for $26.99 and was surprise the quality of the bag! It looks high end and I'm loving it! This is a medium size bag on the small side. I got lots of compliments and it comes with a strap to cross body.
5.0,Love this pin! Really nice. Amazing how inexpensive it was
5.0,I love these mostly because they are light weight. They are available is popular colors and perfect for casual wear. I also love the price even tho some people call them cheap. I get lots of compliments on them.
5.0,They both fit  well.  I have gotten many compliments on the look and questions about where I got them. The material is not too heavy. I live in the Mid-South where the usual night-time temps are in the 30s or 40s. The hats are big enough to cover my ears.
5.0,"Great Quality, little smaller than expected but close enough to work"
5.0,"I purchased this kimono as a gift for my mother for her birthday. It is beautiful, but is quite small and she couldn't wear it. We gave it to my aunt and I ordered her another in a different pattern that was not nearly as pretty."
5.0,Fits well loves how it moves during workout
5.0,"I just got these ant they are soft and comfortable and awesome...except they are about a size too small. I had hoped they ran big but alas. No snappy new boots for me. If they had a bigger size I would have gone with that and had the best boots ever so I would totally recommend buying them if you have an actual size 11 foot and not one that is sometimes 11, sometimes 12."
5.0,"I hesitate to purchase clothes online, but my daughter was tickled pink and they fit her great! I will most likely buy more."
5.0,"Super cute!!! I purchased this to carry my college textbooks, so I was searching for a large bag that had a great design, and at an amazing price.  This holds 4 college textbooks and a couple of notebooks.  The zippered pocket has the best placement for easy access for cell phones and what not.  I definitely questioned how large this bag really was when I took it out of the package, but it definitely pull through on the size and roominess."
5.0,Love the variety and it doesn’t look cheap.
5.0,"Wonderful it has good length, vibrant colors, fun for summer and winter."
5.0,"They don't unsnap a'll the way up. The waist does not come apart, bit still love them."
5.0,"Bought it for the wedding. Beautiful dress ! The purple dress is much brighter, not like on the photo."
5.0,This is a beautiful skirt with vibrant colors. I got so many compliments at the wedding I last wore it to. It's smaller in the waist than the sizing in my opinion. My suggestion is to order a or two size up. Great purchase!
5.0,This is very nice to clean sterling silver I would recommend it
5.0,"I love this top, and bought two. This first one I bought was a tad large so I bought a smaller size too.<br /><br />The length is Tunic, nice with narrow pants or leggings. I love the print, it hides pet hair and stains for those of us that cook without aprons.<br /><br />I like that the neckline is not too low, this a flattering top for us larger women."
5.0,"I am impressed with the quality and design of these . They fit my 8 yr olds face really well and will fit her for a long time . It will fit for a few seasons for sure but still fit her little face really nicely. Good job on making a quality product for young mountain bikers . She’s so little that it was a task getting her setup with a quaint bike to ride trails . My husband had to custom make her bike because of how hard she rides but I’d just an itty bitty little 55lbs of determination. After spending thousands on a bike for her and getting her the best gear and helmet too , these go well with the quality setup she’s rocking . You get what you pay for and for eye protection I’d rather pay more and get a great fit with polarized lenses that fit while wearing a helmet then pay less and take risks with irreplaceable things like eyes . It looks slick in the black on black color . It’s her new favorite pair of glasses and I’m thrilled she’s got good gear like her dad and brother . I’m very pleased"
5.0,They came quick and were super cute. The teen I gifted them to has been wearing them none stop since Christmas and they remain in tact
5.0,"Fit like expected, very comfy and supportive."
5.0,"Simple, pretty, lightweight earrings.  I love them!  You can wear them with anything."

5.0,Extremely cute. I get lots of complimemts.
5.0,Very easy wash and low maintenance
5.0,This Christmas we are going to have a grinch tree. I bought this mask to create a Christmas tree topper and it is better than I expected.  It will be the perfect tree topper. This mask is very close to the real thing. I love it! Just what I needed.
5.0,Lovely. I wear a size 2/4 and the small fit perfectly. Beautiful swing to it.
5.0,couldn't wait to get them and was not disappointed when I did THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL!!!  exact look of photo<br />I love them! cutest boots ever!

5.0,"Love it these water boots, they  are too cute on my baby .. I finally found size 2youth. For unicorn 🦄 .. thank you"
5.0,Great product. Good.
5.0,"My husband says these are the best work boots he’s ever owned, even better than some more expensive ones he has had."
5.0,Does what it is meant to do.  Carry a suitcase outgoing - not too full.  Fold backpack and carry in suitcase.  Return trip suitcase very full after shopping at destination.  Take some of your clothing and carry home in the light backpack.
5.0,Love Vivian’s Yoga Brand. Excellent quality<br />Good fit  Large selection of colors!!!!<br />Boot cut an extra long length!!!!!!!<br />Love them  worth the price!!!!!
5.0,"My wife loves this bracelet, it looks amazing on her wrist and it sparkles beautifully. It seems to be of very good quality so far."
5.0,Cute dress. Even long enough at the sleeves to fit my long arms. I'd buy this in a different color and wear again.
5.0,The Rolex Datejust Mother of Pearl Dial with Diamonds has earned a spot on BoldList's Top 5 Rolex Watches list!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Rolex automatic movement<br />- Scratch resistant sapphire crystal<br />- Water resistant to 100 m<br /><br />Check out the rest of the list before making a purchase: http://boldlist.net/top-5-Rolex-watches.php
5.0,"I haven’t tried swimming in this yet, but I gave it five stars because the material is very good and I love how it looks. It’s super comfortable. Happy with the purchase!"
5.0,Good quality and covers your entire nose and mouth
5.0,"I have children who are on multiple sports teams.  They need bags like this one to keep their gear together.  This is a new favorite for several reasons.  First, it is lightweight and easy to stow away.  Second, my daughter thinks it is stylish (score for Mom:). Third, it is easy to care for.  It fits nicely in the wash, comes out clean and dries quickly. Fourth, I love the shoe compartment.  Kids shoes tend to get stinky, so now my daughter's uniforms aren't mixed with her stinky shoes.  You will notice that the bag in my pictures is not wrinkled, all I did was put it in the drier for a few minutes and it came out nice.  Also, there are several different compartments for good organization.  When volleyball/basketball/cheer leading seasons are over, I will just fold it up and stow it away in my coat closet so it is ready for the next time we need it.  Very easy. I am thankful to have received this bag at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"Excellent quality! I ordered A pack of Ten and loved that they were individually wrap. These pins are high quality in colour and durable.<br />I ordered these pins on Thursday and received them on Sunday. Thats right, Sunday. Three days. awesome."
5.0,My favorite necklace. Perfect and came in fast. Very cute
5.0,"These socks are very soft, thick and warm.  Nice variety of colors."
5.0,"This t-shirt is perfect.  Fits good.  It's not too thick and not too thin, it's just right.  Feels soft and comfortable.  I highly recommend this shirt to anyone that likes cute t-shirts to wear.  I love this shirt!!!"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for. Soft, warm and drapes beautifully."
5.0,"I got this for my dad, and he absolutely loves it"
5.0,"Very very sparkly, love them! I did not realize there were two pairs for that price, an extra sparkle for me!"
5.0,Very pretty ring. Daughter loves it. Well made.<br />Excellent seller. First item was lost by USPS and seller quickly replaced it. Very happy. Thank you!!
5.0,I loved it..well suited for my face ..long enough ..if your looking for something reaching your shoulder..!
5.0,Beautiful top.  Perfect for the summer and extremely comfortable.  Ordered the same top in green.  I love it.
5.0,Great item for costume.
5.0,Not what I expected at all.  Shirt ran small.  I thought I was getting 3 colors.  Shirt had mesh in the front.  Doesn't look like the picture.  My son liked them regardless6
5.0,"Nice design.  Very soft & comfortable.  A little loose, but that’s fine.  Had quite a few compliments/comments 🤣"
5.0,Very comfortable and makes you look great.
5.0,I bought this for my niece and the size fit her perfectly.  The stitching is very good.  I'm guessing it was cheaper than buying it from one of the ripoff souvenir shops in DC that charge twice the price...and it was delivered to her within two days.  Nice.
5.0,My two year old daughter loved these earrings.
5.0,It was perfect!!! And a good price will definitely order again!!
5.0,They arrive in a timely manner and fit great
5.0,"Very comfortable and stylish, good value for the money"
5.0,"I ordered this watch in the green option, and it comes in a nice box and the entire watch band plus the face was protected with a thin film of plastic.  When the plastic is removed that's when this watch really sparkles and it's true nature is brought to life.  It has a stunning analog face with an emerald green starburst pattern background.  Small rhinestones surround the face and give this watch a classy look.  it is easy to read the time, and the size of the face alone (excluding the rhinestone rim) is slightly over 1.25"" (3.3 cm).  This watch keeps great time as it should and has what is called a deployment clasp.  It folds over and snaps into place, then there are 2 little notches that are depressed to open the clasp to remove the watch.<br /><br />My husband's wrist is 7.25"" and the band was slightly too large for him.  I only had to remove one link to make it a perfect fit.  Another extremely nice feature of this watch is it came with the tool needed to remove the link!  I have purchased many watches as I've been a watch nut for a long time, but have never had a watch come with the link remover tool.  I had removed links from quite a few watches before so it was easy for me to do.  I used the tool that came with the watch, and  the pins removed easily so that was nice.  The little user manual that comes with the watch does have a page on how to do this, but if you've never done it before I recommend just watching a couple short videos to see how it is done.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice classy watch more on the dressy side, and looks great on my husband.  We both love it!  It keeps time well and has a band with a combination of satin and chrome finish.  Last, it is affordable and is very giftable."
5.0,My husband loves the unique texture.
5.0,I absolutely love the outfit. I am 5 '10 tall and I had plan to wear skirt for casual occasion. I  just exchanged suspenders for regular longer and skirt on my hight become to be able cover my booty. Top will fit bigger chested woman. It's very cute and sexy. Its stretchy material. Skirt is made very well - not cheap made. Costumer service  was very helpful ( +++++) Thank you so much! I am happy for purchase.
5.0,This is a fantastic wallet. It’s very comfortable holds 4 cards and several bills. Love that it fits easily in my front pant pocket so I can keep my things with me while I work.
5.0,I love these earrings. I thought that they would change colors quickly but they didn’t. I wear my earrings daily without removing them.
5.0,I ordered 2 in 4x they are perfect. I ordered a size up because I like the extra room for my shape. They came early. I am very happy with this product.
5.0,My grandaughter loves this gown.  This is the second one I have gotten for her.
5.0,Cute hat. More of deep purple than grey. Cozy and kept my head warm in NYC weather.
5.0,Very nice dress but much too big.
5.0,"I bought these as a theater prop.  They survived a month of shows and dress rehearsals, to include multiple &#34;take glasses off and wipe nervously on sweater&#34; episodes.  One of the plastic thingamajiggies (technical term) that touch the ear have gotten a little loose, but as my ear is permanently affixed it is not a problem.  Oh, and they were a much larger glass than expected, they fully covered my eye socket, I was expecting something a bit smaller and &#34;Lennon&#34; esque.  But maybe I'm just a dreamer."
5.0,"its HARDTAIL FOREVER, NEED I SAY MORE this product line can do you no wrong. great fit, the fabrics when treated properly will live longer than you. cold water , drip dry . i have 4 pairs of hardtail yoga pants i purchased ten years ago still have the snug well made fit and they are intact in every way. amazing. its a no brainer"
5.0,"Purchased for my husband to keep the pollen out of his eyes to see if it would help with his spring allergy suffering, which is great.  He loves to putter outside, so he is miserable inside and miserable outside once the trees and grasses start up.  Alas!  By using these goggles and a mask, he has had two great weekends outside.  We weren't sure it mattered that the sides would be completely covered (he has always used sunglasses), but it has made a big difference.  Love that the glasses are tinted and UV protected, so it's no problem that he can't wear his regular shades.  Recommend highly!"
5.0,Just perfect to wear all the time in my second holes.
5.0,"Sucks in my belly. I’m 5’1” and 125lbs. I have a tiny waist but thicker/muscular thighs. So leggings usually fit but they do not stay up as I’m running and exercising. This does the trick. Also, it shapes my legs to look slimmer and more striated. I bought a small."
5.0,Great boot for young toddlers. It's a softer boot so it's easier for them to walk in and a little easier for you to get on. Get extra laces though. They don't hold up very well.
5.0,kids happy so  am  I  .
5.0,Love this hat! Great product for the price! I need one in every color.
5.0,My son loved it...
5.0,Very nice Pendant of good quality. I use it for with an Ancient Roman coin and it fits and looks perfect. Great item for the price
5.0,These glasses are wonderful! I have ordered several pairs. They are very sturdy and well made. Great value for the money!
5.0,"This shirt is super cute, and very comfortable. It fits great, with nice length."
5.0,WOW!  The quality of this costume for the price point is amazing!  Our child literally was stopped on the streets and asked for photos because this costume was so legit!
5.0,"This was very elegant. A little too elegant. I bought this for something casual, but this would go great with something more fancy, but I teamed it with a leather skirt and it works. It could work with leather leggings as well with heels and you are dressed. If you are a little more ample in the chest, buy from this brand. Fabulously made. Love the fabric."
5.0,Lindos y de muy buena calidad los lentes vienen con su propia franela 10/10 :)
5.0,"This shirt/bra is great. I bought it with the intention of wearing it as a shirt, but since I'm proudly apart of the itty bitty titty committee this has more than enough support to wear by itself, and I can imagine this would be pretty good for bigger chested girls as a medium impact to low kinda bra. It's super soft, and cute as well! The blue color is a bit different than the picture, but I like it nonetheless. Overall it's comfy and cute."
5.0,My daughter is 4 an loves to run around the house. We have hardwood floors these prevent her from slipping love them
5.0,Size was correct and they fit my daughter well.
5.0,well designed and totally functional
5.0,These are exactly as described
5.0,"I love this dress! It fits like a glove and the length is perfect. I bought a large and could have even gone up a size (5’7, 160). Now just need to figure out what shoes I want to wear!!"
5.0,Beautiful fancy dress. Bought it for father-daughter events.
5.0,Loved them! Very delicate and pretty! I do recommend using a rubber earring backing. I added my oil right away and put them on. In less than an hour I lost one.
5.0,Love this dress!!! Form fitting and accentuates all your curves. Quality fabric. Length is perfect with heels and train is exquisite.  Do not hesitate to purchase.  I can't wait to wear it.
5.0,Fits well and is really flattering
5.0,Good quality. Fits as expected. Arrived on time. All good.
5.0,"Cheap, takes about 10 minutes to install, looks great. Fitment is not spot on like the factory casing, but it’s good enough"
5.0,Lightweight and comfortable. Adjusts easily
5.0,"Super soft, good price"
5.0,Love these! Everyone wants them when they see me wearing them. Bonus: I can drive directly into the afternoon sun and not even need to squint. They are fab!
5.0,Grey and a darker blue than it looks but I like them
5.0,"I have other jewelry by this brand Karma and Luck, and would describe the jewelry as stylish, unique, and well-made. This red string bracelet is no exception. Yes, it is petite but that is the intention. It looks great mixed in with my stack of gold bracelets. Very nicely a packaged and giftable."
5.0,Love the tree of life design. Beautiful
5.0,I will be using this facinatior to make Soras Halloweentown mask. I didnt want to make something from paper mache as we live in a wet climate. This will be the perfect frame for what I need it for. Glad I found it and made the purchase. It is definitely sturdier than I thought it would be.
5.0,They are Cut a little small get a 1/2 size larger and you will be fine. Good value for the $
5.0,"I love the lightweight material that this top is made out of. It fits as I expected and fits very well. Seller sent quickly, easily, and I will be doing business with them again!"
5.0,absolutely love these jeans... they have the look of blue jeans but feel like comfy pants.  Best jeans ever purchased.
5.0,My wife loves her socks!
5.0,Its easy to put it on. I love it so much. I wear it all day except for when i'm sleeping or showering. I love using it to work out because it helps me sweat and it does not smell after always smells normal and is super snug and comfy and helps with my poster. It also suppresses my appetite which is great because I've lost some weight.
5.0,"I really liked the hair tie it came with, however, I have since lost it. C'est la vie. It's still a cute beanie."
5.0,Perfect first fit TTS listed on pics
5.0,"There was nothing about this hoodie that I disliked. The color and quality were as pictured, it fit true to size and I received it one day after placing the order. Feels good on and I love it!"
5.0,Perfect fit! Hiss any belly fat
5.0,"I love to wear flip flops as my ""inside shoes"" around the house. I still need some arch support for comfort, and thought I would try these since the description said ""arch support orthotic."" Well.......they are as comfortable and supportive as the description says. The arch support is in the correct place in the sandal, at least for me. I wear a 10.5 ladies in shoes but I usually get a 10 in sandals. The fit on these is good -- maybe just a hair long but that's OK. Usually size 10 sandals leave no room at the ends for me. I recommend these!"
5.0,So versatile I just love it and there has been zero tarnishing! I have worn it almost every day for the past 2 months.
5.0,Perfect for flying when pregnant to avoid blood clots.
5.0,"Easy to release when you want them to, springs are strong and keep them in place while wearing."
5.0,My friend just love the chain it compliment the earrings!!!
5.0,i AM A ROSE GOLD PERSON AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE INITIAL NECKLACE. My boyfriend and I have the same letter of our first name so he thinks it's for him lol NOT! i have received so many compliments on it
5.0,I’m impressed. It’s cozy and inner lining is soft and good material.<br />Fits true to US sizing. I run between M and L and wanted a L so wear over stuff. It’s warmer than a hoodie but not a heavy jacket. I’m happy w it!!
5.0,This is an awesome coat!! And cheap
5.0,"I absolutely love the way these earrings look. They are small, dainty, cute, and go with anything. My ears are extremely sensitive: will get red and itchy and oozy within the hour when earrings are not quality. These earrings I can wear all day. At the end of the day my ears are sore though. I slept with these in one night and it was fine. The next day my ears were a teeny bit irritated but it could have been way worse. I haven't slept in earrings other than gold because I cannot wear them for prolonged amounts of time. These earrings came in a black pouch within a plastic bag. Inside the pouch were two small plastic baggies. One bag was inside of the other. Each bag contained one earring. I did really enjoy wearing these earrings and I'm so happy I can wear them all day with feeling as if my ears were surrounded by the fires of Mordor. Please let me know if this review was helpful. I received these earrings at a discount in exchange for my complete, honest, and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and formed solely by the product itself."
5.0,Like New
5.0,"I now have 3 pairs of LazyOne lounge pants and I love them. I am 5'1"" and they do run a little long on me, but I just roll them up and it is fine. They are super soft and comfy. Would highly recommend them."

5.0,Super lindo y cómodo recomendado
5.0,These are the exact ones Ice Cube was wearing back in the day 💯. I never expected some legit looking locs. They're the ones you can't see your eyes through and all that.
5.0,"Clips stay in place and keep the shirt tucked.  Straps feel rough to the hand, but haven't experienced any issue against my legs.  Very happy with the purchase."

5.0,Great fit and extremely comfortable
5.0,Love the watch band's.  Easy to put on and very stylish.
5.0,Comfortable and pretty. Fits well. Sizes are accurate.

5.0,Very vibrant colors and sturdy!
5.0,"I bought this for my husband, and he loves it.  He receives a lot of compliments on it as well."
5.0,"As an RN a KN95 Mask is a much safer mask Asthma makes it harder for me to wear it all day. This cloth mask is well fitted 4 layers PLUS a disposable filter. The extra chin flap,longer nose wire, extra filter and adjustable straps make it closer to a KN95. The most important aspect of any mask is that you can and will WEAR IT!  So when I do not have to wear a kn95  it is my “go to snd I feel safe !"
5.0,Love the pin.
5.0,Super soft comfortable slippers for a great price
5.0,Everyday use.<br />Comfortable fit.

5.0,"Russell Athletic nailed it with this sweatshirt.  It is sooooo comfortable.  The 3X fits amazingly well too.  It's not tight.  It's not baggy.  It has just the right amount of room and slack in the right places.  Even the cuffs are comfortable.  Oh, and this sweatshirt arrived the day before a frigid &#34;polar vortex&#34; hit my city...yet I'm warm and toasty wearing this sweatshirt!<br /><br />I'm so happy with this product that I ordered four more in different colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  Russell Athletic also has a sweatpants line that you should check out."
5.0,"Absoutly LOVE this dress! Super comfortable great material and fit. I bought a large.  The material has a soft cotton feel. The ""about this item"" section is all true. This is the perfect cute casual dress. I highly recommend buying it."
5.0,My daughter loves them! She’s wearing them all day everyday.
5.0,This was a gift for my adult son. He is 5’10 or 5’11 ish.  He is medium build. He said they fit perfect and that they are comfortable.  He said he really likes them.
5.0,this item is the best pair of gloves i bought in my life if you are a large get a med.
5.0,This skirt is GREAT quality. I ordered it for a Halloween costume and didn't expect it to be nice. But it was a good quality fabric with a real waistband and zipper. Could totally be worn for a special event with no worries. Fit was exactly as expected.
5.0,I love this dress. It fits great. The first time I wore it I got complements. Light and comfortable material. You can dress up or dress down. I live in a cooler temp so the long sleeve is a great option here even in summer.
5.0,Looks great. Received many compliments on it so far.
5.0,I thought it looked exactly like the photo and it fit me perfectly in my size. It’s really beautiful and it’s lined and well made. The only thing I noticed I ordered the gray but it’s more of a blue based gray but still lovely. I recommend it highly it’s really versatile and can be a dress or a blouse but it’s definitely long enough to be a dress. I will add photos ASAP.
5.0,Fits great and it came in no time !
5.0,My 10 year old daughter got these for Christmas because we have not allowed her to get her ears pierced yet. They are very pretty and she loves the way they dangle. Her earlobes are very thick and so these turn them very red. She never complains they hurt though and wears them almost daily.
5.0,Very nice product and good quality! Great gift!
5.0,"This collection had a good variety of the most popular characters. All of the charms were a good quality, they had a nice thickness to the charm as opposed to others who tend to be thinner and rip when trying to remove from shoe. These so far have held up to the repeated placement and removal from the shoes."
5.0,Worked well on our cargo trailer.  We replaced broken hinges.  Will buy again.  Has grease fitting.
5.0,Picture does not do this justice. Little bigger then I thought but I love it.
5.0,Very comfortable and great style. I’m happy that I bought this.
5.0,"If your looking for a great garment bag, this is the one. Plenty space, durable, many pockets to store things in, and easy to carry."
5.0,This bracelet is very nice and great for the money.
5.0,Great size. Great quality. Matches just about everything.
5.0,💜💜💜<br /><br />Favorite boots ever! Comfy from the start and sooooo cute!!
5.0,THE BEST SUNGLASSES FOR THIS PRICE. I NEED TO BUY MORE CAUSE EVERYONE ALWAYS TAKES THEM FROM ME.
5.0,Belt is very comfortable and allows for adjustment to the exact size need.
5.0,"I bought this outfit because I liked the pattern knowing that it is a crop top suit.  It is age inappropriate for  me  so I put a wide red belt with it and I must say, va va va boom. Love the material and the fit. Going to buy the black one and reverse the colors. A lot of customers are saying it is see through, use your creativity people and it will work."
5.0,Neat keychain works as expected.
5.0,"Just got these yesterday.  Washed them real quick in cold water and air dried.  They are perfect!!  Fabric is soft, and they fit like a glove."
5.0,"I am actually a woman, and Fallout is my favorite game series. Obviously as you can imagine I was apprehensive as there is only one review however I took the chance hoping for the best. I was not disappointed!!!! The shirt was crisp and super white, although did have a somewhat “vinegar” smell, maybe from the graphic print however came out upon first wash.<br /><br />Original Bethesda marking in the shirt, I did notice inside my shirt/and on the packaging it says “boys” sizing but I got my usual shirt size and it fits like a normal men’s cotton shirt."
5.0,"My daughter loves these. Fit comfortable, and a plus on the stitch designs. Not too tight and stretchy"
5.0,Very happy. The top did seem a tad small for a large
5.0,Good quality and price. I'd buy again
5.0,"Very delicate and simple,- perfect for my daughter's wedding dress which was simple and elegant. Excellent quality and beautiful! Thank you.."
5.0,"Bought this to go with my work halloween costume.  The 3D ears headband is well made with large thick black faux fur outside& a soft velvet type material inside, satin black bows & a metal bow under each ear which are both stitched on very snugly. The metal band has coated tips to help make it comfortable.  I was able to wear it an 8 hr shift without any discomfort.  The stockings are like sheer dress socks with a tough rubber type pink paw on the ball of your foot. They can be walked on although it was uncomfortable for me to do so. The arm warmers go almost up to your elbow with the fingers & thumb open. These are sweatshirt like material & are very warm!<br />The choker is made of sturdy material also. It did fit a bit tight & scratchy on the skin for me so I added an extra extension chain that made it bareble to wear for a whole shift. I look forward to using this set again next year too."
5.0,"we love these and wish they had more colors of the same type, and i would buy more of them"
5.0,"Got it today.It works so much better than I expected it to and turns my regular bra into a super low line that is comfortable and wearable.And what is more,high quality."

5.0,no sharp edges like the first one I ordered-a winner!!!
5.0,"I absolutely like the cap. It is so light, soft and comfortable. I have a long hair and it covers all my hair. Dry fast. highly recommend the product."
5.0,the gloves are nice my grandson says they fit like he wants them to fit a little large
5.0,Wears well!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:13d535c47a224155f7b2d60d7cd38e93]] 10/10 if you wanna get this dress get it !! I got burgundy in a size small. This dress is from SHEIN. 😍😍😍
5.0,"Band fit perfect and looks great, however if you are hard of seeing you will find it difficult to change out the band because the screws are extremely small, smaller than those found in most eyeglasses.  But once the band is on the watch looks like the day it was purchased."
5.0,I love it. Love Bernie too.
5.0,"I added a wide belt, tights and a pair of shooties to this dress and I received compliments on how cute I looked in it.  It was comfortable and packed well."
5.0,It is an over-sized sunglasses with great details. Exactly what I am looking for. The value is great.
5.0,"Tried ratchet belt for first time and will never go back to traditional. Old style belt always seemed to be between holes for perfect fit. Not with this belt, just pull tight and your good."
5.0,Omg i love itttt ♥️
5.0,Beautiful and very exspincive looking.
5.0,Received this so quick! Wonderful quality and truly exactly what is pictured

5.0,"Beautiful I loved it, was exactly like the pick just what I wanted!"
5.0,Very well made and aesthetically pleasing appearance. Beautiful luster to lenses and frame. Perfect look and perfect fit.
5.0,I love it ! It's a little warm and the sleeves are really thin material . They might tear off real quick if not used well ...
5.0,I bought this for myself....great price for one of today's deals.....very elegant and not bulky
5.0,Great bra very comfortable love the straps
5.0,Just not what I would like .
5.0,Great goggles! I was pleasantly surprised that they also cam with a nose plug as well as ear plugs. They did not come with the case as suggested in the site photo. But rather a mesh plastic drawstring bag. They feel comfortable! will be great in the pool.
5.0,"This is a well made sturdy canvas bag as advertised.  It will be useful more as a tote to carry to work or or school.  The sturdiness would allow for books, laptop or tablets.  Items that would ordinarily be too heavy for reusable shopping bags."
5.0,"Fits great, light weight but durable, easy to open and close when needing a restroom break during work shift"
5.0,loved my watch its just perfect and cute .
5.0,This is my fifth Anne Klein watch over a 12-15 year period.  You. Cannot go wrong with this brand.  This model has larger face and easier to read numbers than other models.  All are good!
5.0,EDIT// IT BROKE. DONT BUY. DIDNT EVEN LAST A MONTH!<br /><br />Pretty sure the stones are real. Bought for a friend. She loved it. More beautiful than the photo. May buy one for myself and my boyfriend! ♡<br />THE ONLY issue was with the little pamphlet that tells you the healing properties of each stone... It doesn't specify the stones that are on this bracelet.
5.0,"I bought 2 and they are beautiful like the pictures.  I have a small wrist and they are perfect.  I love these because I love Shambala bracelets, but they can loosen as the day goes and these never do that and people admire them all the time.  I would purchase again."
5.0,"This purse is small but big enough to hold small wallet, keys, phone and a few other small items. The closure have a firm leather step that slides through a metal button. The strap is long which is pretty normal for Dooney and I love it!  Overall very nice cross-country body bag"
5.0,Affordable but looks super expensive and classy. 10/10 recommend.
5.0,"I love this hat ! Great quality, fits like a glove<br />It’s not flexible but not crazy stiff either. Cannot fold this one up. But I freakin love it, so cute"
5.0,Just as described and Arrived as promised. I bought a friend their first tennis racquet  for a birthday present and this is a great gift to give along with that! Excited to see their reaction to this fun spin on sweat bands. Would purchase again
5.0,When I saw this dress I knew I had to have it. It is sexy and very flattering. The color is gorgeous and i don't have the best body in the world but I feel like I do when I wear it.
5.0,We used as part of Dracula costume. It looked great. It got stuff all over it so I threw it in the washer and it came out perfectly-seems well made
5.0,The product was a gift that worked out very well. I connected to the smart device without any problems. It definitely had a lot of volume. Well designed.
5.0,So amazing little small on the band but overall great 10/10 recomend.

5.0,Comfortable bandana mask. I have a few from different companies and people always compliment them. They look great.
5.0,"This case was beautiful and we'll made. Unfortunately the lady I had purchased it for wanted a different design, so I had to return the product. I must say that the return and refund went so smoothly and I am extremely i.pressed with how well it worked. Thank you very much."
5.0,"These are warm and fit as promised. My only wish would be for a true black. I bought 4 pairs, in different colors, and they’ve made winter bearable and are fashionable. They don’t slide down and bunch around the ankle, and I can also pull them as high as the bottom of my knee without binding."
5.0,Super great product. Easy to install and remove. I highly recommend it.
5.0,This mask is awesome. We had to cut out larger eye holes but other than that customization it fit perfect.
5.0,"great suit..not too long like a lot out there,,,beats my old speedo as I age gracefully"
5.0,"My son loves them, they fit great and they came quickly! They also came with a little storage and carrying baggie!"
5.0,"Just received these today and  love them! Fit is perfect, color is awesome and 2 pockets 👍😎<br />Haven’t had them but an hour so don’t know about washing them or long time wear?"
5.0,I love the design and the way it fits.

5.0,Very good support and good looking
5.0,"I normally wear medium in swimwear, noticed some people said it fits small. I got an extra large and it fits perfect!"
5.0,This has been my favorite lounge/jammy outfit yet.  I am 5’10 and the shorts are just the right length.  The outfit is comfy and loose.  My only wish is that they had more variety in colors/prints.
5.0,Was perfect for maternity work comfortable blouse. Looks good postpartum to hide whats left of my baby gut.
5.0,"Cute shirt!  Best value around!  Feels handmade in a good 'Etsy kind of way'.  Material is not the softest but nice, not stretchy, just cotton.  I am 5'6, 155ish lbs, 36b/c, and got the Medium and its a nice loose fit without looking like a pillow case.  still tight enough around my hips to be flattering but doesnt dig into my armpits.  I wear it as a boat neck most of the time.  When I shoulder slouch it, it makes the words go crooked (as would any shirt like this).  The shade of pink is very close to how it appeared on my screen.  The shipping was super fast to NC.  I am very happy with my new rad shirt."
5.0,Very pretty detail.  Lots of sparkle.
5.0,LOVE THIS DRESS!! It is so flattering! So comfortable and stylish. Very happy I found it on Amazon. Great price too!
5.0,I love this shirt and it fits as expected. But I recommend a shirt under it. Especially if you live in a colder climate

5.0,This earring were the perfect size and great quality.

5.0,I liked having the draw string cause my size is usually an inbetween
5.0,A fine dinner jacket!
5.0,"Amazing fit and support, no worries about bouncing around during a workout.  Compresses where it counts without restricting movement or breathing. Additionally the material is awesome I will be buying again!"
5.0,Nice ring.certainly gets noticed with the the large size. I ride a Harley Davidson so this fits the bill perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful and fun shoes!!!! Size half size down for Steve Madden heels.
5.0,"Necklace is more of a pendant as it's a long chain, but my daughter absolutely loved this and now won't take it off!"
5.0,I love soft loungewear and these are my favorite! I am a size small and they fit great. They're lightweight but actually very warm! I've laundered mine a few times and they hold up well. Now I want them in more colors!
5.0,"Muy bonito y escotadísimo, jajaja."
5.0,Keep my hat warm
5.0,Great glass bottles for DIY sprays.

5.0,Was a present because I ordered mine in 2 x my friend saw it and loved it so I got her one too.

5.0,"soft, easy to put on to a newborn baby."
5.0,"I absolutely love the soft material, color and how it fits"
5.0,I gave this item to my 3-year old grandson as part of a birthday gift.  He LOVES owls and the sunglass case especially was a hit.  Looks very cute in his glasses!
5.0,Nice to have such a nice looking casual band. Although I love the blush leather that the watch came with I didn't want to wear it while exercising or other situations that may stain the leather. This looks great and it was easy to size. I have a very small wrist (about 6&#34; around) and like a snug fit and this band fits perfectly and I did not even have to go to the smallest fitting. Also like the easy on/off clasp and it is easy to switch between bands
5.0,Omg here on time and arrived exactly at 5 pm
5.0,Helped restore old pair of boots

5.0,"This is such a great little skirt for your little ones, whether they want to play dress-up or wear it out for real, either is possible! This skirt is really well made, straight seams, no loose threads anywhere on it and, the top has a beautiful satin edging all the way around it. It's made with three layers of tulle, and it's only slightly see-through. This is a cute little skirt, perfect for your little ones! I did receive it at a discounted price for my honest opinion. I would recommend this to my family and friends."
5.0,The young lady I bought these as a gift for absolutely loves them.  They seemed well made when I wrapped them
5.0,Bought as a gift for my sister and she loves it!
5.0,Gift for wife. She was very happy with these. Excellent assortment of sizes ranging from dime to quarter size pairs. Feedback from others to my question was also very useful in deciding on purchasing this product.
5.0,Gifts for friends.
5.0,I wanted a comfortable pair to wear to work! Currently work in the funeral industry and during services I am usually hustling around to get stuff done! These don’t restrict and are super comfortable!  The red is vibrant and have received many compliments!!<br /><br />1000/10 recommend!
5.0,"As a Mom of 4, I tried shoelace alternatives. So many different ones. Most were too complicated, too flimsy, or provided a poor fit.<br />Laceez to the rescue! They are easy to ""install"" and give that perfectly snug fit. I used a pair to replace the laces in a pair of slipons and can wear them again."
5.0,Great product and does what it’s suppose to do. Hands down one the best products out there to replace original dammits. Well made product.
5.0,"I love this band. It's soft, comfortable and cute. I have large wrists and it still fit me comfortably"
5.0,"Gorgeous ring the pic doesn't do it justice. I work in construction, so I don't wear my wedding ring, but this is the perfect option to that. The pearl white is beautiful and very feminine."
5.0,OMG. This works amazing for my needs its long fluffy ended up being the perfect length of 16&#34;/ 17 &#34; if you count fur to the point. The colors are exactly like the photo and it didn't smell horrible or shed a lot.<br />Over all im contemplating buying this again just so I can have a spare it love it so much.
5.0,"I received lots of compliments on this top! I wasn’t 100% in love with the poofy sleeves at first, but after all the compliments I am sold!"
5.0,One of the best hats you can buy. Very comfortable and you get lots of sun protection all day.
5.0,Not only pretty but very comfortable.
5.0,"Great dress, I am on the plus size but it fit perfect. It's roomy and lots of way to wear it."
5.0,"I got these 2x. I'm 1x/2x depending on the brand. These fit perfectly. They didn't look like they would fit when I took them out of the box. They seem very slim, but they stretch very well. I have big hips and a big booty so it's hard to find leggings that come up around all of my junk. These are super soft and came on smoothly. I didn't have to force them on and the lining is nice and thick so they don't become transparent over my booty, where they are being stretched the most. I did not like these jeggings on first sight, aside from them looking small the color looked weird, almost shinny, but once I got them on, I fell in love. The color seems to balance out once the material is stretched. The look like actual jeans which is nice. They did give me a much slimmer look. I didn't even take them off after I 'tried them on'. My mom and cousin saw me in them and asked where I got them from. I got back on and ordered more in different colors after trying these on. I was disappointed that I got the 2 of the same pair. The ad lists them as multi-blue-black and it's a 2-pack so I just assumed I'd get one black and one blue, but I received 2 blue. While it's nice to have a back up pair, I don't have a real use for 2 of the exact same pair. I wish they had more colors for my size."
5.0,Classy looking for a great priceHi
5.0,LOVE THESE!! Fit great / as expected and they are super cute !! ... great price as well !!
5.0,"These fit me PERFECT! I read some reviews that stated they shrink and they are prone to pulls. I washed and dried,in the dryer (normal setting) and they haven't shrunk. Also, I have a big rottweiler, that likes to jump on me, and so far no pulls. They are the right weight, not too heavy, not too thin. Love these shirts."
5.0,Came fast fits good
5.0,Just perfect. Love this blouse. And the sleeves without hems are especially cool! Love it love it love it!
5.0,"Fit perfectly right out of the box, and I love how it feels on my wrist! Would buy again if anything happens to this one!"
5.0,Quality of aprons is great!
5.0,This shirt is exactly as shown. My son really liked it also the size is true
5.0,Based on the reviews I ordered a size smaller than she typically wears and it fit perfect! Super cute! I did cut off the pink bow on the tutu because I wasn’t a fan. It didn’t ruin the tutu or leave any holes.
5.0,l0ve great
5.0,PERFECG
5.0,The material is different in person rather then what you see in the picture. It’s still cute and comfortable.
5.0,I get lots of compliments when I wear this dress
5.0,fit great and look Great I will buy more
5.0,high quality good price even came with a tool to adjust the band.  Love the look and feel
5.0,"THis is a great value for money as many of these devices are extremely expensive due to the materials used, like hard woods and expensive finishes.  This is made of plastic and seems a bit underwhelming when you place a several thousand dollar watch into it but it functions well, travels well, and accommodates watches of all sizes.  In fact, I have a Breitling Super Avenger, which is a very large and heavy watch, and it is able to fit well and the device functions flawlessly even on a watch of that size.  If you don't want to spend several hundred dollars to keep your watch spinning between uses, or you need a watch winder for travel, then this is a great option."
5.0,"My wife absolutely loves her new tank top.  First, the top is very lightweight and even though loose fitting (as described in product description), it does not have big arm holes.  She loves that the colors on the front do not wrap to the back.  This was an excellent find for her."
5.0,Very beautiful!!!! excelente purchase
5.0,Enjoying my T shirt. Let go racing.
5.0,"When it says tiny, not really but they are small. I love onyx and these are keepers."
5.0,You will love this item. It is so soft and comfortable.  The length is on the longer side too. You will not be disappointed.
5.0,"Love the look of these as they are similar to some designer ones without the price. I have a small head so they are a bit big but I wanted them to leave in my car. Very dark lenses, very oversized, very statement. Thinking of buying a second pair."
5.0,I'm 5'9&#34; tall and the length is perfect tea length. The fabric once ironed looks fresh and stands out nicely. The only issue is I ordered a medium and it gaps a bit in the chest.
5.0,Beautiful dress and excellent fit.
5.0,nothing more to say. true to size. i wear these to the gym all the time
5.0,Just what the doctor ordered! Very comfortable good for support
5.0,The kids love them.
5.0,I LOVE YOUR CROSS BODY BAGS I HAVE 2 AND PLAN ON ORDERING MANY MORE THEY ARE JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND SHAPE
5.0,My daughter love these!!!
5.0,"The quality is amazing! The price is ridiculously low! i find it hard to believe, but I'm greatful for the price."
5.0,I get so many compliments on this necklace and it goes with literally anything! Highly recommend!
5.0,Great price!  Love this concept...good quality.
5.0,This dress is beautiful. I got so many compliments on it at work! I will be ordering more in different colors.
5.0,The foxtail was sent in a vaccuum sealed pouch which made the tail very flat for shipping purpose.  The package was easy to open and all you have to do is pull it out of the packaging and shake it a couple times and it fluffd up perfectly. It is very soft and no odor.
5.0,"I'm planning a week at the beach (Galveston) later this summer and there will be a lot of walking to and from the beach house to the beach, and a lot of sitting on the deck sipping cold drinks and visiting with friends and family. This gorgeous and light Nomad Ruffle Beach Dress will be perfect! It fits great; there is a drawstring at the waist to add shape, and the fabric is light and airy - Texas beaches are hot! And it's sophisticated yet very feminine (the ruffles are subtle)! I'll feel both properly covered up AND stylish on my upcoming vacation!"
5.0,Love these leggings !!! I would definitely buy again !! I’m thinking of buying two more bundles I love the bundle . I bought size L-XL
5.0,"They are a creative distressed pair of jeans. Pictures do not lie, and the size is what I was expecting. They have a little stretch to them, so that should help if you get a little chubby."
5.0,"This is a very prominent charm. I love it, but it could be a bit smaller! I will wear it often, but probably not to work bc it is VERY big. Great for weekend gear though!"
5.0,I really like these clip locks!  They work really nice on my Pandora Bracelets.
5.0,"Husband loved this jacket, nice quality"
5.0,"Perfect fit, I don't like that I have to wear button ups to work but this shirt's material is nice & it looks professional :)"
5.0,My daughter wore this shirt on her 9th  birthday to match with her Roblox cake. The shirt fit perfectly and she loved it.
5.0,"Comfortable, strong, easy to set up and use. Allows me to carry and use my heavy DSLR easily, and, finally, a strap that doesn't slide off my shoulder! Well done!"
5.0,These were amazing just wish there were equal amounts of the gold.
5.0,My new favorite jean! I am 5’6 135. I bought a small! Nice quality! They feel and fit great!
5.0,"Have had for two months and they are still perfect. Love the case too, it's harder so they don't get smashed in my purse."
5.0,"It's great!!! I work in childcare and the kids and parents loved it, huge hit and very comfy and breathable."
5.0,Band fits perfectly and is very comfortable to wear.<br />The magnet on the end of the band is strong at best and keeps things secure on your wrist. Id definately recommend this band.
5.0,i really love how this looks! it’s really cute and you can easily pair it with anything! it’s great quality as well. i highly recommend this product!
5.0,Love it 😍 Received  a lot of compliments.<br />Arrived on time for my vacation.
5.0,"I JUST LOVE THIS! IT IS GREAT QUALITY, HOLDS ALL OF MY ESSENTIAL ITEMS AND MY PHONE.<br /><br />IN THE PAST HAD A MAGNET TO HOLD MY PHONE IN PLACE WITH THE WALLET.  NICE NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH A MAGNET FOR MY PHONE WITH MY OLDER WALLET PHONE CASE. I HAD A FEW TIMES IT DEACTIVATED MY CREDIT CARDS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET ON THE BACK OF MY PHONE."
5.0,"my first chain didnt work out so well, i returned it and the manager of the shop was very helpful and quick to make thing right.<br />i could not ask for better service. jim moore of rialto"
5.0,i love it. It liked cheap like a t shirt someone cut the sleeves off but it has become one of my fav tanks.
5.0,Bought these for my Husband who wanted an extra pair. He loves them.
5.0,I love this cover up. It is even more beautiful in person. You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"I have bunions and wide feet.  It has been difficult to find shoes that are comfortable on my feet.  These shoes fit great,  they look nice and I love the color purple."
5.0,"I purchased these Stompeez as a Christmas gift for a teenager in my family.  I knew Stompeez were for kids, therefore, I selected a large because she wears a 6 in a ladies size shoe.  The slippers do fit, however, if she had a foot that was larger, they would not fit."
5.0,"I saw in other reviews that this headband was too small for many adults, but I often find that headbands are a little too big. So, these headbands are perfect for me! They have a bit of rubber on the inside so that they are less likely to slip, and they are a comfortable. They are tight enough on me that I expect that they will still stay in place even after they have had a chance to stretch out a bit."
5.0,"Great quality, really thin wallet even with cards and cash in it. My fiancé loved it!"
5.0,"I had a hard time finding the ""old fashioned"" ear muffs like these, and thank heavens I found these on Amazon. I have to wear ear muffs a good part of the time, because of inner ear problems, and these are perfect. I like the fact that they are adjustable - so, the fit is good. I really like them."
5.0,"It is lovely and yet I had to return it,even thought I rated a 5 cause of its beauty,..too thin and short for me.I would recommend it."
5.0,Wore on the plane for 14 hours and I didn't have any swelling of my legs. It was very comfortable
5.0,These work perfectly for me. They really take the strain away. My only minor grip is that they are really tight. I could just have a big head! But I find myself having to take them off to stretch them due to the tight feeling around my ears. Other than that they are great!
5.0,"Being in a leg cast and fresh out of a major foot surgery, I had to have something comfy to wear for the family Christmas get together.  These provided a comfy and cute way to lounge in style.  Great quality, held up in the wash very well, and earned laughs from the family (gingerbread man's broken foot went right along with mine! ;)  Tiny correction I would have made to the design of the shirt: The puff ball on his Santa hat hits right in the middle of my right &#34;girl&#34; and puts one in mind of an ummm...particular &#34;feature&#34;.  Just a quirk that I'm sure the designer wasn't thinking about.  Well, at least I hope it wasn't on purpose....  Shirt fits well (long armed, big breasted, broad shouldered gal here), pants are large on me, though.  Length is great on my long legs, but they almost seem like they're a size or two larger than the shirt.  Not an issue, as they're pjs and should be comfy.  Would buy again."
5.0,Very cute son will love them.
5.0,Love it.  The material is nice and good length.
5.0,"Vivid colors, well made and the perfect size"
5.0,Great size great shirt
5.0,"I wanted a band that was a bit bigger than the original, as it was too snug to be comfortable.  This band was very easy to swap with original.  It gave me the extra room I was looking for and the material is comfortable.  I have been wearing it a few months now.  It has stretched out some so I have even more room and still comfortable.  I was worried the Velcro would wear out but so far doing really good. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I love the size and compartments on this purse. So much that I purchased two!
5.0,This bag is perfect!  It's just the right size for me! The gold color is great! And the straps are easily adjustable!  Very happy!
5.0,I really like it and it got here really fast
5.0,"its not sparkly or glitzy/glamy. sure it has some matte designs on it, but 4 different guys wore this on different occasions and each one thought it looked &#34;sick&#34;. haha.<br />originally got it for my bf since we were going to a masquerade bday party and it was so comfortable for him, he kept it on all night.<br /><br />product arrived in perfect condition. would def buy again!"
5.0,The color pattern and the fit. Gives a more slimmer body look.
5.0,"I love these!!! They are the best tights I've ever worn.  I wear them under my jeans,  skirts, etc.<br />They fit so good. They don't pull down in the back. If you are curvy, you know what i mean.  I hate tights that pull doen & won't stay up in the back!<br />Amazing,  soft fleece on the inside! I will purchase more!"
5.0,"Love them. Put them on and fit perfectly, nice leather, like the holes for air and the sole is awesome. Going to buy more."
5.0,"I love this dress! It’s a fairly basic yet still flattering A-line cut. The neckline is modest enough to not need a camisole or coverup underneath. The bottom hem is long enough to be modest, as well. I don’t like my bra straps showing so I wear it with a cardigan, although you could certainly go for a strapless bra instead. The white parts of the fabric can be a little sheer, but they are small enough and spaced through a busy enough pattern that it really isn’t noticeable unless you’re wearing neon undergarments. The material is soft and stretchy and it washes and dries well without much wrinkling. As is the case with these style dresses (with a printed rather than dyed design) the colors will likely begin to fade after a dozen washes or so, but it’s really not that bad and you can’t beat it for the price."
5.0,Fits well and my son loves it
5.0,"These are the most comfortable bands I've ever had. The problem is that if any of your clothing has Velcro on it, and the Velcro sticks to the band, it's going to make pulls."
5.0,It looks real good and it has good weight to it
5.0,Ordered this for my 12 year old som and he loved it.
5.0,Got it on time and looks great
5.0,This dress fit perfectly! I’m 5’8 and normally wear a 2x and went with a 2x dress. Received so many compliments. I was able to dance without strings coming loose. The length was a bit long which caused me to step on it but I still loved the dress!
5.0,"Best pants I have ever owned! I am 5'6, 130lbs and normally wear a size 4. I work in security and have to wear black slacks so I need pants that fit comfortably enough to move around all day. The stretchy material these are made of fit the bill perfectly! I have a hard time finding pants that fit my waste without being too tight for my thighs and vice versa, especially in slacks. There is just the right amount of give while still having a tight amd flattering fit! The only problem I had was that they are just maybe 1/2 inch too long but with shoes on it doesn't cause any problems. I will certainly be buying these again!"
5.0,"Arrived quickly, Great Product, BIG bag and good price!"
5.0,"Well made, fit perfect."
5.0,"It's always a guessing game to order clothes online, but this one is perfect!  I ordered one size larger than it recommended (I like things roomy), and the fabric is so soft, the lettering is great, I have absolutely no complaints!  Love it!"
5.0,good quality. gave to son as a birthday gift as we went bowling.  he put it on and loved it!
5.0,"I bought this hat for my son for christmas. Although he didn't get it yet, I know he's going to love it!"
5.0,Pefect for our needs.
5.0,"Most of all the comfort of this dress! Washes well, can be dressed up or worn  as is."
5.0,"I flipped so many pages to pick something for Vegas, a Wedding and other special events. Settled on this seller. But it has a story so would be easier to review if I break it down… stay with me… :)<br /><br />'Blue'  (ordered Sept 10) - was going to go with my outfit but was not going to arrive fast enough so ordered another style a few days later. Interesting to note the delivery for this item is 2 weeks LATE (just says ""On the way, but it's running late""  - no explanation) so I am glad to have ordered something else when I did.<br /><br />'Black Crystal'  (ordered Sept 10) - arrived quickly. Pretty. As advertised. Not as comfortable as their other style but still works. It sits kinda low which is good for lashes but it feels puckery (? Not sure how to describe it - the part around your mouth feels bulky/ like a bag?) it's not uncomfortable - just not as easy to wear as the other style IMO. Plus I felt like I had to keep adjusting it (no good for no hands to face rule).<br /><br />'Black/ Pink Stones' (ordered Sept 14) - Once I got this style I bought in another color and have been considering getting in another 2 colors. The fit is more structured and sits well in one place for a long time without adjustment needed. This design feels easier to breathe in than the other style since it doesn't fluff around your mouth as much (again hard to explain lol).<br /><br />'Black/ Blue Stones' (ordered Sept 25) - Second color. Excited. Not arrived yet.<br /><br />Extra points:<br />Thickness of both styles reviewed is good. Not N95 rated of course but thick enough to feel like its filtering something (even without filters added).<br />The chemical smell goes away after a while  (both styles have it and should be expected based on the materials). Just wash and air it out before first use and you will be happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Bonus points for reading this far:<br />Get 'nose bridge strips' and you could wear masks alllllll day. Seriously they make such a HUGE difference. They will stick on any mask and you can put them inside the layers or on the back so you don't see them. Best $6.50 you can spend on pandemic PPE."
5.0,"Bought this for my husband so he would stop stealing my robe and he loves it, makes it nice for standing outside"
5.0,"This seemed pricey to me when I was buying it. When I received it, I understood it was totally worth it. It's thick quality material, stitching, hope it will last for many years.  Very pleased with this item! Better than bathrobe, more versatile, must have!!"
5.0,"Bought 2T/3T for my 19 month old daughter. She is almost 26lbs and wearing 24m-2T at the moment (she’s slightly on the taller side). Hand washed and line dried before wearing- no issues. As you can see in the photo, the sleeves are a tad too long, but hopefully that means she’ll be able to wear it next summer as well. Otherwise, it fit fine and did the job of protecting her from the sun."
5.0,I love these earrings!! I bought the same pair around a year ago. The &#34;crystals&#34; on the bottom were not as bright green as the picture. And they've become cloudy over time. The pair I got this time are identical to the picture! I couldn't be happier!<br />They're perfect for almost any occasion and match all of my outfits. And they're so light weight that I forget that I'm wearing them.
5.0,"love it, and its got a classical-ish look. and keeps me warm!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:12121570910fc441d0b5ccba22366365]] i like how it fits me and the color is beautiful

5.0,Good looking and sturdy.  Arrived promptly
5.0,"Even though there's no expedite shipping button I received this in perfect timing for me and my friend's onsie party!!! Never have i been a fan of onsie's, but this is a very good looking onsie :D  warm and stylish.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,Great watch. Great quality.
5.0,"The quality of this costume is amazing (I got the T Rex), given it’s nearly half the price of others available online.<br /><br />I’ve worn several of these inflatable creatures and this by far is the best put together. Excellent buy!"
5.0,Nice shirt. I ordered a size larger than I wear and it fits fine.
5.0,My mom loves hers and it matches her purse perfectly.
5.0,If you want a shirt that fits well in the right places (if you're a fitness addict like me) then this shirt is the right pick.
5.0,The pack itself is small but I can carry a book and a medium cosmetic bag in the zipper bag. Not at all water bottles fit in the cup pockets but it’s manageable. Perfect for work and on the go.
5.0,Another wonderful product from AmorWing. I keep thinking my wrist is so much bigger than what it is. I should of ordered a smaller size but it's fine I don't like to go through the hassle of returns. This is my second bracelet from them and it is also beautiful. I highly recommend if you are on the fence. This is quality. You will not regret.
5.0,Excellent. Very very soft. High quality. Great purchase.
5.0,"got a ton of compliments. 5'6&#34; 160 pounds, had plenty of room in the medium"
5.0,"In the past month, I have reordered these pants multiple times now. I have 3 black pairs, and I am in love! I'm a stay at home mom, 2 months post pregnancy, and was struggling to find pants that were comfy and that weren't my husband's sweats. I can lounge in these around the house, but can easily wear them out and &#34;dress them up&#34; or dress them down. I haven't worn non-maternity pants quite yet so I'm not sure my current size, but I'll say I'm probably about a size 14, and I bought the XL. They tuck in my post partum baby belly. I wasn't sure about the longer length for the hot and humid VA summers I am currently in, but the fabric is so great that the length really doesn't matter. Pretty sure I'll be coming back for more colors!"
5.0,This dress is for work.
5.0,"I love Luminox watches, and I really like the metal back on the watch"
5.0,"excellent product, I like it.."
5.0,Russell sweatshirts fit great and look good at the gym  or just hanging around!!!
5.0,Love how cute and stylish they are
5.0,"Took a couple of weeks to get, but I was not in a hurry.  I had purchased the blue one as well for another baby shower and it was a total hit.  Can't beat the price or quality"
5.0,omg yes i have this dress in three different colors and want them all!! so comfy and stylish the material is thick! and i get so many compliments!!

5.0,My grandson loves it!!  Beautiful quality timepiece!
5.0,Better than I expected. Love this wallet and the design. Thinking about purchasing again for when my first one breaks down.
5.0,"I read several reviews and ended up buying a large. A medium would have fit better, but I’m fine with if being a little big. The shirt is as pictured and well made. I’m 5’5” 145 with a curvy build."
5.0,Yes ... love it even its a little expensive
5.0,Love it!!!!!! This shirt is comfortable and soft. I'm 5'4&#34; 132 lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits just as I thought it would. The material is lightweight and is perfect for these hot summer days.
5.0,Very sturdy good quality love it
5.0,I purchased this for my daughter who works mostly outside and she need the coverage from the sun. The only this is it was a little small in size.
5.0,"So far so good.  Appears to be super high quality especially compared to the standard plastic rings.  Time Will tell, but a nice weight out of the box.  I sprayed the bearings with silicone liquid wrench for good measure, very smooth operation now."
5.0,My nephew who is 14 really liked it!!!
5.0,"I bought these to create 'flying keys' for a Harry Potter themed 11th birthday party and they were perfect. The keys are different sizes and designs, some have many while others there were only 1 or 2. Not sure what I will use them for in the future but they were perfect for the project I purchased them for."
5.0,They are the most comfortable sandal!
5.0,Great quality and nice fitting. Very cute as well.
5.0,These are great accessories for a switch to allow easy in the go play
5.0,I have very sensitive ears and can only wear surgical steel or stainless steel earrings. These are great! The screw back secures the earrings and the size is perfect. Love them.
5.0,Works great. Its a little tight at the end where the elastic part is.
5.0,"I really like the fabric, soft and stretchy. I get compliments on it often. #momlife"
5.0,Easy to change looks good
5.0,"Love, Love, love. I gave this as a gift and the price is fantastic. The watch looks awesome and was loved by the gift receipient"
5.0,"I ordered this shirt for my mother. I ordered the pink, white and black long sleeve. Great quality, is very soft and is prettier in person. The only complaint I have is the pink is more of a peachy color then the pink that's shown in the picture, the color in the picture is pink but it's still a beautiful shirt. My mother wears a medium luckily I ordered a large to be on the safe side, the large is more of a lose medium then large so i'd recommend ordering a size up from what you'd normally wear."
5.0,"So happy with this. I wanted something with my son's birthstone (pearl) but didn't want to spend a lot. It's large, but not gaudy. I've had it for a month, so I can't speak to how it holds up. But it's beautiful"
5.0,fun time wearing these
5.0,I purchased this jeans since I was looking for a plus size high waisted jeans at a reasonable price...iam size 14 but when it comes to high waisted jeans i need a wide one as i have big hips and most regular size 14 high waisted jeans will not go beyond my thighs 😕...but theses were pretty good and didn't look ill fitted anyplace...will need to see how long they stay in shape just washed them 2 times since purchased.
5.0,This NW Native loves the &#34;Seattle&#34; graphic design.
5.0,"Love them.  They are beautiful,  great quality, and perfect size.  They arrived fast. I'm so glad I bought them."
5.0,"Love, love, LOVE it! I ordered it as a bridesmaid dress for my friend's wedding and it's perfect, comfy, and looks amazing! I'm 5'5'' and typically fit anywhere between a 4-6. I would recommend this to anyone. They ship fast! Worth every penny."
5.0,This bracelet looks just like the picture and the quality was very high.

5.0,"I love that it's organic cotton, the fit is flattering and the great message on the front! I will buy more styles from this company!"
5.0,Beautiful designer watch for way less than retail price!
5.0,I love jewelry by Patricia Locke. She makes unique pieces that are always beautiful. I own at least six pairs of earrings and each one makes its own statement. I've had my eye on this particular pair for quite some time and finally decided to splurge and treat myself.
5.0,Even comes with a separate bag so I can keep their swim stuff separated from their change of clothes or even use it to store the wet clothes and keep them separated from the dry.
5.0,I love to wear this mask so much! It's comfortable.
5.0,"My daughter loves it, very pretty, ty"

5.0,Awesome material & fit!
5.0,Beautiful and elegant skirt. The price is reasonable. Love it!
5.0,"My daughter wore it for my little brother's wedding, she was the flower girl : ) got her a size 8 because she's pretty slim and tall...a 7 fits perfect but was  too short...8 hits her right at the ankle but her waist area was a bit loose...it's ok, safety pins worked it out..."
5.0,I bought these for 2 young boys and they liked them (along with their dogs)
5.0,They are super comfortable and fit like a charm.
5.0,This shirt is super cute! I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. For reference I’m 5’3” and 160lbs. It has plenty enough room and feels so comfortable. I’m I love and will be checking out more like this.
5.0,"Very nice, not too long in length. Perfect for the price!"
5.0,Great product at an even better price !!
5.0,fabric feels good to wear.
5.0,"Mifa Apple Watch Band.Nice brown color, a little darker than picture but still ok.  It looks great and easy to put on.  It comes with a tiny screwdriver to be sure the connectors were attached correctly and tightly.  I had no need for it - it was perfect.  It feels comfortable and the leather will probably get softer the longer I wear it and I break it in.  Great replacement or just addition to your band collection.  I received the product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I love this set. It’s super comfortable and fits great. The quality of the material is really good and can be compared to other athletic sports wear brands, only more affordable. The shorts are also squat proof. I feel very confident working out in this. Definitely will be ordering more!"
5.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 130 pounds. I got this in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. It wasn't too tight, and that is a huge plus because I have had two kids, so I still have a little bit of a kangaroo pouch 😉 It falls just above my knees, and fits comfortably in the shoulder and chest area. I could of ordered a large and would of been fine with that as well. The material was thicker than I expected, but it is see through. It arrived before the expected date, and it comes with a cute, lightweight infinity bracelet/anklet. Can easily be dressed up or down, and I would definitely recommend it! You can't beat it for the price!"
5.0,Loved it. I wore it for my hello sunshine themed baby shower.
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS! Must buy, love the pockets."
5.0,These were for a birthday party.  They came on time and were just as described.  Thank you!
5.0,"I have owned all the big brands over the years and these are by far and away the best value I have found. The quality is amazing, they use some very clever engineering and design with their hinges and nose anchors, too. I am going to buy another pair in the darker brown, too. I have this thing where bright sun makes me sneeze uncontrollably and this kills glare down to nil. The lenses are every bit as good as Oakley."
5.0,So beautiful love them!
5.0,"the best part is this belt's buckle pin can be placed at any place i want, after a big meal i can loosen it to any size i want :P loved it.  material is great, fast shipping. This type of belt is generally very durable, last one I bought (this type) used it for more than 5 years, rough use with jeans. I am optimistic about this one too."
5.0,I have a big nose and a big head and figured I'd give it a try due to the massive discount. I like them since I was able to adjust the nose piece to fit the glasses at an acceptable level on my nose. They look nice. I wish the glass was a little bigger in the vertical to more shield below my eyes. Big nose issue!<br /><br />I did check that they were polarized by looking at a car window and seeing the spots. There is a slight distortion when focusing on a far object and moving my head. It's very slight. I would like to test their claim on the 100% UV filtering.<br /><br />Good glasses for the price.
5.0,"Went for the size 12 for my 8/9 year old/3rd grade daughter. She's traditionally a size 10 in regular clothes.  Fits great - I recommend checking your child's height against the chart because these are LONG. These are the longest parka's on the market - great for warmth travelling to and from practice and keeping car seats dry,  which is exactly why we chose this type. The towel liner is also a feature  - most have fleece - again this is great for travel to and from practice as it feels like a warm bath robe."
5.0,Great Bag. fits everything nicely.  cushioned insert holds ball in place.
5.0,"This is an absolutely adorable princess dress. It has a laced bodice, filmy shoulder caps and filmy strips of cloth in various colors that swirl over the underskirt. This will be a hit with any princess-wanna-be. There are two caveats: 1) this dress sheds glitter, which some people abhor, the underside of the straps are wrapped with the glittered cloth making them rough and scratchy, so if you have a kiddo with sensory issues, they’re going to need to wear a t-shirt or other clothing under this dress. Other than that, this is a surprisingly well-detailed and cute outfit that fit as expected. Very pleased with outfit.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

5.0,LOVE THEM! These were my Valentine's Day gift. They are perfect and not heavy.
5.0,they were a gift for my good friend he loved them
5.0,"It fits perfectly  and comfortably. It is more than comfortable, they are inviting a good night's rest during this hot summer.  Bobs girl"
5.0,"I just love these tops, because of the soft rayon blend fabric, and the flowing fit.  I always love a top that hits right at the hip (5'7&#34; tall, size 12).  I buy the XXXL because I prefer and oversize comfy fit.  I followed the reviews stating that it runs a little small so opted for the XXXL.  Normally I wear a large and now have this top in several colors.  I wear it alone with skinny jeans., or with leggings and a cute kimono type cover-up.  During the winter I wore it under my heavier cardigan sweaters.  Fabulous style, fit, design, and fabric.  Also washes well with no shrinkage.  (Wash cold and hang dry)."
5.0,"COMFORTABLE<br />Not tight, and not too loose<br />V neck<br />No bulky hoodie in the back.  Very thin for style.<br />Front pockets without being bulky there too.<br /><br />Love this casual wear.  I wear this once a week and it holds up well in the washing machine.<br />Over time, this just keeps getting more comfortable.  Like a worn in favorite shirt.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
5.0,"Beautiful, however wish the opening was a bit larger to fit a better chain."
5.0,This necklace is the perfect accent to my blue dress and other solid blue blouses.
5.0,"The first few days it ran really fast, but that is because I wore it ALL day and the position it is in while being worn was causing it to run fast. But lately I find it a little fast in the day and it runs slow at night on my dresser. So, for the last few days it has stayed around even. I have had it around a week now and I have not had to set the time other than DST. The regulator is pretty much impossible to get to, which stinks. So I am happy it doesn't need it. Looks wonderful and I have gotten tons of comments about it. I wish the day button have an actual button rather than needing a small object which inevitably scratches around it. But it looks clean without it. It is amazing to just watch it. Very surprised and incredibly pleased with it. I hope it stays in the condition it is in."
5.0,Beautiful dress the color was absolutely awesome.  I'm 5'4 150 pounds brought a medium Fits perfectly.
5.0,"These are awesome. They are a bit roomy for our 9 monther but not too much. It is getting warmer where we live and we wanted something that she could run around in her walker with that wasn't shoes. These stay on, lovely and she doesn't object to them. These are definitely going on my list as great shower gift."
5.0,Great price. Looks good on
5.0,"This is the second dress I bought from PattyBoutik and I’m obsessed. Fights perfectly, and I get lots of compliments."
5.0,"Sweater material is better quality than I expected. You never know what you might get from Amazon, but this is a great item. I might order one more in a different color. Glad I ordered a medium it's not too small and I have a little extra room but its not to baggy."
5.0,"Small but pretty, sizable (It doesn't have just one ring at the end, but several slightly larger links)."
5.0,good rings some we didnt use cause of the  writings on them but well worth the money just for the bars
5.0,"Early Detection is Important.  Education in key, support your local Cancer Awareness Association."

5.0,Great product and looks awesome.
5.0,"I was surprised at how nice this set it for the low price. The hat is adorable, and fits great. The price is awesome - and it includes a pair of gloves."
5.0,These don’t ride up at all. And feel just like leggings which makes them super comfortable. I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants something comfy to wear that can go with anything.
5.0,"I read some bad reviews on this after I ordered but mine arrived quickly and I was happy. They are delicate, yes with a tiny pearl surrounded by the mother of pearl flower which is a perfect ear size--not too small. They were in tact, not broken & easy to put in with long posts. Could not be happier with this product."
5.0,Love them for my classroom students as a giveaway tote bag for my students to use during trick or treat.
5.0,So so cute pants are more blue than as seen. Thought they were cuter in person than the picture
5.0,This will fix the water leaking in my camper
5.0,Perfect for my sister in law. It runs on the small side and she has very tiny wrists. So its perfect.
5.0,I bought this item to give me shade while walking the RenFaire. I was happily surprised at the beautiful quality for such a great price. Shipping was fast and well packaged.
5.0,very satisfied. looks great
5.0,"This dress fits true to size.  It is elegent and comfortable.  Love the lace and texture of the overlay.  I am only 5'2"" tall and wasn't sure this would be the correct cut for my stature but it worked perfect."
5.0,"I'm giving this 5 stars because iit was cheap, it came quickly, it fit, and there seem to be no issues. What more can you ask for for $6???"
5.0,I liked the fit and length of these. Pockets are oddly shaped but my phone has yet to fall out of my pocket during a workout.
5.0,This costume is awesome! So fun and easy to take on and off! Great quality for the price! My son won best costume!
5.0,Love it and very soft
5.0,great quality for the price. Fit was as expected.
5.0,Quick shipping and great product.
5.0,I love this form fitting dress. It has a very flattering fit!
5.0,The sweater is comfortable amd fits well. It warm but breaths. I love the large easy buttons and l love the way it bundles up to keep warm. Functional and designed well. I have 4 different ones from this brand amd they rock.
5.0,The dress looks fantastic. The material is high quality.
5.0,"Items are excellent quality!  Cleaning solution easy to apply to the very high-quality brush.<br />The buffing cloth is also an ideal size and worked well.<br />The storage case is small, hard-sided and will store easily, and also can be packed and carried along on a trip with ease.<br />Easy to use, cleaned shoes very well.<br />A highly recommended product."
5.0,First of all SUPER adorable.<br /><br />Love that it comes with its own little case & head strap.
5.0,"Lovely bag, I have carried it a couple of times,"
5.0,"The material is great. I was worried it would be see through but it's not. They come up right under my bellybutton. They are not too tight, but they can still hide the tummy a little. I'm 5'6&#34; and 110 lbs and the XS fit perfectly. First I got it in black and I loved it so I got another pair in reflex blue which I love even more. The blue is a little softer and stretchier."
5.0,I loved it it’s very lightweight<br />We got silver and<br />Will be ordering in more colors
5.0,love it so easy to wash my daughter does not mind the skirt usually she hates tutus but she was fine with this one received lots of compliments for my daughters birthday party
5.0,perfect for the price.  more of a cotton blend than a stretchy one so it does not lose it's shape after several wash and wears.  i get complimented every time i wear it.  and it has pockets! need i say more?  perfect dress for moms with bits and bobs.  I have been wearing it postpartum and it hides my pooch.  i ordered a large.  5'6 163
5.0,I love it....it is my affirmation reminder to JUST BEE!!!!!
5.0,I like the look of this anklet better than the ones I seen... haven’t tried it on yet but will update later on
5.0,Used as a mold for latex mask using latex liquid. It held together for the first 3 masks but then ripped.
5.0,I very  like this shirt I was received and fit right on me. Good one also the color so beautiful.
5.0,"Finding groomsmen gifts was an annoying process - you want to get something nice that they'll use, with a &#34;personal touch&#34; to show you care, but also don't want to spend tons of money in the process.<br /><br />This package of aviators was great as something for my groomsmen to wear for pictures, during the reception, and after the wedding as well.  They're a great price and look good.  After being transported to the venue, worn around the venue, shoved in pockets and bags, etc. the lens coating didn't scratch and the parts didn't break.<br /><br />The only cons with these glasses is the quality and the darkness of the lenses.  The arms definitely feel like $2 glasses.  The lenses themselves are also really dark.  I originally rated these glasses as 4 stars because of these issues, but then, recalling the very low price, the glasses certainly fill their roll as fun, cheap glasses to hand out to friends and wear for awhile."
5.0,This dress is so pretty on. The picture truly don’t do it justice. Elegantly beautiful.
5.0,These were super comfy<br />My wife stole them. Haven’t had them since!
5.0,Just what I wanted and needed.  Good Price Also!
5.0,This is by far the best armband I have owned! It is so easy to attach and remove allowing you to easily access your phone.  Once placed on armband it is solidly in place.  The armband is well made and has last longer than other brands​ I have used in the past.
5.0,"Size is right on, good quality, looks great."
5.0,"Perfect swimsuit! I could shop all day at the mall, and order from high end places and still never get a suit that felt this good.i ordered an XXL. I'm 5'10 normally a 14/16 with a long torso and a 38 DD. This suit fits perfect... tie it tight for more support!<br />I have 3 kids and this suit is kid friendly, keeps me tucked in but also is slightly sexy.<br />I own it in black and pink 🍍.<br />LOVE IT."
5.0,GREAT!  My wife looks unbelievable in it: Super Sexy!
5.0,I've been using this for a few months (maybe 3?) and this has been a great investment. Not expensive and has been holding up well.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6ed7b1957326be91447d61dc25f9f79e]] This bathing suit is definitely true to size it fits perfectly, well made and looks exactly like picture !"

5.0,"[[ASIN:B00NOQ2ZAA FuzzyGreen® Cute Unisex Children Kids Baby Hot Pink & Purple Cable Twist Woven Knit Crochet Cable Warm Winter Hat And Scarf Set+Gift]] When my granddaughter and I opened the compt package for<br />FuzzyGreen® Cute @BeanieScarfSet - the very first feel, is it seems,  by all means to be hand crocheted - it looks like this product was made by great grandma for sure- the quality and the vibrant colors were fun and exciting- a child usually does not get excited over  winter warm gear, but as you can see in the photo - my grandchild was very excited- when I sent her home - everyone was asking -who made the scarf set- I just smiled and send my friends and family a link to add to cart- guess what - not just for kids I had to wear it myself! 5 stars"
5.0,After a year of wearing this watch everyday it shows almost no signs of wear and tear.  The face shows no scratches and am pretty rough on it.  Would definitely buy more from this brand.
5.0,"Love this, I want more. I always get complimented when I wear it."
5.0,They fit as expected and very comfortable.
5.0,"She loves this skirt! My 16 year old wears it often and gets compliments all the time. It is comfortable and hits about 1 inch above her knees (she is 5'4""). She is very conscious about modesty and feels perfectly comfortable in this skirt. She loved it all Summer and it looks super cute this Fall with tights."
5.0,Love this watch. A good size for my smallish wrist. Adjustable too
5.0,Our daughter loves these adorable shoes.  She got them for her 3rd birthday.  They are a bit big but she can still get around in them.  A must have for a girly girl!

5.0,Great umbrella for its size when closed
5.0,Fits nice around the crotch. Makes your package appealing.
5.0,"Nice weight, look good very comfortable."
5.0,"This top is generously cut, and if you're feeling modest, might need a tank top underneath, as the neckline is wide enough to go off shoulder if you buy the next size up from your usual. This could be a plus, as off shoulder tops are coming back in now. Either way, it's very light and comfortable, well made, and a flattering cut. I will buy another one when I can."
5.0,Gift for my mother. Very nice
5.0,"Gave this to my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he loves it! High quality, durable, nice looking!"
5.0,Bebop is kick a$$. According to my wife.<br />And me too. I bought her the small size of these jeans in the two different colors. They fit perfect and then shrunk after washing just enough to make them a little to tight. So I ordered her the mediums and after washing are perfect. They look beautiful on her. They seemed to be a well made import and the seller seems to be on the mark. Seller says they are working on more colors now. Good move.<br />So here are her measurements based on a medium size fitting perfect after washing.<br />115 lbs<br />36<br />25<br />35
5.0,Omg I love this lil jacket its so stinking cute
5.0,Bought it as a gift and she loves it!!!!!!!
5.0,Wow.  Looks very expensive.  Very happy !!
5.0,It was cool! Looks like a 70’s style watch with that unique Speidel label.

5.0,"Bought this for a friend, and he loves it! It's a really nice color and fit."

5.0,Wore these on a cruise. Very generous in size and versitile!

5.0,I liked the earrings very much.  They were exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,This is a great looking shoe!!  Fits well and a great value for the money!
5.0,The quintessential go-to shirt. A blue plaid shirt seems to make anyone look good. Great with any hair or eye color. Blue plaid always sells out first.
5.0,Fits both mommy and baby!
5.0,"For the price, this jacket fits me just right with a lil room left to move around in ...I wear a M with busts size 36b and narrow shoulders. ..im very satisfied with my product!!"
5.0,These are terrific socks that I've owned for a few months now and I've used them a few times. They truly are as comfortable as all the other reviews say. They are a little bit thick so know that going and if you have shoes that already fit you pretty tightly. The socks definitely absorb my sweat pretty well. A+ product. They seem pretty durable so I believe I will own this pair for quite a while.
5.0,Gorgeous leather!! Love it.
5.0,Loved the color and quality but a little tight on the neck
5.0,"LOVE IT!! Only tried it on, so far, but it's super cute! Material is nice, color is vibrant and the length is perfect!"
5.0,Perfect for my 8 year old son who has returned to school. I wanted him to have extra masks handy because he has a tendency to misplace things. He says he doesn’t mind wearing it at school the whole day and he can breathe fine.
5.0,This is a really cute shirt that fits true. I run between a L and XL and bought XL and I’m glad I did. There’s a little stretch but it fits very well. I love the coordinating lacy sleeves.
5.0,They have their very first travel and works so good!!
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, and was very pleased when I took it out of it's package.  It's a little thicker than I imagined (I own another that is more of a thin fleece), but that is a good thing.  I'm sure my sister will love it.  It's perfect to wear around the house in chilly weather, yet I imagine it will look great as a casual wrap for going out."
5.0,"These take the 'power' of powerflex very seriously, and they support my lower back when I move. I've never head another pair with such a perfect fit, and pain-stopping core support. I've already bought two more pairs."
5.0,"nice and soft, my second pair, love these...and so warm."
5.0,"These are good quality workmanship, very colorful and work well for the holidays but they are long. If you have a short neck they might not work for you."
5.0,"very cool.  my son loves it, and when playing in a group on a playground, I can pick him out of the crowd."
5.0,Got this for my daughters first communion and she looked great in it.
5.0,"super cute, fit about a 4 month and up head. Got for a newborn and they did not fit"
5.0,"Bought for my 23 year old daughter and she loves it.  She looks great in it, too.  I thought it would be a bit baggier but it fit nicely.  She was very pleased and wears it all the time in the cooler months."

5.0,Durable & fashionable. Looks amazing in person. Husband loved it.
5.0,Great material. Beautiful color. Very comfortable.
5.0,"It's really nice, the only problem I have with it is the smell. Other than that, nice bag.<br />UPDATE September 2016: after a couple months, the smell is completely gone. So I guess it's really a minor issue, considering how cute these bags are ;)"
5.0,"A mi hija le gusto mucho, mas por que cambia a varios colores"
5.0,"Nice product, exactly what It says. Very happy with this glasses"
5.0,This bracelet is exactly what I wanted.  I like that it screws open to fill the felt pads with oil.  I had another bracelet that flipped open with a magnet and I kept losing the felt pad because it was loose.  So far this one works great and I like that I got 2 for a great price.
5.0,My little guy loves his new sunglasses. He wears them constantly.
5.0,"More beautiful in person, gorgeous craftsmanship, and a lovely touch of little gift bag. Thank You"
5.0,"I've worn these hiking in 30 degree weather without feeling a chill.  Fit is very small. I'm 5'2"" and 105 lbs and XS fits perfect.  The color combination is bright - not muted."
5.0,"I was skeptical due to the reviews I read. But I love this wallet. Its not cheap at all. Its not a leather wallet, but I wasnt about to spend 40 dollars on a wallet. I bought the hot pink and like it alot. I'll buy another one down the road. Thinking of getting the yellow."
5.0,Got this for my flower girl and she looked so cute! Fit perfectly!
5.0,This dress made me look snatched in the right places. It fits as expected but like a glove. I bought the red dress and it was my birthday. It was cold and it has thermal protection from the cold. I loved it!

5.0,The plastic visor was made well and easy to see see through.

It looks really cute on my 10yr old daughter and with it being so colorful, it goes with any outfits , casual or formal.<br />She also loves the Fuzz ball chain.  Had a question about the product and the seller was very prompt with reply."
5.0,Loved the design and the material.  Wish you could make one with a Lion print on it.
5.0,Seems good so far. You can seem rip the logo off very easily.
5.0,Just as described-nice fit.
5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! I bought this necklace to go with my dress for a gala and I received so many compliments!!!
5.0,Socks are a bit tight. But they look groovy
5.0,"I ordered these for my daughter who likes to wear this type of sock with Vans, tennis shoes, etc. She loves these socks! They are lightweight, breathable, comfy and soft. She especially likes the fact that there is a sort of grippiing tape inside the edge of the sock that prevents it from falling down and allowing the backs of her shoes to rub against her heels. She also likes the variety of colors in this pack. The price is also very reasonable. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Love it. Beautiful and true to size

5.0,Daughter in law LOVES these!! So cute on her too!!
5.0,I have several of these dresses in different colors.  Great fit and flattering.
5.0,Beautifully blue. Petite & elegant
5.0,I got these for my grandson for Christmas. He loves them. The only thing is the lights aren't constantly on. They only light up when he walks. There's a little button inside on the heels of shoes that presses when he walks  He also wears a size 10 toddler I got him a 10.5 they fit perfect.
5.0,Good quality and I love it but runs very small I had to return it but fit very nice.
5.0,"I ordered this product to repair the clasp on my watchband.  I used a [[ASIN:B005ZEWGSA SE - Spring Bar Tool Set - 5in., 7 Pc]] previously ordered to make the change.  The large assortment meant I could be sure of having the correct size, and a generous supply of each meant I don't have to worry about replacements for some time to come.<br />I have no complaints as to quality or fit and finish.  If I had to nit-pick, I would complain about the case; I wish it would hinge instead of being a friction fit, secured by cellophane tape at the joint by the factory.<br />Place this in your desk drawer along with a spring bar and you'll have the ability to fix watch bands for years to come"
5.0,"better quality than i expected.  I really like this shirt.  the fabric is nice, not too thick or thin. ran a little big but not enough to return it."
5.0,"I like the style, you can wear it at work and it is perfect for going out"
5.0,I love them! they make any outfit look pretty. they fit my 6month old perfectly. they are just so pretty. I received the package on time.
5.0,"Works well, until it broke."
5.0,I needed a black comfy watch with a second hand and a face I could actually see well.  I have a tiny wrist and I don't like huge watches.  This is just perfect!
5.0,I love these glasses! The red metallic frame compliments the sunset-finished lenses perfectly. The frame even has flexible springs to fit people with larger heads.
5.0,My son loves this pullover. It's comfortable and it looks great too.
5.0,So soft and comfy!  LOVE IT
5.0,Very nice. I will order again. Used<br />them with pebeo paint and acrylic/ ink.
5.0,"Good fit, comfortable material!"
5.0,"I wear this to work.  It's comfy.  Can be dressed up or down with heels or boots.  I've done both.  It's a little shorter than I'm used to but with tights or leggings, it's fine."
5.0,I'm 5' 3&#34; and 135 lbs. I ordered a small and it fit perfect. It's very flattering.
5.0,Love this color and the dress!
5.0,Love this watch! It's professional enough to wear to work but still has some personality.
5.0,"These are beautiful! The picture does not do it justice. It came on time, well packaged very much protected. I love the rose gold with the rhinestones design. I thought these would look cheap,but they do not, they look very nice. It did not irritate my ears, and I do experience sensitivity when I wear earrings that are not hypoallergenic. I'm really impressed with the quality of how this was made and I am so happy I purchased it! I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review of this product after testing it."
5.0,"GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS, NICE MATERIAL FIT JUST RIGHT"
5.0,"Quality @ Value, plus they hold up after many washings!!"
5.0,My girlfriend lives it. Two months to receive it. U forgot I bought it. It was a nice gift for my girlfriend.
5.0,It worked just a little off suze
5.0,just as expected and as pictured
5.0,"My absolute favorite socks! Soft, stretchy, long lasting! Love the heel tab!!"
5.0,"This is a hat that resembles a beret but is not quite that. I wouldn't know what exactly to call it but I do know that it is very cute! I bought it because I wanted more hats that would frame my face well and this hat did not disappoint. I think that hat can be for any fashionista who wants to add a pop of print into their lives! I don't know how it would work on big hair, as my hair was straight when I bought it, so I'd beware of buying this with a natural fro. All in all, this hat was extremely cute and I could wear it with almost any outfit to make it a tad bit cuter.  It also fit well, and didn't feel like it was squeezing my head or too loose. It feels very comfortable and I would definitely buy again. It is not very sturdy or thick, but that is what makes the design so good. It is thin enough to allow it to be comfortable and not feel like a weight or a stressor on your head."
5.0,Bought the 10-12 for my 9yo and it’s a perfect fit and great quality adidas long sleeve hooded t-shirt! He’s rough on clothes and after several washes it’s still in great condition !
5.0,Super cute and it’s a real rose quartz Crystal
5.0,"I love this dress! I have been buying a lot of dresses on Amazon and this one is my favorite! It fits perfect, not like a maternity dress or too tight. I'm 5'5 140 and a medium is perfect. I think in cooler weather I will wear with tights and boots. In summer it's perfect with flip flops."
5.0,"I have not worn to date.  I have to wait for summer, but like the looks of them."
5.0,"Love the bootie but just too big.  Ordered a 6 because smallest size offered, hoping it would not be too much larger.  But not happening unfortunately.  Beautiful bootie, though."
5.0,Got these for myself and my bestie as Xmas gifts. They are toooooo adorable. Seem to be made out of  a decent metal. Cute dainty chain. I love them!
5.0,"Wow, I’m really impressed by this band. It’s a little tight going over my thumb but it fits so well. It feels very secure and comfortable. This will definitely be my new favorite band"
5.0,"Soft and comfortable, true to size for me. But it does shrink."
5.0,Very nice for the price! Was worried that these glasses would be to small on my 3 and a half year old but they came in and fit her great. Love that they are polarized. And she loves the pink frame!
5.0,"The Outdoor Research radar pocket cap is perfect! I wear a 7 3/8 baseball cap and large was the perfect size! I wear mine in the pool with the kids and they use it for a bucket to hold pool water. It gets a ton of heavy use and I rinse it off after pool time to keep it intact. Also great for travel as the bill fold folds in half. The green color is a nice dark green. Great quality, couldn’t be happier!"
5.0,Love these tops for excercise!!
5.0,Got this for my wife. It fit her perfect. And feel very comfortable.
5.0,"Love these! I have an odd bra size, with a large cup and small band size, and it always seems like they were made for someone with very wide shoulders and the straps constantly slip down. I have a few bras with j hooks but that ends up hurtin my back and I’m not trying to make these puppies look even bigger. These work great to simply keep my straps up without altering the fit of a regular bra. Just be careful if your bra straps have a decorative stitch on the edge as they can get caught and pull"
5.0,love this bathing suit!
5.0,"super comfy, very warm.  love the hood."
5.0,"I love the material, the color and the fact that there is a thumb hole and a harms cover to keep warm. This jacket is designed to stay warm and comfortable in activity or while chilling!"
5.0,"I bought it for myself as my Christmas gift. It’s thin but very comfortable. It made of 95%polyester and 5%spandex. Highly recommend it. Also one thing very important. This is Asian size, read the size chat carefully before you submit your order!!!  I am 5ft 7in and 155LB, I bought the size XXL."
5.0,Nice shirt and great seller!
5.0,Like the size and the black and red contrast. I always like skulls!
5.0,"Very cute dress,Fits well, the fabric is light and comfortable. I was shocked by how much I loved this dress when I put it on, it’s even better than the picture.Appropriate for travel，or great for brunch or a fun outing."
5.0,"Read previous reviews on the size, Xl fit just fine for 5’10’, 218lbs with room for clothing underneath without being bulky."
5.0,Really holds you.
5.0,This piece is beautiful. The colors really pop on the bracelet. Really nice
5.0,"im a mommas boy and i got this for my mom and she loves it, the quality is amazing for the price"

5.0,"Beautiful comfy shirt,"
5.0,"Great bag, zipper is little off it doesn't run through all the with of bag but it is not a big deal to me anyway. Handles are good and all hardware hold up great. I took it for vacation trip use it for my airplane aditional carry on with tons of things in it. Changing the planes and hotels several times always with maximum stuff packet in that bag. No problems still good as new"
5.0,Love the way it compliments most of my outfits
5.0,Very flexible. Feels less stiff than apple version which I prefer. Doesn’t pinch hairs or skin.
5.0,"Absolutely love this hat. Absolutely did not expect to be writing that!<br /><br />Nicely assembled, this hat provides excellent coverage against the sun and bugs. Lightweight, it rests comfortably atop the noggin (though it is a bit small; OSFA means sizes small-large, but not extra large). The material breathes well, so it's not too hot up top.<br /><br />Really like the pull-string closure at the bottom of the bug netting. And speaking of the bug netting it folds up nicely inside the zippered compartment on the top of the hat.<br /><br />Reasonably-priced at $17.99 (Amazon price at the time of this review). Wish a hat sized for us big heads was available. Would be buying more....<br /><br />Regardless, still a 5 star item!"
5.0,I love the color and it is very comfortable.
5.0,Came in safely. It's simple but pretty and cute. :)
5.0,"These make it easy to go to a concert without having to carry a case. Same goes for hiking and running. If you have a large dog with a faster reaction time than you, these will keep your lenses right in front to take all the slobber."
5.0,I LOVE this piece and have gotten so much positive feedback as I wear it. I would order more pieces from this seller!
5.0,"Covered my sun line on the wrist perfectly, Really nice for wedding day &night ."

5.0,Very nice dress with good fabric. Bigger than true size but love the dress.
5.0,"This backpack for the price seems amazing. Already tried it for the weekend carrying a box of ammo (400 rounds in), case with handgun, two pairs of earmuffs, and safety glasses. Love the available space, large zippers, support straps and the velcro options. This bag also brings a compartment for a laptop which exceeded expectations. Thanks."
5.0,It is great and although it could be a thicker plastic it fits great
5.0,"When I put this on my wish list I was a little concerned as to how it would look.  Well I didn't need to be it's beautiful and very delicate looking.  I hate jewelry that has polished silver ""bumps"" made to look like diamonds instead of having diamonds, white topaz, CZ or  similar stones.  This one has CZ's and looks very nice.  It does catch delicate cloth and snag so I'm careful what I wear it with."
5.0,great quality and comfortable to wear. I would buy from them again .
5.0,My son loves his new Sonic PJ set.... It fits perfectly

5.0,A bit big but I live in a cold place anyway and I wear 2-3 pairs layered up.
5.0,I loved the Medical Assistant key chain I purchased as a gift for two students.  The quote on the key chain was so appropriate for what these students had accomplished.

5.0,"I ordered the wrong size which super bummed me out because I ordered for vacation expecting a cheap dress. When it came in, the material felt heavy; like a good quality heavy. The top landed nicely I just should have ordered a size down."
5.0,"Fantastic!Bought my first one in  Paris.  It hold your purse as you sit to dine, or whatever."
5.0,"I've been a Frye girl for years and feel like the leather is high quality and comparable to other Frye items.  The zipper is stiff, but I'm hoping it becomes easier to use over time. Overall, this is a great, classic bag at a great price due to the style being discontinued."

5.0,"Such a great value, material is sturdy & hangs beautifully....great everyday skirts! I have bout 5 more"

5.0,Excellently priced gloves for warmth and functionality.
5.0,I wear them every day it was a great purchase applied by them again
5.0,"I run while wearing these and Vivobarefoot Stealth for women. It is the perfect combination. These socks fit perfectly, are ultra-thin in their cushion, but protect my feet just right, so that when I run or walk, I never feel that the socks are too thick for me to feel the ground through my shoes, or too thin that my feet might get blisters or abrasions.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
5.0,I love  these earrings  I received them yesterday and have gotten a lot of comments.
5.0,Very pleased. !

5.0,"Loved the fit, nobody gets a tushy flash. She thinks they are comfortable and cute"
5.0,"I do love this dress. I almost didn't order due to one customer stating the fabric was see-through; but, I took a chance. I am so glad I did! The fabric on this dress is soooo comfortable. My only complaint would be the top piece being slightly (hardly) baggy (not too form fitting); but, I am not too large breasted either. I am 5'4, 34B and overall can say that I love this dress."
5.0,"My daughter on the left of the pic, ordered this for a Valentines dance! She loved it and looked adorable in it!<br /><br />The only Hong we had to do was hem the sleeves a tad tighter...my daughter is smaller and they sleeves were gapping on her arms lol"

5.0,awesome for the price! Light enough to hang and fit both my daughters.
5.0,"Very nice wristlet/wallet. I can fit things in nicely for an ""on the go"" purse. Very classy looking. I might add some type of embellishment in gold on the outside to glam it up a bit. Perhaps some type of adhesive-backed scrapbooking/jeweled item."
5.0,This bag looks nice and is convenient because it has the ability to slide right over your rolling luggage's handle. I have seen a lot of travelers fight with bags that twist right over their rolling luggage's handle (I have done so myself) and this does not have that problem at all. I purchased an extra one to give as a gift and the recipient is pleased as well. The space in the bag is more than adequate for a weekend trip and makes for a good addition to rolling luggage.
5.0,Love it. Beautiful and interesting.  Great quality.
5.0,Who knew they made disposable gloves footer kids? This is genious! These gloves are perfect for our tie-dyeing projects at The Paintbrush. The kids didn't have to go home with semi-permanent purple arms!

5.0,I love this hat! It’s perfect for Pokémon lovers.
5.0,Oh Boy!  This dress is so perfect for travel.  Unpack and wear and look SO fabulous.
5.0,"Super cute jumpsuit. Def need to wear a bralette because the cut doesn’t work with most bras. Really light, soft fabric, but it gets super wrinkled when you wear it, so probably best to wear on a humid night. Comfortable on a hot evening or cool evening. Got tons of compliments! The slit on the legs looks exactly like pictures.<br />I’m 5’6, 34D, 135lbs, and long waisted and the size Small fit me perfectly."
5.0,They are very durable and I love that you can adjust them.  They work great for my two year old and for my mother.  We are very pleased with the purchase.
5.0,Cute purple dress- it’s definitely on the shorter side so I would most likely wear it with leggings or tights if wearing it to work. The material is pretty soft and the color is exactly what I expected. Great dress to wear in the fall and spring overall.
5.0,"13 year old this was purchased for says, &#34;fashionable and fun to wear.  Looking forward to more designs.&#34;"
5.0,"This jacket is perfect for the spring/fall and even the winter if you layer properly. Keep in mind that the jacket runs about a size large since it's a classic harrington fit, so you mind want to go a size down."
5.0,"I had seen this sweet little charm on a friend and had to have one! It's very small, but I love it."
5.0,Exacatly what my granddaughter wanted.
5.0,Comfortable and affordable.  I have been given clothes in the past that I still have. Great company.

5.0,"Product as expected.  For the price, feels like good quality!"
5.0,"Awesome earrings, get lots of complements!  Sturdier than expected (for the price)"
5.0,Dress was very flattering. Very stretchy so I purchased a medium and so glad I did. I’m 5”2 150 pounds.
5.0,Fits nicely. I am usually about a size large 10/12 so after reading the reviews I ordered the medium size. Fits perfect and is very cute with my dress.
5.0,Beautiful. I love it!
5.0,"My 3 year old son picked these because they're &#34;just like daddy's&#34; underwear. The hole is functional, fyi.<br />I've bought several packages, and each time, the sizing has been consistent and true to size. The boxers are also super soft and the band is wide enough so it doesn't cut into the hips.<br />They also wash well and don't shrink in the dryer like some other name brands.<br />I'm planning to stick to this brand as my son grows."
5.0,"It really is a choker. A very pretty piece for a small neck. It fits, barely. The white shell is stunning and really pops next to the bronze. I now had to buy the matching bracelet."
5.0,I LOVE this small backpack that fits a lot!! I wish they had a nude/beige/light brown color since it seems to be the only one missing.
5.0,"Beautiful Tree of Life! Nice weight, not chincy."

5.0,"I absolutely love this bag. I use it five days a week and it still hasn't shown any wear. I bought this to replace two poor quality bags I had. It is huge. I can fit my lunch, shoes, work pants, kindle, book, tea thermos, a box of grahamn crackers, and still have room left over. I'm thinking of buying a spare one just to have on hand"
5.0,I love how this fits and looks. Very comfortable.  I love the color too.
5.0,"It's a good watch. Light and not too bulky. Mine did get a little scratch on the clasp though, and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to rough while wearing it, but I can't be sure. Still a nice watch."
5.0,Very nice! Love these sunglasses!🤠
5.0,"My wife loves these.  Bought Size 5 for her, and fits perfect.  Great buy, about (3) weeks for delivery from China.  Well made."
5.0,Cute for a dance performance. Fit my daughter perfectly. The quality was good too.
5.0,"This is nice and snug. I followed the size chart to order and what I received seemed appropriate. My son likes this fine for compression, but he’s ready to get it off at the end of the day. I like that this is discreet and can be worn under regular clothes. We used a vest in the past and there were too many layers, it crinkled when touched, so it was obvious he was wearing it."
5.0,runs big!! cute top
5.0,"Great fit, comfortable, very pleased.  Better than my experience with Jockey and other Hanes versions."
5.0,"I love everything by Joules, and this dress is no exception. Stylish, easy to wear, carefree casual outfit."

5.0,"Excelente calidad, muy caliente y elegante"
5.0,Love it! Really don't want to take it off! So plush and comfy!
5.0,"This looks great in the living room - subtle, sleek, and the mouse functions well on it. I'm redoing the living room to make it look more put-together and we keep our computer desk out there, so I needed something to protect the new desk that didn't look like it came from the early 1990's (namely a foamy floppy pad with some over-saturated image printed on it.) This is great!"
5.0,Love my soft pony pants.Fit perfect and totally comfy.
5.0,Got these for grandson for Christmas. He saw the package so he got them early. His old ones are so heavy but these are very light weight and he loves them. They fit perfectly.
5.0,"Although it is larger than expected (I should have read the description) it is very well made and attractive. Also, customer service is fantastic."
5.0,"I love this bracelet, you can really feel the energy in the beads. When used for prayer the beads are easy to handle as the transition from bead to bead is fluid.  It shipped quickly, and was packaged in a beautiful box."
5.0,"This prouct is excellent for extending the life of cork lined sandals( Mephisto, Birkenstock,etc). Follow instructions and the cork liner will last for a very long time.  A must for all cork lined sandals."
5.0,These are high quality pins great for gift giving!

5.0,"Perfect size and color, absolutely adorable. Loving it for summer!"
5.0,I am 5’4” and weigh 147lb with dds and a easily bloated belly i bought a large. it’s a great dress cute it make me look skinnier than I am because of where the band lays higher on my torso. I say A+ Very feminine. Someone said they needed a slip but I don’t think you do but that’s a preference right. Hope of you buy it you like it as much as I do.
5.0,Great work out pants.
5.0,This is just the perfect watch. It is a classic and it is cheap. The value you receive for your money is unbelievably high. The quality (beware of fakes) is outstanding.
5.0,"Just ordered more of these briefs. Thank gawd someone finally put out soft, pretty basic underwear with plenty of cotton and comfortable legs and waist. My only slight complaint would be wish these were all cotton, but really haven't notice anything but softness and comfort. Whoever designed these should get a raise. I'm in the process of ditching all the underwear that annoys me or cutting into cleaning rags, but these are keepers! IMO u could size up if u wanted with these and get away with it, thanks to a sensible design. But don't recall any fit issues. I just like to wear stuff loose."
5.0,"Great size - small when folded, but opens to a full size umbrella - it's heavy and sturdy and looks like it should last for a long time.  It was a gift for a very picky person and he loves it.  I can't speak to its longevity, but hopefully, it's built for the long haul.  Thank you.  Quality!"
5.0,Mom loves it. Seems like a nicely made item!

5.0,Good fit. Soft fabric.
5.0,Ordered by the size chart and still too small but such a lovely dress!
5.0,"More sheen than expected but looks good and fit is just right. I went up from my normal size because I wanted something extra loose for jogging/exercise and this does the trick. Nice faced colorful pull over that is warm and easy to wash. Looks good, nice length in both the arms and bottom hem. Ample space for moving around."
5.0,"Works well, display easy to read, buttons are great.<br />I don't like the side illumination..."
5.0,"I love these glasses. Perfectly oversized and they truly protect your eyes from the sun. I have Madewell sunglasses and they barely do anything compared to these, and they are a fraction of the cost! I dig the all black ones. Definitely worth it!"
5.0,"This dress fits my daughter perfectly! She loves the color,because we were worried it would be  dull. It has the  perfect shimer!!"
5.0,These are small but really cute!
5.0,These Pajamas are so soft & comfy! They are true to size & I will be ordering another set!
5.0,"The Amore Lace bra has become one of my favorite bras of all time. Not only does it fit like a dream, it gives ample support, and a lovely shape under clothing. Did I mention that it is also super sexy!? If you are large in the cups you know how hard it is to find a &#34;sexy bra&#34; that  also looks good under clothing, this one does not disappoint. I first bought this bra in the black and green, because that color was on sale, and I wanted to try it out. I was so impressed I bought it in the red and black, and now I want to collect the other colors too."
5.0,Well done. Beautifully packaged. Great products.
5.0,"Bought as an anniversary gift, my husband loved it! Nice detailed print on shirt!  Good quality!"

5.0,Good fit. Cute graphic.
5.0,"This is a really soft sweater, very happy with it, not too tight on the arms."
5.0,"I love these pants. Very comfortable. I'm a size 10/12 bottom depending on the brand. I ordered a Large and Extra Large, however the Large fit perfectly and the Extra Large was a little big.  I also like the cotton fabric. wish I had ordered two black because I do wear it often. I will order again if they restock."
5.0,"Love these because they are unique and flexible. They also are dark, which can be a nuisance in the car looking for things  in youe purse but if you are out in the sun all day these are great."
5.0,First pair of no show socks that purchased that stay on my heal. Will purchase more.
5.0,The originals we had were all stretched out so we looked and looked for the actual size that we had. This was it! Finally! Only wish we could get the stretchy ball piece without the other attachments. Oh well!
5.0,"Very warm hat, with fleece lining.  Love it."

5.0,"I had to go up 2 sizes, but the quality it great. My son loves them."
5.0,"The jewelry from this website is a lot of fun!  The pieces are bright and glitzy.  It doesn't pretend to be something it's not - it's obvious from the price that this is inexpensive costume jewelry, but it's very good quality for the price. And it's perfect for wearing when you just feel like loading on the glitz. I will definitely order again in the future."
5.0,The quality of the shirt is really nice! Ordered a size medium
5.0,I purchased this for my boyfriend who wears a lot of really nice dress shirts.  He loved this and thought it was one of the most thoughtful gifts ever:)
5.0,"I love the wallet, only complaint is that the color is much lighter than in the pictures."
5.0,"Can be used as a kilt pin, or as I did: to place on my shoulder with my Tartanista Women's Honour of Scotland Sash.  BIG piece.  Was honored to wear it."
5.0,"Took a bit of time to figure out how to attach and use it. Did not come with instructions but after messing with it, was easy to understand."
5.0,Cute scarf and it goes well with different outfits.
5.0,Have had so many compliments regarding these earrings. The size and weight are great.
5.0,Most comfortable sock I ever bought
5.0,Wonderful fit. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"I usually wear a 12/14 or L/Xl (189lbs)but I ordered a XXL because I was worried the material wasn’t stretchy. I got the dress and It was a loose on me but it was still really nice! I’m short 5’1 so I could not wear flats unless I hemmed the dress. With heels, the dress was still a tiny bit long but was still so pretty! Lots of compliments on the dress!!! For reference I think I’m an apple body and carry my weight in my belly. The dress in XXL gave me lots of room to eat and drink!"
5.0,This is a great dress. Love the fit and style.
5.0,My daughter moved up in ballet a level and now navy is required.  This came right away and is good quality.  Has been worn several times a week and washed.  No complaints.

5.0,The perfect bra to wear under see through clothing.

5.0,These suspenders are awesome!They are strong and sturdy.Just what I was looking for!!
5.0,"I absolutely love this nightie by Ekouaer!! The design is super cute and fun and SO VERY COMFY! Hands down one of my favorites of the many I have by this company!!! I am 5’5 and weigh around 145lbs, and a small is a perfect fit, not super big or slouchy and not too small or snug!!"
5.0,So cute! It fits perfectly. Material is of great quality as well.
5.0,"They aren't too thin and they're not too thick, perfect amount of fabric."
5.0,Super cute and trendy. Some of them have this kinda clear look to them that I love. Definitely worth the buy!
5.0,"Love my starfish toe ring! The delivery was quick too! I  had this toe ring in gold for ten years n wore it everyday, never took it off until I banged it on a door n it split in half. This new one is identical to my other one but in silver. I wear it all the time, never take it off. I live by the beach n am on it everyday so this toe ring is perfect"
5.0,"Super soft material and not clingy like most purchased online. It has a slight bagginess to it, which makes it even more comfortable. It's one of my favorite long sleeve shirts I own!"
5.0,"I've been on the search for large pearl earrings and stumbled upon these. They're perfect! The size is great, the coloring is beautiful and the backs they came with are perfect. I might even order a second pair as a back up since I'm so prone to losing earrings & these are exactly what I want in a large pearl earring and for the price it makes them even better. I definitely recommend these classic earrings."
5.0,Loves these
5.0,Love it!!!! So cute.
5.0,Bought first one for myself to take scuba classes my best friend thought it was adorable so I bought her one!
5.0,"This sports bra is good. Excellent stitching, double layer fabric, padded chest, minimal bouncing, flattering back design, snug fit, but the size ... oh the size... I'm 112 lb and 5'5"", and by all means I'm considered a US size S. I ordered a size M based on the size guide in the listing, and I still wish it'd give in a little more. It goes a little better without the padding. Trust the sizing guide recommendation.<br />I'm not taking away any stars because of sizing being inaccurate compared to standard conventions, as in their listing they clearly state their definition and measurements, but be really really careful."
5.0,My son's new favorite.
5.0,Great Brand.  Have similar item and runs same in size.
5.0,Trip to Edinburgh to perform in the Fringe Festival!<br />I bought them as a gift for our  traveling group. They love them.

5.0,A los niños les gusto mucho.
5.0,My piercing is relatively new so this was my first time shopping for studs.  I was not interested in spending a lot of money because I am still figuring out which style is going to work for me.<br /><br />These work very well.  Yes. I take it out to wash my face and when I put on my makeup... because it is so easy to put it back in.<br /><br />I went with the smaller size because it is dainty and I work in a professional office.
5.0,Really cute! A little bit see through but that is to be expected with the price.
5.0,"These arrived on time, in good packaging, and look exactly the same as they are advertised. They are good quality and have helped me tremendously on my long runs in the heat. They are so bright and fun and I just love them :)"
5.0,I’m usually between a small and a medium and the smalls were perfect. So stretchy and flattering. Squat proof for sure. You need these!!<br />I’m 5’5” and 145lbs
5.0,"I was looking for a basic navy hoodie but was unable to find what I was looking for at local brick and mortar stores.  Took a chance and was not disappointed.  The quality is fantastic for the price down to the YKK metal zippers.  As some reviewers noted, they do run a little large.  I am 5'10"" and usually wear a 42 size jacket.  Medium fit me perfectly."
5.0,"Love love love this bag! I use it to go out to the pool & at the beach! Very durable. The closer @ the top really helps out as well. The bag also looks good, and could probably be used as a tote to go anywhere in the summer!"

5.0,"I love these pj's! They fit well, and look very cute."
5.0,adorable! meets bb needs while looking stylish.
5.0,"I bought this for my graduation dress and loved it! It got a stain on it and it washed out, stays tied, the only thing I suggest is using fashion tape for the straps to keep them from sliding off. Over all 10/10"
5.0,Love it! Material is soft pockets are actually useful and it is easy to nurse while wearing!
5.0,This bracelet is really lovely - much prettier than expected. The beads are so smooth and the color of each is so nice. What a great surprise! Bought it for my 11 year old granddaughter who loves space. Highly recommend!
5.0,perfect for gym workouts.  Mesh material keeps you cool even with intense workout.
5.0,I thought my sperry shoelaces were the same length as these but they're a good inch or so shorter.
5.0,This suit is sexy looking. It fits tealky nice.
5.0,I’m 5’1 and 32 weeks pregnant and medium fits great for my height and I feel material is stretchable around my stomach. Good buy for my baby shower photography.

5.0,Love Love Love this clutch
5.0,Love these zip up jammies! Fitted but not to tight. Held up well after multiple washes and no shrinkage. Non-slips on the feet are a huge plus.
5.0,Nice display dome at a reasonable price.
5.0,"For anyone considering this adorable little dress......BUY IT!!!<br />This was a last minute birthday purchase for my 7 year old and not only did it fit perfect, it also arrived sooner than expected!<br />The fabric is not cheap at all! This is a dress my daughter will wear until it doesn't fit her anymore. lol<br />SUPER in love with it!!!"
5.0,"This little black dress is perfect for date night, dinner, going to the club or etc. It is both sexy and classy. I am a very petite woman and finding a dress that fits me like this one does, is really hard. I generally wear a size small 0/2 but they didn't have that size. I ordered a size small 4/6 after I saw that the measurements are appropriate for me in this size. The dress hugs my contours beautifully, without feeling tight or uncomfortably clingy. The material is very soft and at first glance you will notice that it appears to be see-through, with the 2-tone ridges. I thought that I would have to wear something underneath but surprisingly a black bra and panty keeps everything looking dark in those areas. I love how the back is designed with a low swoop, exposing most of the back and the rest of the back has a lace-up design. However, if you don't want your bra strap to show in the back; you can always wear a small tube-top like I did and it looks like part of the dress."
5.0,I love this skirt!! The weight is perfect for a cool fall day. Just ordered another one in a different color so I can have 2!!
5.0,My daughter loved it! The material is not terry and I wish it was!
5.0,"Very pleased with this purchase. Realistic enough without looking too fake, in both size and brilliance."
5.0,These are the perfect shorts
5.0,"As beautiful as I hoped it would be. Came with the chain and a black cord, which is what I have been wearing it with. I've gotten several compliments on it. Would buy from this seller again."
5.0,"Super cute. Was nervous to buy because, it doesn’t flatter this model .. but it’s adorable. Can’t wait to wear once it gets colder."
5.0,"It’s is comfortable, stretchy, beautiful and a great price"
5.0,Super cute and comfy dress! I wear it almost every other week - it’s so versatile. I’ve worn it with converse and wedges depending on my plans. The pleating and pockets are a win as well!
5.0,"Holy moly. If you ever buy any dress from Amazon, buy this one. The material is thick, has all over excellent stretch, and fits true to size (if between sizes, size down). It’s super comfortable and so flattering! I am 5’4” and the slit adds a little sexy without being scandalous. The neckline is not plunging and I am a 38D...so overall alluring without being skimpy. Very classy.<br />Bonus, flip the straps up and it looks excellent as a not off the shoulder style too!"
5.0,I love this. It was suppose to be 6 pair i only got 5 but still for the price they are really good
5.0,"Touch screen fingertip does not work. Other than that, nice warm gloves when I’m riding. Still 5 stars."
5.0,Misinformation ? Necessary and effective . HOOAHH . Try for a softer material next time . haha
5.0,"Bought 3 for my daughters & granddaughter,  was very pleased.  They all loved them."
5.0,Cute shoes. Exactly what I was looking for!

5.0,"I have this purse in black, and I love it.<br />I bought it as a travel purse for the airport because the convenience of the outer pockets, and I have used it ever since.<br />No one can believe how inexpensive it is.<br />Great quality."
5.0,I have had it on every day at work under my boy cloths. It feels amazing. Now I am going to have to buy some new panties to go with it.
5.0,"Good price, nice coverage!"
5.0,Super cute and great material!! But unfortunately they didn’t sell it in size XS which would’ve been perfect. Bought a S. I’m very glad it has a belt. Perfect for people who like flowy dresses/clothes.
5.0,I have never bought clothes online out of fear they would not fit and then the hassle of returning but due to Covid I took a chance. This gamble paid off. I love these pants. They fit great. I love the feel of the fabric and BONUS I didn’t pay attention that they were elastic instead of having a zipper.
5.0,Great Quality. Made a cute gift idea!!
5.0,"Just got my pants! Im 5'5 and 130 pounds and ordered the medium in magenta.They fit perfectly! Not too tight, not too loose. The color is bright, but lovely. They were packaged appropriately and arrived as promised, within two days with my prime. Overall, very satisfied!"
5.0,Love the color and add so soft
5.0,If you get sweaty and are active this bra will start to itch around the banding if you have sensitive skin. Other than that no complaints from a 40e cup

5.0,"I have ordered four or five suits from CUPSHE so far and they have all been exactly as described and adorable. The material is good quality and they have held up for quite awhile now. I love the cut of this suit as well the high neck style is super trendy, the top is also padded but not crazily and actually makes my chest look bigger than it really is (i'm a 34A). The bottom is slightly cheeky and very flattering. As far as size I am 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs. and ordered a Small."
5.0,Good quality and looked as pictured. My daughter used them for a Cinderella Halloween costume. She was 3.5 years old and these were a bit large on her as we expected they would be. They would be perfect for 5 year old I'm guessing. She loves them and will get a few years out of them for dress up!
5.0,Fits and looks exactly as expected. Does its job well! ;)
5.0,Great case for the price! It looks nicer than what I payed for it. I gave it as a gift and they started using it a month ago (for every day use) and it's still in perfect condition.
5.0,I recently had cataract surgery on both eyes so my vision was greatly improved. I needed the glasses to read small print plus the top of the glasses were clear and become tinted in the sun. A great pair of glasses. Enjoying them very much.
5.0,This is the most beautiful evening bag I have ever seen! I absolutely love it!<br />The workmanship and materials are the finest.

5.0,I love my new evil eye lanyard. I purchased it to hold my casino membership card. It makes me feel lucky! No bad karma when it is in hand.
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01DQCGEIA Minkang Fashion Jewelry 925 Solid Silver Chain Bracelet]]<br /><br />I was skeptical that a $20 bracelet could be much good, but I love it. I wanted something that I could put on and leave on. I have -- I play tennis in it, shower with it, garden with it...never take it off. So far, it's taking a beating and still looks lovely. It's hard to tell in the picture, but the triple links move, sparkle, and add unique texture. The clasp is extremely secure, too. All in all, a great value.The bracelet is pretty and dainty; but very well made. I don't purchase a whole lot of jewelry because I am tough on it. I do not change jewelry for every outfit. If I like, I where it day in and day out.<br />I must say I was very cautious, especially after reading so many warning reviews about being cheaply made. Honestly, it does feel very light on your hand for silver, but it looks and feels great! It is not too shiny and very comfortable.This is a piece of jewelry that I feel I can dress up or down. It is nice enough to wear on special occasions, but simple enough for everyday use. It is also nice and light. I have showered in this bracelet and experienced no tarnishing or anything. My skin reacts well to this product as well. I generally have to be careful when wearing jewelry that isn’t solid. This is well-made and I have no reaction.<br /><br />I recommend this product and other products They care about quality.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price an exchange for my honest review"
5.0,my wife really likes them!
5.0,I really like the way these pants fit. I followed the advice from the other reviewers and sized up. I usually wear a M in pants so I ordered an XL and it fit perfect! I wasn’t too interested in using the jacket but that also fit well. It feels like the old school windbreaker we wore back in the day. Very thin which is great for summer wear when you want your legs covered. The colors were also very bright and vibrant which I loved.
5.0,This is a Christmas present so I can't truly evaluate it yet.  She has not had it in the water.  Compared to other I have purchased this seems to be of good quality and I would purchase it again.
5.0,Bought this for my daughters as a Christmas gift and it’s so pretty and dainty. They have been wearing it since and have not seen it tarnish. Excellent buy!
5.0,Went with my normal size 10 and fit as expected in the foot area. A little snug with thick winter socks but good overall. I am glad I didn't go a size down as others suggested. Have been stomping around in the rain for the past few weeks and they are keeping me dry and nice and comfy. Hopefully they last a while. Seems to be decent quality. Design is super cute too. Love wearing them with black leggings or skinny jeans. Only complaint is that the calf section is a bit wide and bulges out this is a minor thing and they still look cute overall.
5.0,"Love  my  colorful  squares, perfect  for the  best dress man."
5.0,Good for cleaning & polishing any kind of jewelry.
5.0,These are so awesome. I bought them for watershed country music festival last year and they work very well and I got a lot of compliments on them.
5.0,Well made and extremely comfortable.
5.0,"Had one previously and enjoyed it for several years.  Plan to do same with this one.  Leather feels good, looks good, and holds up."
5.0,What fun patterns. Fast shipping. Very pleased with socks. The size 9-11 fit my 7 1/2  lady's foot .
5.0,Thé pants are super cute and good quality fabric but I had to return them as they are too small for my daughter.  I should have ordered a size up.
5.0,"Although I had to return it and receive my refund due to it not completely fitting my watch, the quality of the watch strap was great. Was not stiff rather it was flexible. Overall, the watch strap was high in quality and will recommend this product, if it will fit your watch."
5.0,I have NEVER experienced what the other reviews say about the band coming undone at random. I’m active duty Army and wear this every single day. It never comes undone. I’d buy another but this one will last longer than the watch itself. Buy it.
5.0,"Great support for running but not nearly as expensive as a Nike jogging bra.<br />Anyone can run, but as with anything in life, you need the right bra and the right shoes!<br /><br />This bra does what it needs to do.  I am really rather well endowed and it was seriously a huge reason for me to avoid running.  Finding a bra that was supportive without making it hard to breathe was really not an easy task at first.  Then, I discovered Nike Compression bras, but they were $30.00 or more per each one.  When you are running every day the last thing you want to do is wash your bra after every run.  But that's awfully expensive for an item of clothing you wear an hour a day and only to sweat in!  This bra is the same quality and support and about half the price."
5.0,"A very beautiful gift for a dance lover friend,  highly recommended."
5.0,Good front pocket Tavel wallet..
5.0,Fast quick delivery! Great product
5.0,"The Orchid Row Reversible satin and chiffon wrap is perfect for an evening to dress up your outfit. The satin side is shiny and the chiffon side is matte. It is long and it is generous in the amount of fabric used. This is a one size and smaller women may find that it swallows them up. You can style the wrap as you would a scarf. It has many options on how you choose to wear the wrap. For me, it is great over my shoulders. The wrap is made of 100% polyester and can be machine washed, hang to dry and then use a low iron."
5.0,"I don't know what kind of sick monster could say anything bad about a Poison t-shirt.  It's for sure not me.  I bought this to wear to a Steel Panther show in Orlando, but I have worn it out since then.  It feels, right."
5.0,Very good quality and the mock turtle neck is perfect fit.
5.0,"Super cute, slimming because it’s longer"
5.0,Excellent quality.  The GR-15 fit me well.  I normally wear a U.S. large.
5.0,My husband loves this. All the guys at his office have one.
5.0,dobre
5.0,"The photo does this no justice, it's nice and shiny and heavy! Definitely an awesome piece to rep being a 5 percenter!"
5.0,"Nearly 5 months preggo, I ordered a large and it fits nicely up top with looseness over belly and hips. I'm 5'3&#34; and the length is perfect! Love this dress! No layering pieces needed. Yay!"
5.0,I've been doing quite a bit more traveling lately and decided it was finally time to protect my most valuable asset overseas. This passport cover is great quality. The embossing was well done and it works for exactly what I needed it for. Already taken it through three countries.
5.0,"Arrived quickly, stylish and love the color!!!!"
5.0,"The bracelet is simply beautiful. With a stretching band woven through the beads the bracelet fits my wrist (something you will appreciate if you have smaller wrist). It's presented to the buyer as it appears in the picture. The bracelet even came with a colorful tassel, a nice touch."
5.0,"It is stunning.  Fits perfect.  Lays on shoulders, arms, and hips perfectly.  Color is true and so pretty"
5.0,This is stylish and provides comfort for kids.

5.0,"Fits well, love the colors and designs. I bought it specifically for work and it serves its purpose. Thanks"
5.0,Love them and size is perfect! It feels like a second skin
5.0,I could not ask for better.
5.0,I really enjoy this top. It is very nice looking.
5.0,I like this dress I have bought two it’s a dress you can wear all year long and it has a nice variety of colors. Good quality material at the same time it’s light and breathable. Colors are vibrant and pockets add a nice touch. Will purchase more
5.0,"At first I didn't think they were going to fit right, but they actually fit amazingly! My husband was VERY pleased to see me in these!"
5.0,"Very nice dress but I was looking for something more casual and it appeared to be casual from the picture but when I received it, it appeared more dressy  ie church/office dress. It looked good on."
5.0,Ordered the coral color. Flattering but still loose enough to not be skin tight. Get lots of compliments on it.
5.0,I am 6 months pregnant and this is a good fit for office work.
5.0,The color is just like the picture and it’s very comfortable.
5.0,just what i was expecting!
5.0,I have ordered 2 of these dresses.  One in black and then other in blue.  I usually wear a medium depending on style of the clothes.  This dress fits amazing! Delivery was great as well. I highly recommend this dress. I am abour 140 and roughly 5'4. Slightly bigger bust and a medium fits perfect!
5.0,"Let me just say that there is nothing I DON'T like about these pants - I have ordered several different colors. I had ordered a pair in black a year or two ago and receive compliments all the time. It's almost as good as wearing leggings or sweatpants to work. Now with that being said, they are definitely on the form-fitting side so if you are between sizes or like a looser fit, I would go with the larger size.  But they look very professional and the bottom cuff is moderately loose and ankle length so they aren't mistaken for leggings which are skin tight at the ankles. And they actually have POCKETS, unlike a lot of the dress pants I have.  I have a black cloth-like belt that came with another pair of dress pants (like a belt that might come with a dress to tie around the waist, not an actual belt), so sometimes I tie it around the waist-band of these pants, for looks, not for tightening, and it's super cute!"
5.0,These are super cute! I wear them all the time at work and my coworkers always compliment them!
5.0,It’s very nice not too big. My daughter loved it
5.0,I bought these for my daughter. She loves everything red and sparkly so these were PERFECT. She wears a size 12 girl’s shoe and the xs size fit like a glove. Thanks for the super fast shipping (and for being the only seller with red rhinestone undeez!)
5.0,The outfit fit perfectly for my toddler.
5.0,My son loves these and they fit perfectly
5.0,"Really like these, good variety, no issues with allergies yet"
5.0,Ordered one size up And fits perfectly with just enough room to grow a bit more. Soft and beautiful quality! I’m impressed for a coat under $20!
5.0,Love them! Nice & comfy. No problems with order at all.
5.0,nice and small
5.0,Very warm! They do run small though!
5.0,Love! Exactly like the picture!

5.0,"cute earing, perfect for the wedding outfit.  Light and fun"
5.0,great suit! Bottoms are a bit small but wearable.
5.0,Nice headbands.  I have a couple in different several designs/colors.  I like the fit.
5.0,My son calls masks like this hacker masks from the Youtube shows he watches. I have bought many of these in many colors but this is the first set that lights up.
5.0,"Very nice, would be even nicer if Stanford would have won this game...."
5.0,I love this poncho!  It is perfect for cool fall weather.  It runs true to size so do not expect it to be large and frumpy just because it's a poncho.  I want one in every color now.
5.0,"I have to say I was sceptical, but the price was so good I gave them a try, very nice and in the past few weeks I have worn a few pairs and they do not bother my ears, which are usually sensitive"
5.0,"The material from which these PJs are made is extremely soft with a plush feel that is like the ""brushed jersey""  PJs that I used to buy 30 years ago and which I have not seen for many years.  They are warm in the ""just right"" category and the length of the pants  is also just right. The sleeves are a bit long but that is nice too, keeps the hands warm if they are outside the covers.<br />The top and pants might be a bit short for a tall person but still, they are so comfortable and cozy, we could put up with that."
5.0,Great quality and affordable
5.0,Easy to install...  easy to adjust...  looks like it belongs  on the watch.
5.0,Love these socks. Easy to get on and off. Snug fit.
5.0,my favorite driving glasses. these are extra large which is exactly what i wanted .

5.0,Elegant & Practical.
5.0,Pleasantly surprised with relatively small size but larger enough to carry my iPad
5.0,Absolutely LOVE it...Perfect little summer bag.
5.0,I got a medium for my 7 year old. It’s a little big for him but that is ok. Rather too big than too small. Color looks great even after a few washes.
5.0,Totally what I believe in and what I needed.
5.0,I love this top.  I get so many compliments!
5.0,Love these keychains!!!
5.0,Five star considering the price. I have a big ass head and they fit great. They are not $100 glasses so don’t be to rough with them. I didn’t buy these to wear glasses under them so I can’t comment on that
5.0,"This hat fits exactly as you'd expect it to, and it looks awesome! Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some throwback gear."
5.0,My husband looks fantastic in his Halloween costume!! I can’t wait to show everyone our family costumes this year!!
5.0,"This is at least my fifth pair since I am known for losing or breaking my glasses. What I love about these glasses besides them providing great protection, is they do not leave marks around my nose! Will but again I’m sure!"
5.0,Worth the money! Just buy it!
5.0,"excellent quality, very reasonable priced."
5.0,Perfect for cold rainy weather!
5.0,"These are easy to store on a keychain so you have a screwdriver handy when you aren't at home, but you need it!"
5.0,"Wow. This skirt is just wow !! I'm 5'7&#34; and after reading the reviews I ordered an XXL and its just perfect fit. Not very snug on the waist, the length is great for me and its so flowy and beautiful. Wore it at a birthday party and got so many compliments."
5.0,Absolutely love these sandals! I posted them to my Facebook page and everyone wanted to know where I got them. Many of my friends and my sister now have these sandals too!
5.0,THIS HAT IS PERFECT! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT!
5.0,"Love this bracelet. It's very delicate, but is very durable and looks beautiful. I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas and she's been wearing it ever since! I love how the thin strands makes the silver extremely bright and shiny."
5.0,"These boots are exactly what I was looking for: waterproof, comfortable, easy on and off, easy to clean. True to size."
5.0,"Flattering, warm and great color.  I can't believe I got this for 12 dollars.  It is great."
5.0,"This dress was to have been my ""go to"" this spring (in hopes that some places to ""go to"" open up!) but neither the color nor fit worked for me.  The rayon fabric provides a classy look, while the design works for casual events. Rayon does wrinkle, so it might not be the best travel or backpack choice.  The burgundy(a favorite color for me) is closer to a wine color; i.e. is not a cool tone but warm and works better on a redhead or many blonds with warm skin tones.  The waist hit me in an awkward place, neither empire nor standard.  At 5'5"", 175, I am high waisted but have long legs--the skirt just touched my knees (my pant length is usually 32""). I purchased a size L and it was ampIe for 36DD/38D.  I did return it however.  Hope this helps."
5.0,"Comfy, well-priced, nice color, what more could you ask?  wish I had one for every day of the week!!!  easy care, nice to ride in and just run errands in!!!"
5.0,Very nice necklace and I loved the sentiment. I sent this to my mother in law recently for her birthday and she didn't even thank me....but I honestly don't blame the necklace... she is obviously having some issues. I'm sure if you sent it to your mother in law she would love it....the issue I had is definitely my mother in law....just saying..
5.0,"I ordered size 8 (I'm 7 1/2) since the reviews were saying it runs small, but it wasn't the case. Anyways, nothing like a bulky par of socks couldn't fix. Love the lights!. I just walked around house, so, can't make a comment about a regular use. But, I will make an update is necessary."
5.0,Love the look and the fit!!
5.0,"I ordered this to wear to a tea party and it received many compliments. It fit true to size and has some stretch to it. I wore with a petticoat to add fullness to the skirt and it was the perfect finishing touch. It arrived fairly wrinkled but I ironed it on the lowest steam setting and it came out great. The lining is a light gray light-weight jersey materiel which also needed ironing and the hem has something to stiffen itwhich helps it hold its poofy shape. It did arrive a little creased but, again, ironing it fixed that too. The dress zips up the back and has two buttons at the back of the neck. The buttons need to be reinforced and are difficult to button/unbutton. I only did one of them as I was wearing a big floppy hat for the tea party and it covered it but even to get that one button done I had to ask two different people before one managed to finally get it fastened.<br /><br />I would buy from this brand again as I can trust the fit and quality. Highly recommend it."
5.0,They are still bigger than me! But I still like the color!
5.0,"At first i was worried that this was going to be too small as I did order my usual size (large, i'm 5'2 175). It looked very small when i took it out of the packaging but actually stretched very well and is surprisingly not see through! It's very comfortable and not to mention very flattering. I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,Beautiful! Exactly what I wanted...worth the money.
5.0,Very nice bracelets. They look small but they bend out easily to get on wrist. They come individually packaged in a velvet bag. I ordered these for my bridesmaids in my upcoming wedding and I'm sure they'll love them.
5.0,perfect for the tanning bed if you dont want tan lines! Fits great
5.0,Beautiful.  Love this saying
5.0,I wear anywhere between a 10 to 11 US and the Large size for these socks fit perfectly. I work on my feet 12 hours a day everyday and these hold up great while still remaining comfortable.
5.0,"Finally, a high-waisted short for ladies with a high waist!! They actually fit without highlighting the mom tummy or pulling too tight in the crotch. They are a bit baggy in the crotch area, but not in a bad way."
5.0,I've been using sport watches for years and wanted something different.  This fits the bill.  Thank you...
5.0,"I love this dress!! I’m 5’2 112lbs and xs fits perfect. Versatile, wore it to a wedding and to work. Extremely comfortable and love the pockets! My coworker and I call it my pj dress where it’s so comfy."
5.0,Definitely worth the wait!!  Made from great material and exactly what I was expecting.
5.0,wanted my family crest for my ruana and this is perfect.
5.0,"Great Product that is amazingly compact,"
5.0,Very comfortable gym shorts. Decent. Love PUMA
5.0,I was worried as I have a nickel allergy and you never know with cheaper jewelry what might flare up. I wore these for a week straight and had no issues.
5.0,"It’s not as thick as I thought it would be,  which to my suprise made it nice, I barley notice it on my waist. Looks great, I wear it everyday for work holds up to the job of a Firemen."
5.0,"fits great! I bought a large size and its just a tiny bit bigger than i expected, but thats how I like my jackets! I havent used it in the rain yet (but i will tomorrow) so i hope this does justice! this review is for the fitting and feeling alone."
5.0,"I'm a size 9.5 to 10 shoe size but I ordered the mediums which are a 7/8 and they fit perfectly, i can even wear a thucker sock and not feel uncomfortable.  They are so soft and plush feeling I love them."
5.0,An excellent option for pregnancy finger swelling.
5.0,great pants I like how it fits
5.0,Materialis kinda heavy but fresh
5.0,Love it!! Mines starting to get worn out for having it so long. Once it goes completely worn out I'll buy another one.
5.0,"Love, tons of compliments. Classy, non tiring"
5.0,This stiletto is so handy. I use it all the time for keeping my fabric where I want it and my fingers away from the needle.
5.0,Looks just like picture!!!! Fits in all the right places If your top heavy I wouldn't suggest this out fit I barely made it at size 38DD
5.0,Very nice...very happy
5.0,"Absolutely love this, always gets compliments whenever I wear it"
5.0,So soft and fun!
5.0,"I Love Pretty Jewelry and this Wide Open End Silver Cuff Bracelet is Extremely Feminine and Beautiful!<br />The Filigree Vine Pattern is Perfectly Detailed and would be a a very nice accent piece for both day and nighttime wear.<br />It's made of heavy duty metal alloy and will hold up well to any adjustments made when putting it on and taking it off again.<br />My wrist is only 6&#34; in circumference and this 1 1/2&#34; wide  x 7 1/4&#34; (with ends touching) Silvertone Cuff Bracelet is loose enough on me that it moves around freely on my forearm.<br />For me that is really not an issue, as I planned to gift it to my son's girlfriend who's wrist is a bit larger than mine.<br />It would definitively fit an 8&#34; or larger wrist comfortably.<br />The Etched Detail of the Outer Edges and Center Strip are a wonderful accent to the Slightly Raised Silver Vines that grace the top and bottom bands.<br />Both the outer and inner sides of the entire cuff are Silvertone in color, but the way the Vines are slightly raised give this Cuff an Antiqued appearance.<br />Smitco LLC packages this Wide Open End Silver Cuff in a nice gift box that is sealed with a thank you sticker on the top of the box. They even wrap the cuff in tissue paper and set it on a bed of cotton batting so it won't get damaged in transit.<br />I received this bracelet at a discount in exchange for testing and review and I am giving it a Very High Recommendation!"
5.0,I really liked how well they suctioned on my eyes.  They very clear and seeing underwater was awesome. They were also very good at being adjustable plus they didn’t pull my hair. The nose and ear piece was so added bonus.
5.0,Great solid bars to use with Nato watch bands.
5.0,"These fit well, and look nice in my ears"
5.0,Quality product.  I will order more in future.
5.0,Such a great piece for the money! So many compliments but really what I loved was that it works with many of the clothes I already have.
5.0,I can’t believe how flattering this dress is!! I gained some weight recently and I’ve been really self-conscious but this dress hides it all. I can’t believe it was so cheap.
5.0,I love this dress. It washes up nicely and fits comfortably.
5.0,"I bought the thongs from this same brand and love them. These are a little bigger than I anticipated though. I bought what is my usual size is many brands (M) and probably should have gone with the small. I’m pregnant right now so I decided to keep them and feel like I’ll be grateful for the extra room, but my advice would be to size down one. I love them though, and will probably order the smalls in the future. Very comfortable!"
5.0,This top is so comfortable.  The fabric is so soft and it fits well.  It is moisture wicking which is great on hot days. The length is good too.  I ordered the grey plaid but will be ordering it in other colors.
5.0,Really what I wanted.
5.0,Great color and comfort
5.0,nice my mother loves them
5.0,I wear my ring everyday it has my daughters name and birthstone on it
5.0,I love the tote.  It's everything I was looking for in a bag. I must have looked at over 1000 before I found this one.
5.0,I really love this retro sharks logo.. that must be made out of polyester or something because it’s so hot on my head and naturally run hot and difficult for me to wear this hat. Thinking of wearing a snow hat? Purchase this.
5.0,Great quality and fit for my daughter’s full figure.  I got these to go with a pink rash guard and they look great together as a stylish alternative to a one piece.
5.0,Very cute! Little smaller than expected but it makes sense for the price.
5.0,"Fit great, comfortable material"
5.0,"Loved this dress!! My daughter wore it for a red-carpet themed father/daughter dance. The dress was perfect! Flowed beautifully, pretty pink color, nice detail at neckline (not cheap looking) and very classy!!"
5.0,Perfect for Arizona winter
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. Super comfy. She enjoys just lounging around in it.
5.0,"I bought the black, sz 12, fits perfectly, I'm about 155 lbs with a middle age tummy.  Can wear as a casual dress, beach cover up, or sleep in it.  It is a soft cotton, not thick or thin, just the right weight, and not clingy.  I'm 5' 2"" and it's knee length.  The neckline is a little high but better than too low.  I wish there were more color choices.  I'm going to buy another one because it's so hard to find 100% cotton tshirt dresses that aren't clingy jersey knit.  Perfect for hot summer days and nights in So Cal."
5.0,"I ordered the black and gold flower skirt. It is exactly what I was hoping to receive. I purchased this for my first trip to Italy, so I have very high hopes for elegance and quality. The gold threading is so beautiful, multilayered, and textured. The material is sturdy yet still not heavy. I’m thrilled. This skirt was 1/3 the price of the design I was inspired by in an ad. Love it."
5.0,"Loved the fit. Very comfy, not too cheeky"
5.0,My husband thought they worked great. Very comfortable and easy to put on.

5.0,Good eye catching suspenders for wedding reception.
5.0,Love it!! So froggen cute
5.0,I love my new watch bands for my smart watch.
5.0,"Great earring for my 7 year old. They are very cute, so she loves them, but more importantly she has sensitive ears and these do not bother them at all. Thank you!"
5.0,Works well in snow season. Quality of hat is great as per the price.
5.0,"This is without a doubt the most beautiful watch that I have ever owned.  Every time I check the time, I am impressed with it's beauty.  This watch would make a knockout gift."
5.0,The ring is real nice. Thanks

5.0,These fit great!  I am NOT thin either.  Very sexy!
5.0,"Although it didn't come with a tag to tell which way to wear it wasn't hard to figure it out. Others complained that it wasn't long enough, I am 5'6&#34; and have a big butt but it fit me great. Hit right below my butt and I didn't feel it necessary to wear anything else under it. Felt great and looked great also."
5.0,I love this comfortable shoe.  They run a tad small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger.  I usually wear and 8 1/2 so I bought a size 9.  They fit great and I can wear them all day.  I usually wear flats and wanted a shoe to wear with a skirt or dress.  These are perfect for summer dresses...So happy to get them at a great price compared to the department store where I first tried them on....Very happy with my purchase and fast service.
5.0,Great model and nice materials.
5.0,These earrings are so dang cute! They are not heavy on the ears at all. Love them!!

5.0,Quality guages
5.0,Nice heavy material. Good long chain. My teen daughter loves it.
5.0,"I own 3 of these. I'm 5'1&#34; and 140lbs. I ordered a medium first. It was a little big but it shrank a little in the washer. The second time I ordered a small and I'm happy with the fit. These cardigans are decent quality. I'm happy with my purchase. I bought the Olive, Dark teal, and rust colors. All colors were pretty true to how they were pictured.

5.0,"Delivery was fast, and the luggage arrived in perfect condition. It appears to be well made for the price paid. The wheels work nicely and look to be very durable. Have not traveled with it yet but will be using it on a long road trip later this week. The zippers also look to be sturdy as well as the telescoping handle. I hope to get many years use of this luggage."

5.0,Beautiful. My daughter loves them.
5.0,"These boots fit perfectly and look great! I'm well beyond happy with them! A tip if you're ordering them, though: Production and shipping took a month, so order well in advance if you need them by a certain date. I couldn't he happier with the end result."
5.0,This was the perfect belly ring for my new piercing. It’s high quality and beautiful. Plenty of room for swelling and easy to clean around with the extra length. If you’re looking for outside of average belly ring lengths these are perfect. I seriously recommend.
5.0,I'm very short and chubby.  These are THE best pants ever.  They're comfortable and great length.  I want more.
5.0,"The pocket book is nice and roomy -- quite large, but that is what I wanted.  I think it is a nice looking bag and reasonably well put together,<br />although the zipper on the outside broke after about six months.  But for the price, I bought another one."
5.0,"I loved using my glasses! I was at Manasota Key Beach for 5 weeks! I picked up a TON of rocks. When I got my glasses, no more rocks! I found over 3,000 teeth and barbs! I had my dream come true. I found a Megalodon!!! What the glasses did for me? They ""changed"" the color of the sand so I could see teeth better!<br />shark teeth"
5.0,Live in these! They are a great material with ZERO tear after many times of wearing and washing. They are comfy enough to be pjs. They also look decent and classy and can be worn as casual wear. They are not too baggy to look frumpy. Very versatile and ABSOLUTELY essential. I would like to purchase another one.
5.0,Great gift. My wife loves them.
5.0,Great bag and the price is not too high. Live it
5.0,"Best bra I have ever owned!!! Fits perfect, very sexy but modest and comfortable, and looks awesome! Has a nice push up effect surprisingly, it didn’t look like it would but makes everything push together quite nicely!"
5.0,"This is a great, flashy, well made apple watch band with a functioning clasp, apparent durability, and clean cut look. For the price, recommend for sure!"
5.0,My granddaughter loves these!  Comfortable and stylish.
5.0,I'm so glad I added these to my collection. They're well made and the perfect size (not to big or small). The colors are vivid and add a nice pop. Look forward to wearing these with both outfits and on my coats/jackets.
5.0,"This is 3 bottles of stain protector. The same stuff that you get at the store for 3x as much. Worked well, no complaints. I was able to spray and protect all of my winter boots and my husbands, we have a lot of shoes too."
5.0,"Wow! Pretty & versatile, surprisingly nice quality for the price. There are a couple pair of duplicates, but can always be used as gifts. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"Very comfortable,  love that it's adjustable."

5.0,Very cute and durable. Would recommend and buy again
5.0,"It took awhile to get and it finally came. The packaging want what was expected, rather it was a blue box that had been smashed. That's not what really matters though. Is it? The piece fits snugly but lose. My wrist is 7&#34; My beads are starting to fade just a bit but the leather and latch are still in tact and my wrist isn't green. I'm a CNA and I've been wearing it since I've gotten it and considering the abuse and water treatments it's upheld I'm giving this a 10/10<br /><br />Is this product hand made? It's beautiful. Thank you."
5.0,Excellent. Better than I thought
5.0,They are  not so large the petite size fits me well.<br />The lenses or just right not to dark.
5.0,My son bought this robe for me so I thought it would be best if I wrote the review. This robe is so pretty. It's very warm and cozy. I read in some reviews that they had a problem with the robe not staying closed at the bottom but mine doesn't do that. I've never had a robe with a hood before and now I'll never have one without it. It's great. Definately reccomend.. 5 star robe
5.0,Size was perfect. Engraving was perfect. The pic was so clear. Love this!
5.0,"These are so soft and comfortable, Love it!"
5.0,I love these earrings. They're very cute and classy. They seems to be fragile. But they've held up so far.
5.0,"Needed a dress for a funeral, almost last mi Ute, and this was perfect.  Fit exactly as the photo.  Length was perfect"
5.0,"Nice sunglasses with a comfortable level of tint. The arms are made of metal with plastic on the ends near the ear to balance comfort and sturdiness, and the design of the glasses themselves is nice."
5.0,These work great and they are not as expensive as the ones that say Martin on them.
5.0,Wonderful product! I am 5'8&#34; and medium frame. I usually wear medium but the reviews were correct on going up a size. Lovely quality and very slimming! I now own several in different colors and 2 in one color I really love!
5.0,"I bought this in khaki, and I love it. It looked like it would be a bit too big before I tried it on, but it actually hangs perfectly. The khaki is a tiny bit see-through, (a lot less see through though than I expected) but if you wear a light colored bra under it, no one will be able to see it. I definitely will consider buying it again in mint. I haven't washed it yet, but I will edit my review if anything disastrous occurs after washing."
5.0,"My little girl wears a 7.5, she loves them and said they fit good. I wear a size 8 and they also fit me perfect. I ordered size 7.5 so order half a size down for adults or regular size for children so they have room to grow."
5.0,"First time purchasing clothes for myself on Amazon. I thought the dress is amazing, a thicker fabric and it comes with pockets. It fit my bust well and flared out. Very flattering, worn once and got many compliments."
5.0,Love this!! I thought it might be too small but it's not! :)
5.0,In Love with the necklace
5.0,Soft and comfy.  Cool for summer.  Nice color
5.0,Loved it. Nice and comfortable.
5.0,I freaking love them! They're so perfect for casual or fancy. The chain dangle makes them impossible to be pushed out accidentally and even when they get caught in my hair they don't come out! I love love love them
5.0,Love these. Very comfortable!
5.0,"I'm so picky on leggings  and was so hesitant of buying online.  I ordered these based on the reviews and I do have a pair of leggings from this brand but a different kind and I really do like them.  I got these and I wasn't expecting them to be anything amazing  but oh man! I freaking love them. They don't move through my workout. They hide a lot of imperfections ( hallelujah),  and they're not see-through!!  Literally all of my leggings are see-through...specially since I do a lot of squats at the gym.  I have namebrand leggings that are supposed to be no show and it still shows but these did not! They made it through a leg day with no issues. I want them in every color!  For reference I'm 5'6, 130lbs (mostly in my thigh/butt area) and I ordered a small because I like mine thight"
5.0,It’s a wonderful material. My baby is 13lbs and 4.5 months so it was a bit big but not by much. The hood is great. You can flip the bill up which was good because it was big on her head but I liked it much better than putting on a whole different hat.
5.0,Nice dress!!!<br />I bought it for my sister and she really likes it.<br />True to size my sister is 149lbs and the medium fits her.
5.0,Matches my purse. the red is a little off
5.0,Great Pair I ever bought looks amazing; however is somewhat flat but you can add soles with gel patter and its a great look.
5.0,"I love Skechers anyway so this was not a hard choice.<br />However I went to the local store and tried them on to see exactly what size I needed for the walking shoe and these flip flops.<br />I have a wide foot , sometimes take a 9.5 or a 10. They fit perfectly. Very comfortable and love the little bling on the strap,<br />I am very pleased with all the skechers bought here.<br />I do recommend you try them on in a store first to work out your size. If a half size go up.<br />You wont regret this purchase. Great flip flop. Wear with capris, long skirt or dress pants."
5.0,"I just received my watch. It was easy enough to program, is comfortable on my wrist, and looks simple, yet Functional.<br />I work with small children, and needed a simple watch that could withstand everyday wear and tear. This watch was very inexpensive. My parents owned the same watch when they were young, and had nothing but good things to say about it. For the price, I am happy to buy another should the battery give out."
5.0,"Just received this today and I must say it’s gorgeous. I expected it to be a small beaded bracelet, but it’s huge, thick and pretty (just like me 🙂). I wore it this evening and received loads of compliments. Thinking about ordering another."
5.0,"Beautiful dress I wore it Easter Sunday, it fits like a glove, material is nice quality."
5.0,Not long after these arrived we had our first snow of the season. So glad I had warm boots to wear.  I normally wear 8.5 so I ordered a 9.<br />There is thick insulation in the boot that makes it a tad cramped but I think they still fit fine.  If you wear an in between size order up to the next size.
5.0,Key chains very useful if you want to attach frequently used keys to your bag or belt loop. They have a nice sturdy stretch to them and don 't break. Good product.
5.0,Very comfortable helps me when working
5.0,My son wears this watch every day. Never takes it off. He loves it. I love that it wakes him up for school!
5.0,My wife loved this gift !Thanks for the care in wrapping it and packing
5.0,"This was a gift, and the person loved it so much they got the matching purse😊"
5.0,With bad circulation in my hands they keep me warm
5.0,"When i rvcd my package and opened to put my dress on i really love the way it fits and feels on me, I wore it to work and rcvd very nice comments."
5.0,It  is a gift to my wife for St. Patrick's Day. She will love it.
5.0,They are beautiful and I know my daughter will love them when she opens them on Christmas!
5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He's a gadget man and this gift made his day! He didn't want to use anything else I bought him. He works construction and he would take this to the site. He could work and talk at the same time. Good product!
5.0,This is a really nice suit. This is my 3rd and they hold up to swimming laps 4 to 5 days a week.
5.0,Perfect and comfortable! If you're not accustomed to the material wearing the socks designed for flats will be helpful but otherwise they're just what I needed - something that wasn't as steep as a heel that would make me more elevated than a boring old flat.
5.0,This was a gift for a teenaged friend for mine.  It appeared on time and well-packaged.  The construction appeared to be good and it seemed durable for a few years of frequent wearing.  It was very attractive and definitely was approved by her.
5.0,Beautiful charms.  Nice detail.  Looks great on a bracelet.
5.0,"Love it! I get so many compliments! Smaller than I’m used to, but it’s so cute I don’t care!"
5.0,Bought this for my daughters donut themed birthday party. She is 7. I bought the 8/9 size. Fit great and she’ll be able to wear it for a long time to come. ❤️🍩
5.0,"I love these things, they are way different than any of my other sunglasses. Julbo recommends that you do not use them for driving, but honestly they work great for driving in the bright summer sunshine."
5.0,"It looks great in person, very high quality and easy to install."
5.0,"This shirt came true to size, fits so comfortably and the shirt is made out of such a soft fabric! 10/10 would buy again!"
5.0,Great case!
5.0,"Best dress ever! Great for a variety of purposes, work with a blazer, a cardigan, heels or flats! Adorable and great buy- I'd buy it again in every color of the rainbow!"
5.0,Cute.. roomier than it looks.
5.0,Scope fits nice and tight with this breech.
5.0,I'm am very happy with this. I live everything about it.<br />The size of the hand bag.<br />And it came with the wallet to match.<br />I use mine everyday.
5.0,Got it for my daughter and she loves it!  It fits her perfectly
5.0,The cosplay very wonderful and fits properly! My height is 5’1 and my weight is 130 pounds. Usually most of my cosplays I fit a Medium so when I only saw Small or Large I read the measurements before getting the size and a Small fits perfectly for me!My only complaint is the leg guards ribbons is thin and can easily ripped/ break if not tied correctly on the legs! Other than that this was one of my favorite cosplays to wear! 💕
5.0,"very good, I like it."
5.0,Its beautiful! But I am a bit busty and its a bit narrow in the bust for a 40 C..Fabric is pretty and color is too! Had to return..bummer!
5.0,"I have waited 6 months to review this dress. I did this because I didn't want to just judge it based on how beautiful it was when it arrived. I wanted to wear it, wash it, see how it held up. I bought it in red and black (black on top, red and white flowers on the bottom) and it is a dream! Compliments every time I wear it and it fit me PERFECTLY (my build is 32-25-36, and I used the chart and chose small). I wash it in a garment bag on cold/delicate and hang it to dry immediately. It still looks brand new &#60;3"
5.0,Just what I was looking for.  Flexible key ring that allows for regular sized and huge electronic keys to fit and fold easily.  Also has secure closure.
5.0,"I love these pants, even with the straps swinging in the wind gives it a unique character."
5.0,I haven't washed them yet so I can't speak to that.  They are nice and look great.  So much easier than all the bulkiness
5.0,My daughter loves her locket...it's sturdy and color is perfect
5.0,Fit perfectly. I what I needed for the bright sunlight
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to adjust. Keeps dust off you very well and helps in cold weather to a lot for me.
5.0,Had looked everywhere for one!  Happy again with the perfect wallet insert!
5.0,Bought other brands and styles but this fit perfectly. True to size and very stylish. Bought the black and blue watercolor ones. Lined and quality work.
5.0,This shirt is really cute and fits true to size
5.0,I ran errands in these all day in Las Vegas and my feet didn't hurt at all
5.0,Light weight and fits over my glasses perfectly.  Love the color and the rhinestones.  It's difficult to find sun glasses that look stylish and fit over your regular glasses but these fit the bill and they do cut down on the glare in bright sun without being extremely dark.
5.0,Awesome!!!! Shipping was super fast. I love it and get compliments on it everyday :)
5.0,Love this robe. Perfectly sized and nice quality.
5.0,"Very happy with them!  Warm, firm-fitting, comfy all day."
5.0,This hat is just too cute.  Lots of compliments when I wear it.
5.0,Love the color and jersey
5.0,Only baby socks that will stay on my newborn!
5.0,Comfortable with some stretch but not too much. Fades a bit after multiple washes which is to be expected with color black. Sized up 1 size which was perfect.
5.0,"They're comfortable,  they stay up (no rolling down on the waist) and that pocket is perfect for my phone! I love them!!"
5.0,Kept head really warm during these cold days!!
5.0,Beautiful red color.
5.0,"It was more glossy that I was expecting, but still a very elegant, timeless pair of cufflinks."
5.0,"Treated myself for Christmas. This watch looks good in the photo, even better in person. Eye catching, solid, feels great on my wrist, a pleasure to wear."
5.0,"This hat was so well made and very sturdy. Should fit a medium-small women's head. It was a little bit smushed when it arrived, although the packaging was excellent. I soaked it in water and bent it into shape, and it was fine. I used it for my Halloween costume, and got so many compliments! It also came with a cute little keychain, which was really nice! Definitely recommend!"
5.0,I am 5”2 and it fit me a bit big. I threw it in the washer and dryer & it shrunk a bit so that helped make it the size that I wanted. It is soft and very comfortable.
5.0,I love the tiny print is super nice I always get compliments on my mask 😍🥰 is very comfortable to wear too!
5.0,Perfect! Great quality ! We wore them at Disney and got lots of compliments on “ where did you find those? They are so cute!”<br />Highly recommend !
5.0,This is adorable & stays upright.
5.0,"Looking at a picture you get an idea of the material, and I got exactly what I had in mind. Comfty, and perfect for my height.  (Btw, I'm 5'3 - female & ordered L)"
5.0,"Beautiful dress. Apparently I measured the length incorrectly as the dress is a bit long, but otherwise the dress fits beautifully."
5.0,Recommend! Worked great -1 for a boy & 1 for a girl!
5.0,Blue color was nice and item is sturdy.
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect, from some reviews, but as a regular millinery client, I know fascinators and hats. This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon. It's for Halloween,  so I wasn't keen to spend $100 on a one-time-use, but now I'm going back for more colours, because I'm definitely using this again. Well made, well packaged,  comes with clip and headband, and is easily comparable to a much more expensive one I just bought at Disney Springs-you literally can't tell the difference."
5.0,"Really worth buying. Soft fabric, elegant look and unbelievable comfort wearing it. Super happy about this purchase and totally recommend it!!!!!!!!"
5.0,Good quality and shipped fast
5.0,It is as described. No complaints.
5.0,"Comfortable fit and fabric , good quality"
5.0,Fits well on my hat and a good price
5.0,I think they’re pretty good for the price. Quality in the frames is better than my Oakley Holbrook’s but the optics are no where near what you get with Oakley. Can’t complain for the price though! I love the black frames and wish they had more lens color options with black frames. If they did I would have multiple pairs by now.
5.0,Love these boots. Perfect fit!
5.0,"For the price, I didn't expect these to be such sturdy shades. I bought them for my son, who goes through sunglasses like no tomorrow, and they came in great packaging with a nice bag to keep them safe. They're not flimsy at all and look great."
5.0,Having back problems it works great for me.
5.0,Perfect way to carry all the things I need. Slim and sleek.
5.0,❤❤❤ just the right amount of compression and they stay up my entire 12 hour shift. Nice material too. Not itchy or uncomfortable.
5.0,"Really love this sweater! Trying to find a sweater in this color in the stores was impossible.  Thank goodness for Amazon! The fit is true to size, the color perfect and the material is so soft, and the price was just right!"
5.0,This is a beautiful gift!
5.0,"Well made, light weight"
5.0,INCREDIBLE SOCKS!  Have purchased 20? pairs at least and mailed them all over the US and Europe to my kids  and * grandchildren and their children! Wonderful product! Thank You...
5.0,Great product at competitive price
5.0,absolutely stunning! a great purchase
5.0,"Those socks are so cute! I bought two packs for my sisters in-law and after my husband saw the socks, he said I should have bought one pack for myself since they are so adorable!"
5.0,Fit was great for dad and are very comfortable for him.
5.0,"My nephew LOVED this hat! He wears it daily and it’s made with great quality materials! Great price for a great, long lasting hat."
5.0,They arrived quickly and I love them.  Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"My fiancée ordered this item, her thoughts: “Comfortable, snug fit and true to size. The length of the pant wasn’t too long or too short and just goes right above your ankle bone! :) The elastic band doesn’t fit too tight either, so you don’t get those pressure marks from the band, which I hate. Good to wear for exercises, lounging around the house, or for going out shopping! Another thing I liked was that it didn’t fade when washing/drying like a lot of my black clothing do!”"
5.0,Love love this outfit fit perfectly true to its size
5.0,Love these. They're large and seem durable. I actually really like that it has a sewn in elastic loop instead of a pouch -- folding the bag and putting it away is much easier.<br /><br />Unbeatable for the price. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,Super cute and versitile.  Throw it on over jeans and a t-shirt and you’re ‘dressed up’.  Put it over dressier clothes and you’re on trend.  Washes well.  The blue color is lighter than I expected for navy but it’s a very pretty color.
5.0,"I have large wrists, so the band that came with the watch I purchased was too small. I got these because they were cute and stretchy. They were very easy to add to my watch and are incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />The designs didn't look quite like the pictures, but I still like the and so I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Bought as a gift for my guitar loving boyfriend. Discovered they go with a key hanging set so will purchase the full thing!
5.0,"Large numbers, easy to read dial - the best night illumination of any watch I have used. The watch itself is a simple unit without all of the elaborate, seldom used features found on most digital watches. The watch includes a stop watch, and alarm functions. Plus, you cannot beat the price - a good value."
5.0,Love it and will probably order some more of them. Very comfortable/
5.0,"carries just what you need, lunch, the newspaper, maybe an umbrella, etc...."
5.0,Excellent for a frequent flyer.
5.0,"I love this hat! The wool is soft and warm and the color I ordered was a nice medium grey. The fit is great, and I love the leather and lovely wool flower accents."
5.0,Tener en cuenta que una pulsera trae los mantras y la otra no
5.0,They're fuzzy women's gardening gloves. Nuff said.  They did crafty glove things.
5.0,"Excellent clear polarized lenses.  Light, very comfortable to wear.  Easily as good as glasses twice the price."
5.0,Nice top!  I get a lot of compliments on it.  The rubber at the top helps keep it up.  Much better quality that I was thinking it would be when I ordered it.
5.0,very nice bought another pair.
5.0,This shirt runs really small and only good for people size zero through five. If you're trying to cover anything this will not work. I am a size 14 pants an extra large shirt and I ordered an extra large and it didn't even close around my body. Not a lot of material.
5.0,"I snagged this for our family pic session this year and it's super cute! The colors are vibrant and the material is stretchy and soft. The pockets are great and the length is perfect! The sleeves are great too, not stretched out and fit snug to my wrist. I'm going to grab a few more in different colors!"
5.0,"Wore it for a wedding, was perfect."
5.0,"It works exactly as described. Many have mentioned the difficulty peeling the backing tape. Maybe because I'm a builder who has used many peel and stick tape products, I know how to do it. The product comes with a starting tape stuck to the beginning helping to get the backing tape off at the start. Once you have peeled off the amount of foam needed, leave a little of the backing tape beyond where the foam is cut. Then you have something to pull on when using the foam again. Works every time."
5.0,"Love these! The color is gorgeous and much more true to their namesake than depicted in the picture, they really are almost an emerald green. These fit perfectly, I sized down from S to XS, I have a pair of short in a S that are just a tad too big in the waist, but these are perfect! I am 5'4 125lbs and most of my weight is in my hips, butt and thighs, generally a small is great, but I definitely suggest sizing down in these."
5.0,Really nice quality.<br />Good deal.
5.0,It’s fit me perfectly.<br />I like the color and the quality and everything so I give it 5 stars
5.0,This purchase was everything just as pictured fast shipping true to size. FYI I’m 5’2 180 pounds and it fit perfectly you can dress it up or down.
5.0,This is a solid piece of jewelry. Won’t tarnish or bend like sterling does. It’s a substantial pendant and I love wearing it. Doesn’t irritate my skin.
5.0,"Gorgeous good-quality scarf, and responsive seller. The yellow color is not as shiny as it looks in the picture, which is even better. I already returned a scarf to another seller but this one is to keep. Item arrived sooner than expected."
5.0,"I got this to use as a septum ring, and I love it. I also got a 6mm and 7mm before realizing 8mm was the right fit for me. All of them seem sturdy and well made. I've had no issues with irritation from the material, and no issues with it coming unclasped. I've been wearing it for a week or so now and it's so comfortable that I forget I have it in until I scratch my nose. I'll probably get more in other colors. Would recommend."
5.0,This is a great dress looks good on. I’m 5’8 and it fits me right at the ankle so if your short it might be to long to wear with flats.

5.0,"Used the Gonex Garment Folder on a 3-week trip that involved several changes of hotel, so quite a bit of packing and unpacking. It took just a short time to master the folding technique. Contrary to the directions, I found it more useful to use the translucent ""instruction"" card as the folding template and to leave the larger ""folding"" card in its pocket. Will definitely use this product on my next trip."
5.0,Quality and size both are perfect.

5.0,😀These are very comfortable sandals I love the style. And you can wear them with just about anything really. They are true to size. They are cute style. They zip up from the back of the heel. I wear them just about everywhere!!!!😀These sandals are 8 1/2 and they fit perfect. Also they have a really cool front design to the shoe. So what ever your tennis shoe size is for that's what size you get in these. You do have to break them in but once you do they are so comfy. 😁5 STARS!😁 I would definitely buy different colors in these sandals.<br />Thank You & God Bless
5.0,Nice shirt..design and color
5.0,Starting a hat collection for my sister going through chemotherapy and she needed some warmer hosts and variety

5.0,"Luv these, so portable and comfortable!"
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter, and she loves all of them! Very beautiful earrings and cute! Worth the price!"
5.0,"I'm 5'2"" and these are about 1~2 inches longer than I would like them. If you wear it with heels I think they'll be fine. 35"" at the waist and a L still had plenty of room. I probably could have sized down. Would love them more if it had pockets, but still gonna keep them. Will be order more."
5.0,Excellent fit and very comfortable!
5.0,"The spiny turquoise is really pretty, very soft colors but with a lot of detail.  This ring is well made, has lots of little design details in the silver work."
5.0,I am reordering these because I had a pair that I got at LL Bean 7 years ago and they were perfect until I lost them. Definitely worth the price if you are okay with everyone calling you a cop.
5.0,"Omg!!  Velvet is so in right now! And this is the most flattering dress I’ve tried on lately. The gathering is all in the appropriate places around your waist to hide any bumps or lumps.  The top part can cover the entire chest, if you want.  Or I need more of a Vneck so I open the neckline a bit. The fabric is smooth and soft and lined appropriately. I’m wearing this to a wedding right near Valentine's Day. Hope the bridesmaids aren’t wearing the same!!!<br />I got an Xl in the red color. I’m a redhead so I thought the green one would be flattering. My kids told me the darker red was much more slimming!!  So think about that.<br /> 36DDD. 160lbs. It fits perfectly, not at all too tight."
5.0,"Love the shoes, runs a bit small will see if comes in 9 1/2 now"
5.0,I love this dress. It fits as it should and is not very shear although I did wear a slip under it. I did receive quit a few compliments about the dress.
5.0,Great product... I recomend it
5.0,I'm very pleased with the dress! I'm petty small in height but I loved that the dress hit the floor. You can dress this up or down.
5.0,"These slippers did not disappoint. They are gorgeous looking. Well made, materials are excellent and they are extremely comfortable! My husband absolutely loves them and wears them all the time. He is always commenting how good they feel and how warm they are. I gave them to him as an early Christmas gift because his others were so worn out. He was so surprised and happy. They also provide a decent sole for support without being too rigid. That really fits the bill for him. He had a stroke in June and needs some support for stability. These provide that without sacrificing the comfort a slipper should have. I will definitely be ordering again. THANK YOU!!"
5.0,Very cute and exactly as pictured. Received many compliments on it when I wore it. Was also a great accent to my daughter’s Lion King Jr play costume. Only thing is there was a weird horrible smell in the box when we opened it but we ordered several pieces of jewelry and I don’t know which one was the offender.
5.0,"Good product with sturdy velcro  grips. Doesn’t ride up as you’re working out. I bought it in a medium but should have bought a small as it’s a bit loose, even after tightening it as much as I could."

5.0,Very soft - great graphic design - could not be more pleased!!!!!!
5.0,I bought this at the beginning of summer and it is my favorite suit I’ve ever had.<br />Im normally an all around xl so I ordered the 3x cause the reviewed said it runs small.<br />I’m 36d and size 12 on the bottom and it fits perfectly.
5.0,Love the subtleness of the design and fabric.  Looks ama I got!
5.0,It’s a good thickness and doesn’t feel cheap
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Very comfortable and good quality. The soles are great and can walk outside with them.
5.0,very warm (must be the down). inside part that touches the ear is really cozy! overall good choice to keep your ears warm!
5.0,Strong boot.

5.0,"I gave this to my roommate for Christmas this past year. She's always remarked how she wanted one, so this year, I made sure to get it for her. The original one she had on her wish list  was no longer available, but I saw this and she loves the color blue.<br /><br />It was a total hit! She loves it! It's got lots of pockets and a full zipper across the top, plus a handle that's long enough she can put it across her body! I kinda want one for me, now!"
5.0,Exactly as described. Love the option of the design they have for you.
5.0,"I love everything about these earrings: The textured silver, gorgeous mabe pearls that are perfectly matched, the size of the earring and the fact that the earring backs fit the posts perfectly! They are a gift from me to me :-)<br />I wish that the outer package was a little sturdier. One of the earring posts arrived bent though I was able to bend it back in place. I bought 2 pair of earrings, and the second pair (different) was fine."
5.0,Bold Banana racerback tanks are my favorite ever! Fits great and is very flattering. I have this top in several prints.
5.0,"Perfect!!!!<br />Im a Baltimore Ravens fan but now live in S. Florida,  we went to Ravens vs dolphins gzme, no problems getting into stadium and it holds everything and more!<br />I recommend this product and the seller!!!"

5.0,This book is exceptional not only because of its content but also the presentation....it is in the trade paperpack format with high quality &#34;thick&#34; pages and cover!! It is easy to get into and hard to put down! Well done Varg!!

5.0,I loved this product. It came with a lot of beads and everything I needed. It satisfying to make. Now to test to see how strong it will be. Loved it so far!
5.0,Fits as expected nice material with some stretch.
5.0,"This shirt is incredibly soft and warm. I am 5 feet and 100 lbs, and found even the x-small size to be roomy. So, keep in mind that it runs a bit on the big/long side. I, however, bought it with the intention of wearing it as a top layer - much like a cardigan - around the house on cold days, so the extra room makes it fit nicely over another shirt. The seller was also extremely responsive and gracious when I contacted them."
5.0,I give this product 100% and recommended to other people
5.0,Awesome watch!  You can't beat this an automatic watch for under $50 bucks.  Has the look and feel of a Breitling and the quality is very good especially considering the watch is this inexpensive. I am extremely pleased with my  purchase!
5.0,"I love  all the  credit  card  compartments.  It's a little hard to close if I  put my Galaxy Note  5 in it because of the  Otterbox case, but  other than that,  it's a  perfect wallet. Two  thumbs up!"
5.0,Gorgeous dress that can be worn in 3 different ways!
5.0,Fits true to size. Very comfortable dress.

5.0,"Solo pensé que era más grande 😆, igual me gusta!!"
5.0,My dad loves it💕
5.0,"I wish the pocket was a little bigger, but it was big enough for my phone, wallet, and chapstick. It was a great way to stay warm and not have to carry a purse."
5.0,Little bit of spray paint and it made an excellent piece to a Maleficent costume. Worked perfect to deflate in car and going through doorways then turned the fan on and it inflated so perfectly!!
5.0,"Gorgeous shoes! Makes your legs look long, lean & super SEXY!"
5.0,I got this for my son‘s 10th birthday I ordered a size 1112 is a little too big which that’s what I wanted something for him to have for a little while he is growing fast so I don’t expect him to have it for super long but he did get the job done and he loved it
5.0,My child normally wears a size 11 but I order these in a size 12 and she can still comfortable wear them. Would order a size larger than normal just to be on the safe side.
5.0,Fits great and my daughter loves them
5.0,"I'm a big girl, and these are some of the most comfortable exercise pants I've ever worn, even when I was thin!  The waistband is designed so as not to roll over and they're cut wide enough in the crotch that you're not walking around with an eternal wedgie.  They were a gift; until now I didn't know where they came from, so I'm off to order more!"
5.0,"This is VERY pretty, much better than the picture."
5.0,My girlfriend loved the pearls and I loved the box.  Classic item for a reasonable price!
5.0,I LOVE these!!
5.0,wife is very happy with it
5.0,"Love it, I machine wash, and hang dry, never shrinks, never fades, and I would order more apparel from this seller."
5.0,"They added extra support after my surgery, which was great. I'd say the only down side is that they are really hard to get off when they're wet."
5.0,Feels smooth on skin and it's easy to breath with it on.
5.0,Infinity
5.0,"I bought these for outdoor yard work. I am 5 foot 8, weigh 180lbs, and the size 16 is a very nice fit. I will probably buy a second pair. These are very lightweight, tough fabric. I am not sure they will hold up as well as the canvas heavy weight pants, but they are much more comfortable when it is hot outside. I will update the review after a couple of months of use."
5.0,Great price and as presented.
5.0,This brooch is absolutely gorgeous!<br />I ordered one for my sister and she receives tons of compliments too.
5.0,Got one in every color!!

5.0,"absolutely loved this necklace!! i had bought it for my aunt for christmas but shipping took a long time and the package ended up getting lost, but know that i don’t blame the seller at all they were very kind and asked if i would be willing to wait a while longer n when I said yes they and sent over a new necklace. i 100% recommend it it’s so cute n pretty and an amazing gift. just know it may be smaller than you expect, wasn’t an issue for me, but if you do want it to be kind of big try a different product. i didn’t have a high quality photo to use as it was of a pet who passed away years ago, but you can still clearly see the picture when you put your camera up to the necklace! though it is a bit blurrier and looks like it has a filter that one would use to relay that it’s old. use a high quality photo and follow the recommendations for the best results but if it’s not possible it’s not the end of the world."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:2970b68ec9bf5f46dc0f8c4dbd475383]] Love these shoe's and the extra pair of insoles included.

5.0,"I've been wearing mine every day for 6 months at work and it has held up wonderfully. Still looks new. Bought mine in black. My co worker got hers in the blue and hers split where the ID goes after a month of taking her badge in and out. I do the same, but have had no issues.<br />Looks good! I'm tall, so some of the other options available have lanyards that are too short. This one is nice and long so it doesn't feel like a dog collar.<br />I keep a few business cards in it, and am able to slip in my credit card if I need to.<br />Works out really nicely."
5.0,"Love these hats!!<br /> I was really skeptical, because you see a lot of cheaply made baby items… I figured they were very expensive, so why not give them a try…<br /> They're beautiful! The material is soft and nice for baby, and they look so adorable in pictures!<br />Highly recommend!!"

5.0,Good quality Jersey work gloves... At least as good at the ones I used to be able to get at Home Depot and maybe better. They do wear out after a few days of heavy yard work but that's expected. That's why you buy them by the dozen and I'll be buying these from now on.

A classmate recommended some compression socks, so I figured it was worth a try. They work wonders!  Now my legs aren't super sore by the end of the day.  They work so well, I ordered another pair!  I'll be using them after I graduate and get a job as an RN."

5.0,Pleased with the color match and fit of shirt.

5.0,I wore this for a wedding and it was great! Wasn't tight at all and I danced all night.
5.0,"These are great I love them. The post secures really well to the back when you put them on. They're light weight too! I was afraid they would be heavy and was surprised! I like how they came in a nice box, I'll be keeping it to store them in when not being worn. The over all design is well made and the legs and tails seem sturdy enough not to snap off at any slight bumps.  Definently 10/10 on these."
5.0,Decent quality wristlet. Phone fit well. Shipping was costly.
5.0,I bought these for a gift for my husband and he really likes them.  They are holding up well and are very warm.  They are exactly the slippers we have been looking for and do exactly what they say as to being well made and warm and of great quality.

5.0,"Nice little bag for walking or shopping without a huge bag on my shoulder. The strap is super adjustable for crossbody or shoulder use. Will fit my small wallet and my Samsung Galaxy S7 with ease. You can use it without a wallet as well. It also fits right into a medium bag if you want to carry more things but want your basics in this one.  Well made and cute. For function, I would prefer nylon zippers."
5.0,Very convenient easy caring
5.0,Amazing worth it!
5.0,3yr old has been using this backpack everyday for the past 1.5yrs and will use again for another year. It has held up perfectly. Love the compartments we can separate his books from lunch box and put a spare mask in the little compartment.
5.0,I bought several of these dresses to wear as uniforms for a special event my staff and I participated in for a Macy's event. I have a tea party business (prettypartiesandfancyfavors.com) so the dresses went well with my vintage theme. We received many compliments! I will be buying more! Bravo on the design! The only suggestion I have is to add a XS small to your collection. Many thanks!

5.0,"This is one of my favorite finds! This dress is super lightweight and stretchy and fits so well! I am 5'4 and typically wear a medium or size 10, so I ordered this in a medium. No problems at all with the fit! Waist hits where it should and falls just below my knees. I've worn it by itself with a necklace and also with a cardigan and boots. Super simple dress that is really easy to accessorize. Right after trying it on, I went to order more and discovered it wasn't available anymore. I've searched for other dresses similar to this one with no luck. If it becomes available again, it is worth the purchase!"

5.0,Exactly what I needed. Lucky brand pajamas are so comfy and soft. Fit perfect!
5.0,"This is not only warm, especially since there is a stand-up collar, and the jacket, rather than making one look like a marshmallow, actually comes in at the waist!  Since we have had unseasonably cool weather of late, I am so happy to have this new jacket!"
5.0,"Official. It’s cute for your book bag, and also has a mirror on the back. It’s a little more bluer than the other Koya keychains but it’s still cute."

5.0,"I'm 5'3 an weight 135-140. Currently 8 months pregnant. I needed larger sweats for an upcoming c-section, and i wanted to make sure I had really baggy pants. The extra large is good, order 3 pairs.. i feel like they fit like a medium. So I then ordered 1x for a larger fit cause I need extra baggy for comfort an of course the tummy for after c-section. They are very big so.perfect! And I like that they have the string to tighten so when the tummy goes, ill still be able to wear them for the months to come. So order a size up I suggest, 2 sizes if you're pregnant."
5.0,I really like the way the fit. They are nice and loose on my temples (which is great because I get headaches a lot).

5.0,"High quality, true to colors. Packaged appropriately and shipped quickly. I am delighted with this supplier and my purchaed items."
5.0,I looks this band a lot. It feels more dressed up than your standard fitbit band and seems durable. I would not want to wear it though vigorous workouts but for everyday walking it's perfect for my needs.
5.0,"i’m 5’4” and like 115 pounds and these shorts fit perfect. they stretch, they are the perfect length, and the smaller leg holes disguise my bird legs. i ordered a pair in every color. ordered a xs, which is a little snug in the waist, a s would’ve fit also."
5.0,They arrived late after summit
5.0,Fits perfect and is super cute

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4a569126b0fd5bbdd64264ccfae7a1c5]] I have alot of boob so I order an XL. I would absolutely recommend this outfit. It was comfortable, soft, and cute as hell. Best Birthday Outfit I ordered"
5.0,This product is so soft and so comfortable. It says one size fits most and it is a little big since I'm pretty petite but I adore it.
5.0,"Very nice, fast delivery"
5.0,Beautiful and very well for the kids !
5.0,"Perfect!  Fits great and easy to replace.  No more buying new sunglasses....my lenses always scratch, but the frames are still in tip top shape...this alleviates spending for frames when all you need is to replace the lenses.  Definitely will purchase again and tell all my friends about this!"
5.0,I purchased this for my son and he loves it !! Very comfortable and stylish
5.0,I am on oxygen and its very hard to breath with my oxygen on however this make it so much easier<br />Thank you
5.0,"Super comfy and lightweight for slightly warm days, but warm enough for chilly days! Love the fit and feel."
5.0,"This was a gift for my friend whose wallet was falling apart. I was reluctant because there was only one product photo but the reviews looked good and I went for it since my friend bikes everywhere and loves cruelty-free products. It arrived on time and was a great purchase! He loved how original the idea was, and it looks like it will last for a long time. It had plenty of room for all his accumulated wallet junk, and it's not too thin or overly bulky."
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this top...it fits so, so well and looks super dressy if you want it to, but also goes well with casual styles.  So comfy, doesn't wrinkle and I've never had to worry about the v-neck wrap gaping open or shifting and exposing anything.  Just all around very flattering design, fit, etc.  Perfect for travel as it doesn't come out of your suitcase looking like you pulled it from the bottom of your hamper...haha  I'll be getting this in more colors to add to my wardrobe...definite go-to in my closet."
5.0,Great quality and Product is exactly as mentioned in the description.. Totally satisfied.
5.0,Sits close to the ear.  Very easy to fasten.
5.0,"Gift for friend who likes Dragonflies. Very pretty earrings. Would order again. However, presentation could have been better, if sent directly to gift recepient. Was in gift box, but, didn't like each earring in separate plastic bag. Fold open earring box with both with both earrings displayed would have been nicer."
5.0,"Symbol of union, freedom, democracy and equality.  Highest possible recommendation."
5.0,My daughter loved her gift
5.0,Love that they have arch support. My feet are sooo happy!
5.0,These beads were a great bargain and really pretty. We used them as part of a birthday activity making jewelry. The kids and adults loved them. They are made of glass so they can break if you drop them on the ground.
5.0,"Thanks for having these available. I've been a victim of dollar store readers for too long. These woodsters are cool, fit comfortably and have great clarity in the lenses."
5.0,So super comfy. I was worried about the sizing because I am 5'7&#34; and usually wear 16/18 but the XL fit so nicely. The fit is loose and the stretchy waist band is awesome. I am ordering more!
5.0,Great for a kids party
5.0,"I love this cardigan!! It is on the thin side, so don't expect it to keep you toasty when it's cold outside, but it will complete a nice outfit during the spring and fall months. It's long how I hoped in the back, and the arm length also did not disappoint. Since delivery took long, I did reach out to the seller whom was beyond immediately helpful. Thank you so much for this lovely cardigan, as well as your help."
5.0,"my Little Girl Loves Her New Moana Pjs, and IT fits, As expected."
5.0,"I love these to wear around the house and to the store.  Very comfy, light and airy."
5.0,"This dress has a very nice cut and good quality.  It has nice sturdy lace over a slip of some sort.  Looks expensive.  I am 5’4” and 110 lb.  i bought Small and it fit well, not too tight at all.<br />Very sexy! Husband loved!"
5.0,Item was exactly as pictured.
5.0,Reminds me of a peace sign I made in medal arts class back in the early 70s love it
5.0,Really nice dress- very comfortable and pretty. Doesn’t feel or look cheap. Got several compliments.
5.0,It's very colorful and comfortable
5.0,"I love this dress! The color and the fabric are great! I like it so much that I bought another one for myself and one for my mom. I will say that they are quite loose though so I would order one size down. I’m 5’6 140lbs with bigger hips and you can see in my first picture how much “give” there is. I ordered a medium for the first dress (pictured) so for my next one I’m definitely purchasing a small! (Runs loose on the arms, chest, stomach and hips)"
5.0,This was a great keychain to give to a teacher who moved.  She loved it!!
5.0,Love my card holder. Very conveinent and saves a lot of time and space!
5.0,This little band makes my Fitbit look more sophisticated for those busy days that I don't want to miss my steps but also don't want it to look so sporty. I am a pretty casual dresser as it is but this still looks great with jeans and a cute top on date night or a dress for Church on Sunday. You can add a couple bangles and dress it up even more. I think the description says that this band is genuine leather but I am not 100% sure that it is real leather. Either way the quality is great. The connector is secure. The color is true to what I see on my computer. I have a small wrist and find that this fits perfectly with not a lot of hangover from the strap hanging off at the end. I only wear it a few times a week but so far it is holding up very well. I get compliments on it a lot and love telling people where I got it. The price is very affordable. I am thinking of ordering it in additional colors.
5.0,My iPhone 11 Pro fits in here very nicely!
5.0,The sweatshirt fits well.  I have long arms and The shirt still fit well.  It appears to be a quality garment.
5.0,Beautiful dress. Love the feel of it and the fit is amazing. Can't wait to wear on vacation
5.0,Cute & comfy!<br />Dress them up or down or to bed!
5.0,I absolutely love my bag. I got it because I wanted a stylish gym bag but didnt care to pay a arm and a leg for a designer bag. Very impressed by the quality of it. The bag is PU leather which is a plus because I'm vegan but you could never tell based off of the durability of the bag. My work requires  business casual attire so the all black PU leather compliments that as well as a casual look for the weekends. I would definitely recommend it and will get the bigger version for short vacations.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1ac3974eaf7569902ac9babad3d563e5]] Love it!!
5.0,"I seriously love how cute these bracelets are. If you have small wrists that you find hard to embellish with the right bracelets, these are perfect. They fit very snug! Quick delivery time."
5.0,"These actually arrived a day early. This was a great way to clean out my old socks. 12 for a great price. Great quality, not too flashy. They fit like normal socks in this style and size. I got rid of 12 older pairs and hope these will last as long."
5.0,I really like this shirt but it runs larger than expected. I normally wear a large so I ordered a large and it is huge. Better order a size smaller than you usually wear if you order this shirt.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ecefdea71c1004001e1d3645c6ca57a5]] Love these glasses so much, I wear them almost everywhere. I just wish that they had a much darker tint around the eye area so that you can barely see my eyes but, other than that I will purchase again. They are super cute & not extremely big."
5.0,"I have tried every variety of no show socks available, but with size 6.5 feet, they always slide down my heel and never stay put. This is the first product I've tried that actually stays on my feet! I'll be buying more of these ASAP."
5.0,Compared to 90degree brand
5.0,"I had so many compliments with This dress it complimented my shape very well, j just wish is was a little tighter around the waist"
5.0,Fits really nice.

5.0,True to size. Quality product at a good price
5.0,"Love it! Easy to adjust the size, comfortable to wear, decorative Crystal's aren't ""too"" blingy, dressy or casual, awesome value!"
5.0,"I prefer post earrings to dangles. I have worn these for several years now and have had no problems with them. I didn't realize how small 4mm was until I got them. I would have preferred them to be about 6mm, I think. But I still like them."
5.0,Beautiful colors!!  Very comfortable. I get many compliments on it.
5.0,"Hope for the best, save was very happy. Larger than the photo makes them look, but not ridiculously big."
5.0,This shawl is perfect for those cool evenings and inside when the air conditioner is on high.
5.0,"MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SKIRT!!! It took a while to get here, but it was well worth the wait. The colors are soooo vibrant and beautiful, and it has a nice sheen to it.  I can't wait to pair it and wear it."
5.0,"I recently received this product and I am pleased.  It is exactly what I expected and arrived earlier than previously suggested.  It is very light weight, fits well over my padded undershirt, and is bright enough that any player with half a brain should not shot you by mistake.  That being said, there is always one person who proves you wrong.<br /><br />In conclusion, it does what it was designed to do for a decent price.  It is not limiting in range of motion, it is bright enough to easily stand out in almost every environments, and works well with other paintball clothing."
5.0,I like everything but the price I think the price is a little high.
5.0,These skirts are flattering and comfortable. I just ordered another four!
5.0,Another favorite!
5.0,Great product for those of us that may have put on a bit of a Guinness belly.
5.0,"Very nice earrings, as described and very fast delivery. Would buy from this seller again."
5.0,"My daughter loves it, but the face has been fading. She's had it for about two months and wears everyday!"
5.0,Not bad at all for the price. Buy it! If you don’t like it send it back but I’m keeping mine lol
5.0,"Super cute, just wish the chain were a bit longer"
5.0,Absolutely love this hat! It's so warm and the fuzzy interior is so soft!! Highly recommend to all my friends!
5.0,New dress code at work closed heal. I have wide feet and a knee issue. I was praying to find something cute and comfortable. These are PERFECT
5.0,Great dress! Gets so many compliments and is very easy to wear. For size reference I'm normally a S/ M and went with the M. I'm 5'7 and it hits my upper calf. If you're on the fence go for it.
5.0,Was expensive as Walmart had exactly the same one details material and all but they were sold out! Quality is great! Bought other ones from Amazon but the quality in those were so bad! So even though this was double the price of the one at Walmart the quality is great!
5.0,Beautiful nightgown
5.0,Just the right size I was looking for. Friends keep trying to get them from me. Price couldn't be any better. I also bought a pair for a man to wear. Pleases both men & women.
5.0,My other daughter loves her jacket and wears it every day!!
5.0,"This body suit is fantastic! I’m 5’10”, 154lbs and have a small bust - I ordered a medium! It’s comfortable and the sleeves are very long. I love it!"
5.0,It looked small but fit just right. Very comfy and keeps me warm in snowy weather.
5.0,Was worried that it'll be too small but it’s a perfect motorcycle keychain
5.0,"Beautifully crafted, solid, and with great detail"
5.0,"I ordered this swimsuit in a size M (US8). This is the size I generally wear in swimsuits, and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I love this suit! It is well-made and very flattering. My only real “problem” area is my stomach since I had 3 children all very close together. The suit has an extra layer of fabric that really helps hold in my jiggle. Many skirted suits have a mesh or lightweight fabric that connects the bottoms to the top of the skirt. This suit has regular swimsuit material all the way up, and then the skirt goes over the top of that. I look like I have a flat tummy! And it’s not at all uncomfortable.<br /><br />The tie at the bust is actually a strip of fabric from the inside and a strip from the outside that get tied together. In one of my pictures, I left it untied to show that (if preferred) the tie could be cut off to give a more modest look to the suit. I really like how it looks when tied, however. There are 2 rounded, molded cups in the bust that are not stitched down. They do move around when the suit is first being put on, but they don’t move a lot while I’m wearing it. I would prefer a teardrop shape cup for a more natural look, but these do give that pinup look to the bust.<br /><br />The straps that tie at the neck are wide, which adds so much to the comfort of this suit. I also like the elastic at the top of the back because it is comfortable and doesn’t roll.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this suit for style, quality, and true fit.<br /><br />I received this swimsuit for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have used this product myself, and all words in this review are my own."
5.0,"Great fit in my Tincan Oakleys. I clean with confidence, as they are secure in the frames. Polarization is light and is aligned with my iPhone screen in the portrait position. Tint in consistent and very sharp."
5.0,"Was looking for a light, comfortable, cool dress with pockets to wear around the house for the summer and this one is fantastic. Tossed it in the wash & dryer and it didn't shrink, came out great, so I quickly ordered another one in a different pattern! Very happy."
5.0,They are well made and very comfy
5.0,Will work well for Peppa Pig Live. My son loves it
5.0,I'm in love!!! The dress is light and the material is awesome! Great product!! I was skeptic at first so I only ordered one but I'm about to get a few different colors now. Adding a belt definitely helps with styling it!!

5.0,"Received today, comfortable, good fit and worth the price. I am a Mike Mazurki head as well and the fit band is fine with me, good design."
5.0,Love it! Does everything a digital watch should do!
5.0,"Watch does everything it says it'll do. I rate it a five.  It operating instructions need a little work though. You need to read them,their are discrepancies with the number positions,and watch the video to get set up  correctly."
5.0,"Not as yellow as the pic. A lot more blue on the sides then gradients into a little yellow in the middle. But that's ok, it works for what I need. Might buy more :)"
5.0,It has in a window for the memories of my sister who passed away
5.0,Airborne
5.0,"I wish these were the only socks I’d ever bought. They’re truly perfect. Even after several washes they still look great and hold up well to my squirmy 6-mo. old. They grip on to his ankles and stay up! Mind blowing.<br /><br />If you find my review helpful, please do me a favor and hit the “helpful” button. I really appreciate it!<br />Have a lovely day"
5.0,I received this sweater on the expected date. It is a beautiful sweater. I ordered pink and it was a very pleasing color. I ordered a XL because I like my sweaters roomy and it fit to a tee. It was heavy but did not weigh you down. The material was very soft and comfortable. The price was low for the quality and appearance of this sweater. I will order more of these in different colors.
5.0,The material was not thick not thin perfect I loved everything about it
5.0,"Stylish looking watch, love the red stripe on the watchband."
5.0,This dress is made very well. The back is lovely.  The top of the apron is a thin cotton so it was not used for this costume event. I had a belt made with a bow in the back which really finished off the dress perfectly.  I also bought a crinoline to poof out the dress which really looks nice.<br /><br />S.
5.0,"I love the product, beautiful chains! Problem was it took 3 weeks to get to my house! Not the seller fault."
5.0,"So cute, fits great!  I have gotten a lot of compliments on it!  Better quality than I expected.  I'm 5'4'' 125lb and usually wear size 2-4 it fits me well but would definitely fit someone larger."
5.0,Have had numerous complaints
5.0,This logo money clip was a great quality. It was a gift for a friend and he loved it tremendously thank you
5.0,These gloves are awesome.  I'm a novice/beginner and use a heavy bag for cardio training.  These gloves offer great protection for my hands.  The large wrist straps feel great.  Most importantly...the &#34;gun metal black&#34; gloves look awesome.
5.0,These shorts fit well and are very comfortable.  I will purchase them again.
5.0,This was cuter than the picture!

5.0,"This is the best belt I ever owned, it's adjustable to just the right size, no more searching for the right hole to lock it in place and maybe its to much or to little, now we can have Goldilocks moments and have our belts just right! I bought another for work, great and durable yet still a nice looking belt at a great price!"
5.0,Gave as a bridesmaid gift and the girls loved it!
5.0,Best lip ring for my Monroe ever
5.0,When I received this bracelet I was really impressed.<br />It is much prettier than pictured.<br />Very sparkly!<br />I would highly recommend this bracelet to all.
5.0,Wig arrived in excellent condition. For the price you can’t beat it. It’s going to need some love with hairspray and gel to make it how we want it but what do you expect from a wig in a bag. I am very happy with it.
5.0,Great band. Color was lighter then the picture. Fits series 3
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous earrings
5.0,I bought this to replace a Stuhrling band that pretty much wasted away. It was an exact fit and easy to install with the provided tool. I was able to swap out the provided buckle with the original.
5.0,My five year old loves it and wears it every night!
5.0,Pockets!!!!
5.0,I loved the whole bracelet. Colors were fantastic.
5.0,"Bought my husband one, and it works great! I’m thinking of getting one for my son as well."
5.0,Bought for my fiance and he LOVES this shirt! He put it on straight out the delivery bag.
5.0,These made a beautiful addition to my wife's earring collection.
5.0,Very nice can't go wrong for this price
5.0,Brautiful! Perfect! For our family celebration!!
5.0,I love them blue/blk and pairing them up with my chaps!! Representing DEM BOYZ!!!
5.0,"I love this swimsuit. It’s beautiful and the colors are so fresh and cute. It’s very nice, dries fast and true to size. Great price"
5.0,Simply beautiful and very colorful
5.0,"Honestly, it's a mouse pad, not much more to say, I've used this for at least four years and only this year it started to crack and rip on the bottom. Keep it clean, and this will be for friend for a very long time! Would buy again!"
5.0,Great Shirts
5.0,LOVE IT!! Fits great and keeps me warm. Love the smiles I get when I wear it.
5.0,"Love these shirts, have several!"
5.0,"These are easy to get laced up & then all they have to do is slip on their shoes, no messing with tying laces! We’ve been using Laceez for a while now & they are great quality! They don’t break or get too loose & stretched out!"
5.0,"A very swimsuit, great for beachside and poolside. Very accurate to the description and reviews!"
5.0,"Dress was perfect for the occasion. I ordered a small. It was a little too big at the top, so we had to pin the sides. I give this dress a thumbs up."
5.0,"I call these my Super Hero sleeves. I have actions purpura which means I bruise like a pear and it takes nothing to tear the skin on my forearms. These are absolutely the BEST protection I've found to work on my car, reach into boxes and storage and do the things that would shred me otherwise. Worth every penny. Easy to machine wash and air dry.I'll be ordering additional pairs."
5.0,My son just turned 2 I got this for him for his bday I got a 3T I really like the t-shirts and they fit him perfect
5.0,So comfortable. Fits great
5.0,"Very nice sweater.  It is well made, and very soft.  I really like the button embellishments on the sleeves."
5.0,"I bought this for my husband for gift, as he is a lot outside in the wind and cold. It is a beautiful hat. I really like that it is wool and not nylon or polyester. It looks like a much more expensive hat than it is. The &#34;fur&#34; is very soft and natural feeling, not coarse or like stuffed animal fur. The buckle strap under the chin is a great feature. I was a little worried that this would be too small because my husband has a pretty big head, but it fits perfectly."
5.0,Bello seve muy fino... Exelente
5.0,Made a boy very happy and a very good deal.
5.0,Lightning fast delivery! Bought this as a gift and he was thrilled with it! Good quality and fits well. Thanks for a very pleasant shopping experience.
5.0,I loved it! I would probably order again this time a different color in the future! Received item really fast!
5.0,"I never write reviews but I am so impressed with this order! Hands down my favorite sunglasses I’ve ever bought. I took photos but I am not sure how to include them in my post! I am very picky about sunglasses, feeling like so many look terrible on me. However, I did not want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a pair. These are exactly if not better than what I expected. I got the black and gold pair. They actually have some weight to them. They look expensive and they feel like a higher quality plastic or a lighter weight of metal, way better than anything you can grab off a tower at Kohl’s, H&M etc. The fit is perfect. I feel like my head is a little wider than average, heart shaped and widest at my cheek  bones. The attention to detail in sizing and shape is ultra flattering! The sides fit comfortably and snug but not tight at all. It has the little nose things which keep the frame off of my cheeks and makeup. They went above and beyond with packaging as well. It all matches the color of my sunglasses. They wrap the sunglasses in a sheer sleeve of protective plastic put them in a again very nice quality snap button close case which looks very sleek and expensive and then put that inside a fitted black duster bag and then the fitted cardboard box. So much to prevent them from being damaged. I feel very much like a boss in these sunglasses haha. 5 stars."
5.0,"Stretchy, thing fabric, but I love it! Very cute!"
5.0,"So beautiful! It's literally my dream ring. The moissanite is so sparkly and clear, and the sapphires are dark but give off a glow in the light. It's perfect, and I can't believe the low price for how high quality the stones are."
5.0,I wear this everyday and I love it
5.0,I love the skinny band and the soft texture of the bands.
5.0,Super cute. The string to tie it on is a little too short but it'll make due.
5.0,The color looks really nice and vibrant.
5.0,"This women’s sherpa pullover is fabulous!! Very warm, cozy & comfortable. It will definitely be on repeat in my wardrobe. Perfect with jeans and lounge wear!!"
5.0,This UV umbrella has held up very well with the daily use. I live in Arizona and I’m constantly in and out of the sun. This umbrella goes with me everywhere. It’s blocking my skin from having sun damage on my face and chest and even cuts down on the heat level. Remember: The sun is NOT your friend and no one wants to age. Protect it with UV umbrellas.
5.0,This case is so sleek and beautiful. It's perfect for my driving glasses.
5.0,"Gave as a gift and it was well received. The price was great, delivery was fast. I recommend both the seller and the product!"
5.0,Gift for the wife. She likes it
5.0,"So happy with the way this hoodie fits, very roomy.  It came way faster than I thought it was going to!!  My daughter was so happy and it is using it for cosplay!!"
5.0,"This is just as I expected: lightweight, comfy, and fits as described!"
5.0,Perfect...I think I had already reviewed another purchase...similar which wasn't sterling silver..and turned BLACK on the first wearing...but this was perfect..Thanks.
5.0,Fit's perfectly. It isn't to long or to short.
5.0,I love the dress but to small i used the size chart but it did not work out. But i would order it again if they had a bigger size.
5.0,Love the comfortable feel and wear of this dress. It is now one of my favorites!
5.0,My Grandaughter loved it she said it felt like quality which will lasts for years
5.0,"Love these dresses!!! I ordered three, will probably order more. Quality is great! I would say a medium is more like a large. I'm 5'5 and 160, and the medium fits perfectly. I put all my weight in the legs and bottom though, so if you tend to put yours in your mid to top you'll need to go larger."
5.0,"I went with a review prior to purchase and sized up, I normally wear a small/med  size 6/8 I ordered one size up, fits so good I ordered another one! Very professional!!!"
5.0,5 year old daughter loves them.
5.0,"Wow, I didn't expect this to fit as well as it does, or be as sexy as it is... for the price I paid for it. I'm 5'10&#34; w/ a long torso, so I was worried about the fit. Like others have mentioned... the adjustable straps go a long way and really dial in the fit. The item is very very comfortable. The open crotch is AMAZING. I love lingerie... but it usually only stays on for a few minutes before my husband slips it all off for 'business time', but now we leave it on the whole time and we both love it. The top is really comfortable, sexy lace, and the bottom is very sheer, sexy, comfortable mesh. Our new favorite piece of lingerie!!"
5.0,Great pillow case!
5.0,My wife and stepdaughter got to share them. Punk Rock Style.
5.0,best undies for work
5.0,Liked that there were two colors in one pack.
5.0,Very comfortable and holds everything in as describes. No rolls or panty lines!!
5.0,"Size guide is spot on, so do your measurements before ordering!<br />This is a great suit!"
5.0,"It is adjustable, with an elastic cord to tighten or loosen. Much more bronze/gold than brown, in my opinion. Very pretty."
5.0,I love the nice colors their comfortable & they wash well my grandson only wants to wear these
5.0,"I LOVE BANGLE WATCHES, THIS FITS GREAT AND I CAN READ THE TIME WITH NO PROBLEMS"
5.0,My nephew loved his hat.  Wears it all of the time!
5.0,Fit as expected and looks great.
5.0,"fits good, very funny"
5.0,Fabulous boots!  I love that these are good looking and waterproof (havent tested this yet the leather seems treated and looks great even after getting wet.)  Lots of compliments while I walk in comfort.
5.0,"Great fit, super comfortable.  After getting used to the look, the babies are legit.  I think I would like a boxer short from them as well.  Buy these, you wont be disappointed and neither will your significant other."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my husband who likes vintage style Hawaiian shirts.  Fit as expected.  He loves it.  Gets many compliments on this great shirt.  Exactly as described.
5.0,"Warm, cozy, and cute! I would buy another pair in another color!"
5.0,"Work great.  I hope they last, seem to be stiff.  I hope I get a lot of use before they break."
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my dad and he really loves it. It seems like the quality is good and he wishes he could get another one to keep in mint condition.
5.0,"This was a gift for an elderly friend who is converting to be Catholic, and she LOVES the color purple.  She loved it!!!  The added touch of soil from Jerusalem was the meaningful touch I was hoping for.  Lovely."
5.0,Muy detallados y venían muy bien empacando sin rayones. Son adorable y elegantes
5.0,Best soccer cleats
5.0,This belt is perfect  bought a second one!!!
5.0,"At $15 a pair, these shorts have features of much more expensive ones. I will re-order several for great variety in my gym wear collection."
5.0,Faster than expected shipping and came with a little instruction packet including a cleaning cloth.
5.0,"I purchased the bags for myself and my bridesmaids as part of my gift to them. I had done a lot of research to try and find a bag that was low in price but at the same time good in quality. This bag is perfect. You would think for a bag priced so low it would look or feel cheap, well that's not the case. My one and only complaint would be the shipping and handling. I think that could be lowered, but I guess it's worth it because I ended up saving some money in the end."
5.0,"I absolutely adore this bag! It’s perfect size for my everyday life. As well as a perfect little beach bag or hiking bag. So much room , as well as multiple little compartments. 100% recommend! I also get soo many compliments (:"
5.0,Has stretch good for and cut. Very pleased with the purchase.
5.0,Just got my sunglasses today and I'm really pleased with them!
5.0,"My dress got delivered to the wrong state.  They apologized ,refunded my money and sent me a free dress. I will be buying more. I ordered size small. I am 5ft.  2 inches tall and  it went a little above my knee. Color was as pictured. Fabric is soft. Very happy!"
5.0,"Loves these tees. Little longer sleeve, which I love. Hem is nice on bottom. Makes T-shirt wearing a little more upscale."
5.0,If you wear a small then buy a medium.  Runs small and it is short.  But very cute!
5.0,"I got a size up from my normal size and felt it fit just right in the shoulders and arms but was looser in the torso area, but not so loose that it looked weird. I love the coat! Would definitely recommend it (mostly if you wear petite sizes)"
5.0,Cute! Hasn’t stretched out and doesn’t stink even though I work out and shower with it.
5.0,Holds everything I need and stays slim. Quality is excellent
5.0,"Love, love, love this bag. Beautiful and well made."
5.0,"Theses boot are just as pictured and they go great with shorts, jeans, and dresses."
5.0,The pictures do not do it justice! It's absolutely beautiful in person. The length is perfect  and it looks just as pretty as an expensive veil!<br />Beautiful 😍😍😍😍!!<br />The lace also has sequins and they give a sparkly effect wich catches the eye!  Love it!
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, and if I had a better experience returning for a larger size, I would. This is the worst return experience I've ever had in all my years of ordering fron Amazon."
5.0,Pros:<br />1. Excellent quality<br />2. Good looking wallet<br />3. Be on expectations<br />4. As described<br />5. Received in one day<br />Conns:<br />1. None
5.0,"Very happy with this purchase, the shirt is quality and the print is very good. Fit is excellent, sizing is great, thank you."
5.0,for my mom loves it.
5.0,"It works well for its intended purpose. See attached photos! Pro tip - if it is misshapen, soak it in a bowl of water for a few minutes - courtesy of another smart reviewer who thought of this before me."
5.0,"Very nice bracelet, made well but a bit to big for me. It looked to wide on my hand, almost 7mm, but very beautiful. Would like to find one the same but only 3-4mm wide. I would recommend if you like that wide of a bracelet."
5.0,"I ordered this sweater b/c I had been wanting an off shoulder sweater.  I found 2 and this was one of them.  I'm 5'1'' tall about 115 and this is a bit oversized but I like it that way.  I ordered a small.  It fits me exactly how it fits the model in the picture.  The only thing is it had a bit of a musty smell to it; however, I will wash it and it will be fine.  I received a compliment on it when I wore it.  It has a couple of holes in it, but it is designed that way.  My bra could possibly be seen a tiny bit through those holes, but since, the neck is large and folded over it's not a problem at all.  I love the sweater and would recommend.  I wore it with skinny jeans and flats - looked great."
5.0,I really like the shirt I received it was what I was expecting. The fit was good too and remained that way after washing.
5.0,"Simple skirt to use for a costume or practice, I reccommend something higher quality for performances. Very comfortable and great length!"
5.0,Keeps sun off face well.
5.0,Gloves were tight & inside not as soft as I expected
5.0,Streches and feels very soft.
5.0,LOVE these socks
5.0,"These bow ties are adorable.  Honestly, I bought them for my lab to dress him up for silly pictures and parties.  He doesn't seem to be a fan, but they have been quite a hit."
5.0,Ordered for niece
5.0,Very cute necklace and it does not look cheap at all. Great buy for the money. Thanks!
5.0,"Fits perfect on my 5'1 and 125 pound frame. It is a thin soft knit but it is not see through. It's very comfortable, and fits me just below the knee. The perfect dress for all occasions. If you are on the slender side you will love this dress. And the price is perfect, can't go wrong with this dress. I recommend."
5.0,I love my Leather Tie...!!!
5.0,Another wonderful Blueq product.  I love my socks.  Color doesn't face.  Wears well.
5.0,"Great buy, no complaints"
5.0,This is the cutest sweater. My daughter loves it and wears it all the time!
5.0,"I have this chapstick holder attached to my ID badge and love that it's so easily accessible rather than digging around my bag.  Came with 10 holders, enough to share with friends for a very good price."
5.0,Did not fit to size. Love the top..very nice. Just did not fit to my size.
5.0,It’s super cute and thin.
5.0,Cute mask for a bowler!
5.0,Nice bracelet and charms for the money. Very happy with the purchase.
5.0,Loved so much about all these bracelets! First of all 4 of them!  They all fit my wrist and r comfortable!  They came in the mail fast too!  I also get many compliments!  I'd buy them again!
5.0,Excellent material and workmanship.<br />Real quality product
5.0,I love these little ring yarn guides. They work great when I'm crocheting. Giving g some to friends too. Would order again.
5.0,"Nice leggings! The fabric almost looks like a knit equivalent of satin because of the shine, making these have a vaguely sexy, dressy look (for yoga pants). I bet you could use these with a dress or long top and still look kind of nice in cold weather. Also, it has DOUBLE pockets! Better organization for your stuff. There’s also a bonus back hidden waistband pocket. Great leggings!"
5.0,I really like the new band.  It's a nice design and a very soft flexible feel.
5.0,"These are beautiful.  The quality was good, not too heavy on the ears."
5.0,Adjusts to any size and very stylish
5.0,Love these aviators.  Oakley is great about making their nose pieces differently so you don;t have the problem of having your hair get stuck in them when you put them on top of your head.  I have a smaller face and they still look great.
5.0,"Fit is PERFECT!  It is extremely difficult to find XS women's clothing.  My roommate only wears this shirt once per year, on New Years' Eve, but it is necessary for her to have a tux shirt for that occasion.  This is perfect! (Oops, I said that. Oh,well. It bears repeating.) PERFECT!"
5.0,I ordered 3 pair. I useally wear at 8 but these run small.... À size 9 for me perfect
5.0,"Great design, great construction, I own about 4 pair now and I don't know if they are ever discontinued! Highly recommended."
5.0,These are just bad ass sg's. Sleek and wicked looking. Best of all? DEMON VISION.
5.0,liked will buyagen
5.0,"Very heavy duty and well made! Especially for the price, early worth twice what there asking for them. Funtional too, these could take a hit too!"
5.0,"Lightweight, breathable, great design."
5.0,"I love it! Super silky just like I like. Tank is super adjustable!!!!! Not too long, not too short. I highly recommend!"
5.0,"Live my watch, clasp broke twice though. Carol was amazing getting them replaced!"
5.0,My son 5 yr old
5.0,Love this watch it is very comfortable to wear. I get alot of people asking me what kind of watch is that. Lots of nice compliments.
5.0,"The perfect flowy, maxi dress!"
5.0,"It is very thin, so would be good in warm spring, summer evening or fall.  Color is just like the picture and the fit is what I expect.  Glad to add this to my closet as I wait for spring. (Update April 2) I have worn this a few times now and love it.  I have gotten complements from my friends.  It is very comfortable."
5.0,"These DC Commands are extremely comfortable and look great. They run a little small, so I ordered a half size larger."
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes and tries to wear them everywhere
5.0,This product was for my son. He is a huge curry fan so I had to get it for him. Since he has yet to take it off. Has been in and out of water. Very sturdy bracelet.
5.0,I paired it with the other pieces and they look great together!!!
5.0,"The earrings are absolutely beautiful!!! I love them. Can't wait to wear with my dress. I was expecting them to be more blue, but the one that I received are more green. Still very pretty. But I was looking forward to the blue ones."
5.0,Work perfect with my ray Ban sunglasses.
5.0,This is the finest dress I have in my collection.
5.0,True to size.  Bought for grandsons to wear on a rainy Halloween night.
5.0,I purchased this pompom charm to adorn my handbag. It looks great and creates a bohemian look. Best of all it's faux fur (animal friendly).
5.0,The most comfortable shirt. Fit just as I expected it too.
5.0,The only thing wrong with this is that there isn't 2
5.0,Great gift- my daughter loved it!
5.0,Love this skirt. It looks perfect on me.
5.0,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it. So adorable and is really holding up. Really love it and so cute
5.0,Just in time for the cold weather. Love it.
5.0,This is my GO TO bag now. I love how you can change it up. I wish you could unclip the shoulder strap though
5.0,Got this for my aunt and she loved it so much fast delivery.
5.0,Great fit on my Yukon steering wheel. Seems to be a quality product.
5.0,Okay I said they shipped the wrong ones... I was wrong.. i ordered the neon blue thinking they were the white ones because of the picture.. regardless I love them
5.0,The outfit fit perfectly for my size and shape. It was very comfortable and breathable for a hot day outside. I just wish there were more color options in my size but other than that it was perfect.
5.0,I bought these for my sons wedding just in case it rained. And I am so thankful I did. I love how you can see through them unlike most umbrellas. We were able to stay dry and not miss a thing. We even had the best man and brides maid hold them over the bride and groom. Would recommend
5.0,love this dress!! A little heavy but once i figured how to put it on I looked amazing!!
5.0,"I love this bag! Perfect size for me, durable material, absolutely adorable."
5.0,"Had purchased  these for my husband at a large BOX store and wanted a spare pair for my husband.  So, of course I checked Amazon.  $10.00 cheaper at Amazon!  Yah!  He loves these sunglasses.  They fir snugly, but not too tightly.  They definitely get rid of the glare without making it too dark.  They make objects appear more crisp and detailed than most sunglasses.  The case is amazing and worth the price of the glasses.  It's very sturdy."
5.0,Great driving glove. I really like the cashmere lining. Keeps my hands warm.
5.0,Loved the goggles! Color is just what i expected!
5.0,"It fit like a glove and is very attractive.  Only thing that is bad is it has to slip over your head and with broad shoulders, it can be a little tricky.  Very flattering suit and quality made.  Would definitely recommend for those of us with curvy figures."
5.0,I love these so much because they look sturdy but are very light!
5.0,"We buy most of our children's footwear online these days, and having an actual Brannock device has made it much easier to order the correct sizes.  The cheaper plastic ones were a waste of money, the measurements were never accurate.  Having this device and understanding the role of the arch length measurement has made it easier to order correctly the first time.  The instructions are clear and useful."
5.0,Boots are gorgeous.  I've received many compliments on them. They are a beautiful dove gray and can be worn all day with anything.  Fantastic buy.
5.0,Perfect pastel shades and they fit fabulously.
5.0,Great fit for the ball 2016! Thanks
5.0,Cute bag and does the job for a low price. Needed it to get into a concert but will be using it again.
5.0,My little girl likes it! That’s enough for me to give good rating!
5.0,"These are the &#34;better&#34; quality Champion socks that I've been looking for now for a while but for what ever reason proved to be elusive here on Amazon. There are an abundance of the cheaper, lower quality Champion socks available here, which I inadvertently ended up ordering and which didn't live up to my high expectations. Those cheaper versions have the Champion logo over the toe area instead of up by the ankle.<br />These higher quality ones are usually only available at local stores and are pretty pricey. Even here on Amazon they are not cheap but once you get used to this quality it's difficult to be satisfied with cheaper socks, even if they are of the same brand.<br />These high quality ones last me for years. As a matter of fact I still have half a dozen or so of these same socks that I purchased about 8 years or so ago, and still, no holes in them!!!  The cheaper ones I bought barely lasted me a year before they developed holes all in different place and had to be thrown out.<br />One thing I will recommend to you BEFORE you wear these socks for the first time. Put them through a HOT water wash and dry first. This will lock the weave in place which strengthens it up and will provide for a much longer lasting sock. I used to work in the apparel industry.<br />So yes, paying a bit more for this top quality is definitely worth it!"
5.0,The ring is really nice. I got the wrong size but the company is willing to exchange it. Overall IV had a great experience. Would recommend.
5.0,I would have rated this as 5 stars if the fabric matched the description.<br /><br />I received this adorable dress today. My daughter has not tried it on yet but the material is quite different than what I expected. I’ve purchased other Skater Dresses through Amazon and the fabric feels like cotton. This dress description says 95% cotton 5% spandex and “slight stretch”. However it FEELS LIKE A BATHING SUIT. The color is beautiful and it appears to be made well. I am waiting for my daughter to wear it before deciding if the material looks okay on a 7 yo.<br /><br />UPDATE: My concern about the fabric ended up not mattering. The dress looks adorable on my 7 yo. It is not clingy. The color continues to be beautiful. I changed my rating from 3 to 5.
5.0,I love this style of Capri pants for work. My original pair were falling apart and I couldn’t find another pair in the dept. stores that fit my petite frame. So I tried these and they are perfect. I am 5’2 120lbs and I ordered a small. They fit perfectly. They’re thinner than the capris I am replacing but I like it better. I also love that they’re stretchy. They’re so comfortable. I’ll definitely order again and more colors.
5.0,"Very fast shipment, very good feedback from the seller, mu wife liked this watch! She was able to setup the time by radio-frequency, watch looks great! Thanks a lot! =)"
5.0,These are so comfy & cute!!
5.0,"Love them, really pretty, not too big."
5.0,These are quality safety glasses. I am very happy with my purchase and feel this is the best value for your money.
5.0,Super shiny and pretty. Perfect for that nautical touch. Chain seems strong.
5.0,Even cuter once placed on the child.  It feels nice and looks adorable.
5.0,"I love these shoes. They fit a tad small, but other than that they are awesome."
5.0,Very pretty and comfortable to wear - would recommend
5.0,"SIMPLY GORGEOUS!  this set is simply spectacular to see, to feast your eyes upon.  It's truly a catchy showpiece to be sure!  The earrings really set the necklace off!"
5.0,I love these racquets!!! I give them away for our tennis girls and boys that are Seniors. With allot more tennis items.
5.0,"This was a gift for my daughter who, after a stressful couple of years needed to be reminded about what she chose to believe!! This item arrived earlier than I expected which meant that I could give it to her for Christmas!! She loves it!!"
5.0,totally worth the entire 2.50 or so American dollars we paid for them
5.0,5🌟
5.0,they are warm......fit perfect
5.0,"Gift for friend and she loved it! Great, pretty little piece!"
5.0,These are so cute and such a great deal. They’re true to size but if you have wide feet maybe size up.
5.0,warm in cold months
5.0,"These are wonderful pants - very comfortable, and eye-catching."
5.0,I used this watch for work to have something cheap that's easy to clean. I wear it constantly and have had no issues with it. The built in light is dim and mostly shines on the left side of the screen so if it's really dark then you have a harder time seeing the minutes and seconds. Otherwise a great watch for the price. I expect to use it for the next couple of years without issue.
5.0,Great material and feel. Not restrictive but holds well. I've ordered more.
5.0,"Love this off the shoulder top. I'm 5'4&#34;, 139 lbs. and the medium fits perfectly. Very on trend."
5.0,"I have been very happy with the wallet, lots of pockets, but still somehow slimmer fit than my prior wallet."
5.0,This bag is supurb! I bought the crocodile brown<br />(what I call it).

5.0,Husband lives it. Can't beat Russell brand.
5.0,"I just received these---1 1/2 weeks before i had expected!  They came in great condition and the fit is great. I bought the LG size, I usually buy mediums.  I have broad shoulders and full chest from working out . The fit at the arms is good just the right size without dipping to deep on the sides.  Material and workmanship seem very good. I have other products from this company and have always been very satisfied."
5.0,Beautiful watch... high quality great looking piece! Great value for the price!
5.0,Bought for brother and he loved it.  Can’t beat it for the price.
5.0,"Very cute, good price too!"
5.0,"I ordered this along with a Shangri La Ikat Surplice, I was surprised both suits fit beautifully and kept both!"
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these dresses.  My daughters and I purchased these in three different designs for Easter.  They fit amazing, though, thanks to the reviews I knew that they would run small.  So go up a size or two.  The material is wonderful and also I love how the skirt &#34;puffs&#34; without the need of a petticoat.  Now these dresses are our favorite dresses.  I LOVE them!!"
5.0,"I got this for my husband to have fun with. He wears it over a regular mask just for the fun of it and to get a laugh. With our health problems, we choose to still wear masks if we go out, but we are still surprised at many people's negative reactions when they see someone in a mask. We don't judge their decision to not wear a mask, so wish for the same courtesy. This mask gets a chuckle and cuts through some of that."
5.0,My legs stopped hurting the 2nd day
5.0,I get compliments every time I wear this masks. They are very comfortable
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this fit. It's a nice lightweight material and it HAS POCKETS (my phone even fits nicely in said pockets). I'm short and the sleeves end on a normal spot instead of 4"" too long. I really like the dress and if it came in solids with long sleeves I'd order more."
5.0,Very pretty! Totally what I expected.
5.0,Excellent! Get a lot of compliments on this vest.
5.0,"I’ll admit, I was skeptical when I first bought this, because of how good the price was.  I half expected a low quality umbrella.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised! This umbrella feels very high quality, it’s super easy to assemble, and it looks fantastic.  It comes in two parts (the upper portion with the actual umbrella, and the lower pole), and it only requires inserting the bottom pole into the upper pole, and it’s ready to go.  Just as easy to disassemble if you need to take it down for the season.<br /><br />The actual umbrella creates a very wide canopy of shade, more than a lot of standard deck umbrellas from what I can tell.  The crank to open and close it works very well and is also high quality.  I HIGHLY recommend this umbrella…for this price it’s an absolute bargain!"
5.0,Lightweight.  Easy to breathe.
5.0,Very satisfied with item purchased. They turned out to be prettier than expected!
5.0,The keychain is of good quality and the cost was good
5.0,"Love the kimono! Great summer colors ! I ordered a small and it fits tts. I am 5’9, 132lb, 34C"
5.0,I love these socks and I get so many comments at work about them.  They fit so comfortably...
5.0,"It is a really great watch. It’s looks so simple and matches on any of the outwears. I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised at the construction and quality of this watch. The only suggestion I would say is to take some time and really read the instructions on how to use."
5.0,As described. No color variance between picture and actual tie
5.0,I have been trying multiple brands. 4 to be exact. Trying to find the most comfortable. These by far are the most comfortable and fit the best. They fit as described. The price is great.
5.0,Fit good and was pretty comfy
5.0,"It fit my glasses very well and light. The legs ware easy to fall. For the price, I am happy with purchase."

5.0,My favorite scarf I’ve ever purchased
5.0,Adorable! It well!
5.0,"Very loose and flowy, very comfy. Looks great with jeans or leggings"
5.0,I really like this wristband. I've had it for a few months now and I've worn it occasionally. Nothing has broken off and the buttons still work. The best thing about it is it's vegan. The little poem that's Engraved  doesn't make much sense to me it reads &#34; I feel about you makes my heart lone to be free&#34;. Just think the grammar is a bit off.
5.0,My partner works for a ski resort building and maintaining park features. These have held up longer and with more comfort than other brands he tried. Will buy more!
5.0,I was surprised that I received them faster than expected it looks very nice for the price I'll recommend it to anyone
5.0,"i love these nightgown/chemise things!  love everything about them.  they are the ultimate in loungewear, then from lounging to sleeping.  they are modest enough that i can wear them around the house whenever others are around.  i can throw one on after my night shower while i unwind, and then go straight to bed, and even through my morning coffee if i so choose.  it's super comfortable and lightweight, but also super cute!.  i love the color and touch of lace.  and the length is appropriate all the way around, but also while sleeping - i don't like longer or anything that feels like i get caught up in - but this length is good for all the things.  i have a few of these now, and i suspect in time, i will have a few more."
5.0,I have a hard time finding sandals that are truly comfortable!! I hit the jackpot with these. The support and comfort are amazing. Super light weight sandals.
5.0,"This is a well-constructed, plastic shoe horn with an 18.5-inch handle. For someone who has difficulty bending over to put on shoes, this works very well. It is quite sturdy with a good grip."
5.0,Just ordered a second pair!!!
5.0,me encanta. para hacer ejercicio
5.0,Love the way these fit and feel.
5.0,"Warm, cozy, comfortable, washes and dries wonderfully. So glad I decided to get them. Will buy again"
5.0,Hermosas gafas!!!
5.0,Hi everything fits thanks
5.0,Great deal!  I needed a little gift for a group of ladies and saw these.  Everyone loved theirs and they look great on scarves.  Easy way to add alittle bling!
5.0,the pin met more than my expectation it is very beautiful
5.0,"I'm going to get a little personal and let you all in on my measurements, so don't judge me too bad, I know I'm a big boy 😜. Hopefully this will let someone else know about how the sizing runs. My waist is 49&#34;, hips 50&#34; (I got a pretty rounded rear end), and thighs 23&#34; at the largest point. I normally wear a size 46 in pants but depending on the maker, I can squeeze into a 44. Because of these measurements I went with the 48 and it was WAAAAY too big, so I sent them back. When I went to order again, I figured I would go with the 46 but they were out of that size. So I went with the 44, thinking that if they were too small I would just send them back too. The 44 fit almost perfectly. They fit very nicely in the waist, still have about an inch of &#34;breathing room&#34; and that's with the adjustment in the back tied tight. Loosening the ties in the back will give you about an extra inch across the waist. The lederhosen fit a little tight across my hips, my rounded rear fills them up. BUT, when I wore them for about 30 minutes and sat in them for a while, they began to stretch a little and became pretty comfortable. The thighs were also a little tight, but they too began to give a little after wearing them. There are also 3 buttons down the bottom 4&#34; of both legs that you can unbutton and give plenty more room if you have bigger thighs like I do. Looking at the EU size tags, I think the conversion to US waist size is a little different here than with other sellers. The 48 that I ordered had the EU tag size as 66, and the 44 tag says 62. Looking at other places, normally EU66=50 and EU62=46, so I think the sizing on these are set to run a little big, hopefully that makes sense. ANYWAY- these lederhosen are absolutely awesome!! The suede leather is very soft, supple, and the dark brown color is beautiful! The embroidery is very nice and the stitching looks great! They seem VERY well made and with proper care they should last a long time. I hope my info is able to help someone else out there figure what size they need to order."
5.0,Fits great and is very classy. Love it!
5.0,Love it. Just exactly what I was looking for. Fabric and construction is perfect.
5.0,"Overall a great product, I would purchase again!"
5.0,"I use this to hang my sunglasses, eyeglasses, and a few necklaces. It's fairly sturdy as long as you balance out the heavy items. It wouldn't work for necklaces longer than about 25 inches, but most of mine are shorter so I'm fine with that. I have an embarrassing number of glasses and this works great to keep them where I can grab the pair I want easily. I think it's a good deal for the price and a decent looking item--nothing too fancy."
5.0,It was for my daughter and she loved it thank you 😍
5.0,"Very pretty, high quality"
5.0,Great for water aerobics classes. Look and feel good
5.0,Order one for me and one for my sister  we get a lot of compliments on them
5.0,It is as expected and arrived in the promised timeframe
5.0,"I paid $20.90 and I am very happy with the quality, feel, and look of the band. Most of all it fits as described and is comfortable.<br />The circumference of my wrist is about 9.1 inches and I'm on the 4th notch.<br />Comparably to the original band, I really like that it doesn't sweat or hold water, also nylon is BPA free (unlike the original band).<br />Overall it is an excellent product, however it is not worth the &#34;original&#34; price of $58.88, but the price point I paid it is a very good purchase."
5.0,Love the beautiful shades of blue!
5.0,"Great sweatshirts.  I am 6'-0&#34;, 165 lb and medium size fits just right.  Only con for this product is extreme shedding of the inside fleece. Recommend washing alone for first 2-3 washings."
5.0,"I had already bought this jacket at our local Polaris dealer. My husband had actually tried this on there but they didn’t have it in the color we wanted. So we went on Amazon and found it in the right color and the right size! We ordered it on November 22 and originally it said it would be delivered between November 29 and December 5. All of a sudden it showed up this morning before 8 AM on Friday the 25th and was sent 2 day shipping which we did not pay extra for. Now that’s customer service! If I lived in Ohio, I would definitely frequent this place!<br /><br />As far as the product, the jacket is awesome very well-made fits well and should keep us very very warm!!"
5.0,"I totally loved the purse that I brought the same one in Red.  Got the red one and it is beautiful! The color is so deep and a different type of red than what you see on the picture.  Actually, the picture does not do it justice.  I give it 5 stars!"
5.0,Good delivery time. Good product. Good job.
5.0,"This dress is better than what I expected. The fabric is great and it looks beautiful on me. I love that it has adjustable straps. I am petite so this was very huge for me. I am 5' 125lbs and ordered the small. It fits perfectly and is flowy, very cute!!"
5.0,It’s a great little bag . Perfect to house all my things . Very well<br />Made and good looking
5.0,I love my MK bag!!
5.0,My nephew liked it.
5.0,"These shoes are GREAT! I have the worst time actually finding shoes that are comfy and fit my feet right.  These shoes are so amazingly warm and you can stand in them all day and not have  feet that hurt at the end of the day. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone who hates having achy cold feet.  I have never bought the same shoes twice, I will with these shoes.."
5.0,We bought this as a gift for our foster child. She loves it
5.0,Perfect for smoothing under my clothes!
5.0,"Nice shoes, soft material, comfortable and fits perfect. I love it."

5.0,"Very cool, fit good, very bright"
5.0,I love these jeans! I've ordered two pairs already. Super stretchy and cute. Love the fit and very flattering!
5.0,"While I'm not crazy about the color, this is a cute short jacket that's probably best suited for a not too chilly day. Living in the Northeast, this wouldn't be practical for a frigid day since it'll only keep you warm up to your waist. But I do like that the cut is generous. I took a chance and picked a small and it fits with plenty of space if I wanted to layer under it. I like that it has pockets as well as a hood. It's just pretty short for a really cold winter day."
5.0,Every time I wear this dress I get compliments. I am 5'8 and 135lbs and I'm a 34 B. I have a hard time finding dresses to be at a classy length because I am so tall. I have two dresses from this company and they are my go to work dresses. You will not be disappointed.
5.0,I couldn't ask for a more supportive design. The shirts are comfortable and look great too. The quality is top-notch and a boy couldn't ask for a better tank top.
5.0,This is a great jumper for the price! I will definitely order again!
5.0,I am so thrilled! I was worried these wouldn't fit my newborn. She is petite and only six weeks old. They fit her and look so cute and fashionable! Love love!

5.0,This is beautiful!!! Made out of good metal if I had to buy again I would.
5.0,"Fabric of this t-shirt is soft and comfy, and the print on it is cool, my daughter thought it's a fun t-shirt, too. Fits true to size."
5.0,"This is my favorite dress! I love it tlso mich, I have 3 colors so far. Purple, Grey, Cream/Beige. They are beautiful! The fabric is silky, soft, not see through. It hangs gorgeous and is VERY flattering. I get compliments every time I wear them. They are great for layering or a dress. With boots, heels, or sandals. I wear a Medium and am a small on top and size 4-6 on the bottom. Hope you lobe yours!"
5.0,"Exactly what I was hoping for... petite but noticeable, nicely made, and comfortable.<br />Can be worn with just about anything. Would recommend to anyone who liked petite and classic every day earrings."

5.0,I loved it!! Fit was awesome and it's gorgeous on
5.0,Material fills good
5.0,Me gusta es efectivo pero necesito los filtros de respuesta iguales
5.0,"I love it. It is definitely not a small necklace so if your looking for something small and delicate,  this is not it. Even though,  it is all proportioned and has great detail."
5.0,Not too tight or loose. I love them ! I’m going to buy more in different colors.
5.0,this was a gift and they loved it it fit as expected.
5.0,"excellent, excellent quality ...<br />its beautiful!"
5.0,"I bought this from elsewhere not from Amazon. I love everything in this alarm clock, strong alarm, easy to set, the alarm goes off for 1 min, you can use the snooze function."
5.0,"Such a cute casual tee!! It’s sheer so you’ll have to wear a cami under it. Nice soft fabric. Fabric does seem delicate so if you have a mesh washing bag, put the shirt in it when doing your laundry. I’m 180 and the large fit me perfectly without being tight or too lose."
5.0,Great shades! Minor scratch on the side but not major.
5.0,The feather was a little bent out of shape but I was able to fix it with a straightening iron. Exceeded my expectations and the price was right.
5.0,"These definitely do the job for keeping my hair back, especially if your hair is short, and ponytails just aren’t good enough! And they are cute."
5.0,"I have a small wrist and it fits me perfectly. The light is very dim on the right side, but you can see what you need to see. I've used it for several months and I have the feeling it will last for a very long time -I'll comment here otherwise."
5.0,"Great necklace,  very elegant"
5.0,Ordered these for my daughter! They are super cute and well made. Fit to size
5.0,My favorite nighttime jammies

5.0,Gorgeous!!! Cant a ccount for its magnetic properties but gorgeous..
5.0,"Very satisfied with the dress and it fits very well.  However, I paid $49.49 for the dress and the next day the dress was shown on the ""frequently viewed items"" section of my account page for $43.99 for the same size (M) that I purchased.  It made me feel really bad that I was overcharged $5.50 and I think it is only fair that I am reimbursed for the amount that I overpaid.  Thank you."
5.0,"These actually work for me! I've been trying to find a headband to hold my short hair back while exercising and hard work. That's what I use these for. I have a petite head and they fit,but I don't wear them all day,I wear cotton otherwise. These are very sturdy and do the job I need them to do. I don't need to constantly adjust these either! You really have to get your head upside down when you put them on and walk it up your face to get all the hair in. The silicone grip is awesome!  I love all the colors also!"
5.0,Great quality! Delivered on time.
5.0,"Holy moly!! I was very apprehensive about buying a swimsuit online, but I adore this one!! It is so flattering and I feel comfortable in it. It is cute without being too revealing. I'm a mom of 3, so I don't want to suck in the whole time at the beach 😂  It seems well made and I am so happy with this purchase. For reference, I am 5'2 and weigh 120ish (see pic). I ordered a size large and it fits perfectly."
5.0,Cute not too heavy but look nice
5.0,"Love these pajamas!  Absolutely cute, fit as expected and extremely comfy! I even purchased a set for my sister."
5.0,"Loved it! Super cute and sexy. Beware it does show quite a bit of side boob. It was true to size and fit me great. I'm 5'2, 34C, and 112 lbs and typically wear a small which is what I ordered."
5.0,"Excellent coat. Lightweight, very warm, well made and good looking. The side entry pockets are a major plus. XXL fits my 6'2&#34;, 225 frame perfectly."
5.0,Gorgeous item. My only complaint was the delayed delivery.
5.0,This was a really cute outfit. It was nicely made and the location of the zipper was better than most sleepers.
5.0,I am 5'8 and 138 lbs. I purchased a 2XL and the fit is good. A little snug but it loosens up in the water. Nice and stretchy for water aerobics. In winter I am wearing it over a fleece-lined rash guard for extra warmth.
5.0,Nice clean two sided charms.
5.0,Fits as expected. Cute!
5.0,"Firstly, the costume is a better material and quality than the ones you buy at the popup Halloween stores. While you may not win any hardcore cosplay conventions with one, it's definitely detailed enough and well-made enough to rock with confidence.<br />The costume came with black gakuran jacket and hakama pants (should technically be brown but still look great and even have the a large kanji character in white, ”滅” metsu, meaning ""extermination"" on the back!), a white belt, as well as his signature white-triangle patterned, yellow and orange gradient haori!! it even comes with tabi socks and a calf sleeve in the same pattern as the haori. The kid loved it and it looks great. The only things needed to complete the cosplay would be a katana, wig, and sandals."
5.0,Great fit.. Love them
5.0,hope I won t lose those gem too fast<br /> look  like real<br />love it
5.0,"Since I don't like to wear a watch, this is an excellent alternative for me. As a retired RN I like the upside down effect."
5.0,Love the feel and fit of them!
5.0,"These are great!! Can wear for long periods of time without bothering my super sensitive ears. Listing is for gold studs. I didn't read the fine print and purchased, thinking I was buying silver. When I received and contacted the seller, they responded right away and sent me silver tone,even though it was my mistake! How awesome is that?! Highly recommend these earrings and seller!! Thank you!"
5.0,"Outstanding cufflinks, they sparkle beautifully in the sunlight! Great when you need gold accents for a special occasion or a big business meeting. I recieved an impressive amount of compliments on them straight away. Thank you JBlue, for selling a wonderful product, I'll be returning for more cufflinks and rings!"
5.0,The cap is adjustable and it's easy to put a head full of hair in the cap I just love it .
5.0,Very sturdy.  My original bracelet came apart after 14 years.  This was so much easier to attach to my tag.  I would recommend to anyone.
5.0,"Fits well, well made. Thicker cotton."
5.0,Simple for everyday. .a simple an settle look.
5.0,Size 14-16 and this fits perfect. Little below the knee. Great cover up

5.0,"These are the same as the ones you can buy elsewhere, but for a lot less money. I feel like we just cut out the middle man!  No problems at all, same manufacturer and fit is the same.  I have purchased 2 jerseys from this same seller and both have arrived earlier than expected, free of any quality issues."
5.0,"I love this. Just a little too small, Anyone who orders this order next size up. But I still love this and it is long. This needs pants to match it."
5.0,nice for hidding belly
5.0,Thanks to inspired silver! Excellent customer service!! Necklace is beautiful! Good quality!
5.0,"very lovely, I have to have my piercer put them in, as this will be my first time, but even though they're a little thick, the hoop my piercer put in my ear is pretty thick, so hopefully there will be no problem."
5.0,"Muy bonito, quedo perfecta la talla elegida"
5.0,I like how it looks as a part of my collection
5.0,Tried it on and it feels absolutely soft. The Velcro strap for the mask is really nice since I can adjust it unlike the ones where it's just one elastic strap.
5.0,It is betiful and nice pants. The actual size match the size chart. Very satisfied.
5.0,My son is four but in 3t shorts. These fit perfectly for now. Nice and snug and soft.

5.0,I usually wear a size medium and after reading reviews I ordered a large. Fit perfect!
5.0,Nice and long!!!
5.0,The product works as advertised
5.0,"These are a very attractive pair of pants.  They can be worn as dress pants or casual, depending on you choice of top and shoes.  I am 5'2 weigh 105 and in jeans I wear size 0.  It is very hard to find size 0 in nice fabric, so I am so happy that the size S fits me very nicely, with a little room.  If they shrink a bit in the dryer they will fit even better!"
5.0,"Adorable, quality product. My 3 year old wears it every chance she gets. We’ve washed it several times and it’s still in great shape. It looks so adorable on her !!!"
5.0,Gamer socks were perfect for my son

5.0,It's actually a really cute wallet
5.0,"The title says it all. I bought this because I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I needed it for a mud race. It held up really well, kept me warm and the price was spot on. Buy it."
5.0,Probably the best sweat vest I’ve purchased ! This makes you sweat ! I wanted to wear it a few times to give a honest review on this product ! If your looking for something to sweat this is perfect
5.0,The best present ever on my wedding for my groosman
5.0,"This was perfect for my brothers ashes. The black represents him well, as well as the heart. The smooth texture is nice too, especially if you fidget and like to rub smooth surfaces."
5.0,This dress is amazing. Very beautiful and comfortable. It looks more expensive than it is. I’m 5’5” and 120 and ordered an 8 because I like things a little roomy. It fit nicely.
5.0,They were cute & fit just fine. Went well with the outfit she wore.
5.0,Love these earrings and got many compliments!

5.0,The pants are very comfortable
5.0,Fit my grandson's good and they both like wearing the masks.

5.0,been looking for this style of panties for a long time. The fit and material is great. Although each pair after wearing one time developed a small hole on the left side at the waist band line on all pairs.
5.0,"Kid likes them, which is important. They came with a hard case shaped like a car, a silky pouch and a cleaning cloth, so justify a little higher price compared to other shades we've bought the kids, and they are polarized."
5.0,"I have so many bags in my closet, I finally found the perfect one!  Has plenty of room for my wallet, cellphone, iPad and other stuff, if necessary.  I love the extra long strap so I can wear it as a crossbody bag.  Great quality, great price.  Highly recommend seller!"

5.0,Love them for the price

5.0,"Soft material, form fitting, fit to size. (Small)"
5.0,"Nice belt for the money.  Was a bit long but super easy to trim down to the right length once I figured out how to open the buckle.  Yes instructions were sent, just didn't see them right away.  Better to order it long.  Too short is not good."
5.0,It is cute and dressy enough for any occassion.
5.0,"Love the product for what they cost. I get so many compliments on them every time I wear them, friends ask to borrow them, they’re lightweight and the tassels don’t fray as easily as others have. I do add a rubber stopper backing to ensure they don’t come off."
5.0,Love the sparkle these give off. the cut has them sparkle and they are larger than i expected but fun and with the dress up outfit they will go great.

5.0,It’s a little more snug than I would like. Great other than that.
5.0,"Besides having to level, it’s awesome that you have the option on mounting.  I have to move them, but if I didn’t have the option, I couldn’t move them.  Then there is a cover, so that you don’t have to see the screws.  Another plus was that there are 2 holes that if you put 2 blinds up you can put 2 opposite ends together."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5c7ac702dc7ccd34c186bb60c0c448ad]] Super cute! The shoulder openings give it an elegant touch. It had a really bad chemical smell when it arrived but it was fine after a wash. The color is more of a cream, not white. If you look in the picture my boots are actually white, but they still worked. I’m 5’10” 190lbs, 38 G and the XL fit me great. Worth the price."
5.0,"These pants are so comfortable.  They are also a ""dress up or dress down"" item.  The color is rich and colorfast.  I will purchase more of these."

5.0,My grandson loved it! Fits well.
5.0,"I love these yoga pants! I have 2 pair of the long ones and 5 pair of the short. I prefer the length of the shorter ones. I am 5’4”; the long ones bunch up around my ankles because they are a little too long for me. I love how these fit around my stomach and waist though. My waist and hip measurements are 33” and 43”, I ordered the XL."
5.0,They fit perfect and was delivered earlier than expected .....the shoes are great !!!
5.0,"For the price, they are good glasses alternative to spending $$$ and they sink. Get a couple pairs for the boat, car and pool."

5.0,I bought this for my 11 year old and loves it. Fits perfectly and the blue is so pretty.
5.0,I ordered XL because I have long arms and most jackets I need a Large even tho I'm a medium sleeveless.  I'm 5'5&#34; 132 the bottoms are a big big but I'll just take them in with a stitch. Because the jacket is everything!! Really quality for the price.

5.0,I like the fabric.  Nice quality; doesn’t feel cheap.  Also love how it fits. Have gotten lots of compliments on it!
5.0,"I love the print and versatility of the bottoms. Perfect for showing patriotism. The straps on the top are great because they cross in the back and don't put a strain on your neck. I like the I am a 34D and the top covers just enough. If you're shy, you probably won't like it."
5.0,Quality is excellent. Exactly as described. I ordered a Med so as to fit over a sweater/sweatshirt and it fits great. Love the collar and sleeves. This is such a cute cardigan and I love it!! I may order more in other colors!!!  Highly recommend!!!!!
5.0,He loved them. All else too.
5.0,"This t-shirt is so cute and comfortable.  I am 5ft 2in and weigh 135 and the medium fits me just right,  The colors are bright and pretty. It is well made and easy to launder."

5.0,Loved this set. Super comfortable. I was a little worried about sizing but it fit perfectly. Will definitely be ordering in more colors. My only problem is that I do wish they had it in black.
5.0,fit great and is a super cute swimsuit cover up.  Shows just enough so that it does not look like a dress that is too short but still is modest enough for a real swimsuit cover up.  Comfortable and washes well.  Long enough- I am 5'8&#34; and 120lbs and it goes past my butt but is not too long.
5.0,Love It 😍🤩 Thanks so much
5.0,"At the start of a little wind storm the other day, I went out to roll up our shades.  The wind caught the shade against the rod and broke the plastic loop off.  A quick search found the replacement part and easy to replace."
5.0,Firm enough to hold your jeans up and stretchy enough to put the pants on with ease. Well crafted and nice leather applications in the stress points.
5.0,I bought a size 10 or my tall 7 year old son. got a size larger to fit him a while. Washes well feels soft and great for camp after swimming. Not bulky so he fits it into his camp bag. Really happy with this robe. not like others which are completely useless for kids. it really dries him
5.0,Really happy with this purchase.
5.0,So comfortable and warm! And soooo waterproof! Will buy Baretraps again! Very happy with this boot! Try them you wont be sorry!
5.0,Great length for a shorty like me. It can be difficult for me to find a maxi dress without it being a bit too long. I do not always wish to wear heels with my dresses. I got plenty of complements at work and it looked great with a colorful blazer. Considering buying other colors for the spring/summer time.
5.0,"Very comfortable, easy to move around in"
5.0,"Makes the statement, I wanted"
5.0,Fits my elongated torso well and doesn't shrink in the wash to create a belly shirt.
5.0,"These earrings are very beautiful.  For me, they are the perfect size hoop, not too big or too small but very visible because of the sparkle.  I also really like that they are stainless steel at a very good price.  I have ordered all three colors.  More colors please."
5.0,"I'm a 36B and its really hard to find bras that look nice on me since I use to be very over-weight during puberty.  I'm now 34 and I've never been perky, even when I'm in top shape. But I'm only a B cup and could probably squeeze into an A depending on the bra. I wore this today and not only did the brand have my odd size of 36B but it didn't look weird under my t-shirt like some sports bras do. The girls weren't bouncing like crazy during a high impact work-out either. I would even feel comfortable wearing it with no shirt once I get a flatter stomach."
5.0,This must be one of the best sales for two they are not at all flimsy or cheap looking they appear to be strong and durable they are exactly as pictures of not better o have not yet worn them but I look forward to doing so soon !
5.0,These were a gift for my 20 year old daughter. She really liked the look and feel and thought they would be perfect for winter driving or walking to class.
5.0,"nice fit, slimming comfortable"
5.0,Easy to assemble. Very cool under the shade! (My patio is now habitable). Great that it’s so easy to rotate and tilt the umbrella for a small person like me. Highly recommended!
5.0,After giving the gift I was told it is amazing! It fits great with some room so she can wear it for more than a year! The mom loves the fact that she can wear it all the time because it looks like a real dress not like a dress up dress!
5.0,Es simplemente perfecto. Excedió mis expectativas. El pompon se quita y se pone con ayuda de un broche. Es simplemente perfecto. La mejor inversión que he hecho.
5.0,"These shorts are comfortable and the fabric is good quality.  They have lots of pockets and the fact that they are quick-dry, makes them perfect for all outdoor activities.  They run a little large, so I would recommend that you order a size smaller than your normal pant size.  Since they have elastic waist, they stretch for a comfortable fit."
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this purse. And I'm pretty happy with the size and ho wit can just be worn everywhere. At the store, I don't have to worry that my purse is in my cart. And my credit cards and phone info are safe from sniffers. I notice that my phone doesn't log in to my home wireless while it's inside this purse, so I know it's safe when I'm out, even if the compartments are open."
5.0,"When I start traveling again, my suitcase will definitely include the two Black Bagvio packing cubes. They come in many colors and configurations - the two I have are black - and the sides are tight. You can’t stuff willy-nilly but they are perfect for folded clothes and files. The bottoms have two zippers so they can expand to hold more. They fit nicely into both a briefcase and a roll-aboard. Good quality."
5.0,My daughter loved it....
5.0,"Heavy, warm, and comfortable"
5.0,Very comfortable & they wash very well.
5.0,Love them!!  Want more!
5.0,Love them...my favorite jean!!
5.0,Great hat …<br />It literally came in a crumpled ball..<br />The company who shipped it needs to get its act together… No reflection on Amazon<br />I had to shape and starch it to the way I wanted.. I’ve gotten many compliments on it.<br />Great value<br />Thank you Amazon
5.0,Loveeee this dress! My only issue is that the strings on the side were abnormally long. But I cut them and problem solved. Great stretchy material. Dress keeps it shape and is thick enough that you can’t see through it but not bulky.
5.0,Needed these for twin grandsons and they worked perfectly.
5.0,Nice heavy metal.  Exactly as described.
5.0,"love them,"
5.0,"I used the sizing recommendations, and it fitted perfectly. The fabric was soft with some stretch. I washed it in the washer and air dried it as the words were vinyl."
5.0,I love  it ! A classic
5.0,Great color light weight
5.0,My wife really does like it.
5.0,Pretty good Apple Watch band . I love the color I got and it’s cute.

5.0,Gonna keep it and lose a few LBS and it will fit just fine!
5.0,I ordered this for my 5 year old and she loved it! I was nervous about the crown breaking but you can slide it on like a normal crown or wear it like a headband. She loves all of it! The gloves fit perfect.
5.0,"The quality of the tie is great but the color in the picture shows a fire orange tie. When I received it, it was actually a much lighter orange so I returned it. They sell these in many colors so maybe they just didn't have a picture or the lighting was off. I still will give 5 stars because the quality off the tie was so good and the return was no problem at all. A good seller for sure."
5.0,My new faves. They are very comfortable and stay in place on my large bum. Very soft and provide a small amount of tummy control.
5.0,These are great for protecting your shoes and the service was great. Very satisfying experience!
5.0,"Beautiful! Ive worn the earrings several times, they are delicate in appearance but sturdy. The posts are not easily  to bend."
5.0,Great little shoe for my granddaughter
5.0,I was very impressed with the quality for the price; these look very good and are of a nice quality.

5.0,very strong dont break
5.0,Exactly as stated. Fast shipAplus
5.0,Beautiful leather and great fit. I couldn't be happier
5.0,"We have some small faces over here, and have tried many masks to fit without big folds or gaps at the cheeks. This is it! Very well made, no strings or frays at the seems, lightweight but good protection. I worked in the southern humid heat for a full day in this and did fine. If you've got a smaller structure to your face, I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,"Doesn’t fall out, been wearing for a month now and no discoloration"
5.0,"This is a really soft, large and warm sweater. It is perfect for frequent flying and cold weather.<br />The body of the sweater is huge while the sleeves are narrow; the neck is long and easily pulled up over my head in a snowstorm!"
5.0,Very beautiful shoes! I ordered a half size up and they fit perfect!
5.0,I absolutely love this dress!!! Fits amazing!! Colors are vivid!! Everything I expected! And more!
5.0,This is one of the handiest travel cases we have.because it expands or contracts as required to fit what we need to take on the trip.  Because it has trolly wheels and is narrow makes it is easy to maneuver on an airplane.  We have used it on several trips already and are very happy with this purchase.l.  .
5.0,Its super comfy and i love the stretchy-ness when i'm doing my workouts and living life
5.0,Like but to big
5.0,Fits great and is comfortable. I plan to buy another one.
5.0,I love these leggings. I have 8 pair! I wish there was more choices in patterns for the plus size gal.
5.0,"It’s always a little scary buying something with zero reviews, but this strap is GREAT! It’s super cute, sturdy/durable, doesn’t look cheap, and a great length. I added it to a plain black croc style purse from Nordstrom. I’ve never gotten more compliments on a bag. People ask me if it’s designer all the time (and no one ever noticed/complimented my bag before me adding the strap lol). It also came with a brightly colored, patterned, silk-like neck scarf (like the kind people tie on purses). So that was a great surprise too! If I had a white purse I loved, I’d buy the white strap too."
5.0,"ordered 2 sizes bigger fit perfect a little lose but still good, looking back would have ordered 1 size up....I am 5'2&#34; 180lbs ordered a XXL"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. I used this floral crown in my maternity photos. It was the perfect touch for one of my looks! I've used it since then for several day parties and outings. The flowers are full and I haven't had any issues with anything coming loose.
5.0,It’s a Beautiful dress. I ordered the olive green one and I’m so happy I did! It fits perfectly and has a zipper that runs along one side so it makes putting this dress on so much easier. I followed the size chart and after reading reviews decided on ordering a Small... I’m 5’1 and a 127lbs. And the Small fit me perfectly. Thinking of getting more in different colors. So happy with my purchase!
5.0,Great short length. Very comfortable and adjustable bra straps. True to size
5.0,My co worker loved it
5.0,"What's there to say? It tells me the time and it doesn't break when I wash my hands up to the elbow. The method for changing alarm settings was a little arcane, but easy enough to look up and remember. A great device for the price."
5.0,Nice 80s look
5.0,"I liked this band very much. I have a very small wrist and have a lot of trouble finding bands that fit properly. So far this band hasn’t stretched out or had any discoloration, and I wear this EVERY DAY."
5.0,light weight easy to breath through.
5.0,Provides a lot of shade. Very nice. Love it.
5.0,Looks good. Works great.
5.0,Super soft and warm and cozy
5.0,I prefers another brand but these are great to put in our camper and no refrigeration is needed.
5.0,I love it! I haven’t worn it out yet because spring has not sprung but it fits and is adorable.
5.0,"Fit is great. I normally wear a lg and that's what I ordered. They don't roll down on the waist, the pockets are awesome and perfect size...and my husband won't stop looking at booty.... we're both winning."
5.0,"I got this for my sister in law last year.. just saw it hanging on her keychain the other day.. hardly any scratches, still in great shape. & she has 3 boys and is the carpool mom so you know those keys get used!"
5.0,There are 3 and for a good price. It's exactly like the pictures and it does extend. They are thin and light weight perfect for toddlers and even for adults. The kids were able to catch butterfly & moth. I would recommend.
5.0,Hey Tim it's Christmas time. Have not even opened it but it looks pretty and thanks for Askng.  Love judy
5.0,"I bought a size small. I'm 5'7.5"" tall, weight 140lbs, am a 34E bra size and the small fits perfect. It's a little long but not bad. Super cute with skinny jeans and kitten heels. I have several designs in this style. I wanted to put all my dimensions because no one ever seems to give all the info. The straps also have an adjustment so you can make them longer or shorter. Looks cute with a racer back thin strap bra. The V embroidery is high quality. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Let’s just say this dress has pockets ! Great quality comfortable and not tight
5.0,I love this it is easy to clean it's a nice material and it looks beautiful in pictures

5.0,"love this jumpsuit! i got it in black and green. i  thought that it would be the same but the black one was heavier material I don't know why, but both of them good quality. i bought one similar off lulus.com for 3x the price and actually like this one better. Had to get it altered but still so worth it!"
5.0,"Bought these as a birthday gift for my grandson's 9th birthday. He loves all things Mine Craft, so I'm sure he'll love the sunglasses. They are good quality glasses, UV protection, and colors are bright as shown. They are so funky I'd love a pair for myself!  Good purchase."
5.0,"I love this Fossil, I have so many that I love the fact that you don't have to worry about the battery. The BEST thing about this watch is the wind indicator dial that tells you how much you have wound it by moving your wrist around."
5.0,Such a great prop for my 1 year old daughters photo shoot. She looked adorable.
5.0,"Great price, product and service.  Would use again"

5.0,I loved the color.  It was a little hard to breathe but served my purpose.
5.0,Our daughter-in-law loved them.
5.0,"These socks are super good.<br />I really like the thin socks especially in summer. The size is good for men size 11. Since I have not washed them once, I don't know whether the quality is also good but I hope so.<br />If the quality is still good after washing in machine, I will defenitely purchase more."
5.0,I like quality and sparkle. Goes with everything.  Very happy.
5.0,"I've ordered two, one white and another black. My customers have loved their watches!"
5.0,Super stylish and very comfortable<br /> Able to wear with casual and fancy clothing<br />Very worth to buy
5.0,"Ordered the XL in green. I'm 5'4&#34;and 180#....fits beautifully. ...... the fabric feels so good to the touch, but it is a heavy dress..... don't wear it to your annual physical. ..lol"
5.0,the outfit was so cute and perfect fit!
5.0,They were exactly as described and fit perfectly.
5.0,Looks really good. High quality stuff for less price.
5.0,Love this band! It looks so slick and fancy. I can’t wait to wear it to more formal events. It comes with a little tool to take off or add chains.
5.0,"I received a beautiful assortment! But they do run small so if you have big hands or wrists, you may want to find some you can try on first. But otherwise, I love :)"
5.0,I love these. They have adjustable ear straps and the material is not too thick or too thin.
5.0,I am giving it as a gift but not until September.  I know she will love it.
5.0,I love these. I bought them after trying my sons and I was blown away by how well these work. I will definitely be buying more for my family.
5.0,My husband loves this tie! He hates wearing ties but he loves the mets so it was like a happy compromise!

5.0,I love these shoes.  Great as water shoes and comfortable enough to wear daily.
5.0,Fits well. Cozy! Nice colors.
5.0,Very nice sunglasses at a very nice price.
5.0,This is a great onesie.  The material is VERY soft and it fits as expected.  This washes well and looks great on.  Definitely a must for anyone that is a fan of the Beatles....and who wouldn't be?
5.0,I wear one of these every day and get loads of compliments
5.0,my 9 year old loves these!
5.0,Super good quality.
5.0,"I had a couple of these visors for years and years, and they finally wore out.  I use them for outrigger paddling.  They are comfortable, the gel makes them fit better, and adds a little weight so they don't blow off.  They even float in the water.  Do they keep you cooler?  Maybe - they seem to."
5.0,A quality product which I highly recommend. Service first rate.
5.0,Love this handbag.  It was great to take on my vacation and not worry that anyone would be scanning my cards and stealing my identity.  I would definitely buy another one when this one is worn out.
5.0,"Outstanding watch and value.  What more can I say, well worth the slightly delayed Amazon Prime delivery from overseas.  Very sturdy, and I expect it will serve me for years.  Haven't tried it underwater yet but will soon."
5.0,This tshirt is too large and looks as expected. The pattern on the sleeves adds to the cuteness and uniqueness of the shirt. Great shirt. Great for the cost.
5.0,"This is the identical wallet my husband had for many years. Some of the card slots had gotten a bit loose, although the wallet still looked great. I surprised him with a new one! It is lightweight, carries well, is beautiful, and unique!"
5.0,"At first I was skeptical whether the ratchet system would hold the belt well, but so far I have no issues with the ratchet buckle system once it has been adjusted.  Actual belt material seems well crafted and firm, does not seem like it will wear out fast like other belts in the same price range."
5.0,Unique silver brooch. Looks great on a blazer!
5.0,Used this as a gift bag for a bach. They are a decent size and held everything I needed them to. Looks just like the pics.
5.0,Finally a top that fits fuller sizes
5.0,Great case. Buying another for my wife.
5.0,"I needed another bathrobe but one for a girl this time who loves purple.  Once again I went to my favorite place to shop--Amazon.  I found the perfect robe,it was plush, attractive and purple.  She loves it.  The vendor provided a quality product and delivered it on time."

5.0,These socks are just great fun!!!  I bought them for gifts and for myself.  I expect everyone to smile when they get them!!!
5.0,"Overall this Balaclava has been great value for money. It's comfortable, stretchy - not windproof - but for me adequately warm even in single digit temps with a breeze. If I were to criticize one thing - it would be that there is a seam right in the middle of the mouth area which is not uncomfortable per se - but would be better if it were elsewhere"
5.0,Sexy. Super fly.
5.0,"Very pretty. I wish the tree wasn’t loose but, small problem. Got this for my mom for her birthday and she loved it."
5.0,"Overall I loved the dress! I purchased a Large it was a little loose, but I made it work."

5.0,I like them they brighten up the day!

5.0,This is the most comfortable item in my wardrobe. I wear it often. I may order another one. I wish it came in multiple colors.
5.0,"Its very long, but I am 5'3"""

5.0,Always perfect Pandora!
5.0,Fit was nice and like the colors
5.0,I LOVE this key ring!! Super durable and great for when I am running errands. Just slide it right on to my wrist and keys are out of the way! No more concerns of accidentally putting my keys down when I am out and about and forget! Or having a lanyard getting caught on something as I walk by! The print is SUPER CUTE!! And great quality and the tassle is a super adorable accessory. The door key is awesome! I purchased a other door keys in the past and broke right away not this one!! I am super happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Very true to size, sturdy fabric good zipper not see through. Covers everything and looks very cute on. True to size and not “clingy”"

5.0,"I love the fit, feel and look of these guality grest firbthe price.'shopping for mire"
5.0,"One size only, but it fits my head just fine. It looks great. I'm not really a hat person, but I don't mind wearing this one in public."
5.0,"After looking at previous reviews, my husband and I were wary about purchasing, as well as unsure of which size to order. However, it fit perfectly and despite the price we feel the quality is rather exceptional! He is 6'2&#34;, terribly thin, very long legs, and the small size fit great, long enough and everything."
5.0,I’m a huge marvel fan and this is perfect for any fan to relax and lounge in. I’m a girl and bought men’s small and I like them loose so these are perfect
5.0,"good craftsmanship and workmanship, great quality and the lady is happy, elite expressions and the need to express desire to share the leather scent is noted."
5.0,So you can feel like you go to Harvard as you leave Community College to go to work.
5.0,"These shorts are really cute and comfortable,  look just as pictured.<br /><br />Sizing - no need to size up.  I'm 5'5"", 145 lbs and the large is a bit baggy, but still looks good.  Would've been fine with a medium though."
5.0,"Works very well over my prescription glasses, like the style, and fits the shape of my face, even it is a bit big. Nice light through the protective glasses, not too dark, for a reasonable price. Bought me a second one in a different color, so I always have one handy at home for going out and in my car."
5.0,This hat is so adorable and good quality knitting.  It looks so cute on my granddaughter!  I would buy more of these hats!!
5.0,Perfect. Loved it. I get so nervous to order clothes online especially since I can never even find any in stores I like and fit well ever since all my babies and haven’t managed to lose any weight yet and have too much around my waist. Nice thicker material so it doesn’t feel see through or cheap at all! Perfect length for me I am 5’9” Hides the leftover baby weight  in hips and stomach pretty well I don’t feel super self conscious in this dress
5.0,Got this for my daughter and her college roommate who currently attending SDSU.  They loved it.  They wear it with other Alex and Ani bracelets.
5.0,It is really nice conceals well
5.0,Perfect size for mask

5.0,I love this watch it gets so much attention from others
5.0,"Great, comfortable, casual summer dress.  Nice fabric, not that see thru stuff you often get at this price range."
5.0,"Don’t know why there are so many bad reviews. This watch is super pretty, Looks just like the picture, is soft, and is lightweight. A lot more comfortable than other nylon bands. I noticed it’s no longer available, which makes me sad because if I end up wearing mine out, I can’t get a replacement."
5.0,Bought this for my grandson who is 4. He wanted to get dressed up when his sister does. So cute and he loved all the extra accessories.
5.0,I loveee this bathing suit! Don’t think about it just buy it lol the colors are vibrant and it’s great quality. I’m a 34DD and I bought size 12-14
5.0,This pjs material feels super soft. I will buy it again.
5.0,10 beehaws out of 10 beehaws. cute pin
5.0,These are super cute & very nice looking. Very happy I got them.
5.0,Sun protection keeps you cooler
5.0,I truly love this waist trainer😍😍😍
5.0,I love this dress. It is very flattering and comfortable.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, and exactly as pictured/described.  Seems to be of good quality fabric and workmanship."
5.0,These are so simple but so cute at the same time. I gave one to some male friends so it seems to be unisex. I would for sure order more in the future.
5.0,"Wore the product for the first time February 1 ,2020 and it fell apart heads  were everywhere so embarrassed, because I got so many comments on how pretty it was. Feel apart in front of everyone. Wish I could get my money back."
5.0,I’m not a dangly earring kinda gal but here we are. These were so perfect for my recent beach vacation. Great quality and goes with pretty much any outfit if you’re going for a beachy vibe
5.0,These fit me perfectly and are comfortable.  I bought them because I frequently cut myself while preparing food and these do what they're supposed to.
5.0,SOOOO CUTE!!!
5.0,"These would be the best performing grocery bags I’d ever used even if they were made of plastic-coated baby seal skins. The fact that they’re made of compostable materials is icing on the cake and proof that you don’t need to sacrifice performance to be eco-friendly.<br /><br />In short, the bags are perfect in every way: well made, sturdy, easily folded to stow, and great for carrying full loads of groceries or whatever else you need to transport, even heavy items.<br /><br />I bought these for grocery shopping but they’re so great, I use them for all my shopping. In the picture, one bag is loaded with 6 large Yankee jar candles—which, though heavy and easily breakable, I had no qualms about carrying through the mall in this bag because I knew the bag would hold (and it did).<br /><br />Unless you live alone, buy two sets of these to get six bags as you’ll need four to five bags to carry a cart load full of groceries."
5.0,"I love that these or mostly White, not see through. Though, I do wear an oversized shirt because I'm pretty modest. They were great in the hot sun cycling, they were cooler than the black ones I had. I would buy more white ones for cycling on a trike. That's where the sun strikes most of your body because you're laying flat on the trike."
5.0,"Please know that I write this as someone who is VERY picky about her fashion and accessories. I work hard for my $$$ and think of ALL of my purchases as a self-investment that needs to have style and staying power. Classics, not fads! Having said that...I just received my Satchel in the mail today...fast shipping...Star #1. The first thing (both my 15 year old son and) I noticed was the smell of the leather....Star #2. Then I noticed the beauty and high-end look of the bag...Star #3. The magnetic closure and structure gets it Star #4 and the overall style, size and construction gets it the whole-package-Star #5!!! I will DEFINITELY order a Pijushi again....and again..."
5.0,"I'm a size 12, ordered the medium and it fits great.  I love my Slayer hoodie.  Been a fan for thirty years!!"
5.0,"Soft, comfortable and a great fit!!"
5.0,Packaged neatly. Product is exactly as shown as described.
5.0,love this top.. hope to order other colors soon....
5.0,Great Value for the Price. Was comfortable for the most part and was able to fit everything in it for my backpacking trip.
5.0,"awesome, I bought these for my mom for mothers day and they were so much nicer than i thought they would be,  they shipped fast and were in nice little jewelry box with paperwork proof of authantisity.  I would recommend this product"
5.0,I loved this dress! Stretchy material and it was very flattering for my holiday party for work. I went with a Medium and am glad I did because since the material was a little stretchy it fit like a glove. It even hid the little tummy I have left from having a baby earlier this year. :-)
5.0,The only thing is logo is straight in pic but it's slightly cockeyed
5.0,Love it wish the size was just a little bigger
5.0,I really love this dress! I am 5’7 170 pounds and the large fit perfect. The tie at the waist is super flattering and the material isn’t too thin or too thick so it is very comfortable! I ordered it in the dark green for Christmas and I loved it so much I then ordered it in black for work!
5.0,"Great product, got it as a gift for a friend, because she cut her hair and reminded me of Mikasa haha. It's a bit large, but it's a scarf and can be adjusted and worn many ways, worth the $6!"
5.0,"I bought these, not for scarves, but to use on my shirts rather than tucking them or tying a knot. They create a very neat and attractive alternative to a knot. Further, you can adjust them to just the exact placement. I read in other reviews that because they are a bit heavy, people have lost them because they slipped off...so, I opted to secure with a safety pin on the fabric underneath the clip to make sure that did not happen. That works! Love them!!!  :)"
5.0,Bought this as a gift and my mom wears it everyday
5.0,Delivery took TOO long. Product is quite attractive.
5.0,This fit really well true to size for a tall thin kid. We use it for a Acro theme of video games and she was dressing up as link. It worked really well for the purpose
5.0,"So often I'm  not able to find a nice looking dress, because of my shape. My x-large size is mainly on my hips and thighs, not the breasts, so when I buy x-large, the breast area is way too roomy, yet the waist-down fits. However with this dress , it fit perfect and complimented my short waist. Love it!!!"
5.0,"I really like it and even wore it to work on a business casual day. It's comfortable, cute, and not too short. Tge only thing I don't love is the bright white eyelet for earbud cables to feed through, it would be nice if that blended with the fabric."
5.0,Looove my stance socks. Great fit. Soft material. They’re perfect!
5.0,Beautiful and quality made.  Well worth the purchase.
5.0,Very beautiful pajma
5.0,Love to material
5.0,Love it so much! Definetly worth it compared to buying a barbell at hot topic or the mall for $15-$30!
5.0,Very cute order a size up
5.0,love the fact that this bracelet is adjustable.
5.0,"Amazing dress! I wore this to a Black Tie Gala and got so many compliments! Definitely looks like a high-quality designer dress! I would not recommend this dress if you will be outside in any way shape or form though, anything/everything (grass, mulch, etc.) gets stuck in the bottom very easily."
5.0,"Love these socks. Great prices, and great feel"
5.0,super cute and warm for my 5 year old.
5.0,"Very cool product!!!! The fabric is soft and well put together!!! The product is very much what is advertised. I would not have a problem buying from them again, I love how comfortable it is to wear"
5.0,My son loves it. Good quality
5.0,So far the earring backs have been amazing.  I was hesitant as my earrings are not only expensive but very sentimental.  I would by LuxLocks again.... in a heartbeat!  Great product.  Thank you!
5.0,"I only had one nursing bra and it was this one, It got washed and worn constantly. I loved it. Only problem I had with it was that the clips were a little stiff when I first got it which is stressful when you are dealing with a hungry screaming newborn so I would suggest wearing it before the baby is born and getting used to the buckles so when the time comes you can undo it one handed...with a screaming newborn in your other arm :)"
5.0,Such a great value!  With numeric sizing these leggings fit perfectly. I have 5 pair and my daughter has 5 pair ... we are sold. They are on par with Lulu and Athleta leggings ... for a quarter of the price.
5.0,"I had never used packing cubes and was headed for an 11 day tour. It's amazing how much you can get into these and how well they hold everything in place.  The zippers are sturdy, I could see enough through the mesh to know what was in each, and they did not add any weight to my suitcase.  I also took another reviewers advice and rolled my clothing for the first time.  Now I see how that's extremely practical being able to grab an item without riffling through the whole stack.  I compared prices before buying (Target, Macy's) and these are the same thing for much less $$."
5.0,"I purchased a little too small, but the seller was quick to respond and took care of it immediately"
5.0,This was a 5t (not her size) but she fit it perfectly. (It’s an over size shirt.)
5.0,Soft and for me
5.0,cute shoes and very comfortable fit even though i ended up returning them only because i did not need them
5.0,Beautiful watch for the money. Works very well so far.
5.0,"Love this dress! I ordered a large and it fits great!  This dress can be casual or you can dress it up and make it perfect for a date night. I usually have a really hard time finding dresses I like, but this was a total win! I will definitely be ordering more of these."
5.0,My daughter bought this sweatshirt for herself and couldn’t be happier. She loves the graphics and it fits great.
5.0,It was perfect. Just the right size.  The quality is superb. I have wanted one to wear with my miniature medals on my tux for a long time.
5.0,Very nice hats for the price. I bought them as a donation to our local homeless shelter and was very happy to find this economical pack of hats. This way I was able to afford to give so many.
5.0,"This hat is soooo cute. I bought it for my Mom who is going through chemo and radiation. She loves it. It is also soft on her scalp. I was afraid it would be itchy but she said it is comfy and soft. I've purchased several hats, beanies and scarves for her but this one got the biggest smile. Definitely ordering more colors."
5.0,My 4.5 year old hasn’t wanted to take this shirt off since he received it! He says he’s “transforming“ into Iron Man when he pulls the hood over his head. I feel like the sizing runs right on target.
5.0,beautiful.  Get compliments on it
5.0,I love the glasses but a screw has already fallen out.  Had them 3 days and off to the repair shop already!  Grrrrr!
5.0,"Very cute and well made. Perfect for athletic builds. I'm 5,2&#34; - 115# and a small fits perfectly!  Not tight but drapes over curves. Love it!"
5.0,"The image on this tee looks exactly like my Persian when she's about to take her nap, so of course I had to order it! It's great for those days when you just need to take it easy - and it's even better if you have a cat to match.<br />I ordered a size Small. The size chart was a little odd, since it only featured width and length as the measurements. But I usually order Small and decided to give it a shot. My measurements are 34C, 27"" waist, and the top was a perfect fit. The material is a bit stretchy so instead of a loose fit, it clings to my curves. It's 95% cotton, but that 5% of spandex makes the difference. If you're looking for a slouchy, sleep shirt look, then you'll probably want to go a size or two larger."
5.0,"Super cute, fits very well, I would say that it’s a pretty short bar so don’t get this if you’re belly button is still swollen from getting it pierced"
5.0,Looks good. Like it very much. Thank you
5.0,"Love this dress, if I ordered again I’d probably size down because it’s a little big but Other than that it’s great!"
5.0,Absolutely everything advertisied to be!
5.0,Very cute and the price is great.
5.0,"It was super easy to install, & is very comfortable to wear throughout the day. I love it!"
5.0,i feel like a real woman now
5.0,"Nice shirt, breathable."
5.0,The earrings are really nice!  The color of the Amber is very crisp.  Wonderful<br />value for the price. Highly recommend.
5.0,"These are very pretty, arrived quickly."
5.0,Love how many came and how inexpensive it was and the material is great!
5.0,love it! smooth prongs over stones. really well made.
5.0,My husband LOVED it!!
5.0,"Cutest leopard print skirt! Super on trend. Good quality material and sewn well. It’s become a “go to” in my wardrobe bc you can style it SO many ways. Skirt has an elastic waist and is unlined but not see through at all.<br /><br />For reference - I’m 5’8”, 150 lbs and Med fits well (true to size)"
5.0,It is adorable.  Soft and comfy
5.0,I like this watch... but don't love it. If I had plenty of money I would add it to my collection just because it's beautiful I found it to difficult to read.<br /><br />Update May 4: I have regretted returning this since the day I sent it back. So I had to order it again! I really missed it! Of course it is not quite as easy to snap a glance to read it but it is really just... different. Wearing my glasses (which I should do anyway)<br />I really don't have any problem. Actually reads better than other negs I've had. In short I do love it! Highly recommend!<br /><br />Semper FI<br />Mike
5.0,Full grain leather. So far a good product after one week of use.
5.0,Bought this for my young-adult daughter and she loves it. The fabric is really soft and drapes well. Fit was as expected. She likes the navy color. The criss cross straps in front lay nicely when worn. Her size small measures 26&#34; top to bottom and 17&#34; from  underarm to underarm. Front and back are same length. Recommended as a cute and comfortable shirt for casual or dressier occasions.
5.0,"I love these! Exactly what I was hoping for, and better quality than I expected! The lens comes all the way to the edge of the frame, and the mirror lens is just as the picture shows. The frame of the sunglasses is sturdy and flexes enough so they won't break. And they're lightweight!"
5.0,Absolutely perfect case for the super Mario bros game and watch. Fits like a glove and worth the price.
5.0,"I have a thick black tie but I wanted to buy a thin one so I got this one. I like how it looks and how the material is a bit shinny. I included a pic of me wearing it, I should've done a different knot but still like it."
5.0,"The best chamois shirt you can get for the money ... Thicker than your standard chamois shirt. Fits well. Recommended for folks on a budget, or folks looking for a nice, thick chamois shirt."
5.0,"I gifted them to my Sister in UK .She is a nurse , she uses them with her read glasses ( she used to loose them a lot , she used them with her Masks too.<br />She really loves them. 💯✅"
5.0,I love my order.
5.0,"Was not a fan of the original, thin strap that came with my Turenne and ordered this wider one as a replacement.  Great add on to my bag.  Matches it perfectly."
5.0,Glasses arrived on time. They fit and look as pictured.
5.0,"Blouse arrived today, one day earlier than the window of expectation. The colors are vibrant, the fabric is soft and perfect for a peasant blouse. It's very roomy and the length is good on my short body. The yoke is double sided, which is nice. I don't know whether the color is good on me but with a bright lipstick I think it'll work. This will be a nice Fall top and with some turquoise jewelry I'll look like a super-model :)"
5.0,"Great product, Great price !!"
5.0,So light and sparkling
5.0,"This came so very much faster than the date it was promised.  I was very pleasantly surprised about that, as it was for a birthday gift.  The early delivery allowed me the time needed to ship it to my friend in time for her birthday.<br /><br />Great quality for a t-shirt.  It was softer than expected, which is great.  The fit seemed to coincide exactly with the size I chose.  The color of the fabric was exactly as expected.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great choice going with this company."
5.0,Daughter loved the cute  cat mood ring. Well made and sized.
5.0,These earrings are truly Beautiful and Amazing.  They show up and add sparkle to your face<br />yet they are not heavy and feel light as a feather.  The best pair of earrings that I have<br />purchased in a long time!!  I will wear them casually and for a dress up event.<br />Beyond description. They are a winner!  Thank you Honolulu Jewelry Company.
5.0,Super nice ! Love it.
5.0,loved it on my wife
5.0,It came in better than expected. I was expecting the fabric to be less thic but thank goodness it didn’t lol. Had a blast bringing this to SacAnime winter 2022 &lt;3. It was long but I don’t think that matters too much honestly
5.0,I love it! I still use it
5.0,These were a gift for my father in law former marine. He loved them and he said they were comfortable and easy to adjust.
5.0,I own several pair of compression socks.  The SB Sox are very comfortable and perform as they should.
5.0,Thick material and good quality.
5.0,Yes. It does have 925 on the back. I really like the item
5.0,I absolutely love my ear rings ..they are gorgeous and not as big as I thought they would be..perfect size and came right on time.

5.0,Bought foe my daughter during pregnancy fit perfectly and comfortable she loves it.
5.0,so cute !!!
5.0,"I bought these for my husband, he had eye surgery and needed sunglasses whenever he went outside. These made it possible for him to go swimming when we were in Hawaii. They fit really well and my husband found them to be very comfortable."
5.0,"Will be buying several more of these!!! The leg fits a bit looser in the thigh than these skinny jeans that I hate! You can sit and bend over without constantly having to pull them up. Super nice stretch and they look like jeans. I'm 5'9"" 195lbs and ordered Medium. These don't shrink! I was really worried the first time I ordered these that they would be too short but 31 1/2 inseam was perfect!! Superior comfort and style. Thank you Lands End and Amazon!!!!"
5.0,"Cute colors.  Support, but not cutting off the flow of veins and feeling."
5.0,"I have to wear a compression sleeve on my left arm due to breast cancer surgery causing lymphedema. The sleeve is ugly, so I bought these and they are fun and colorful, making me feel not quite so ugly. Thank you."
5.0,Perfect little socks!<br />Good quality.
5.0,this jacket is well-made and designed. the straps are a design element that can be tucked to the inside pockets or simply cut off to remove if you desire a straight-forward bomber. it's padded but not too padded. the zippers seem solid and should perform well. the strapped right sleeve is solely there for design too and can be cut off if safety is an issue but adds an element of modern-street design.
5.0,"Love them, I get lots of compliments!"
5.0,like it : ) i’m 5’1. Small fits okay.
5.0,These are very nice glasses! Very impressed with them and the packaging they came in! Would buy again!
5.0,"I just love these shoes, reminds me of the shoes I had in the early 80's only better. They fit great and have a rugged sole, looks like they will last a long time. One of the best fitting shoes I've ever bought. I wear an 8 wide and these 8 wide were spot on, no tight spots anywhere."
5.0,This is a great bag. No problems with carrying my bocce balls anywhere.
5.0,Absolutely great looking! My favorite and it comes with a gift :)
5.0,I saw it on a gal in a nail salon and she told me it was by Nautica and I bought it and I love it and I had an extra large but I thought I would get a double X so if I wear sweaters and that works well.
5.0,Very Happy With My Purchase!!!!
5.0,"This set was way more than I expected, it was delivered sealed as promised.<br />I bought this item because I was looking for a BRET FAVRE rookie card and this set contains 3 FAVRE cards from his rookie year.<br />Its a must have for any FAVRE FAN.<br />I tottaly recomend this 1991 UPPER DECK BOX SET its worth every penny."
5.0,This is a very nice short. Just the right length and love the pocket on the short leg.
5.0,This dress looks so beautiful. Highly recommend
5.0,"Love these bells for casual wear, especially shorts. I’m not a big guy but I appreciate the movement these belts allow. Good value also!"
5.0,Band is a bit big
5.0,"These panties are absolutely beautiful and soft. Wonderful fabric, fit and colors. Even so, I would have liked for there to be an option to buy all of one color. The dark peach color is my favorite. They are the most comfortable panties I’ve ever worn. Thank you. Highly recommend these!!!!!!!!"
5.0,Me encantó le pensé mucho por el precio 😂 pero igual esta muy bonito le quedo perfecto lo usará para su cumple años #4 las medias un poco anchas pero igual funciona
5.0,They are very easy to put on my toddler. His hands stay warm and he loves them.
5.0,This is a very nice flag it is jewelry quality.
5.0,"Funny thing is, I owned a pair of simples in high school over 10 years ago and they weren't completely un-similar. Tough construction, fun style, great colors... These shoes have been beat to crap, covered in mud/sand, bent all over the place and they still hold together almost six months later. My wife and I love these shoes. Please get them if you're on the fence. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,Was delighted this was normal sizing- have had nightmares with other amazon fashion being extremely tiny!<br />This dress is so comfortable & flattering! I just ordered it again in navy!
5.0,I turn heads when I wore this set all eyes were on me
5.0,Loved it. It's nice and comfortable and inexpensive. It's just a drop large.
5.0,Jersey looks amazing and feels amazing! High quality Jersey for the price!
5.0,"I have always admired Skagen from a far.  I am a fan of thin, minimalist watches.  Ever since I saw my first ""wafer thin"" Movado in the 90's I was hooked.<br /><br />I would spend the next 20 years or so purchasing watches that scratched that particular itch.<br /><br />And while Skagen was always on the list, there was just something about their styling that prevented me from pulling the trigger.<br /><br />That all changed with the Horisont.<br /><br />Skagen has produced a winner by completely eliminating the hour hand.  In it's place is a rotating disk with a small PIP to indicate the hour.  The minute hand is the only hand on the watch.  Interestingly, the branding is not affixed to the dial, as in most watches, but to the underside of the glass.  This ensures that the name stays at the 3 O'Clock position while the workings rotate beneath it.<br /><br />It is an absolute stunning display of minimalist design.  And while this could easily result in difficulty in reading the watch, Skagen wisely put both minute and hourly indexes on the face in concentric rings.  This makes the watch stunningly easy to read.<br /><br />This is all packaged in a nice thin stainless steel case with matching mesh bracelet, that is both comfortable and easy to adjust without the need of special tools or a jeweler.<br /><br />Many watch snobs won't give it a second look because of it's quartz beating heart, but I actually prefer my watches to be accurate.  And the fact that such a good looking watch is available at such a low price makes it an even better value proposition.<br /><br />If I could change one thing on the watch, that would be to place the index markings as well on the inside of the glass and have the entire face rotate beneath.  That would eliminate the seam between the index ring and the rotating disk.  I think that would have been really magical.  To see that hour indicator clearly imprinted on the face, but somehow also moving would really be a conversation starter<br /><br />As it is, the rotating disk currently employed offers no mystery on how it works, but Is still distinctive.  I just think they truly missed a WHAAAAT? moment.<br /><br />I really hope this ""special edition"" is a winner for Skagen.  This asthetic deserves to be explored deeper.  In an age where it seems that a lot of watches lack originality, or worse blatently copy the look of famous luxury brands,  it's nice to see at least one brand carve out it's own look and give us something different, while still maintaining the basic readability of a traditional watch."
5.0,Well made and adorable!!!
5.0,This item is exactly what I was looking for. The belt is a little over size but as per the directions a pair of scissors quickly corrects the problem. The belt has no metal which is perfect for my zinc allergy and security at the airport.
5.0,So far they have not broken off after 12 flights on checked baggage.
5.0,These bands are great for the price. The colors are as described and I like the pattern on the bands. The length of the bands are also fine for me. The circumstance of my wrist is 7 1/2 inches where I wear the band. All and all A+
5.0,"These hooks fit the Warners bra exactly as stated in the description.  They work quite well, although they do sometimes unhook when trying to attach it to the bra, but no problem during wearing said garment."
5.0,Great boots! My son loves  them<br /> They fit perfect
5.0,Highlight recommended eye glass case. It’s soft yet sturdy. It’s strong yet classy with a tough of girly. O love it.
5.0,best underwear i own! highly recommend! worth every penny!
5.0,It is really good quality
5.0,I really appreciate it coming alot sooner than what was expected it came 2weeks after ordering even though timeline says the end of August and it's June it became a surprise to myself the chain is a bit smaller than what I like so im going to put it on my other chain and use this for my sons
5.0,It was easy to replace the band with the remover kit.  Very pleased.
5.0,"I am normally a size 4 and a small fits well. The pants are comfortable and come down to the ankle. They are really thin (not see through thin) so I don't recommend them in winter months, but they are definitely worth it in the summer. The material is kind of shiny so I just pair them with a plain, loose, cotton shirt normally."
5.0,"Love it! When you attach (snap) the pouch insert inside it makes the entire bag appear smaller which is a nice switch up. The grape is true to color...very nice taupe purple color. Feels great, good quality. Ordering another one as a gift for a friend."
5.0,True to size and great price
5.0,"Got out creases with a heat gun and stretched some Mars Yard 2.0s with the help of a shoe tree, great product"
5.0,"Looks stylish. And fits shoes, bags, and belts in four colors- brown, grey, white, black. (White is not a snow-white it's more perlish) I just turn different sides. Big enough. Id recommend."
5.0,"Grate glasses, I love the fit and got another pair in black and silver."
5.0,"Just what we wanted,"
5.0,"Great fit, true to size. My daughter loved it!!"
5.0,My son is fully potty trained now and these are a good fit.
5.0,"Fit, look and work great!!!"
5.0,Product as described. Metal tiara and good quality for sash.
5.0,Cute little necklace fits more like a choker and it is thin. It looks cute with a casual outfit.
5.0,Looks like the real thing but i didn't care for the septum
5.0,"I finally found the problem to have all my glasses on one place,  I got this glasses organize to a discount price and  I love it, I keep it  under my car seat and now I can chose any pair of glass only reaching my hand. I am going to get another one, even if I have to pay the full price."
5.0,Super comfortable and soft! I was planning on using it as a swim suit cover type of thing but now I will be wearing it out!
5.0,"Great, comfortable lounge pants. My husband loves them. Fabric is like a French terry--not too heavy and not too light. He is 5'11"", 175 lbs and the size large are a little long but roomy enough to be comfortable. Really could be worn as sweat pants; they are that nice. Definitely keepers!"
5.0,5 stars because its awesome
5.0,I bought this for my friend who is a huge USC fan... He loves this belt.. He said its the best belt he has ever owned... It has the ratchet mechanism  so you can make it larger or smaller with out having to buy a new belt...
5.0,Awesome! :)
5.0,These are the best and most comfortable pants
5.0,"Too cute! I'm a Boston terrier lover and this looks very much like a BT as well as Frenchie, so I had to have it! The quality surpassed my expectations by a mile. The detail in this ring are unbelievable, from the tiny wrinkles in the face, the &quot;hair&quot; etched into the ring to the tiny paws with pads, it is absolutely beautiful.<br />I thought it might &quot;stick out&quot; to far off my hand, and while it does protrude , it's just right for me and everyone who's seen it, knows exactly what it's supposed to be and has commented how adorable it is, how they've never seen anything like it, and want to know where I got it.<br />For the price and since it said fits 3 different sizes, I really expected it to be cheaper looking, but I can't stress this enough, it's not. I have long slenderish fingers and usually can wear a ring right from the case (I think 7 is standard size) and at first I thought it was going to be too small because it didn't seem that it could be pulled to make bigger.  I carefully and slowly stretched it out until it was the perfect fit.<br />I would think if your finger was bigger than an 8 though, that it might not look right because you wouldn't have enough of the ring for it to be clear what it is.<br />My nieces loved it and now want one for Christmas (they are 7&amp;11) and the ring will be perfect for them, too.<br />I have several pieces of Boston jewelry , but this is my new favorite.  And, it DIDNT TURN MY FINGER GREEN! Can't beat it for the bulldog lover in your life!"
5.0,Love this jumpsuit! It’s very comfortable & received lots of compliments! I ordered a size up because I’m 5’10 so it worked because the top straps are adjustable:)
5.0,This is beautiful.  Love it.  Much better priced than similar ones I saw in Tahiti.  Excellent quality.
5.0,"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous. It's form fitting without being too tight, and the color is lovely (exactly as pictured). It's fine quality, just the right thickness, and retains its shape after washing. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,LOVE this dress. Fits true to size for the petite and fits sleek and sexy.
5.0,I had never used compression socks or stockings so I was a little skeptical they could help as much as promised. I’ve worn the socks twice and already have less leg pain and swelling. I have ordered 4 additional pairs and plan to wear them daily. The fit is perfect (measured my calves) and the padded foot is a definite plus.
5.0,"Great quality! Gift for my daughter, she loved it!"
5.0,"My daughter loves these pants! I am 51 and she is 20. I would never have guessed that these were in style or that she would want them. They are and she did. She wears a medium and they just fit her. The waist is tiny. If you’re on the large side of medium, go large. They’re so soft and she says they’re super comfortable. Two thumbs up! Buy a pair. You’ll be glad you did!"
5.0,Bought this for 16 year old son when American Eagle was sold out<br />He loves it! Looks great
5.0,"Very comfortable, great fit, and reasonably priced. I intend to purchase a couple more pair."
5.0,Great quality for the price. Feels like the same band you get when you purchased the Fitbit.
5.0,"This jacket is as pictured, EXTREMELY SOFT, and the sleeves are not at all too short. It's a little more light weight than I originally thought, but it would probably be more expensive otherwise. My only complaint is the bottom sides of the jacket have slits in them that are a bit too short and make my sides a bit chilly with the wind. Would be great if it were a tunic but it's about 2 inches too short for that. Overall great purchase!"
5.0,Good quality. My daughter wears a 2t usually I got the 2-4 would be too small for a 4. But fit her well could see how it could fit a 3 too! Very happy with it!
5.0,Great bag to keep my toiletries organized
5.0,I love the little ruffle on the bottom of the pants but more than anything the fit is just right.
5.0,"Awesome Product, love it"
5.0,Beautiful and comfy! I always get lots of compliments when I wear it.
5.0,"Great fit, beautiful, and exactly what I wanted. I wear it everyday."
5.0,Material is soft. True to size
5.0,It's simple yet elegant and  surprisingly comfortable. I purchased this for my fathers funeral and I'm so thrilled that I did. My order came very quick. I felt gorgeous and it's became one of my favorite dresses. I highly recommend the purchase!
5.0,Linen always looks classic and timeless! Love this dress!
5.0,My wife enjoyed them
5.0,This backpack is great for the price. I really like the many compartments and sturdy zipper pulls. It was purchased for an elementary school child and fits him well with some room to grow.
5.0,so cute and great price!
5.0,"Very cute socks,  fit well"
5.0,"What a fantastic piece! Idk my measurements, but I'm a 34b with decent sized hips so I went with a large. Fits wonderfully!"
5.0,"Super comfy, I’ve gotten so many compliments on it while I’m in Spain and Portugal. It does run a little small. I’m 5’6”, I usually wear a 2X (US 20-22ish) but I got the 3X and I’m glad I did. But the fabric is super soft, it travels very easily, it’s a great dress. I’m not sure how many washes the print will last, I’ve only washed it twice and I can already see some fading, but it still looks good."
5.0,Bought them for myself and I love them!
5.0,"These are socks. They fit like socks, and feel like socks. They do exactly what socks should do."
5.0,Darling Top
5.0,"I came down with a serious case of fjallraven envy, and started looking into other options after reading reviews of that product, which didn’t impress me much. I prioritize comfort and practicality over brand name, but I still wanted that iconic boxy style with the top handles, and the smallish size.<br /><br />This bag does it all! I can’t say enough good things about it. I’ve bought two in different colors and I use it every day. The size is ideal. Not too big and not too small (an ipad fits perfectly), and the different pockets are very convenient. I especially like the anti theft wallet compartment on the back. I think it looks stylish, and it’s also water resistant, durable, and easy to clean. Daily use for months and it still looks new. My perfect bag!<br /><br />Now when I see a fjallraven, I smile a little that my bag is so much better, even if it doesn’t have that cute little fox on it ;)"
5.0,"Finally I have found the right hat to keep my head warm, thanks so much!"
5.0,Love this ring! I have a gorgeous wedding band but im 28 weeks pregnant and im swelling too much to wear it. I love the color options that came with this ring and I can wear it all the time comfortably. The only negative thing i can say about this ring is that its pretty bulky.
5.0,"I love this dress! It fits nicely, and I always get lots of compliments! It reminds me of a Alice in Wonderland and is perfect for a day at the parks or just to work!"
5.0,"These are the cutest bows! The mini elastic isn't scratchy at all, nice and soft. The navy bow isn't on navy elastic, it's on black, but that's not a huge deal. Great price and a good selection of colors."
5.0,"I just received this and it is perfect for my needs. When measured across the shortest distances, I could get a 45"" x 30"" rectangle cut from this. The thickness is similar to that used on my farm shoes. The surface has some scruff marks, but it doesn't take away from its integrety and I think adds to its character."
5.0,My friend loved it it was super cute perfect present
5.0,"The material is very soft and comfortable, the price is fantastic. Overall, the value is great, the size is correct. Highly recommend!"
5.0,I am 5'3&#34; and 135#. I ordered a medium. It fit just right! The back covered down to about half of my bum. Its a light fabric but goes over layers well. I ordered 3 colors and just ordered 3 more!
5.0,Fun color variety that stands out!
5.0,"a little small and clings but if you go the figure for it, its perfect"
5.0,"They are pretty, light weight, and are the perfect size. I wear them with a lava bead necklace that has a Howlite pendant the same shape as the earrings and a lava bracelet along with a Howlite bracelet."
5.0,I don't know what I was waiting for. Amazing concept good quality. Two different brands almost identical design. Super happy with performance.
5.0,great and fast shipping and I loved it!
5.0,"These bow/neckties are so cute! there are so many of each style, and the workmanship looks great. I will have to schedule my doggy for a ""photo shoot"" with all of these different color ties, and I also have little t-shirts and sunglasses for him! Very pleased with this purchase, I do recommend."
5.0,love this tshirt
5.0,"I fell in love with this blouse, so, I ordered a Large and XL not sure how the material and style will fit, I had to send both back they were too big. The Large was still big on me but not as bad as the XL, still not flattering and just hang... I could use a medium and that might look nicer and give me that silhouette that flatters.<br />I'm waiting for this company to get a medium in so I could get that..., I'll have to wait for my next several paychecks (put a bit of money aside after rent, and other bills are paid)."
5.0,I am actually considering buy other colors. This dress fit super nice and its comfy. I feel sexy and comfortable.
5.0,So cute! Dress up any boots. Got tons of compliments. Get these!
5.0,I bought this for my sister.  She absolutely loves it!
5.0,"So cute and so soft!! Bought next size up so not sure how it fits now, but they will grow into it."
5.0,My daughter has received so many compliments on the emoji leggings!
5.0,"These waders have such a refreshingly good fit! The feet are the right size, the body is well proportioned for womanly curves, and they even look flattering when you’re wearing them. I never thought I’d be able to say any of these things about waders! Mine have held up to multiple fishing trips, keeping me warm and dry. They’re lightweight and comfortable. And the women at Lone Cone were very helpful when I had to return the first pair I ordered that were too big. I highly recommend these waders."
5.0,"Very attractive pair of earrings.  I purchased them for my husband for Christmas, they came in on time, and the shipping packaging was adequate. Best of all my husband loves them."
5.0,"I liked the weight, and also they’re pretty."
5.0,"This bracelet was ADORABLE, so girly like. I bought it for my boyfriends 2 year old daughter. It really is beautiful and very dainty, perfect for a girly girl."
5.0,"I got my nipples pierced almost a year ago. Suddenly, my nipples began to be sore and red; my areolas began to peel and produce a clear liquid. It got so bad I was using several bandaids daily to try to keep the balls from touching my skin as that seemed to me to be the problem. As a month or two went by and there was no progress I took to the internet to find anyone who had, had this issue. Turns out lots of people had. And the culprit was nickel! Over time my piercing had disintegrated and the nickel in the piercing was causing the problem. Apparently that's an issue with people with sensitive skin. I am allergic to almost everything so I should have thought about that. So the answer I found online (because I REFUSE to remove my rings) is titanium! Not surgical steel actual titanium. I ordered these because of the length; not realizing they are for industrial piercings. When I received them I saw they were much longer than the ones I had in but I had to take the old ones out. I couldn't take it anymore! So I put them in. THE VERY NEXT DAY I saw improvement. And they have been getting better ever since.  If you have sensitive skin, go for it!"
5.0,These shoes are very light and stiff.  You can ride in them all day whether you are climbing or on the flats. They are true to size.  Excellent value
5.0,Perfect for any kid
5.0,Very cute dress!  Love the fit and the length.  It was classy be comfortable all night!
5.0,Was a great outfit I got it on sale it as exact to the outfit in the pic great for club or pool part setting’ I will purchase this in every color they have
5.0,"i love my world food programme feed bag! it is huge, durable, and reversable! it's a great bag! i'm thrilled with the bag itself and i'm more thrilled that it will feed one child for an entire school year! that was the bag's biggest seller for me! i get a great bag and a child gets to eat! what could be better? i would buy the bag again in a heartbeat and i hope you will too!!!"
5.0,"Very soft material.  Light weight.  It looked see through when I first got it,  but when put on it's not at all see through.  I love it."
5.0,"I love these glasses for computer work, stylish and they protect my eyes!"
5.0,We love them!  Great purchase!
5.0,"I wear these under my work uniform every day and have had them for a few weeks now. They wash and dry easily with no problems. They wick sweat well and are comfortable. They are definitely stretchy and the material is substantial. I was really unsure of what size to buy based on reviews and went with medium as I want it to be tight under my uniform top. I am large chest 34F and smaller waste with large hips. This top fits me very well the only thing I would say is they are a tad on the smaller side but more so shorter in length. Luckily for me I have a short torso but if I would need more in the future I would buy a large, mostly just for additional length."
5.0,"This dress is better than I expected, I'm 5'7 - 125 pounds- bra size 32 b, and it gets past my knees! I ordered a medium size, and it fits perfect, just a little bit big on the chest area."
5.0,Great watch great size.
5.0,"Comes with a scrunchie!<br />Purchased for my 11 year old, bought her the 10-12, it is a little wide. But my daughter is tall and skinny,  so it may just be her shape. Would buy again, cant beat the price!"
5.0,"This dress is super comfortable, it also is super cute on. It doesn't cling in the wrong places. Love that it has pockets, and they work well. I highly recommend getting this dress."
5.0,These are everything I hoped for. Rugged suade exterior and soft and warm Thinsulate interior. Priced well.
5.0,I was very surprised with this bracelet. I love it and really comfortable to wear and looks so nice .
5.0,"I just walked over 30 miles over 16 days in Europe. I wore these everyday, sometimes over a tee shirt and then under an over shirt, and other times directly on my skin.  Couldn’t really tell a difference. These helped because I did not have to wear a tight belt when I was walking a lot every day.  Easier on my back and a better motion for walking. Very comfortable, couldn’t really feel them at all because of their construction and materials. Highly recommended!!!"
5.0,Love this spinner fit in all over heads have not tried it under seat yet. Roomy and moves around easily
5.0,"This little jacket is so cute, my 5 year old loves it! She picked out the strawberry one  and has worn it to school every single day that she could. There is a compass Built-in the sleeve which she is just loving, very cute jacket, I highly recommend."
5.0,It wasn’t too big so it is. I’ve to wear everyday
5.0,Wife Happy
5.0,Very nice and well made for the money. I would highly recommend this lovely piece.
5.0,"High quality piece, sturdy and actually quite pointy. I got it to replace a broken sythe for my 1/6th scale figure and works nicely, although a tad small.<br /><br />However I wouldn't use it as a key chain as it is too big and pointy to carry around. The little plastic weapon stand is a nice touch as well."
5.0,Useful and sturdy. I really like the clips. Have them attached to my lunch bag to keep needed supplies.
5.0,"Beautiful, better than expected."
5.0,Way more money than anyone should spend on toddler's sunglasses but  guess what?  She loved them so it was worth it.
5.0,Fits perfectly. Very comfortable
5.0,"So far, so good! I just received them but have only been able to use them once because of my schedule and the weather. The goggles have made a huge difference in the way that I swim. I wish I had bout these sooner!"
5.0,I've already used it on a pair of somewhat tight sandals.  It is very well made only plastic is the t-handle.  Others I looked at had plastic gears.
5.0,"This dress is adorable and comfy, especially for the price. The dress runs surprisingly big—the size chart is not accurate.  I’m a US 18/20, and the XL fit fine, maybe even a smidge big.  The length is good and suitable for work.  The material is a silky polyester, and the tulip sleeves are a fun detail.  If you have any interest at all, get this dress!"
5.0,Really comfortable and nice soft hold
5.0,Love them❤❤❤❤❤
5.0,Perfect for my projects!
5.0,"I took a chance and bought a size small shirt, i am happy i did. At 5'5"" and 107 lbs it fits Perfect."
5.0,"Fast shipment, perfect fit, stays on when on bike!!!!! Great Buy"
5.0,nice teacher gifts
5.0,I'm 4'11 140lbs<br />I purchased a small and medium and another small cute easy going dress. Fits skin tight and not see through
5.0,This robe set is so cute! They are extremely soft and fit both the doll and my 6 year old daughter.
5.0,Love them. They look much more expensive than they are.
5.0,"I use this for work as a housekeeper, and this watch gets exposed to a good amount of water. So far it's hanging in there, and it's been perfect for what I wanted it for. The price was good too, because I think, with the wear and tear I put this thing through, I can get another and it won't hurt too bad."
5.0,"My bff's and sisters wore them at my graduation so I could see them from where I was sitting by the stage.  They were beautiful,  full, and vibrant!"
5.0,"I like watches, and while shopping on Amazon, this one caught my eye. Not in the mainstream of chronographs and outdoors and designer watches, and I wanted something different, so I ordered one. I have been wearing it almost daily now for 10 months; I am amazed how well it keeps time, being a self-winding, non-quartz movement. I will set it by the clocks at work, which are all electronically synched with the computer system. In two weeks, it will be a minute and a half fast. It is rather heavy, but that doesn't bother me as my other watch is a Seiko chronograph, which I've only worn a couple of times since buying this one. I am not gentle on watches, I neglect taking it off when working on my car or doing manual things that can beat up a good watch. This one takes it all in stride, and there isn't a mark on the large, domed bezel at all. I like the feel of the leather band, it is very robust, but not in the least stiff. I get many compliments and questions about the watch, and I always take it off to show the clear back where you can see the movement and winding eccentric. I Thought that I might have issues with the stem-protecting spring getting caught on sleeves or  other items, but it doesn't. As I write this, I cannot think of anything I don't like about this watch. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a high-quality, self-winding watch that stands on its own in style."
5.0,It fit perfectly and was very easy to install on the Fitbit.
5.0,"The most gorgeous boots I have ever seen, and supremely comfortable. I saved a long time for these and ordered them in my giant size, only to be told that Lucchese no longer makes them. I found some eventually and wear them proudly, even though they are made from python and leather."
5.0,Good quality rings for cheap price!
5.0,"Very soft, really like the colors"
5.0,Should of different sizes to choose from
5.0,I'm not a fan of the oversized beanie and this one fits great with great warmth
5.0,the unique ness of it for a childs first start up charm bracelet
5.0,"Needed a shoe that fit properly, psoriasis on feet.  Other shoes rub or fit incorrectly & damage the skin.  These fit the way shoes should be made.  Local shoe stores with this type of shoe almost no longer exist-  All for modern looks not comfort or fit.<br />Have always worn a 6, by this manufacturer, still do!  Very comfortable."
5.0,The wings & headband fit my dainty 3 year old perfectly!
5.0,Great for a gift. My friend loved it!
5.0,I love this bathing suit  It is comfortable and it fits perfect. The quality is great. I would recommend this bathing suit
5.0,Very cute dress. I’m 5’4” and it is a bit short. It’s nice with flats.. I wish they made this dress knee length! I’d buy them all. I’m 40 so the length is debatable :-)
5.0,"LOVE THIS DRESS, HOWEVER WAS DISAPPOINTED AS IT WAS DEFFECTIVE - NECKLINE WAS OFF CENTER, AND THE STRAPS WERE DIFFERENT WIDTHS!  OTHERWISE THE FIT WAS GREAT AND VERY COMFORTABLE."
5.0,Okay. I ordered 2 of these dresses. One in a small for me and the other in a large for my sister.  They were the EXACT same size.  They look amazing in the pics but they are made pretty shoddy.  I messed with them to fix them and will wear them because they are cute enough.
5.0,Bought it for my daughter and she loved it  very comfortable.
5.0,"Light weight, the most comfortable suit I ever had. Considering to buy another one..."
5.0,Very cute dress for my tween for a theme dance. She is Size 00 so just know this is pretty small since for her well.
5.0,"I put this eye in the center of a black rose for Halloween, it's awesome!"
5.0,Comfortable. Well made. medium weight. It arrived very quickly. It's a blend but the fabric is very soft as if it were made from all cotton. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"Love these skirts, can roll waist, or leave as is for high waisted look. I’m 5’6, 125lbs I ordered a size xxs. I wish I can get all the colors in this size"
5.0,Very nice and delicate
5.0,Love it! Comfortable and soft.
5.0,"These boots are gorgeous. People recognize them as Lucchese right away. After my 2nd or 3rd time wearing, I spilled stout beer on them. It came off easy with a cloth & water. They still look prestine!"
5.0,Got these for my mother and she really likes the fit. The material is nice as well.
5.0,Beautiful...just the perfect size
5.0,Very beautiful. I loved them on my daughter
5.0,A little bit cheaper but other than that it's perfect I love it! You get what you pay for.
5.0,Shirt fit and looks great
5.0,"I bought this shirt for work. Good materials. Great construction. Much better ordering here than from the uniform store, or letting my company provide clothes that don't fit. Finally a shirt that doesn't pop out of my pants whenever I bend over, or sit down!"
5.0,"Nice socks - love the targeted support around the ankle. A little tight in the toes, so be careful not to pull them tight around your ankle - leave some slack in the foot so your toes aren't squished."
5.0,"My son loves his new beanie, scarf and gloves"
5.0,"Nice fit, comfy."
5.0,"gOOD fit, very warm"
5.0,Just as I had hoped. Love the size and the look of these earings. 2 pairs - Gold and Silver. Both are great!
5.0,"Never had a pair of clip-on earrings as comfy as this pair! I wore them all day and they didn’t hurt a bit and stayed on very nicely. They are very elegant earrings that can pair with something fancy.<br />I used to wear mostly stick-on earrings (designed and made in Japan) but can’t really find them in US. I have tried other clip-on’s, but they hurt my ears after like 30 mins. I am very happy that I found these ones.<br />In the packaging, it has clear instruction on how to put it on and how to keep it clean and free of tarnish."
5.0,"Great product fits my costa wayfarers, stays on, floats, and is cute."
5.0,"I got these for my sister, who loves them.  She wears a size 11 shoe and they still fit her pretty well.  Super cute, too."
5.0,I got these for my husband for Christmas. He said they are the best slippers I ever got him.
5.0,"The quality of this watch is much better than I expected. It's well designed, easy to remove links & really pretty. I wanted a sleek watch band that looked more like a bracelet & this one was perfect."
5.0,"I have been experiencing fairly significant heel pain in right foot from plantar fasciitis for about 12 weeks.<br /><br />My old pair of custom orthotics that I purchased in 2012 for an earlier case of plantar fasciitis were too rigid and uncomfortable. I did not want to order a new expensive set of custom orthotics so I ordered these hoping that these would reduce the pain from walking outdoors. Indoors I always wear Birkenstock Arizona sandals as I find the cork bed feature of Birkenstock sandals to be really effective at reducing my heel pain .<br /><br />I find the Birkenstock  Sport Arch Support in my running shoes and golf shoes to be very comfortable and similar to the sandals. It allows me to get through a game of golf which would not be possible if I wore no arch support.<br /><br />While the pain associated with my PF does not disappear using the Birkenstock insoles, I would say it reduces the discomfort by about 50%, so for the cost I am very happy with my purchase"
5.0,Me Encanto

5.0,Runs large but I knew that as I've been wearing these for years & love them. Not too warm but warm enough. Have these in short & long sleeves as these are the only nightgowns that I wear.
5.0,My son likes it so much.
5.0,"This seems like a professional grade product that works amazingly well.  Purchasing new footwear has always been a gamble and forced me to buy multiple pairs when I found something that fit my wide feet (and with other issues).  Sometimes a dress shoe or running shoe needed a break-in period or never made it that far (and no longer able to return).  This ingenious device adapts to your footwear needs, easily adjusts for added length and width, plus has small plug-in extenders to stretch at specific pressure points.  This works miracles in a matter of days and I am glad I purchased two to march them trough my closet.  The stretcher is powerful and adjusts easily.  Therefore, if you are being aggressive in resizing/stretching, it makes sense to tighten and  stretch to a point, let it sit for a day and then turn the knob some more to allow the leather or fabric and the seems to ""give""; otherwise, there is a chance of ripping and ruining the footwear.  For significantly stretching a fine leather or vinyl shoe, you might leave it in the sun briefly to warm up the material a bit beforehand for better results. That always works for my car's vinyl convertible top that tends to shrink when not used."
5.0,"Super comfy, swingy dress for casual wear! Soft and cute!!!"
5.0,"I just love these. Comfy, true to size, cute"
5.0,"I absolutely love this fish stocking! I needed another one for my new kitty. I’ve been disappointed this year with Homegoods, that’s where I got the other 4 last year. I would 1000000% recommend! So cute and only $9.99! Fast shipping!! I got it in one day!"

5.0,You never know when ordering online for tops and the models are not your size. I LOVE this shirt! 5'8&#34; and usually wear an xlrg...and it fit just right. The fabric is super soft and flowy. I haven't washed it yet so not sure how it will wash and wear. It is fairly low cut so I will wear a tank under it. Great price too!

5.0,My boyfriend was so happy with these!!!
5.0,"Love it! i'm short in height, so I wanted a bag that wasn't too heavy or large while having to visit patients at an assisted living facility. This has enough space and appropriate pockets needed for face masks, gait belt, pulse oximeter, my ipad mini, gloves, phone, keys, and a water bottle. Also love the padding on the shoulder strap to prevent any shoulder and neck discomfort from carrying a bag for hours."
5.0,"Bonito, fui fácil añadirle la foto"
5.0,"Best pair of sunglasses to date; I was a big PUGS fan. I lose a lot of sunglasses, so I will not spend $80-125 on a pair of sunglasses. I came across these during Amazon week, these are fantastic.  They even have a nose guard that is adjustable. Love them."

5.0,"This is a great necklace really cute, and I often get compliments on it.  I love to wear this with a black undershirt and a pink cardigan at work, and it is really cute.  A statement piece, and you don't need to wear earrings with it (which I love because I often have phone calls to make.)<br /><br />Would definitely purchase again, it is really cute, and is versatile.<br /><br />-Hannah"

5.0,"Always a fan of Bungalow360! I had my previous wallet for something like 6 or 7 years and was tired of the Velcro not working. So I decided on a zipper upgrade! Love that I don't have important things falling out of my wallet anymore! In reference to other reviews, yes the wallet smells a little goofy at first but wears off and hasn't been a long lasting problem for me. Also, yes...whoever sewed the card pockets messed up and I can't use half of the slots. Annoyed me at first, but I've managed to find other solutions (like putting the spare cards on the back pocket). Lastly, and most important, the llamas are so funny and I get a lot of compliments!"

5.0,My daughter loves this. She's a bit sad as she's outgrown it. We had bought one size larger and she wore it for a good couple of years. It's comfortable and offers sun protection. Material is good quality and we've had no issues. Hand wash with plain cold water and don't put in the washer or dryer. Ours still looks brand new.

5.0,I love the cap and the fit!  I’m wearing it now!!!!
5.0,Very nice transaction. Thx!
5.0,The inside of this jacket is a soft silk fabric and its such a comfortable jacket. Its getting a little cold in my area so not quite heater time so ive worn this around my house out of comfort. It holds heat nicely and is comfy! The sleeves are meant to be wider which is a new touch to these jackets which I enjoy and will make it easier to wear gloves with so I find it a benefit. The pockets are zippered which I like as well so I don't have to worry about things falling from my pockets as I use pockets often. Overall I enjoy this jacket a lot!
5.0,Fit's great. Very comfortable
5.0,Best purse charm for the Holiday season

5.0,This is the best deal on a charm I've gotten in a long time.  What you can't see from the photo is that the back of the charm actually has engraved scales of justice and the sides have etching to make it appear like a book.  A great and pleasant surprise!
5.0,"Lovely little timepiece. Keeps great time, and keeps running about 48 hours on a single wind. Pulling the winder to set the time is a pretty normal thing, but for some reason the item I received has a very stiff mechanism, so much so that at first I dared not force it in case I broke it. Now I've got the hang of the setting mechanism, though, it's a perfect fit -- I'm a stickler for a correct watch, so I adjust it to synch within a minute of NTP at least every wind (if needed, and it seldom is)."
5.0,Simple gift. Hard to read saying.  But it is a nice bracelet
5.0,"I have purchased this cross twice and it is likely I will buy more.  My wife, who is in a nursing home, asked for the one I was wearing and I was pleased to give it to her.s  It is a simple but powerful indication of my faith in Christ."
5.0,"Fast delivery and I was honestly surprised at the quality, wasn't expecting much, love it when items over deliver!"
5.0,"I’m so glad I purchased this coat after the zipper on my old winter coat broke! I wanted something that was warm and that came down to my calves and this coat fit the bill! I chose the size I bought according to the measurements provided and it fit very nicely. It isn’t too tight so it can accommodate for thicker sweaters and cardigans which I appreciate. The inner pocket by the left breast is very helpful and I like that the pockets are lined with a cozy fabric. This coat is SO warm and when temperatures drop to the teens and below, the only parts of my body that remain cold are my face, my ankles, and my hands (if I forget to wear gloves)."
5.0,I got this oversized to wear with leggings and I absolutely love it. It is even better than it looks.  The way the purple blends Into the white is flawless and it will go with most of my leggings.  I am absolutely thrilled with the shirt. I didn't think it would look this good.
5.0,Good mask quality.  Kids are haveing a blast.
5.0,"These are the only lip studs I will wear. The colors of the crystals are pretty and the post doesn’t stick way out from my lip. The back doesn’t grind against my teeth, and they are so much easier to put in and take out than regular threaded studs are."
5.0,Taryn Rose never disappoints. Excellent quality and extremely comfortable.
5.0,Oh my goodness this is absolutely beautiful. Glamorous but not to blingy at the same time
5.0,"The color is exactly like the picture (hard to do with purple), but it's much more durable than it appears."
5.0,Excellent inexpensive ties for any occasion.
5.0,Good quality and made nicely.
5.0,"Bought this for my husband's birthday, its humongous! I knew it would be big, but it's much bigger than I expected, looks very sturdy like it will last a long time. Unfortunately husband said it was way too big for what he needed so I returned."
5.0,I 👍it
5.0,"I love them , i always have a problem with my babys shoes bc his feets are wide ... this shoes fit perfecly !!!"
5.0,"Another one of my favorite Amazon finds! Great price, easy to gift and quiet fashionable."
5.0,"This key ring is better than I thought. Feels great and is not flashy, but effective. Would do business with this vendor again."
5.0,"I ordered the power flex yoga capris, but they are great leggings for wear with tunics and dresses, too--not just for fitness.  My biggest pleasant surprise is that these leggings are not shiny at all.  I found that they are longer than capris normally are, but I like that.  Full-length leggings are almost always too long for me, so these are perfect, especially with boots.  I'll be ordering lots more of these, after trying many different brands and being disappointed."
5.0,Beyond costume. It’s such a nice and well put together dress it could be worn to a wedding!
5.0,"This is 21/2yr old second pair. H led<br /><br />This is 21/2 yr olds second pair.  Held up well, he just keeps growing. True to size.<br />Good leather and bottom sole.  Kathy"
5.0,Very nice nato straps for a great price. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"Love this, and get lots of compliments. Wish it was on a slightly longer chain."
5.0,My third pair keep giving as gifts. Highly recommend. Fast shipping. Nice size and I get many compliments. Who can beat the price!
5.0,"I was looking to replace a very old pair of thinsulate insulated leather gloves.  My hands get cold easily, so I had to look around. These fit better than others I have tried, and they seem warm enough for cold, but not frigid weather.  The fingers fit well, not squeezed.  The gloves have fair but not great grip on a steering wheel.  They look very well made."
5.0,Wonderful protection from the sun
5.0,"The Jersey fit as expected, stitching and patches were on point definitely wear a hoodie under to keep warm 😎"
5.0,"I received the cuff a few days after ordering it and I love it! It looks just like the picture, goes on and off easily, and it never feels uncomfortable when I wear it. If you put it on and it does feel like it's pinching, it should just mean that it's in the wrong place-just slide it up or down until it's comfortable."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I’m 5’4” and curvy up top and bottom, so buying a dress online is a risk that I took. Usually dresses like these are always really short & slim fitting. I’m a mother of 2 and I’m not interested in an above the knee or tight fitting dress. I ordered an XL, but could’ve worn a Large just fine. I’ll keep the XL because I like the extra room, it doesn’t hug my curves. The lace top half is beautiful and I like the flowy bottom half. Overall a great buy! I plan on buying the sleeveless green one too!"
5.0,"Cool item, thank you."
5.0,I love this dress! It's super comfy and very cute!<br />I'm 5'8&#34; and I got a M. I'm about 157lbs. Fits perfect!
5.0,"It fit perfect, light weight , can wear outside of jeans or tuck in. Love it!!"
5.0,Omg great dress love that I purchase no sweating light weight
5.0,It fits perfect. I love the material and how it looks
5.0,Don't be shy....size is just a number. Look at their size chart and order accordingly. Don't be upset if there is an 'x' or 4!
5.0,absolutely love this tank! not see through at all and a great fit. perfect for summer and to transition into fall
5.0,Beautiful dress! Bring it back in stock!!
5.0,they're really nice and fit well.<br />I've now had these lip rings over 2 months and they're wonderful. very happy with my purchase i ordered another set
5.0,I’m 5’7 about 200lb curvy/semi atheletic/muscular 42DD and I purchased several of these for work to go under my short sleeve shirts.  Love these and they fit perfectly!
5.0,"Finally, a dress that hits all the marks: plenty of structure, clean/polished seams, thick fabric (but not too thick) - at a price that means I can buy one for every day of the work week and still have money left in my paycheck. All of this - AND POCKETS! Professional ladies, do not be deterred if you have ordered other dresses on Amazon and they disappointed you. Not only does this dress look like it could be from Ann Taylor or Brooks Brothers, but the sizing is accurate too. Don't be afraid to order the size you are. No need to size up with the fear that it will run super small like imported dresses often do. My one criticism: the belt is junk. I didn't plan to wear the belt, so I wasn't deterred. But if this is a deciding factor for you, I'd look for a different one. It looks fantastic without a belt, and there are no belt loops, so it doesn't appear as though it is missing anything."
5.0,"like the style ,cute for dress or occasional wear."
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Great price for 3 pair. I even wear one of the pair sometimes!
5.0,"Exactly as described, perfect for the price."
5.0,"Fits true to size. I ordered a medium and am 5’4” 140lbs. The front and back of the dress cover my knee by an inch or so. The sides of the hem go up on the sides and that shows my knee. It’s flowey enough to wear a skirt extender underneath though. Pockets are great, fit is great, quality is good for the price. I purchased another one! Hope they get more colors :)"
5.0,Perfect fit! exactly what I expected and fits just as well. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,Cute.  Exactly as advertised.
5.0,"this glasses is simple styles, good for all occasions. light weight. price is appropriate."
5.0,"Good product, fair price, it keeps warm but if temperature rises (what happens often in the mountains) you don’t sweat so much."
5.0,very comfortable. I love it. Perfect size.
5.0,Very pretty. Nice color combination and the loop is large enough to run a good size ribbon thru. Good price.
5.0,"Quality product, good zippers.  Makes your baggage neatly arranged.  Easy to transfer from your luggage bags to hotel drawers and back.  My wife and I use cubes of different colors - makes it easy to find and separate items. Is it worth the money?  You decide for yourself."
5.0,"Nice shirt. My son will love it. Got for him for Christmas, but I know he will really like it."
5.0,Love there a great selection
5.0,I’ve bought several sets of these for my kids. They wear them to school and my son wears them for basketball practice. They’re great.
5.0,Amazing fit - love them!!
5.0,"Rápido, bonito y seguro"
5.0,This is a great boot.  The cutout makes it unique.
5.0,"Well I am so impressed with this tunic dress!! 1st- delivered within 2 days,2nd  fits exactly as expected, 3rd so so soft 4th looks amazing on!!"
5.0,"I like these plugs I was desperate to get acrylic out of my ears so I figured id try these stone plugs. Comfortable and true to size,"
5.0,Beautiful amulet.
5.0,It's a little long for petite.  Otherwise it's a good fit.  Easy to wear!
5.0,This is a high quality 100% leather belt it is well made and being reversible from black to brown makes it even better now my husband has one belt for all his outfits.<br />My husband wears a size 38 pants and we got the size 40/42 (large) belt and it was a bit large he is using the last hole of the belt.<br />I would recommend.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review I hope that it was helpful to you.
5.0,"Very masculine. Perfect size for those with a larger neck. Rope chain is brilliant.  Very sturdy, should last a long time."
5.0,"Love this hat...rec'd many, many compliments on it! (some of tried stealing it too!)"
5.0,"As an attorney, my husband routinely wears a tie.  These solid colors and the sheen of the fabric were a nice addition to his wardrobe."
5.0,love these so much!!! Second time ordering and the assortment was great and they are still holding up so great!
5.0,"I ADORE this dress! It fits me so well and hugs me in all the right places. The material is a little thinner than expected, but it's not a big deal."
5.0,"I ordered a second larger belt because the first one was slightly tight.  Even though the jean size was my jean size, for some reason it didn't work.  But the medium is perfect!"
5.0,I was happy to find them and they work well
5.0,I bought it to wear with my deceased mother’s gold Mothers pride ring.
5.0,Just received it today. Perfect for my prescription eyeglasses. I love the color.
5.0,Exactly as Marketed!
5.0,It was a Christmas gift and he appeared to be very excited with it.
5.0,"I use this for swimming in the pool & soaking in the Jacuzzi at the gym. I appreciate the lift from the underwire built-in bra. I love the colors to start with, but after swimming/soaking 3 X a week for a few months, the colors begin to fade. Over time, a LOT of the color fades and the material stretches out. I cut the skirt shorter after that, but eventually the color is horrible, so I buy another top. It's frustrating, as I love the tops, but the color fading and the material stretching is annoying. My husband's swim trunks don't do this. Why can't someone make women's swimwear out of material that lasts, also?"
5.0,"Don't miss these earrings.. For clip ons they are not heavy and are easy on the ears. My older friends don't want pierced ears , and it's hard to find clip ons. But these are great.."
5.0,Bought as a gift. Wife is happy.
5.0,I love my wallet has a lot of card slots
5.0,Pretty but I wish it had more blue in it.
5.0,I ordered the lanyard as a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it!
5.0,It was very well made and very nice cloth. I’m very satisfied!
5.0,"I bought them for my baby girl, she hasn't seen them. I love them and i know she will too."
5.0,"Simple black necklace that comes as pictured. Seems to be sturdy, has yet to fade, very deep black. I use it to hold a grey charm since I prefer it to the silver necklace the charm came with. Sizing chart is accurate."
5.0,"Purchased this watch for my daughter, as beautiful in person as pic on line.  Definitely a ""Bling"" watch.  She loved it.  One of my concerns is that it would come with an old battery but watch was protected and batter secured.  Only drawback was that watch had to be taken to a jeweler to be fitted to her small wrist. (This was expected).  Great customer service and shipping, too!"
5.0,Looked all over for this character in a hoodie that my granddaughter wanted and couldn’t find it anywhere. Thank goodness for Amazon they have everything!
5.0,So very shiny in person. Great quality!
5.0,Cool collection of Star Wars insignia.
5.0,"I returned the medium for a large, because I found the arms tight and too short on the medium. It fit fine in the body."
5.0,Love the style of pants...but 3 X was way too big...lol
5.0,Amazing love the way it is like exactly like the picture.
5.0,"The one reason I choose this watch ( PRW 3500 ) over the PRW 3500Y-4CR is that the reviews I read on latter watch bezel paint will chip if you bump into something hard. After all, it is just a bezel on black paint. However the PRW 3500's bezel is made of metal with no painted color and will not chip if you accidentally bump it into something. Other than that, it is a super watch. The barometer 'might not' show any readings when you first use this watch. Don't panic. Give it a 'couple of hours/days' to regulate itself and the readings will pop up thereafter and you are all set to go. This has been my observation from using this watch. The sunrise/sunset latitude/longtitude info. ( you can google the information based on where you live ) has to be manually adjusted, and after that, it will run on the information you input forever. You only have to set them once. The night light is very bright! Other than that, I have nothing to add other than what you have read on other reviews on this watch. This has been a very good ABC watch for me so far. Glad I bought it."
5.0,So cute and unique!
5.0,Super cute. I get lots of compliments with it.
5.0,"Nice sturdy frame, look just like wayfairs from ray ban. Come in a nice carrying case. Wood finish looks great. Bought during Black Friday deals"
5.0,my husband loved these glasses they were a little small but that's only because he has a big head
5.0,For $25 I can beat them! I love Pearl Izumi's because the heel is elevated and stops my back from aching like a flat sneaker does. They are very light weight and comfortable. The padding inside the shoe is really not good for running. But they will be great for everyday<br />wear and tear. They were shipped out immediately and received them in 2 days! The company even sent me an email to make sure I was happy with my purchase! I might go back and get the other color too!
5.0,Gets great
5.0,I love everything about this shirt!
5.0,This is a nice lightweight vest that is works great over a base layer on the day hikes I make in the winter. I like the shell fabric and the color (dark army).
5.0,So cute you won't be able to stand yourself. Fits as expected.
5.0,It was lovely and very classy looking.
5.0,"Husband likes these a lot. He is a housekeeper at a local hospital, therefore he is on his feet 8 hours a day. They are holding up nicely."
5.0,"We ordered these to use at the Women's March this past weekend. Remarkably, they fit most of us, from my 9 year old to my husband. My 6 year old could have even used one if we trimmed the bottom. The only odd sizing was the length of the arms - they were a bit short, but I don't expect much for a disposable item. At the end of the day, they held up, and could even have been reused."
5.0,"I bought the choker for around the house, but I like it enough to wear ir out. It’s good quality for the price and is super cute on. I recommend!"
5.0,"Love the pattern! It has a nice modest neckline and is cropped. I'm wearing low rise jeans in the pic but I feel it would look more flattering with a nice pair of high waisted pants. I was expecting a soft cottony fabric but it's actually a shiny synthetic material-that was the only downside. I considered lowering the rating to 4 but at this price I thought that it was unreasonable to do so.<br /><br />Also I ordered a medium. I'm normally a size small top and size 3 bottoms (juniors, womens size 0-2). I ordered a medium fearing my bust would shorten it too much. I'm glad I did as it is quite tight on my bust. Hope I helped!"
5.0,This is an excellent cream for the neck I have bought from the most expensive to the least expensive and nothing has worked as good as the screen I first bought it at home shopping network and then I found it in Amazon I think you still get a better deal if you buy it at the Home Shopping Network
5.0,Es hermoso muy buena calidad
5.0,I thought it was going to be cheapy but it worths. Highly recommend! And suppa cute
5.0,Good quality.... washed well :.. I own this in 3 different colors !
5.0,"Go for it! The color is exactly as shown in the picture and material is too good, thick and soft. I am in love with the dress you can wear it casually or dress it up.<br />Will buy in other colors too."
5.0,Nice stylish band
5.0,"The bracelet is beautiful. It’s fits everyone perfectly. I bought this for a bridal party of 10.<br />The bracelet was delivered on time and the seller<br />was extremely kind, he kept checking in with me to make sure my bracelets were delivered on time also to make sure that I didn’t have any problems.<br />Thank you so much JMSourcing."
5.0,Simple and cheap but nice product!
5.0,Red is my favorite color! I received countless compliments. This dress fits nice hugs you in all the right places I will be buying the blue. One issue it was difficult to iron it took several times to get the wrinkles out.
5.0,My wife wears them every day. She loves them. Will purchase more.
5.0,Perfect! I haven’t completely tried it on yet but it appears it will fit with no issues. Love it!
5.0,I love these earrings. The contrasting gold and silver tones and the wire wrap in make them really unique. They’re light too so they don’t pull down my earlobe like most earrings of this size would.
5.0,"I was skeptical, but they exceeded my expectations. They fit comfortably and are well made. I’ll be buying another set of colors."
5.0,Very pleased with this ring. Hope styles like this are available soon.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:75c8f3de970a5b6f9f5ca715e2790d9d]] Loved thos for a contemporary dance I'm going to have I'm a few days. Flows beautifully!
5.0,"Well priced, sole flexes nicely, color as pictured, size appropriate. I like the versatility of the cream and tan color and that the toe is enclosed for a clumsy 2 y/o."
5.0,Fantastic. My son loved it
5.0,"Gorgeous! needed help getting the laces right and tied, but it truly gives a corset feel and looks beautiful. no need to wear a bra, and there is some light padding. The dress and the straps are very long, i did end up cutting some length off the strap at the shoulders. Lovely to walk in, i did have to hold it up, but it would have been better with taller heels or hemmed! lovely in pictures."
5.0,"I was surprised, because the price was so low, I thought it might be cheaply made. I was wrong. This little wallet is beautiful!!!! And it's very well made.  Color was so pretty. Love love love!!!"
5.0,"Love the color, great size for a bold look, great for work or date nights"
5.0,Purchased for my 7 year old. He’s small for 7 but still fit great over his hockey stuff. Sleeves are long but he’ll grow into it.
5.0,"I love the dress , the fit and fabric."
5.0,Great quality. My daughter practically lives in it. It is true to size. Worth the money.
5.0,Super bracelet. Neat look.
5.0,So pretty and so far durable! I love it
5.0,I have been looking for a shoe to use when I cycle. I got out of the clips and went to the platform pedals. I have rode quite a few miles in this shoe and it does the job.
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments from strangers in public arena's.... ON POINT (:
5.0,Exact fit!  Love it!
5.0,Love it. Breathable and comfy
5.0,Very sheer like tights. Would never consider wearing alone BUT theses are perfect for use as undergarments. Undetectable under dresses until it counts.☺
5.0,more than 8 expected!
5.0,Great quality and fits true to size. My son loved it for Ugly Sweater Day at School!
5.0,"While trying to walk. for health, I picked these socks.  My legs have felt better"
5.0,What a great purchase. Recommended by blogger and so happy I acted. Seems to be of quality and fits great. I’m petite and length is perfect; doesn’t hit too high or low.
5.0,Great lightweight fall scarf which really lets me tell everyone exactly how much I love America.
5.0,Unfortunately this dress is too small for my daughter beautifully made I highly recommend this seller I purchased 5 dresses for my daughter from here each one beautifully made wonderful fabric highly recommend this dress and the seller
5.0,Love the look of the shoe. Feels very comfortable. Looking forward to wearing this.
5.0,Fantastic fit! There's actually hidden elastic in the waist band. I feel like I look like a superhero when I wear these. A little pricey but worth the money.
5.0,"Have had this bag for several weeks.  I go to the pool 3 times a week and bought this because I use crutches and needed something I could use to put my stuff in that I could carry on my back.  I'm not a big fan of conventional backpacks so this looked like a decent alternative.  It's just big enough for a suit, large towel,  wet shoes. It has a small pouch on the outside for personal items like wallet, phone & keys. Perfect size for me and I like the mesh plus I can drop the strap across my body and not have to worry about it falling off my shoulders plus it's hands free for me."
5.0,"The color of this dress is exactly what I was hoping for, perfect for fall. It fit just as expected, if not better. It is baby bump friendly if that helps anyone! I think it’s a great dress for upcoming holidays, paired with knee high boots or over the knee if you’re a bit taller. I ordered a small and I’m 5’1 and could not wear over the knee boots with it because the dress came to my knees. Would recommend this dress"
5.0,So cute! I wear a small/medium. Ordered this in a medium. Fits perfect. Not as short on me as int he picture; looks better on me! :-) Great dress for the price!
5.0,True to the picture and size. Nice quality.
5.0,"i got these and thought it was a great idea, my husband an i live apart for 80% of the year do to his job and us thinking owning a home was a good idea. i pack my bags and go visit for a week or two and have everything organized in these bags. I love it. i would recommend them to all"
5.0,que es hermoso muy buena calidad muy<br />buen presio gracias maria esther🤣😲👗
5.0,This turned out to be nicer than expected!  Fits good and looks great!
5.0,I really like this thing. I've been using a utility knife for years stripping cat5 cables. This thing worked perfectly once I got it adjusted. love it!!
5.0,Get a lot of compliments on these specs.
5.0,The color and most important the emblem Aj styles. It is beautiful.
5.0,Lovely blouse
5.0,This is one I get compliments on.  I have heart earrings and another heart bracelet with the filigree textured pattern.  They all go together as a set I was pleased that the shine on the silver was not compromised when it arrived.  It was a great addition to my jewelry collection.
5.0,Not at all scratchy as others mentioned. I love how these shorts fit!
5.0,"Absolutely love my new boots. I ordered a 9, fit perfect with normal socks. As other said, no arch support, but a very flexible sole and soft leather. Lots of toebox room, which is important to me as I like wiggle room. Can't be beat for the price, and fast shipping."
5.0,very beautiful!!!! love my new ring
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful.  I bought this for my cousin as a gift for his anniversary.  It's clearly very well made and built to last.  He loved it, especially since it has his initials engraved into them.  The white-gold plate is flawless.  I cannot rave about this product enough.  I'd purchase a set for the men in your life, whether family or romantic!  You cannot go wrong with this purchase.  I can 100%  confidently and highly recommend it.  It's useful.  It's personal.  It's perfect.<br /><br />*I received this at a promotional price for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are my own and have not been influenced in any way for a positive review."
5.0,"I got this for my daughters birthday and I must say it’s super cute and soft to touch. I did not like the bow but I have lots of pink bows so did not mind it. I like quality of fabric, it’s soft for kids. It did not loose any color and no wobbling as I washed it twice already."
5.0,"These masks are expensive compared to other products, but worth every penny. They seal much better than all the other mask types I've purchased. With many masks of this hospital-type they leave big openings on the sides and bottom; this one does not."
5.0,A great outfit for my son's baptism. It fits him perfectly.
5.0,Look exactly as the picture they look<br />expensive and highlight your face
5.0,"My wife and I each got one for partnered acrobatics. Whatever we do in them looks and feels great. They are well made, don’t tear, and fit perfectly."
5.0,This is a heavier material dress.  True to size.  And it does wash nice without shrinking.
5.0,Great glasses at great price. No damage to any. No issues here.
5.0,I'm giving it to my grand-daughter for her Birthday!  She is very into snakes right now.
5.0,My girl loved everything about it.
5.0,Super comfy and works great!
5.0,The dress fits beautifully! The top part hugs the bodywhile the bottom half flares elegantly and the well placed pockets are an added bonus. Love it!
5.0,"This is more of a shirt with a longer length.  It definitely can't be worn by women who have been blessed in certain areas, unless you like walking around naked.  I've bought other &#34;dresses&#34; like this before so I knew what to expect.  I was looking for a longer shirt and this fits those expectations, I love this shirt."
5.0,Very nice wallet. The good part is its RFID protected.
5.0,Lasted all day didn't roll up comfortable and fit.
5.0,"Material is super soft and the pockets are a nice touch although the material is not heavy enough to support heavier items in the pocket. I bought it to pair with leggings and it looks nice. I am 5'2"" 155lbs. Usually wear a large, but medium is more fitted and shorter on me. Large was too loose."
5.0,perfect size. looks great
5.0,"I like this skirt, lenght is prefect."
5.0,I loved this wrap. I looked so elegant. It was worth the money.
5.0,Good quality fit is trim but not slim.
5.0,"I was apprehensive about ordering this item after reading other customer reviews stating that the sizing was way off. It was so pretty though, that I decided to take a chance and was glad I did. I ordered an XL as I wear a size 14-16 misses size top. I am 5'8&#34; tall and 165 lbs and somewhat busty. It fits fine and I did not note any flaws."
5.0,"I love the quality; the hematite magnets are beautiful.<br />Size 7 fits perfectly for me  (I like the bracelet a bit loose). Size 6 is a bit too tight, even though I have very small wrists."
5.0,"My 13 year old loves this necklace.  She doesn't take it off, and it still looks brand new"
5.0,Love the vest just running too small needs to be a little longer and cut deeper at underarm but it's  light and easy to wear and it looks cute
5.0,This watch does not come together assembled so if you're giving it as a gift i recommend opening it and putting it together. It comes in a gift box and looks way more expensive than it actually is!
5.0,"So far, so good. They came in very nice packaging, and they arrived quickly and on time. They're a bit larger than I had expected, however, but are still nice. They're a holiday gift for my other half, however, and it'll be a while yet before the holidays roll around, so once it does, I'll edit my review based on what my partner thinks, having worn them!"
5.0,This necklace is gorgeous!!!. It fits like a choker on me but it's still pretty. It's really durable. It doesn't feel too flimsy. It's a cute gift to give to someone. It's simple but it's still extra at the same time.
5.0,Great little watch for less than $20.
5.0,Fast delivery and I get the right product
5.0,Great conversation starter. I neleibe there id good on everyone
5.0,"Great sweater. Abso love it. Fits perfect, and the company is great to deal with."
5.0,"I come to work dressed to impress with all the trappings of a Professional Office Drone, but none of my co-workers even suspect the rebel with a &#34;License to Ill&#34; that lies in hidden beneath."
5.0,"They were for my grandson, he loved all the colors"
5.0,"I have breast implants and I wear a D cup, I've used Victoria secret push up bras but they make my boobs look too bigger than they actually are, I found this minimizer on amazon and even though it had very little reviews, the reviews were positive so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy I did!!, this bra gives support to my back and minimizes my boobs, it makes them look smaller and perkier, it even makes my waist look smaller as this bra pushes up my breast without making them look big. I will definitely buy this bra again."
5.0,My husband loves the fit and comfort of it
5.0,Works well good price.
5.0,"I love these sunglasses so much. The sunglasses are very lightweight and very stylish. The sunglasses are big. I got mine in black and love the way they fit my face. I have a pair of RayBans and when I wear them I am still squinting because of the sun. However, with these sunglasses they cover the entire eye and I do not squint at all. They are very comfortable on my face. I would recommend these sunglasses to anyone. Would like to have more in different colors. I did receive the sunglasses at a discount for an honest review."
5.0,I absolutely love my purchases!
5.0,"Comfortable, warm, fairly decent sound. Also recharges really fast."
5.0,AWSOME stretcher!  Used for daughter game shoes.
5.0,Bigger than I anticipated ! Love it
5.0,I ordered it big on purpose.  It is absolutely adoreable!
5.0,"I love this dress! I thought that a medium would be too small and I really wanted a size large or extra large. However, upon receiving this dress, I’m happy I got the medium. I also get tons of compliments whenever I wear it."
5.0,I love this shirt.  It was a little big but I think the smaller size would have been too small.  The lace sleeves are gorgeous.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,My daughter loves them :)
5.0,"Great quality, looks good on my car. Only complaint is the shipping time. I have been spoiled by other companies shipping. Having said that, the shipping was free, so, my complaint is only subjective, when compared to other company's. Price was fine, selection is great."
5.0,We bought this for our daughter for Christmas!
5.0,Beautiful earrings...everyone asked me where I got them from
5.0,This fun costume is well made and works well. The fan can be a bit sluggish after the first hour so bring fresh batteries. It gets rather warm in the costume so this would not be good for 80 degree weather. A neat costume at a decent price. I would recommend this costume.
5.0,Can't wait to give as Christmas gift.
5.0,"This was dress was wonderful, just what I was looking for"
5.0,"Love this bag. I use it as a work bag & everyone love it. The pop of color is on point! Also, it is very roomy & holds all my belongings."
5.0,My 7 yr old son loves how comfy and lights these shoes are. He says they help him run faster. Cleaning them is so easy in the washing machine - just make sure you don't put them in the dryer.
5.0,These are very cute & sage masks tho we aren’t required to wear except entering restaurants or any medical bldg but many ppl comment when I wear them & very comfortable<br />I think 2 layers material w no filters
5.0,"Beautiful, silky and fits well. The sky blue is a lovely color. Hopefully, this company makes a long pj set. Very happy with my order."
5.0,"I love the length of this sweater (perfect for leggings), the softness (it feels soo good!), the warmth and the color! It is a great buy!"
5.0,"Nice side, good price"
5.0,ORDERED FOR THE WIFE. SHE LOVES IT
5.0,More expensive belts are made up of material that is then covered by leather and I find that they wear out quickly. I wanted a pure leather strap that would hold up and not begin to wear after a short time and this seems to be what I was looking for. Will follow up if the product does not perform as expected.
5.0,"I am not sure what others who have reviewed this item are complaining about, this fit exactly as the picture shows. Nice and slouchy and soft. Staticy... but that's what polyester fibers do in the winter."
5.0,The item received was true to picture/description and delivered on time.
5.0,Very well please with these mask. Will definitely rebuy from you... Oops... I did reorder different colors. Thank You ... GREAT PRODUCT.... And ll keep buying....
5.0,"Got the XXL and it fits as expected. There was no information on the website about what the material is. It's 95% Rayon & 5% Spandex. It's light weight, stretchy, and drapes nicely. I washed this in the machine on Delicate cycle, then put it in the dryer - but only on air fluff (no heat). It came out fine. In fact, the fold lines from being packaged even disappeared - didn't need to iron."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I wanted something super comfortable, easy to wear, and not tight around the baby bump. I ordered an XL which I guess was one size big since the sleeves were almost full length for me, but I am only 5ft 1and if you pull them up it looks just fine. I'm also 206 lbs and 8 months pregnant. I usually wear size in 18 pants though which is why I still think the dress sizes may run large. Bottom line, definitely recommend."
5.0,it could probably be called unisex
5.0,I love these pants! They are so soft. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft. I will definitely be buying more!
5.0,Love my new jeans!
5.0,These are great. I wanted something lightweight and attractive and these are perfect. They also came with a nice case.
5.0,Great item. glad I bought it.
5.0,Love that chip/ coin is protected!
5.0,These are so soft and nice!
5.0,CAN NOT BEAT THIS PRICE....every bit as warm as the MUCH higher priced UA stuff....way happy!!
5.0,Gorgeous. Amazing quality for the price. I wish they did half sizes!!
5.0,"they are really the perfect size and come quickly. I thought I might be allergic to them because I have sensitivity issues, but I've had no problem with them at all so far."
5.0,This is a beautiful ring and looks great on my finger. It looks much more expensive than the low price I paid for it!
5.0,Comfortable and affordable🙌🏾
5.0,Most comfortable pajamas I've ever owned
5.0,"This dress is a great buy. It is an elegant and beautiful dress. The picture does not do it justice. I am 5'4, 130, 32 Bust, 28 waist and 39 hips and have dark skin. I bought a small blue one.It runs a little large on me but not enough to justify spending money to get it altered! So I wear it with a gold waist band belt and heels. Every time I wear this dress, I get tonnes of compliments and people want to take my picture with them. I have worn it to several weddings and every bride has whispered in my ear that I looked amazing. The dress is unforgiving on an undefined midsection and a large lower stomach. But that is easily fixed with some shape wear !"
5.0,"Cute, colorful. 💜 them!"
5.0,VERY CONVENIENT FOR HOLDING WALLET PHOTOS AND I.D. CARDS
5.0,No dislikes at all in fact surprised at the room and pockets in this bag. Well made and very appealing design.  Great bag for the price
5.0,"What a cute great outfit.... My daughter loved it, everyone was so excited about how cute she looked in this outfit.  We bought a pair of black boots and was perfect.  Note it does NOT come with gloves, but we found some here.  Also, for the hair, we used the temporary purple spray that washes out... worked amazing!"
5.0,"I’m thinking the large logo should be on the back and another small one, not the same but using the same subject matter, should be on the front left side."
5.0,Used for wedding
5.0,"I have purchased this sexy little necklace for myself and for several of my friends as a gift - everyone just loves it! It is fun to wear and very funky, without being over-the-top.  It adds just the right amount of spice to almost any outfit.  It certainly has never failed to get the conversation started!"
5.0,"It's sturdy, the clasp works every time and I like the band on the top that holds bills"
5.0,"Great deal, price and quality. Fast shipping."
5.0,Quality I like.
5.0,Fits me well. The pants around the ankle aren't as tight as some other slim fitting pants. But still love them.
5.0,I purchased this dress on sale as a backup option but chose to wear it instead.  The dress flares and has a little stretch so the only measurement that was relevant was the bust size. I was able to wear a size 8 in this dress. It was comfortable and I received alot of comments. Would purchase this dress again in any color.
5.0,True to sizing info. Very cute and fun!
5.0,This is the best of all the anti fog sprays!!!
5.0,Great shirt. Order 1 size bigger
5.0,I love them &#60;3
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is Director of Nursing at a nursing & rehab facility.  She is working long long hours to make certain her residents do not become ill during a time when her staff is scared to come to work.  I sent her this necklace to thank her for the love and care she gives of herself to others.  She needed a pick-me-up, and this did the trick.  She loves it!  VERY fast delivery, too!<br /><br />I would love to upload a photo, but there is not an option for that."
5.0,I loved these glasses for my halloween costume!  They were adorable and the nose piece was adjustable.
5.0,Really helps keep swelling and foot pain away!
5.0,Great shirts I will order more! Would like a bigger selection of colors
5.0,"Purchased this for my niece and her best friend and within seconds of giving it to them, they had them on and have not taken them off since. The looks on their faces was priceless."
5.0,"I saw this on The Washington Post's top tech gadgets list for holiday 2013, and decided to buy for my brother and father...It's awesome and I'm sorry I didn't buy one for myself!  Very flexible and tight tabs with rubber nubbies keep your things in place.<br /><br />Perfect to keep things secured before for throwing in a suitcase, backpack, in the car, drawer.  There's also a little loop on the back if you need to have your organizer hanging in a closet, utility room, etc."
5.0,"I would order this again, the print design and colors were vibrant and stylish, I'm very pleased, thank you for making a good product"
5.0,I now have 4 pairs of Vionic sandals. The black with tan leopard are very stylish. Great fit handmade well. I look forward to wearing them this summer.
5.0,"A great thing if you are constantly cold.  Ordered for my mom, she lives in a cold state.  Satisfied with the purchase for 100%.  You can turn on the heating and quickly warm up, and even charge your phone!"
5.0,Color is as pictured and the fabric is nice. Beautiful on.
5.0,"Es super suavecito, a mi me encanta la ropita es suave y de buen tamaño."
5.0,Worked great for our cruise to the Bahamas
5.0,These shorts are great. Very comfy.
5.0,Great quality and washes beautifully. Love the 3/4 length sleeves!
5.0,I thought they would be cheap but i was qronf! Theyre made of heavy duty metal that really does the job!
5.0,great gift for my wife!
5.0,"Good hat, fits and looks as expected, shipped on time"
5.0,nice and light!
5.0,I am in the jewelry business... these cuff links show up like the real thing... excellent value.
5.0,"Got this for a set of twins.  They have problems not only keeping the mask on but losing them.  This helps and quick to have all in one when at doctor's, stores, and just out and about.  Their moms really love this."
5.0,Super cute flowy dress. Adorable with leggings and boots. Has pockets!!!
5.0,the necklace looks substantial without being too heavy and the earrings are nice and light.  very happy with it.
5.0,Good comfortable sleeve.
5.0,"Soft, lightweight! Great fabric!!! Fit is perfect!"
5.0,"beautiful color, looks high quality. my boyfriend wore this to a wedding and it added an extra flair to his suit. I love the simple design. I would buy again from this company."
5.0,It's a very beautiful bracelet iam glad I brought one.
5.0,This jacket is awesome! I was very pleased with the fit. I have long arms and this was not too short in the wrist. Can’t wait to stay cozy and warm this winter! Very nice quality 5 stars all the way :)
5.0,"The fit of this is small - the 2T-4T fits my 10th centile, 25lb almost 3 year old just right, with an inch or two for growth. Which was perfect for us, but everyone else should size up! The colour is good and the material is thick, with almost a swimsuit feel. It is lined in the front."
5.0,Can't go wrong with Atama belts.  I've had them for 10 years.
5.0,"I ordered this hat as a gift.  I was really happy with the quality.  I received it in less than a week, just as I was told."
5.0,"It was just what I was looking for, the price was amazing. I will be repurchasing again. It was a grateful find. It made the perfect gift within my family."
5.0,"I'm a big fan of Yoga Reflex's products. Being plus size makes it very difficult to find high quality and attractive workout clothing, but Yoga Reflex goes up to an XXL that runs true to size. No cheap, ill-fitting, runs 3 sizes small chintzy merchandise here! I'm a size 18 and am very large chested (42DDD in fact) and the XXL bra top fits me just fine. The only caveat to that is that if your large busted, this top will NOT work as a sports bra...there just isn't enough support. I bought mine to lounge around the house and was pleasantly surprised that I can actually get away with wearing it for a quick run to the corner store, gas station, cleaners, etc.  It holds up great in the wash too. I wash it in cold with like colors and air dry it to keep the spandex from giving out prematurely.<br /><br />One more thing about the fit. I absolutely LOVE that this top is easy to put on and take off!!! Unlike some of my other sports bras that involve a serious workout and a lot of contorting to get them on and off. What a relief! If you're a curvy girl, Yoga Reflex is definitely worth buying. Their clothing is stylish, well made and it actually fits!!!"
5.0,Big enough to store items in it. Liked that it has a zipper also. Gift to my mother in law she liked it very much put her initial on front pocket really liked it.
5.0,"ordered in coral and the color is a more orangy coral, as I had hoped, then the picture.  it looks more pink in the picture then in person.  so if looking for a true coral, this was perfect for my ring bearer.  Super fast shipping, thanks!"
5.0,It is to small to wear long johns with
5.0,I love this dress!!! Very well made! Fabric looks like a dress not a costume! I bought a medium. Fits perfectly. I am 5'5 and 138 lbs. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0,"Perfect, stayed on all night I even fell asleep with it on and it stayed on"
5.0,This was purchaces for my father and he loves them
5.0,"Love love love these pants!!  They fit me perfectly...almost like a tailor came and measured my dimensions!  Perfect waist, perfect hips, perfect length!  My new &#34;favoritest&#34; jeans!  I'm going to have to get them in more colors."
5.0,"Inexpensive, good quality, just what I wanted."
5.0,"A loose and airy dress perfect for beach days!  Lets air circulate and keeps me cool!  I wear it backwards too, because I like the V shape to be in front sometimes.  Easy to machine wash and dry.  Love it.  Exactly as advertised.  I am a 12 and have a large.  It's plenty big.  I may consider going down a size."
5.0,"I feel safe wearing it every day.  I even wear it when I run, play volleyball and shower.  I had a box chain very similar to this one for a long time and still have that one and liked the strength of it so much I ordered this one hoping it was the same and it is.  I plan to order more to replace all the weaker chains that come with the necklaces that I have received for gifts, just so that I feel safe wearing them and won't lose the pendants that hang from them. A lot of the necklaces that have been gifted to me, the chains aren't long enough anyway, so this way I get the length I know that works for me."
5.0,just as excepted
5.0,Very nice... Pleasantly Surprised!
5.0,Although I didn't mind waiting these arrived ten days before the earliest date listed. They are really nice looking. The attention to detail and craftsmanship was a real superise for me. I feel like I got a real bargain for the modest price I paid. They have a distinct rubber smell that comes with a new product off the assembly line but a day of airing outside took care of most of it. I much prefer that than a shoe that has sat on a shelf too long and the rubber is dried out. I would definitely recommend this product.
5.0,Very cute and comfortable. I love that it has pockets. Great for travel because you feel as comfortable as wearing pajamas but look nice.
5.0,Tanks fit well. You never know what your getting ordering clothing/shoes online. Very pleased.
5.0,Quality product for a great price
5.0,Love fabric cool to wear.
5.0,Love it! Has helped get that extra sweat that I was struggling to achieve! Must have!
5.0,This is a very pretty shirt and it fits true to size. I would definitely recommend it but make sure you get your own correct size. It is almost see through so I will be wearing a black bra with it.
5.0,THESE SHOES ARE BEAUTIFUL ANDAY FITS WELL WILL BUY AGAIN
5.0,This was perfect for keeping two 7 year olds warm at a waterpark. They dried off quickly and stayed warm wearing these. I even changed my son out of his swim trunks onto  pants in the middle of the waterpark. It's long enough  to cover him up.
5.0,"It is so cute, usually I wear a small but if you look at the description then I wear a medium so i got a medium and it fits great. So make sure to check the size chart in description. I absolutely love this shirt"
5.0,This is a beautiful bag I love it and in my opinion the quality is great!! I also love that some of the money goes to charity I plan on buying more for christmas. I could not be happier with my purchase!
5.0,Beautiful Shirt!!
5.0,"Fun style, best comfort, best coverage, and unbeatable price.  I bought 2 of these."
5.0,"The fit is perfect for me. They aren’t see through at all (that’s the first thing I always check!) they are very comfortable and I can’t wait to wear them when I go surfing! The material is a nice swim suit material. I ordered an xxl and they are a little loose on my thighs so I probably could have gotten an xl like I would normally wear. I’d say they’re pretty true to size and they are cute shorts with the little v shape in the front. I recommend these. I’d wear them to the gym, swimming and I’ll probably wear them while gardening since they aren’t see through when I bend."
5.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, photos do not do justice!<br />I’ve purchased three and will buy again. Wife loves them, what else matters?"
5.0,Just what I want!! Very stylish.
5.0,"Super cute, nicely packaged.  Gave to a friend going through a rough patch.  She loved it and carries it with her daily.  Just something sweet for a loved one or good friend."
5.0,"I had been wanting these pajamas for years, so my husband got them for me last Christmas in the red. I absolutely love them!!! They are so comfortable , soft & beatiful. I am getting the black  now  & one for a gift.  I have had them for a year now and washed them a lot and they  look and feel as soft & comfortable as the were when I got them. The color is still the beatiful rich red. They are my favorite pajamas. Now I want them in every color . ❤️"
5.0,The hat was easy to wear and it shaded my face from the sun very well.
5.0,"Everything I'm looking for in Aviator sunglasses - polarized, oversized, mirrored, & great price - 10/10"
5.0,I am obsessed with these! Beautiful craftsmanship and so unique. Love that they’re long enough not to be covered by my hair.
5.0,One word-GREAT!  I am a 240 pound disabled man and these lightweight poles don’t do anything but provide me with unwavering support. These were referred to me by my cousin and he was right!
5.0,Supportive and cute for my son
5.0,Gift to family member
5.0,"I have ordered 2 of this wonderful dress (tho I personally avoided ones with bright contrasting stripes. ) . I got the yellow - gorgeous! And blue and taupe, beautiful.  Here's why it works for me 1. the waist design is flattering and means ""no belt needed."" 2. The fabric is soft, and comfy.  3. And since I prefer to cover my upper arms, I don't need any wrap or scarf.  So simple! Put it on,  and you are dressed to nicely go anywhere!<br />Caveat: I have not yet laundered and I may even spring for dry cleaning when the time comes as the fabric is nice, but thin.  I hope the dress will hold up because I love it!  Will keep you posted...."
5.0,He absolutely loved it. I was very Skeptical of buying this product. Because of the reviews. But everything turned out to be amazing.
5.0,"Beautiful navel ring. Although I am disappointed with the shipping, the beauty makes up for it."
5.0,Runs very small!!
5.0,"Bought this for the Go-Tcha.<br /><br />I've tried a lot of replacement bands. A lot. Almost all of them have openings about half a cm longer. Seems negligible but that made the Go-Tcha device prone to falling out. This band however, has an opening the same size as the default band that came in the box!"
5.0,Good quality cute dress
5.0,Beautiful!!!!!!!! Thank you!
5.0,fit perfect!  Suck my stomach in!
5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law. She loved it!
5.0,They are cute and stylish. Not see thru at all. All large leggings are to large for me because im losing weight but I ordered a large anyways. It was somewhat hard getting into them due to the fat I have thighs and booty but once I got passed all that they fit perfectly and look good on me.
5.0,Ordered this for my sister's 5Oth birthday.  She says it's the most comfortable mask she's ever worn.  She works a 40 hour work week in a retail environment and deals with the public daily so that's good enough for me!  plus it's Duran Duran!!
5.0,Fits my 5 year old great and he loves it! The ear loops make wearing a neck gaiter soo much more comfortable!
5.0,I absolutely love this robe!! I bought this robe from Costco years ago and fell in love with it ...lived in it from Nov. to Mar.(from Minnesota.) Washes well and is very comfortable so tracked down the exact one here....Soooo happy!
5.0,"My daughter is 9, she usually wears a size 10-12 in clothing. She’s 4’5” and weighs 82lbs. I purchased the size 11-12 years and it fit perfectly. This item definitely runs a bit small in US girls size. Overall super cute."
5.0,"Beautiful necklace with a very touching story. Starfish project works to eliminate the exploitation of women and children in 3rd countries.  I bought this as a gift just because it was pretty, then read the accompanying story and I am coming back to get one for myself."
5.0,Like the color pink !
5.0,These are great over glasses sunglasses!
5.0,"A gift for my best friend. I thought it was hilarious, so did she! Good quality pin!"
5.0,This matched perfectly with a vest we purchased on Amazon as well &#34;Coofandy Men's V-neck Sleeveless Slim Fit Jacket. Fit Nicely and is of nice quality.
5.0,"Hat is warm and flattering. Well made, material is soft, not at all itchy. Highly recommend."
5.0,I love them because they are perfect and don't have to be rolled over. Most of the time these are to tall for me.
5.0,"Beautiful shirt at a great price. Had to size up (usually an XS and the S fit well). Quick delivery and easy returns (as others have said, the seller charges shipping on returns, but it’s very reasonable)"
5.0,"The Orchid Row Women's Prep Stripe Jersey Knit Basic Scarf Grey/Blush is nicely designed, has good muted colors, and is generous in size. The 100% Acrylic material is soft against the skin and retains body heat, great for Fall/Winter wear. The 25 inches by 72 inches size allows my wife to wrap it around her neck atop a jacket for outdoors or spread it out like a cape in cool theaters or on a plane. The Grey color is nice with two pink stripes at either end of the 72 inch length above its pleated ends. The Scarf can be machine washed and hung to dry.<br /><br />This is a great garment from Orchid Row, a company that offers many styles of scarfs and hats."
5.0,My son is four and wore this as part of his Fig the Fox costume from the show tumbleleaf
5.0,"I bought a set of these for my husband; he's a pretty organized packer.  But then, I went on a trip, and ended up borrowing his set.  Beats using grocery store bags for sure.  Undies can go in the small one, and if you are making a stop or two & need to pull out an outfit, it's handy to use the other bags.  Husband is so happy with them he bought a set each for me and The Kid.  Lots of cool colors to choose from; just be aware that they are different prices."
5.0,I ordered a size larger than normal and it is a perfect fit.  Very pretty and plan to purchase another one or two.
5.0,I have to wear the mask all day for work and this particular mask is comfortable.
5.0,it's very pretty and nice materials with a good price.  The pants just a little bit longer but it was not that bad.  I love it.
5.0,My daughter loved it! It was perfect for a stocking stuffer!
5.0,not a brand name one but still extremely cute
5.0,Love the shirt i bought it's very comfortable.
5.0,My daughter is giving these to her friends! She likes the vibrant colors and fingers crossed the necklace doesn't break.
5.0,Adorable Dress<br />Fit perfect
5.0,Love these! Beautiful!!!
5.0,This shacket is on the thin side. It is great to wear with joggers and a t-shirt. The sizing is pretty spot on. You may want to size up if you’re taller because the arms feel a little short.
5.0,Keep the sun out of your face.
5.0,"I have this set in 2 colors and just ordered 2 more.  They are so cute and comfortable.  I'm 5'5"" 180lbs and I ordered a medium at first.  When I went to order another the medium was sold out so I purchased a small.  They both fit great and I am extremely happy with this purchase."
5.0,Love this shirt and color! It's bright!
5.0,Love the case it came in - and the glasses are so cute!! I received them today and have received compliments from at least 5 colleagues. ☺️ Have yet to determine the blue light blocking abilities but I think they’ll be just fine.
5.0,"great item, good fit, fast shipping, great transactions"
5.0,This is even prettier than the picture and she was very happy with it
5.0,I'm 153 pounds and size Large fits perfectly.
5.0,"It's perfect for keeping my purse off the floor and &#34;wasting&#34; a seat. Southern women have an old saying &#34;you sit your purse on the floor, you will never have any money.&#34; My bank account is saved!"
5.0,My granddaughter loved these
5.0,"EXTREMELY HAPPY with this tie. I bought the yellow with black stripes from my Hufflepuff-inspired outfit. The colors were perfect. It's the same length as a normal adult tie. The material is the same as any other tie. Not too wide and loved the loop in back so I could tuck the tail in, which replaces what a tie clip would do. Someone wrote about washing the tie; normal ties including this should be dry cleaned or delicately hand washed. While I have not done either of these yet the quality seems like any normal tie. I love this tie!"
5.0,This robe makes me feel so sexy when lounging about in the house. I really want another maybe a longer one. But it definitely worth it. The quality does not look shiny and cheap at all.
5.0,"So soft , pretty and the length is great."
5.0,Absolutely adorable swimsuits for my girls as expected. Received a lot sooner then I thought I would. Wasn't supposed to receive until July 19 thru Aug 5th but got in the mail yesterday.
5.0,Its exact as picture
5.0,These are so comfy...I love them.  Will always keep this style in my closet.
5.0,"Designed it for my mil, she is very picky on cloths and being petite it’s harder for her. This shirt is her new favorite. It’s light enough for the humid summer and the length, sleeves and collar are all perfect. She was very happy with the shirt"
5.0,"Product is great. Description is exact. Quality is great, arrived in timely fashion. Definitely would buy again."
5.0,"Nice looking watch for the price, good quality"
5.0,I absolutely 💯 love this. It's super cute and just the right width. Sized perfectly.
5.0,"Been working great for me. Arrived fast, looks good."
5.0,"I had dozens of green bags from various stores, all over my car trunk. I saw someone in line at the grocery store with one of these, and had to ask where she bought it.  Amazon, of course!  Right away, I bought a set of insulated and a set of non-insulated.  I threw away all the others as soon as these arrived.  They fold flat for easy storage or carrying into the store. There is a firm flap to flip down to cover and support the bottom of the bag.  The bags are freestanding when unfolded with the bottom in place.  The insulated ones have a zipper top which also has the insulation material on it.  These bags hold so much, and the bagpersons at my grocery store like them because they are so open and easy to load.  They can get heavy when fully loaded, but they can support the weight.  There are longer straps on the long sides that help with carrying, and shorter handles on the short sides that are good for lifting in and out of the buggy and car trunk.  These also worked great when we went on vacation and took lots of food, snacks, paper products, etc.  It was so easy to load these up and stack them in the car.  I would give these more stars if I could.... I highly recommend them!"
5.0,Fit perfectly & color is great!
5.0,I love this dress. I feel absolutely adorable when I wear it. It's a great plus size dress!
5.0,"Finally a G SHOCK  with hands I like. Love the color, the light and the digital layout. The case isn't too thick. The strap is soft and has quick release pins. I get it dirty at work and it cleans up like new with the kitchen sponge."
5.0,"These are good quality, thick, warm, and perfect length (I’m 5’8”). Only complaint is that the front comes up higher than normal. Typically the back is cut slightly higher to accommodate the butt. But not on these so the front feels oddly high."
5.0,"Best compression socks I've ever worn. My feet always swell on long flights. Always, that is, until I wore these socks on a recent trip from the U.S. to Sweden. Between flights and layovers, I was traveling for 17 hours and my feet did not swell. Not at all! The socks are well made, comfortable, reasonably priced, and, obviously, do the job they're meant to do. They have my highest recommendation."
5.0,"Good quality, they were just as described. My wife loved the strap for her Ukulele"
5.0,great product.  interchangeable with many other snap apart key rings i have.<br />good manufacturing and quality tolerances
5.0,Super cute outfit. Would buy again
5.0,"It looks very cute, but the pants are scratchy. I'm hoping they will get softer in the wash."
5.0,Nice embroidery. thin cloth but good for warm weather
5.0,Impressed by these although they do start to hurt if worn for long periods of time worth the price
5.0,"I love this dress, my fianc&eacute; favorite summer dress on me , I have 3 of them now"
5.0,Really nice and sturdy...the color is nice too!
5.0,son loved it. fit true to size
5.0,The product is very good. It fulfills 100% with what it promises. It is a very good product.
5.0,These earrings complement any copper jewelry and matches any outfit!!!
5.0,super cute & soft. I love it!
5.0,i bought it for my dad to wear when he visits the VA hospital. he loves it and wears it everywhere now. he was army artillery in the early 1960's in cold war Germany. he was there when the berlin wall was being built
5.0,"Love the pants! The only thing I wish was that the material was thicker for warmth, but it’s perfect for summer. I wear it to work with a crisp white blazer and it’s a hit!<br />Oh I do wish it has pockets! But i didn’t like the other companies’ design with pockets because you can see the outline of the pocket."
5.0,They look just like the picture. Super cute!
5.0,Soft beautiful robe. Love it.
5.0,Arrived quickly and just as described.
5.0,"They are sparkly, that is what I like about them also they are my fav bb team."
5.0,Bought for hubby and he really likes it. Looks nice on.
5.0,Great for waist stretch in it stretches it alot
5.0,Beautiful watch. I love it. The date and day were a little hard to figure out on how to set but I figured it out.
5.0,es bonito me gusto
5.0,"Lo compré para mi nieta de 10 años...le gustó mucho, el tamaño perfecto,  el problema es que solo ese quiere usar...tengo qye comprarle otros."
5.0,"Love it, just don't get em wet or they get STINKY. Otherwise, perfect. I've gotten so many compliments!"
5.0,It was a gift for my friend that is now a first time Grandmother. She Loved ir
5.0,"Wearing this jacket is like wearing a fuzzy blanket. It blocks out wind and cold and get super nice and toasty from your body heat fairly quickly. I love it, although it does pile and shed a little bit in the beginning."
5.0,"maybe next year, LOL"
5.0,Great quality excellent price fast shipping
5.0,All of their shirts are design for people who work out but mostly I like the 3X for guys like me that can't find tshirts anywhere else in my size and there prices are fair.
5.0,"Looking at it before I received it, I knew it would look great with my dress but I was worried it would be stiff or confining.  When I tried it on, it was soft and comfortable!  And I loved the ever so slightly puffy sleeve with the ruching.  It's fabric is soft and light and flexible, and it looks perfect over a dress or sleeveless top."
5.0,Very cute  I really  like them  .
5.0,These came exactly as they looked in the pictures. I love that they are small and delicate. Big hoops don’t suit me. They reflect light well. I also normally struggle with getting hoops in but these are cool because you put them in through the back of your ear so you can see.
5.0,no complaints....everything we needed
5.0,Absolutely beautiful dress.  True to size.
5.0,"these are quality shorts. Nice mesh lining, nice style. The best feature is the additional elastic in the waist. I highly recommend these, just be careful when picking the size."
5.0,"This works with my Seiko clockwise, had it for about 2 weeks now. It runs for a hour and then rests for 3 hours. My watch is always on time, right day, right time, don't have to set my watch every morning when I get up. Totally silent, great so far."
5.0,This is a great hood when you're riding around in an open gator or any other open vehicle on a cold and dusty night.  I'd be coughing up a lot more stuff and hurting from the cold a lot more if it wasn't for this hood.
5.0,Wore this to a costume Party and won first place! it was awesome!
5.0,This top has very pretty embroidery work. Colors are beautiful on the gray fabric. It drapes nicely but does need a quick ironing after hand washing. I recommend it for casual with jeans or a little dressy with slacks.
5.0,Must buy.
5.0,This shapewear was comfortable and flattering.
5.0,"This pink sugar skull scarf is very soft and subtle. It’s lightweight and definitely not a cold weather scarf, but I wasn’t expecting that. It adds a nice little punch to my outfit."
5.0,"Product is as described and it did not disappoint.  Seems like it will last for more than a couple uses so I am pleased.  We all got new phones and being a true ""Dad"" I didn't want them stuffing the phones into back pockets or putting it down somewhere to get lost/stolen.  These are plastic purses that meet security guidelines.  They are not made of leather and not intended for daily abuse.  I am quite pleased with these and if/when we need to replace, I will repurchase from this seller."
5.0,"Beautiful, thanks"
5.0,"This hat is so cute, and VERY warm and soft. My son hasn't figured out how to get it off, but he does try since he isn't a fan of hats. I was very surprised at the quality and am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Beautiful clips/separators, was very pleased as price was consideredable less than “authentic”.  Will purchase from vendor again.  Matches perfectly with my Rose Gold Pandora Bracelet; allowing to also mix and match colorful, silver and rose gold  beads/charms."
5.0,Great buckle. Get lots of compliments. Nexbelt folks are great. Highly recommend.
5.0,"This Is The Most Gorgeous, Christmas,  🎄 Cat 🐱 Necklace! 😁❤️ I Absolutely Love It! It is Made Of Excellent Quality, Delivered Fast, Is So Sparkly, So Beautiful & An Excellent Price! I’m Very Pleased!"
5.0,My son loves his new watch. The light up feature is his favorite. Shows digital and analog time.
5.0,Really great sweater that accentuates the bust and highlights your curves. The material is thick and stitches are seamless - just upon opening you’ll be able to tell it’s great quality. I’m a size 4 and ordered a small. Definitely worth the price.
5.0,Hi the key chain bag is well made and holds a lot of keys
5.0,Worked out great for our recent Disney vacation
5.0,Great quality - far better than I expected considering it was one of the less costly items. I'm just getting into wearing harnesses - I really like the style it adds a little oomph to any outfit ( I wear it WITH my bra and I like the neckiline it creates)  and this one is perfect to wear in and out of the house.
5.0,My wife loves this and received numerous compliments on it! She wears it all time now.
5.0,Actually stylish.  Very responsive to uv light.  Case is sharp too.
5.0,Fit is good! Color is perfect
5.0,I bought this because I needed something more formal looking and this is perfect. I love the look of it and the fit and finish. It winds by hand by simply turning the crown or by simply wearing it.
5.0,Really cute. I saw the dress for 3 times as much on another website.
5.0,PERFECTTTTTTT<br />LOVE LOVE LOVE<br />BOUGHT A SIZE UP AND IT FITS AND IS SO SEXY!
5.0,Got this dress before a family trip to New Orleans. It was so easy to dress up and down. It’s a perfect outfit for that time of the month ladies and you want to look cute but still comfortable. The ruching hides and hugs all the right places. I bought it in additional colors. Give it a try. Definitely worth it!
5.0,"The jacket that I ordered was too big, but the company had great customer service.  They responded really quickly to my return request and offered me an exchange or refund on my purchase.  The quality of the jacket was really great, and all of the print on it looked like a real sports hoodie.  Highly recommend, just make sure that you order the right size."
5.0,"Love the jewel pop!  I have several pieces of jewelry with dichroic glass and this looks great with my other pieces.  Like other Kameleon jewelry, it's really nice quality."
5.0,"My favorite little hat.<br /><br />Durable and professional feel for a beanie.  I have a slightly larger head and it fits comfortably, sometimes to the point I forget it is on.  It also is heavy enough to keep your head warm but not so thick that you couldn't wear it in warmer weather.<br /><br />I'm now just hoping it stands the test of time and its seemingly durable feel is true."
5.0,Very comfortable shoes for my 2yr old. He loves them.
5.0,"My fiancé loves these shorts, I got him the dark green ones last year so I decided to get him another pair. These ones have pockets so that's a plus. They are super good quality and fit as expected which is nice because he is a big burly 6.6 ft tall man. Will probably buy him a third pair for xmas"
5.0,They are just as pictured and so cute
5.0,"This hat is shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics, it's graphic displays, melts steel like blacksmiths."
5.0,Super cute and easy to put on
5.0,"I have had so many compliments each time I wore these! They are comfy and stretchy. I lost a few sequins where my thighs rub together…but that’s not the pants fault! Overall, I love them!!!"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for.... Nice leather, perfect size."
5.0,"I like the product, and would like it even better if Amazon didn’t pester me for a review."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, good quality, looks awesome!"
5.0,"I LOVE these bands so much I bought them in several colors. They are the closest quality to Apple bands, for a fraction of the price."
5.0,"Ordered a large, has stretch, comfortable"
5.0,"I am a little over 200 lbs and 5'7"" and I ordered a 2xl and it is a little big but still works well for my event.  It's great quality and cute!"
5.0,"Fit my Sun Mountain E-Cart perfectly.  Love having an extra basket for sweater, headcovers, snacks."
5.0,"I'm very pleased with my product. I never write reviews but I decided to do one for this outfit. My son is 2, tall and slender. He wears a 2t/3t and I ordered that same size, fits perfectly. It has an elastic waist band and belt loops if needed. The material is a nice linen quality, perfect for and outdoor summer event."
5.0,"But, order a size larger than normal. The bust runs small - use the data/measurements provided. I bought it for travel and it washed up great in the sink and dried easily overnight. The pleasant surprise was that it didn't wrinkle as much as other linen products that I have worn."
5.0,"As described, fast shipping!!"
5.0,"The fiancé loved these shorts as they were great for when he goes on runs with our husky!<br /><br />He just wished the blue part of the shorts were a bit longer, but glad the black compression is long enough.<br /><br />He normally wears size Small, so true to size for these<br />175lbs<br />5’7”<br />30x31"
5.0,Tight rack every time!
5.0,"4Always loved the Amanda boot cut style. Can’t find anywhere else now. Higher rise is much easier to live with too…very comfortable. Thighs are just a bit loose, but easily corrected. Ordered a 12 Petite, but probably could use a 10 Petite. Length is about right after washing and drying. Usually have trouble with that. Color is great, but would love to order in black or white if ever available. Good price."
5.0,"Quick arrival, great price, apparently appropriate level of quality (I haven't worn them, as they were a gift). I would purchase again!"
5.0,"Surprisingly good. Stays up, gives light support and makes my legs and feet hurt less. Nice quality!"
5.0,Perfect for my bras! Easy to use.
5.0,I wanted a shorter length than the usual 16&#34; length.  There are no other 15&#34; chains that I could see available so I took a chance on this one.  It is a basic box chain.  It is good for small pendants.  Glad I got it.
5.0,"I ordered these for my 92 year old grandmother, who may be the pickiest woman I've ever met, figuring she'd like the blue, hate the bunnies, and never wear them, but at the price, I took the leap. She actually wears the bunny set and even the blue set a few times. Not going to lie, seeing my grumpy granny in adorable bunny jammies makes me smile."
5.0,Great for the price you pay.
5.0,Love this bracelet. Great item. Does not look cheap. This item is well made. Someone had said something about the diamonds. But what do u expect for $70.
5.0,My daughter loves this! Wears it every night after her bath.
5.0,A  OK
5.0,VERY CLASSY AND SWEET
5.0,"Exactly what I needed.  I am pregnant and unable to wear any bra that constructs my rib cage, SO I needed these to remain...presentable...with the little cotton bras I am now wearing.  They breathe well and are not lined with a thin layer of fabric the way previous ones were.  Meaning that when I sweat, they don't start to fall apart.  Would buy again."
5.0,"Fit is great! I have not washed these yet, but they are super cute and fit perfect. I’m 5’4” 105 and ordered XS. A little long,  but will work perfect with the right shoes."
5.0,Bought three different pants from different manufactures and the Reebok men's joggers are by far my favorite. I ordered another pair in a different color.
5.0,Feels amazing and light weight
5.0,"I LOVE this bathing suit! It is so cute, but it was too small. I ordered a medium. I have repurchased it in a large so I will write a review when that one comes. The bathing suit has padding for the top, which is what made it a bit too small for me. Very adorable one piece though"
5.0,"What a stylish, cute little comfortable dress WITH pockets and a flattering shape! Depending on your body type, this will fit you perfectly, but if you have a broad back you might need to go a size up. Ordering clothing online can be such a hassle because you never know what sizes are like but this is one that is actually worth it at the price you can afford and look you will love!"
5.0,"It's a very nice ring, I have received many compliments on it."
5.0,"This is adorable, Well made ,great fabric. Would recommend. I did order a size up"
5.0,I get compliments all the time on it. Love it. Great price
5.0,Great shades and fast delivery.
5.0,"Love this top. Versatile. Goes with everything. Casual, comfortable."
5.0,Doesn’t look anything like the pic!
5.0,"This keychain is super nice!<br />Great price, it took mine about 2 and a half weeks to get to me in california.<br />Well worth the wait.<br />I bought two ! The blue and the red.<br />I did like the blue one a little better but both are very very nice !"
5.0,Ordered half a size up. Fit very well. Good quality. Loved them.
5.0,really cute and shiny for cheap earrings.
5.0,This was a gift for my friend. She loved it & the quality was great
5.0,looks great lots of complements when i wear it
5.0,It came way after my event so I had to send it back
5.0,This is a beautiful dress. The fitting is very complimentary. I wore it to a wedding and received a lot of compliments.
5.0,This was a gift and it is a beautiful sturdy watch that is made sturdy. He loved it.
5.0,"We love these masks.  They fit really well, are easy to put on and take off, and they look great!"
5.0,I love this dress.  It's very flattering.  Nice comfy material.  I've washed on delicate & hung to dry several times & came out nice.  5'7 148lbs & ordered size large.
5.0,"This dress is amazing.  It's fit a bit large, but I think it was meant to fit that way.  I was looking for something to where on my &#34;fluffy&#34; days and this dress is perfect.  The fabric quality is really nice for the price.  I order two other colors!!"
5.0,Perfect! Great for when you don't want to commit to having 18 of the same K-Cup
5.0,"This is a great product for the money, I bought them for work and they don't scratch easily like others have.<br />They always have a snug fit, won't slip down on your nose and are very comfortable to wear all day."
5.0,Great item to put finishing touch on costume.
5.0,"Bonitos y elegantes, esperando el momento perfecto para usarlos"
5.0,This sweatshirt is just what I need for the cool summer mornings on the Oregon coast. I love the spashes of color on it.
5.0,Mask was for my grandson sasha banks fan.  He loves it
5.0,The lining under the dress was longer than the dress so I had to hem it. Other than that it is a nice dress to wear for work.
5.0,Beautiful and inexpensive: can't beat that!
5.0,"Since I spotted this bracelet online, I was reminded of thee evil eye jewelry I saw  as a child in Turkey in 1968.  Of course, I ordered it immediately, and I am wearing it as I writ this review"
5.0,"So far so good. These are so easy to use! I don't know what weight these are rated for but for the weights my family lifts these work great. In fact, we're going to get another set."
5.0,Excellent quality wallet.
5.0,THIS NECKLACE IS JUST WHAT I WANTED IT IS EVERYTHING. I LOVE IT. SO DIFFERENT AND MAKES ANY PLAIN TOP OR DRESS JUST MORE BEAUTIFUL AND JAZZY!
5.0,silky type scrub top
5.0,"Great design and craftsmanship. I get compliments everytime. By the way I am a female and bought the smallest size available. A little big, but very comfortable."
5.0,"This little clutch wallet by Janstore is so adorable.  I really like  the fun print on it.  This is so whimsical. I have to smile every time I see it.  It makes me think of summer.  Its been a long winter....I could use a little inspiration of summer right now. This clutch may be intended for girls but I like so much I'm going to use it for myself.<br /><br />This wallet is well made. The wallet is constructed  from PU leather. There two main compartments.  The cash compartment has a zipper closure and is lined in a complementary nylon water resistant nylon.  There is a separation panel in case you need keep things apart.  Maybe one side could be for cash, the other for checks for deposit. One of the manufactures photo shows using one side to house your phone. My phone works but its a super tight fit with the otter box.  It might work best with a smaller phone. The zipper works very smoothly.  No need to tug or force.  The outer compartment has a snap closure for fast access.Inside you will find 11 card pockets, 1 window ID pocket and 3 large pockets that can hold important papers and/or check book.  I love the decorative charm that doubles as a zipper pull.<br /><br />What I like best about this wallet is I can keep all my essentials in it.  So I can just grab it and go, no need to carry a large purse.  Or if I do need a purse, I can just drop this in my bag and be secure that I have all my important items are with me.<br /><br />I really like this wallet.  I am looking forward to using it for a long time to come.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01BU0DHI0 Jastore® Elegant Girl Women Clutch Wallet Long Purse Zip Bag Card Holder (Rose)]]<br />Sample received in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of product."
5.0,Just as beautiful as their picture. I'm totally satisfied.
5.0,Gave this to our oldest Granddaughter as part of her 12th birthday present.  She is an avid rider and shows her horse regularly.  She was tickled to get it.  She has it hanging on her bag that she carries with her everywhere!  Great little piece.
5.0,"We gave this to our 8 yr old Grandson. My son is a former marine & my grandson is all about the marines & all things camo. We bought toy grenades, knife, etc. The pockets are deep enough for everything. He's 4' 5"" & 50 lbs. It's just a little big on him. It says ages 5-12 but unless your child is very small I can't see this vest fitting anyone 10-12 old. I only gave 4 stars on durability & sturdiness because I just gave it to him for Christmas. But it's a pretty nice vest."
5.0,Bought this scarf for my mother so she wouldn’t mess her hair up with the top down! She loves it.
5.0,photos dont do these justice
5.0,"Perfect wallet for traveling! Very good quality, I could hold two passports, ID's, cards, money, and change."
5.0,Comfortable and easy to slip on.  Perfect for all seasons and can be dressy or casual.
5.0,"2nd pair of these I purchased  very clear,no distortion polarized, excellent protection from small particles in the air, great side wrap around protection"
5.0,I want to love this key chain. It's so convenient if you are someone who wants to remove their car key so they don't have to lug around all their keys while exercising. But I cannot love this product because this is the THIRD one I've purchased that has broken within just a few months of owning it. The same thing happens. One of the shoddy springs pops off and leaves it looking like this. They need to work on their manufacturing. Find an alternative. UPDATE - The company reached out to me and sent me their new version and the springs are MUCH stronger. Thank you!
5.0,Love love love these slippers. So comfy and so cute with the pink hearts on them. Wish I would have ordered more than one set
5.0,I absolutely love this it's exactly what I wanred.
5.0,"Love the knee-hi sheers, they fit very well."
5.0,love these earrings. looked just like the pictures.
5.0,Perfect fit for my M2 Oakley frame.  They look nice and fit nice.  My frame has a lot of wear as it is my number 1 daily used glasses.  I was afraid to spend the big bucks for Oakley lens because of the risk of snapping the frame.
5.0,Gave this to my daughter as a gift and she loves them.
5.0,I love love love these glasses. I was having a vision problem driving at night so my optometrist recommended that I buy a pair of glasses with yellow lenses. I investigated thoroughly all sorts of glasses and decided on these after much research. I am THRILLED with my decision. I had gotten to the point of really hating driving at night. Now I am much more comfortable and at ease driving at night. First of all - they look amazing. I bought the gold colored frames and they fit perfectly. I needed no adjustments made to them. I was having a problem where headlights were down right blinding at times to me but these glasses filter out most of that glare - not all the glare - but certainly the irritating amount in my opinion. I almost feel like I'm wearing night vision goggles because they really brighten up dark areas at night. I have better vision all around me - no more dark side streets. They brighten up the darkness if that makes sense... I do not hesitate to recommend these glasses! I will never be without a pair - and if I lose them I will be reordering!
5.0,the straps are adjustable and the magnet is really good! I love the bracelet and the little envelope and cards that come with it. The bracelets are inside a cute little blue pouch and this is perfect for a gift
5.0,Cute. Perfect for Christmas time
5.0,"These shoes are very pretty!  They have a white base and silver applications.  They match everything.  On the picture it would seem as if they had some blue on them, but I guess its a reflection.  Its all silver, and gorgeous!  Comfortable too.  Great for playing in style!"
5.0,Beautiful and fit great!
5.0,It’s pretty and easy to put on.
5.0,"Very nice compression sock, my wife wears them while traveling."
5.0,I literally loooooove your scarfs great accessories for natural hair.
5.0,"This watch band is extremely soft, and looks great.  I would not hesitate to purchase another!"
5.0,Fits well and was very comfortable. Better quality than expected for the price.
5.0,Muy comodo y resistente de calidad...
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! I wore it for my bridal shower. It looks great on. Nice material and fit. I also put a pretty purple petticoat underneath it to help pop it out a bit more. I was turning heads ;)
5.0,They are just what we needed.Thanks
5.0,This case is very cute and is also functional.  I think it will do a good job of protecting my glasses since it is hard-sided. It is a little oversized so will fit most glasses except for really big sunglasses
5.0,"I am very impressed by this dress, it fit nicely, and it's very comfortable. I'm going to order another one in a different color."
5.0,These are fantastic for the beach and pool! My 18 month old daughter loved these! You can't beat the price and easy to clean
5.0,Good fit to watch and large wrist. Most difficult part of installing was getting the original band off. This band fit right in place. There is a slight gap between the watch and the band but it is noticeable unless you look for it. The clasp color is a shade different than the black watch but makes a nice transition to the green band. When I put the original band back on the gap was the same. The only reason it is even noticeable is because of the shade difference.<br />I hope they have a small version of this band for my wife.<br />After a week of wearing the watch with this band I like the watch much better as I am not worried about knocking it off every time I bump into something. The watch is no longer annoying.
5.0,"The scarfs were just as described. My daughter will love to wear these scarfs with all of her outfits, yea!!"
5.0,I love these so much! I just wish there were more different colors
5.0,I love it! I wanted something simple and stylish and this is perfect.
5.0,Great fitting & warm.  Excellent value
5.0,"I was surprised it fit so well , colors and the material are magnificent !"
5.0,It arrived earlier than expected.  Really cute shorts. It can dressed up or down. Very versatile.
5.0,Murica
5.0,I LOVE them! Perfect Cat Eye size.  I might just have to purchase in other colors
5.0,My son grew out of his previous tie dye shirt so we upgraded to this beauty.  Someone at school loved it so much it was stolen.  The guy is easy to pick out in a crowd.  We figure he needs it so we bought a second one for my son.
5.0,I really like these jogger pants. They are super comfy and is slim-fit which I love. Has two front pockets and two pockets in the back. I chose the size 30 and it fits well.
5.0,Great quality... one of my husbands favorite hats!!
5.0,"Love the colors, sizes and it hold just what I needed it for.  % Star"
5.0,the kids love this!!!
5.0,I really like the color and they are very comfortable. They look pretty good also.
5.0,Fits wonderfully. Going to order again.
5.0,The best money clip my husband ever had
5.0,Love these beanies! They fit great!
5.0,I really like these keychain tags. They look amazing and seem to be high quality.<br />I highly recommend these!
5.0,Great skirt. I used it for a Snow White Disneybound
5.0,"The watch is very handsome while being understated.  The watch says what it needs to without the need to draw attention. The band I am not a large fan of, but that was eqliy replaced for a small amount by a black leather band that makes the watch even more serious.  In brief, I’m not certain another watch exists under $200 that gives you this value. I would not hesitate to buy this watch for myself or as a gift."
5.0,Great fit.  Great looked.  I actually won my company’s sweater contest.
5.0,"Exactly as listed, even more beautiful in person '''''"
5.0,came as described and fit perfect
5.0,These are the cutest earrings. I get so many compliments.
5.0,"This is exactly what I needed!  I was looking for a ring protector to use during my workouts, gardening, and cooking with iron skillets.  Eureka! This is it and it's percect!  I ordered more so that one stays in my gym bag, one in the kitchen, and an extra to keep in my car for miscellaneous activities. I only wish I found this product sooner.  I recently spent hundreds getting my ring redone after heavy daily abuse.  My wedding and engagement rings are only 2 years old and my lifestyle beat them up.  The jeweler said he'd never seen a ring in such a state in his 30 years in the profession!  I prefer the largest one in the set even though I have thin fingers, because it fits best over my large diamond.  It fits perfectly over my diamond setting and stays put without worry.  I recommend ever woman have a few as soon as she gets engaged.  Jewelers should give one out with every ring sold, but I guess they wouldn't make their money in redoing settings, tips and polishing would they.  This product is a ring saver!"
5.0,Better than the ones from the store!
5.0,"I bought these and I love them. They are stylish, polarized and more importantly when you buy a pair your purchase goes towards helping others with their eyes from surgeries to eye glasses. Buy a stylish pair of sunglasses that you will get several compliments on :)"
5.0,I love this crop top. I ordered a small and I am 5'8&#34; 130lb and it fits great.
5.0,"These bras fit great and hold very well.  Great color. Really cute under tanks and tee shirts.  The straps end up closer to the neck than shown here so unless the shirt is made to come up around the neck it will be seen.  Also, I am a 36D and have had a hard time finding bras that will hold well.  This one holds very well and does not allow you to fall out of place from bending over or laying down on one side.  I'm an active mom so I'm always looking for things that make moving comfortable.  I started using these as my daily bras and love them.  I have all the colors but white now and will probably end up ordering that as well."
5.0,"Good fit. I love, love this skirt."
5.0,"Love this keychain, it’s perfect and convenient. Also great material."
5.0,Beautiful .A little long but hey I'm kind of short . Love it
5.0,It is very practical and it is of good quality.
5.0,"Love these. They are great. Fit well. If you’re looking for poon poon shorts, these are them!"
5.0,Its perfect. I purchased my regular size.
5.0,Me gusto !!
5.0,"nice charm,  I like it!"
5.0,"This hat is fabulous!!! I love everything about it, the colors, the warmth, it ties in so well with the season and the knitting on this hat is well done."
5.0,"This dress is super flattering! I am 6 months pregnant and needed something for work, yet light and comfortable enough to get me through the hottest part of the summer. It hits me below the knee but it still looks very flattering. For reference I am 5'1 and about 141 lbs (normally 127 pre-pregnancy and ordered my normal size of M). I love the bow on the side. My husband couldn't stop looking at me in the dress and said it was so beautiful! I will definitely be ordering another color."
5.0,Great product for the price if you use samsung health app!
5.0,It's beautiful!!!<br />Just buy a size larger than you would normally and it fits perfect!!!
5.0,I decided to give this clip five starts because it was sturdy enough to hold my thick and it was beautiful. None of the stones were missing and out of place. A similar hair clip would easily cost $10+ in a retail store.
5.0,"Absolutely perfect! I love everything about this top. It’s the perfect sexy summer top. Fits great, not too revealing, very flowy and fun. The print is bright and eye catching."
5.0,"I'm 5'6  158# I ordered a 2x after reading the reviews.  Usually I wear a large bottom but one of the reviews said size 2 up if you don't want them tight.  The 2x were very baggy but didn't have time to exchange.  I'm still able to wear them but a xl would have been perfect.  Cute colors, shorts work great for the beach.  Print exactly as pictured."
5.0,Love them! Very thick and at a great price!
5.0,Very beautiful! It doesn't hurt or anything.  Very unique.
5.0,Our grandson was so excited and happy to meet Santa at home. Best investment on a Santa suit!
5.0,"I love these leggings, they are warm and comfortable and fit like a glove.  Would perhaps have liked them a little longer but thats because I am 1.75m tall"
5.0,"I ordered this bra for an unusual reason. I reside in a mountain and the road to home is over a mile long. It is a dirt road full of rocks and pot wholes. It is a very rough ride. I needed something sturdy to hold me in plce. This bra is fantastic. it s comfortable, and meets my needs. Normally I yank my  bra off as soon as I get home from work but this one is so comfortable I hardly know its on. The only thing I would suggest is watch the size. I am normally a 38B. I read that the fit is small, so I ordered an extra large and it fits great. I would recommend this for sure."
5.0,"I bought it this because it was offered for $3 and I felt ""what do I have to lose, besides the $3?""<br />I've had a couple of weeks and I like it. It's reasonably lightweight. Not incredibly large, compared to other watches I have owned and the buckle doesn't have thin edges that dig into my wrist. One major benefit is the the display is large enough that I can read it clearly without my glasses and I suffer from a worsening case of presbyopia.<br />The night illumination is clear without being excessively intense. Another plus.<br />Has 24h time that is easy to engage. Another plus.<br />Overall, I would buy this again, if I needed to."
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful, the design and detail are amazing. So glad I got them, would definitely recommend these ! Janyl and her artisans are so gifted. A++ oh wait and the comfort, you don’t even know you have earrings on."
5.0,Good facemarks. The neck strap is extremely helpful.
5.0,Fits nice and also is very comfy!
5.0,"I love this shirt! Very flowy arms, yet nicely fitted at the waist. I did not notice the rhinestone when I ordered it and I thought it was a mistake and peeled it off.  Oh well, I would have taken it off anyway. It is thin material but I wear a thin tank under it."
5.0,"The perfect summer dress! Absolutely love it. The button detail is sooo cute. Very good quality and good price! It is a tad bit big, but it just makes more more flowy and comfortable for summer. I ordered a L, and am a 34D and size 8/10. Next time I would probably go for a M, even though the L fits fine. Love the lining on the inside of the dress so it is not see through."
5.0,Perfect gift for a friend.
5.0,"Material feels like a hispanic table cloth that’s made of thin plastic sack, but it does the job and it hasn’t ripped."
5.0,"Beautiful!!!!!! I have and wear multiple bracelets, and this is excellent as well"
5.0,They are a great value for the money.  I have lost too many diamonds and think I will just enjoy less expensive ones from now on and quit worrying about them.
5.0,Nice fit and as pictured. Decent quality for the price.
5.0,I got so many compliments and stars when I wore this.  It fits like a glove :-)
5.0,"This is a great tool bag, looks to be very good quality material."
5.0,My niece LOVES wearing dresses. It's not always the most practical attire especially in the winter. This dress is really cute and it's sized accurately. My sister liked that she can dress this up and down. She has had my niece put a pair of tights on for dressier occasions and has also put a pair of fleece lined leggings. The dress is priced well so she doesn't mind letting her wear it when playing dress up too.
5.0,I was looking for some reasonably priced warm socks for work.  These are really comfortable.  They have the look and feel of dress socks but they’re pretty cozy and keep my feet warm.  They’re actually comfortable too just for walking around the house.  I also like how they’re not super-tight around my lower calf.
5.0,Dress was wonderful and can be used for other events
5.0,My daughter was over-the-moon happy with this!!
5.0,"I searched and searched for a work/commuter bag that was a) real leather, b) had a sleeve for a laptop but wasn't bulky, c) could be zipped at the top, d) had several additional inside pockets, e) cute/trendy (or at least not ugly/clunky), and f) not crazy expensive (definitely &#60;$150, which is hard to get for real leather). This was a hard and long search, but this one meets all of those criteria! And I was skeptical about the rounded handles, but they are actually more comfortable than flat ones. Love this!"
5.0,"Loved the super fast shipping. Comes with tallit bag which is nice. Stitching beautiful. Really loved the bible verses on the corner. High quality, great price."
5.0,"My son plays youth travel hockey, this is perfect to help him carry his heavy gear bag many times per week.  Inexpensive and solves the problem.  Good item."
5.0,Looks like the photos I got two one pink one blue both size 3-4t one was wrong size though.
5.0,"There is not a back pocket, but 2 hardy side pockets. They are very comfy,  but look classy with the reflective ribs on the legs and zipper pulls fie the pockets."
5.0,cutep
5.0,I bought these to replace the worn out nose piece and sides as i have had my M frame glasses over 5 years now. This has to be the best $10 I have made in a long time. My glasses feel like new now and I'm truly thankful that Oakley still makes these replacement pieces. I will be a Oakley customer forever.<br /><br />Tip: to put on the ear piece i used a little bit of lotion and lubed up the inside the tube to help it slide onto the frame. Also make sure you look closely as one end is bigger than the other. The bigger end slides onto the frame first.
5.0,"I got this bracelet on sale for about $11 and it is well worth it so far. Super dainty and pretty, I like the design of it and how easy it is to put on myself. I like it well enough that I'm considering buying the rose gold version at the full price next."
5.0,"Well made, tough, water-proof and inexpensive. Keeps time accurately.  I wear while doing yard work, jogging."
5.0,Love them. They fit perfectly and are SO soft. Would purchase again.
5.0,nice-&  elegent
5.0,This swimsuit was a perfect fit for my 11 year old daughter! She loved it!
5.0,I like this dress. Flattering and comfortable. Wear it often in the summer.
5.0,"This 10 pack of 14 Gauge Belly Button Rings is the perfect set!<br />I have had my belly pierced now for well over 15 years and I have spent a lot of money on different rings. I always end up loosing the top ball or the entire belly ring because the top wouldn't screw on properly. These belly rings screw on and hold all day long!<br />One of the reasons I chose to buy this specific set is because of all the different color options. I can choose a color based on what I'm in the mood for or wearing that day. The different colors are black, red, purple, lime green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, pink, white, and a plain cubic zirconia diamond color.<br />I do wish this kit came with some sort of box or carry case but regardless I am very happy with my order! I recommend this product to all of the people with their belly pierced! Also makes the perfect gift!"
5.0,"These were given to my son as a Christmas gift.  He was happy to receive them, as he wears black socks for his job.  Just seeing how nicely packaged they come (rolled socks, in a nice box), he remarked on how nice they were!"
5.0,Arrived quickly and good product & size!

5.0,Good shirt for a die hard fan!  Comfy
5.0,nice gift for my daughter
5.0,I was skeptical because the price was so good. I am very happy with these sunglasses. They are lightweight and feel good. They came in a zippered case also which was a bonus.
5.0,"Wow!! I've been searching for a wedding dress for months. Second wedding, wicked small group. I'm a pear shape and wear a 34F. Basically, I don't wear dresses because they are just not flattering on me. As a last attempt, I ordered a bunch from Amazon after failing to find in any kind of store. Thankful for the pic reviews!!!  I'll be wearing this with a crown of flowers on my head as I'm a boho kind of person. It's so stretchy and comfy!!"
5.0,Wish I could get more.  Friends want to take my finger!!!
5.0,I love this dress/shirt. It’s so versatile that I can wear it casual or to work. It’s soooooo comfortable that it can be worn for a nightshirt.

5.0,Good quality. Good price.  Will order again.
5.0,"I have this in Black, and purchased the evergreen; It is still the best hat ever. It is lightweight, it folds down into pocket size, it dries quickly when wet, looks great and fits well."
5.0,As advertised. Very satisfied.
5.0,"Yes, it’s expensive. Especially since you might only wear it for a week or two. But for the first week after shoulder surgery and going to PT, it made life a thousand times easier. It’s also unisex so if either my husband or myself face surgery again, it will fit us both."
5.0,This came in quick time - my husband loves it!
5.0,"The dress fits great. Lovely pockets. it is a bit see thru up to light, but not noticeable when on."
5.0,Love the color and the length of the shirt
5.0,"My granddaughter, who is into Harry Potter, loved it."
5.0,Fits really nice n very comfy
5.0,"I love this ring, it has a unique style! It's so cute. I purchased this extact ring from another seller unfortunately it must have gotten lost, I was disappointed but I was glad I found it again through Fantasy Forge. I believe the metal is Stainless steel, I hope it doesn't turn."
5.0,Love these! They're gorgeous and I get tons of compliments when I wear them.
5.0,"The earrings arrived early, they look great, and I plan to wear them often! Cheers"

5.0,true to size great quality
5.0,so warm!!!
5.0,"Love the fit, and tons of compliments on this colorful and tropical looking dress.  It's got the Hollywood glamour pinup silhouette, and is very flattering in all the right places.  This one will definitely require a petticoat to sit properly, namely when you walk, as it tends to ruck up awkwardly."
5.0,Very sturdy and pretty piece! Love!
5.0,Like these socks!
5.0,"I use this bag to carry our swimming towels and other items in. This is a great bag that can carry our towels, snacks, and hold our personal items without being too bulky. We have a beach bag that is larger but we don't want to carry it when we only are needing a few smaller things to transport. Love the monogram letter we can have makes a nice touch. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Robust. High Quality. Would Make A Great Gift
5.0,This fit my 17lb 9 month old perfectly
5.0,This glasses are so cute.

5.0,Fits my wide face comfortably and I always get compliments on them!
5.0,I like all cotton tee.
5.0,So the outfit is adorable and of really great quality but my body type said no!. Im sure if everything is where its suppossed to be and i wasnt old i would love the way it looked. And you might too. but it leaves a lot to be desired in the support department. 5 stars because my lack of self esteem is not the products fault .

5.0,"itsscosy OL Luxury Fashion Tote Top Handle Cross Body Shoulder Satchel Purse Handbag for Women 6 Piece Set Bags is a very nice set. The set includes 2 handbags 1 cross-body, a wallet, a key holder and what I call a wristlet.  The bag has a nice fabric lining.  The set comes with a removable shoulder strap.  The bags have bright gold-tone hardware accents.  The bags are made out of a high quality canvas, and is easy to clean.  The bags have hardware on the bottom to keep the bag off the ground.  These are great for everyday use or a night out on the town.  I received a discount to purchase the bags in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
5.0,"I have always loved ear cuffs. I am the only one at my university to wear them and believe it or not I am the oldest lady there, so this type makes me feel special, I will be ordering another set soon!"
5.0,"I have bought many thermals at stores and have had to take them back. The TESLA's were a perfect fit, very comfortable and kept me warm on my early morning runs and rides. I would certainly recommend the product. Looking forward to purchasing a few more. Product arrived on time and intact.<br />Thanks."
5.0,Wow It came so fast. I love the seller. Highly recommended. And love the dress it just perfect! Keep it up guys! 👍
5.0,"I actually borrowed this dress from a friend for a recent trip to Mexico and loved it so much that I came home and bought one for myself! I love the fit of this dress. It's roomy and flowy yet flattering. I particularly like that the fabric doesn't cling and that it's super breathable and light. I wore it again and again on my Mexico vacation and felt super cute. I'm 5' 9"" and my measurements are 42/35/42 and the XL fit just right. I have a large bust (36DDD) and I wore a black sports bra under it and it actually looked like it was supposed to be there. I wish they had it in solid colors in the polyester fabric (instead of the rayon/spandex) because I'd buy it in every color."
5.0,All I can say is WOW! The quality of the leather is really really good. I also like all the zippered compartments inside. It looks much more expensive than it is.  It's a bit bigger than I expected but that doesn't bother me. The wine color is gorgeous. Definitely a good buy.
5.0,Good quality for price for kids
5.0,Nice wallet.  I bought it as a gift for my son and he was very happy. It's truly a good product.
5.0,These house shoes are super comfy and very warm.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted and on time
5.0,"Love them!  Cute, cute, cute!<br /><br />I have 5 pairs of the Capelli thongs.  I even bought 2 pairs of a white thongs because I am going on vacation in the fall and want to be sure I have a new pair to take with me."
5.0,"I was looking for a replacement band for my Timex watch, this fit the bill."
5.0,My son is tall and slim. He loves these pants. I get him a new set of these every time he outgrows them. He’s up to size 18 now.
5.0,It was the perfect gift for the marathon runner
5.0,Perfect gift. For the person that loves StarWars a watch band is great
5.0,Larger than I imagined. Cuter than expected. Exceeded all expectations<br />Brilliant!<br />Perfect for Date Night to Chinese restaurant 🤗
5.0,"I love the color (I have the red) and it's thin, soft, and comfortable. Looks great after washing. My only small complaint is that there is a seam down the back and I wish it wasn't there. However, it's shown in the image on Amazon, so not false advertising."
5.0,These have so much more grip than toesox. I could actually feel the grip on the megareformer and it gave me confidence!!!!  I want to order another pair but I don’t need multiple pairs and you can only buy single in black. Do yourself a favor and buy at least 2 pair.
5.0,"Perfect fit, super comfy. Super fast shipping!"
5.0,Bought for my mail lady for Christmas.
5.0,Super cute earrings. You can let them drop down however you choose .. lots of compliments on them.

5.0,Love it! Perfect dress for work.
5.0,"I wore this swimsuit to Vegas and other places. It always is one of a kind and I always get at least one compliment on it! It's so classy and retro, I love the fit and would buy it again-no regrets!"

5.0,Little too large but my son love his rainbow shoes so much he wears them all the time.
5.0,Great gift for my mom who loves her doggies. This apron is good quality and has stood the test of time and a crazy busy kitchen.
5.0,Great looking hat 🧢!
5.0,I love this cute unicorn purse! The colors are amazing i can fit my phone and a small wallet.
5.0,Wish I had bought these years ago. Far less expensive than what they would cost in a store. Fit nicely!
5.0,Wore this to a wedding and it fits and looks great! I’m 5’4” size 6 and bought a medium
5.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for. I don't love the way I look in shorts, so often wear capris in spring/summer months. The dark denim color is perfect. I can dress it up, dress it down. They fit as expected and have a little stretch in the fabric. Not too much though. I've been wearing these all day and they're not &#34;stretched out&#34; like some pants get. They were tagged as &#34;push up&#34; capris and I suppose that's true. Butt looks good lol. They're comfortable and have a nice cuffed bottom. I may be ordering the other colors soon! Price was average!"
5.0,"I have a 23"" head and ordered the XL which fit exactly.  I sized up as it sounded like these hats run small.  Very well made hat - very pleased with quality"
5.0,did the job
5.0,"look and works great and is durable ,no issues , I wear it as an everyday strap and at the gym."
5.0,These are very handy if you have difficulties with dexterity!
5.0,"best sports bra ever !!! comfortable, great support, & cleavage!"
5.0,Very nice.  Ordering two more.
5.0,fit well and give support
5.0,"These are simple but genius. When I buy shoes for my kids I am strictly looking for shoes that will last all year (and be handed down to the younger sibling) and won't be too hard to get on small feet.  I've found some good shoes but the laces get shredded/cut/nasty every year, this solves so many problems for me as a mom. I am stoked about it. Quicker to get on, no tying, shoes stay on their feet better and they don't tie their laces and cut them off or let them hang and get dirty and shredded. My only regret is that I didn't have these when my older kids were younger. Word to the wise: size up if you are lacing high tops and want them to reach the top loops, not a biggie if they don't (we usually stop a couple loops down anyway) but just so you know!"
5.0,"The strap broke within a few weeks of use... I sewed it... So it's back to working.  Other then that... It's been my favorite vegan purse so far... My sister got one, an I'm confused.  Her purse had a silver metal PIXIE MOOD logo... Mine was written in what looks like... White paint? Her inside is shiny leather looking? Mine is like suede? Other then that it's supposed to be the SAME EXACT PURSE?"
5.0,"These flat sandals go great with gold casual textured pant I have. They are just a little darker than the plants, so let the pants be what’s most seen."
5.0,This is a superior shemag. Larger than the other ones I bought and of a heavier material. The fancy tassels are a nice touch. I would buy this product again.
5.0,Quality is superb.
5.0,Exactly as described! Super fast shipping Highly recommended seller thank you.
5.0,Love it and so does my son!
5.0,Arrived super early<br />Beautiful product Item
5.0,This bag is great. Not too heavy. It has usable pockets inside and out. Easy to carry. Just awesome. Hats off to the designer.
5.0,I loved it I got it three weeks late but well worth the wait
5.0,These goggle are simply the best in my honest opinion.  From the quality lenses and easy adjustable strap to the ear plugs attached to the head strap in case they fell out of your ear. I have bought several different styles of goggles for the family this summer.  These are the clear favorite at my home.<br />Note:  this review was given in return for a discounted price.  Review is in my honest opinion.
5.0,Have not use on an actual firetop but when I was going through it everything was portable and fits within itself so I like how much space saver you have putting in a hiking bag
5.0,Very we made. Can't wait to use it for next Christmas. Would recommend purchasing from this vendor
5.0,good quality. arrived timely. daughter loved.
5.0,Outfit is classy. It hid my huge belly!!! The fabric was so soft and comfy. Just plain so accessories is a must! I wear a 10 and got a Medium! Perfect fit! There is still room for food!
5.0,"Great piece, simple yet pretty."
5.0,What can you say it's a sticker for Ron Frickin Swanson and he approves the sticker. Slapped this puppy onto my Cordova Cooler to add some flair. Once the sticker was applied the coolness and manliness of my cooler increased by 1000%. Not many other stickers have that capability.
5.0,Muy suave talla exacta buen producto
5.0,This is a very cute dress. Fits as described in the size chart. Nice fabric...kind of a lightweight satin. Has a little sheen and is soft & comfy.
5.0,These are so perfect for my 2 year old! She has been asking for purple glasses but her script is too high to be able to get cute frames from online retailers. They took a little longer to get here but she LOVES them and wants to sleep in them. With stay puts and the strap I don't worry about her wearing these because she gets mad when you have to take them to clean them or to take a nap! Not to talk bad about Miraflex but these are SOOOO much lighter in weight than they are and she doesn't want to wear her other glasses anymore! She also wears Ortopad under it with no issues either.
5.0,Every one asks about this because the switch is on the outside and it glo<br />I like everything about this coat
5.0,It's super cute and sits nicely on my chest. I'll definitely want to pick up the others at some point. ♥
5.0,We have to carry clear bags where I work because of high rend merchandise and I hate it. But… this bag has proven to be highly durable. I am shocked really because it wasn’t very expensive at all.
5.0,"good, comfortable option that offers padding so that you can wear it for a regular, everyday bra."
5.0,It fits good. I have big thighs and I was afraid it would be too tight but it wasn’t. Nice comfy material.
5.0,"Bought for a granddaughter's birthday. She loves it! It's so cute, fits perfect and is lightweight and great for their desert weather."
5.0,Loved it and fits Pandora with no problem
5.0,"This is my 2nd pair of Sungait glasses and I love them. I’ve always bought less expensive sunglasses and until I tried on a friend’s RayBans I didn’t realize how much nicer the lenses were on his fancy glasses. The clarity difference was amazing. Now enter these Sungait glasses and, boom, I tried them on and they immediately reminded me of those RayBans. I’m amazed at how clear these are! The frames are sturdy and feel substantial like they can take some abuse and be just fine.  They come we’ll protected in the package with a eyeglass tool and a cleaning towel that doubles as a case.

5.0,"If you Google Mrs. Claus &#34;wig&#34;, you will find several choices -- I have at least MOST, if not all of those choices -- however, this WIG here is my most favorite wig for my Mrs. Claus gigs at Christmastime -- it is really well made, fits nicely, and looks great -- lots of compliments on this wig.  I own two of them now since my first one is getting some wear and tear on it from several years of useage.  I think you'll like this wig for your Mrs. Claus outfits."
5.0,Good material . Worth the money
5.0,They did the job perfectly.  I would buy again.
5.0,"My headline says it all, I have purchased these sweat pants several times before and I can recommend them to others looking for quick, easy, casual, comfortable sweats with pockets for your stuff."

5.0,My husband was so happy to get this jersey! Quality is excellent for the price. Highly suggest this purchase.
5.0,"The mask are comfortable,  and heavy breathing when exercising is still possible. The  quality was still in tact after washing."
5.0,"This is the Goldilocks Protrek for me and I've had three now.<br /><br />1. The PAG240-1 is an amazing watch for the money. Only downsides are that you can't really dress it up at all due to the yellow buttons and it doesn't have atomic time keeping. But if those aren't issues for you get the PAG240-1.<br /><br />2. The PRW2500R, I was not impressed with. I found it to be very uncomfortable on my wrist versus the PAG240-1 and I also found the Moon and tide feature to be gimmicky since I don't live near the coast and don't fish. The moon phase feature was always off by a couple days and could not be adjusted!! Wasn't really a fan of this watch but it did look great.<br /><br />3. Now this PRW3500 is the Protrek for me! It has all the features I love about the PAG240-1 and none of the features I hate about the PRW2500R. It's a PAG240-1 with newer sensors, classier looks and atomic time keeping. I can live without the duplex screen as much as I like that. I also find this PRW3500 isn't as uncomfortable on my wrist as the PRW2500R for whatever reason. I think I'm going to love this watch. Real clean look that Clcan easily be worn to the gym, at work or out hiking. I dig this watch a lot so far!!"
5.0,"This band looks pretty cool, and it looks more expensive than it is. The design and color options will make any watch stand out."
5.0,Great baseball cap bought it for my grandson. He loves it.
5.0,I love my kitty shoes! They’re so fun!! The shoes fit a little snug so if you like more room I’d go a size up but I’m happy with how they fit me!
5.0,Great pair of sunglasses and a reasonable price.
5.0,Awesome ring set! Love it!
5.0,"Love this wallet, I get many compliments!"
5.0,product was as expected - true to size - comfortable fit
5.0,"This is the 2nd scarf I have purchased here. The scarves are SO soft, very warm and are a good quality item. I am still surprised at the price as you'd expect to pay more for something this nice. The 2nd scarf I purchased is red and the color is just as bright and vibrant as it appears in the photo. I feel sure I'll be buying more colors as this is a great accessory!!"
5.0,I love this swimsuit. It's very flattering on me.
5.0,"The material is good, no fat rolls show.  I normally wear spanx with all dresses, this one I didnt have to. I am going to buy all colors because it's so practical. You can dress it up or down with tennis."
5.0,Love them! And I also received a little surprise with them! Very happy with this purchase!!
5.0,We made &#34;gummi bears&#34; in them. Works great. Easy to get them out - even for kids. And the end product looks really professional and really like lego.
5.0,"EXACTLY what I was looking for!! I now regret not spending the money to have my initials done in the 14k gold. I did A LOT of shopping around for this item and did comparisons with about 8 - 10 stores, both on line and name brand. None of them came close to the XXL size and look. I bought the 20&#34; chain which is the perfect length even with the over-sized lettering. I have not gotten to wear my necklace yet - because it was kind of an early Christmas gift - but I can't wait. It is solid quality and comes with a REALLY NICE velvety bag to keep it in...was not expecting that. ALL of the great reviews this item received were not wrong. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this item!!!"
5.0,"love it, just what i wanted thank you"
5.0,Bought this for a dear friend and she loved it!
5.0,"I have horses and these are great gloves for working outside in sub-zero weather.  The nubby palm is a must, and the wool is flexible without being too bulky."
5.0,Very cute. Bright bold colors.
5.0,"Bathrobe quantity is fantastic, like all Miss Elaine robes.  However, if you have a larger chest, this may run small.  Have been purchasing Miss Elaine bathrobes for 30+ years, have always purchased XL, even double checked sizing online, XL should have been correct, of course too small was ready to use it.  :)  Going two sizes bigger because I don't want to have to return, better too big than too small.  Will update review when new one arrives.  Could just be a fluke."
5.0,My son loves wearing these for football
5.0,"It’s very cute, loved it<br />It really snatches your body!<br />But the material makes you hotttttt<br />I was sweatyyyyy lol"
5.0,Planning a beach get-away and want to take a small suitcase.  Think this skirt will fill many purposes. Love the color and the fit!
5.0,"At first glance I wasn't impressed, but the more I studied it, it is a pretty nice looking watch.  It has a small surround but the Crystal  makes it look like it's a 50 mm watch. When I put it on it was actually comfortable and looks like at $350 watch. Even if it lasted A month it would be worth the price, but it's been ticking on for several months now. I don't worry about damaging it or losing it because I'll just buy another one. I highly recommend this watch as a gift or a second watch. Even if it didn't have a  fantastic warranty I would recommend it. Time will tell!"
5.0,"Nice looking and great value, I cannot comment about quality because I just received the belt. I would recommend with no hesitation."
5.0,"Exceeded my expectations! It was a little long and I didn't want the train, but the fit was accurate to the chart and the beading was gorgeous."
5.0,Nice design & good  quality
5.0,"I just received mine today, and it's great. Like other reviewers have said, it definitely runs large. I ordered a S/M (Small/Medium) size and it fits the same as a L (Large) size that I purchased at a store. So be aware of that. Unless you have a larger head size, it might be wiser to go with the S/M as oppose to the L/XL. The quality is pretty good. What I received looks pretty much exactly like what's in the photo. Same color, same bow on the side, same feather, same socks. The socks were a nice addition, because I really only ordered it for the hat. Came in a large box, which a protective Styrofoam circle around the colorful material part of the hat.<br /><br />It is pretty good quality. Is it a top quality luxury hat? Probably not. However, it certainly isn't a bad quality hat either. It's average quality, and that's what you should expect for the price, especially when you factor in the embellishments on the hat like the material and the feather. I've typically paid the same amount for plain straw pork-pies So, for this hat to have those added stylish embellishments, and still be the same price as a plain straw hat, is excellent. As long as you keep it safe, it should last a very long time. It seems to be of a quality that it will last a long time.<br /><br />The feather is removable, which is cool. You can decide if you want that traditional/old-school look that the feather provides, or the more modernized featherless pork pie look.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I've added a photo of the products I received (the hat and the socks). I removed the extra protective stuff (there were large plastic bubble protecting wraps and a Styrofoam wrap around the hat)."
5.0,I love them ! So happy with my purchase
5.0,Socks to small
5.0,tuff and looks great.. roomy inside would recomend it
5.0,After reading the reviews I got a large and an X Large.  I am 5'0' and 105#.  The X Large is a little too big but I will wash it in hot water.  The length was good and the quality is surprisingly good as well.  But please not I did buy up quite a size ..I am typically a XS or S
5.0,Stylish and functional
5.0,Mink oil delivered on day promised. The tin contains white cream which is easily applied and seemingly seeped into the leather surface of the shoe. I did darken the shoes slightly but this was expected.
5.0,"Lightweight material, product works as designed,  cute design."
5.0,Surprisingly they were bigger than I expected and very pretty!
5.0,"The shorts are just pictured, they are just much bigger than expected."

5.0,Didn't notice that it was 2. So really great price for a really great product
5.0,I have been waiting for this watch for a long long time that when I saw it was for sale again I didn't hesitate in buy in it. The watch is a very nice watch all black everything on the watch is black. Is the multi band solar power so is a good watch. Is light on the wrist but looks aggressive. I love this watch and I recommend you to buy it.
5.0,"Little tight on the top but I'm a DDD so undid a button, added a cami & good to go.  Love all the compliments!"
5.0,The person for whom this vest was purchased is delighted with it in all aspects.

5.0,Product is high quality and is  as pictured. Shipping was fast and this seller is fantastic. I will do business with Amorwing again.
5.0,"I think this wallet is great! My old one was literally falling apart and had worn down to the bone. I went thru a few different wallet options and decided on this one because of it's simplicity. The material it's made of is firm and flexible, so I wouldn't worry about it scratching up too quickly. Everything fits into it pretty snug, and it's not very bulky so it slides into my pocket easily. Very satisfied with this item, and would definitely purchase again in other options!"
5.0,Absolutely love this piece. Can't wait to give it to my friend for Christmas. It is sturdy and simple. Very nice!!!!
5.0,Great belts.  Very easy to size.
5.0,Work out perfectly.

5.0,my daughter loves
5.0,Wore for work as a bartender. Got compliments. Def in my work outfit rotation
5.0,muy buena calidad.
5.0,I gave gotten so many great comments from my friends!
5.0,Daughter wears a size 4 and these fit perfectly. Also has room to grow since it's stretchy. Good purchase!
5.0,Very Beautiful! Exactly like the picture. I would recommend this charm.
5.0,"These are perfect neck pillows, and the hoodie part adds a nice touch. After getting one for myself, I ordered one for my entire family -- and then for my parents. When my mom brought hers with her into the hospital to aid her recovery, all the nurses freaked out and wanted to know how to get one, too.<br /><br />The memory foam hugs my neck nicely -- and the hoodie can be used to block out light and a little sound. Couple this with in-ear-monitors, and you have your own world on a plane, train -- or in a hospital bed."
5.0,Very well made wallet. Made of leather and excited that it has a coin holder in it also. Can’t wait to give it to my son on his birthday
5.0,Loved the color and the fit was so comfortable.  Fabric was of a high quality.  Wou0d buy from here again.
5.0,Love the quality and they look clean.
5.0,Very nicely made . Fits true to size
5.0,"Perfect fit.Nice looking and the plastic is very sturdy.I have other clear plastic rain jackets and this one ranks at the top.I ordered another clear rain jacket in XL to wear over bulky top wear.<br /><br />Don't Buy this Raincoat,They charge $12.95 shipping for a $4.06 purchase price.I purchased three of these with free shipping a while ago.I won't buy another.THIS COMPANY IS A RIP-OFF!!"
5.0,I've washed this a few times and it's still holding up nicely. Comfortable and cute!
5.0,"I love this so much! It is the perfect way to show love for Final Fantasy. It is very well made, and arrived very well packaged, they obviously cared and didn't want it to get ruined in the mail. I am very pleased with this product! I'd definitely order from them again."
5.0,lovely scarf.  Light weight
5.0,Love it. Doesn't turn your neck green! Very good quality!
5.0,Air force pride
5.0,"Beautiful set! The chain & earrings are thick & sturdy, not cheap looking."
5.0,"I wasn't worried based on all the great reviews and I can confirm that it's a very well put together piece and for less than a cheap, chintzy looking one at Target, I am definitely satisfied. I'll be ordering one in brown and one in pink for my niece, this week!"
5.0,Pretty necklace. Very dainty. My boyfriend loved it.
5.0,"Easy to wear smooth, very soft and great quality. Looks nice with heels as well as a pair of sneakers."
5.0,"I'm not a big fashion geek, and I don't do a lot of patterns or prints with ties or shirts. 26 pocket squares is more than I really need, but this gives you so many options to coordinate with ties and shirts. Plus, you can give a few away and now fret over the cost. They seem to be made nicely, though they won't take a lot of abuse (get handkerchiefs for that)."
5.0,"Soft and cozy! I got a ton on compliments on this sweater... not too hot, not itchy, and has a great interesting pattern with stylish baggy fit. I will be getting another color!<br />I’m 5’5, 152 lbs and got a medium"
5.0,Love this item. Got it as a gift for my friend because she hates carrying big bags for just her phone and keys
5.0,Great dress just slightly too big
5.0,"These are great.  Though thinner than expected, I have no problem using these in 20 degree F weather.  I work outdoors so I need some hot hands out there.  My stitching is already unraveling and I use the gloves for light duty...  What's up with that????"
5.0,I have a girlie girl. She wears fluffy dresses everyday. She loves the dresses and so do I. Sized a little small but arms are long?????
5.0,"I'm happy with these bottoms for color and style, but maybe I should have ordered a 10.  I went for the 12 because I was afraid of the leg holes being tight and causing that unflattering cut in effect on my thighs.  (5'4&#34; 135lbs for reference)  These are a tad big.  No so much an issue while dry, but might be a bit loose when wet or as they age.  We'll see.  I probably won't worry about returning though"
5.0,The never ending search for a comfortable everyday bra that also looks good under a tee shirt and even a tank top might be over.  It was odd when I first put it on I kept expecting it to hurt or rub in the usual places.  It's kind of like wearing a second skin - comfortably.  This is the third one I've bought after getting my first one a month ago. I've worn with and without the pads and like it both ways. Highly recommend.
5.0,These are adorable! Good value for the price.
5.0,Just received mine! I love it ! I'm 4'9 125 lbs 36D I ordered a small ..it's a little long on me but that's fine. Love it can't wait to wear it this summer !
5.0,I have purchased these in large and in medium. Usually I wear A 34 waist. The medium fit nicely for sports because they keep everyone in place. The large are great for normal wear for that commando feeling. These are the most comfortable underwear I have owned ever in my 72 years. Never binding never a ride up.
5.0,Love this shirt extender. It is perfect
5.0,"perfect minimalistic wallet, pretty good handling, thumbs up ;-)"
5.0,I'm love this top
5.0,"I wore them for the first time last night. I love them, but my toes are truly little piggies :)  There is a little pinching at times, but the work beautifully.  I believe they will stretch a little with wear.  I noticed during belly dance last night that my toes/feet did not cramp when placing my feet in certain ways as they had previously.  I'm sure I'll buy another pair."
5.0,Durable & soft
5.0,Love this dress! So versatile! I want it in every color!
5.0,Nice and tight hurt the ears but they work good
5.0,"Great strap, the material seems like it is going to hold up for a long time."
5.0,These work great.  Much better than the spring clip collars.
5.0,This beaded watch band gave my IPhone Watch Life!  It look so Stylish and Beautiful.  I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly.  I’m definitely purchasing other colors ❤️
5.0,"This is a beautiful purse but because of an oversight made by Amazon, who packages and ships this company's products, I inadvertently received a used purse. Even though Envie Designs was not responsible, they graciously sent me a beautiful replacement purse. This company goes the extra mile to ensure satisfied customers. I will buy from them in the future."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:75e1b40293f8aa82c396e5600498be45]] I saw this top originally on TikTok and thought to myself. I have to have it. I ordered it being skeptical but optimistic. When I received it and tried it on I was in heaven. I received soooo many compliments. I will be purchasing a few more colors soon
5.0,"Lo utilicé para ir a una fiesta.y me agrado todo, nada me desagrado.Todo perfecto."
5.0,"Shirt came super fast! Is in great condition, no loose strings , great quality- is true to size. I got a size up because i was still worried it would be too small but I def coulda got my normal size."
5.0,"Quality watch band, looks just like it came from the manufacture with the watch but for half the price. Im tough on my watch and the band in the field and it takes the abuse with no problems. Highly recommend."
5.0,Just what I wanted - tortise shell and gold.  Love them.
5.0,Great material. Not see thru. Fast shipping. Great buy
5.0,"Love this bag!  It's larger than expected and the orange color is absolutely beautiful.  I needed a small wristlet for vacation and this is exactly what I needed.  I can fit my phone, keys, lip gloss, credit cards and more."
5.0,Good quality.  Use them while singing in my church choir.  I can read the music and see the director without having to tilt them down.  Just right.
5.0,"It's very nice, especially for a Dj, it was a Gift well liked !"
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister.  Received it and she loved it.  It was just the right size and the picture is accurate.
5.0,Me encantan muy buena calidad
5.0,"This review is for the black joggers.<br />I'm very happy that I purchased these joggers, they were much less expensive then the alternatives that I had been eyeing but they still seem to be well made with decent materials.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I really like the fabric. It is heavy enough to feel durable, while light enough to not be overly warm.<br />2. The leg cuff is nice and tight, at least when new, and sit flat on your leg. The cuffs on many joggers that I have tried on are either too loose, short, or bunchy. I really like how these look.<br />3. They have the crotch gusset thing. Joggers without this look really terrible in my opinion.<br />4. The crotch is about the perfect height in my opinion. Some joggers have huge drop crotches which look pretty silly, but I still like enough room to feel comfortable and have full mobility.<br />5. The price is right.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I wish the waist wasn't as bunchy looking.<br />2. I'm not sure how I feel about the style of the drawstring. It feels a little cheap, and it's kind of bulky. Not really sure what I would prefer though.<br /><br />Male, 5'11&#34;, athletic 185lbs, 32 waist, big ass, 33 inch inseam. The size large fits me perfectly"
5.0,"Nice colors and fit, it is a keeper.  Should be cool in hot weather."
5.0,great item easy to remove and install
5.0,LOOOOOOOOVE this necklace. I get lots of compliments on it. It's super long and goes with a lot of stuff.
5.0,Makes it easier to  find the ends for tying it on my head.  Very warm when pulled down around my neck.  You need this.
5.0,"Ideal for me, good price, fast delivery."
5.0,It is very supportive of my flat feet
5.0,Excellent product. Allows me to effortlessly haul in from garage to fireplace several heavy energy logs at a time.
5.0,I love this watch. It has style and its quality is awesome. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Cute. As described. Thanks.
5.0,We used these to feed and water the chickens in the winter time.  Kept out hands warm and dry.
5.0,"Very well made and high quality shoes. It's made of real leather, not PU. If you are anything like me, I prefer the real thing. Super soft and flexible. Extra cushion on the back of upper heel for support. Love the distressed leather and prominent stiching look. Even the light colored sole of the shoes is easy on the eye. Light weight. Round toes for extra comfort. Your little ones will look like a model strutting his style down the cat-walk hahaha. First purchase of the Primigi brand and I definately will purchase more of this brand in the future. Kinna of pricey but very affordable if you wait for it to go on sale."
5.0,"This jacket is warm and thick. It didnt fall apart on me at all, and I doubt it will. I bought the one with zipper pockets. Hands fit great. It’s well-made. I’m happy"
5.0,I love my bracelet . Just need to close the clasp better
5.0,"Love this belt, a year and a half later and I am still rocking it. I use almost everyday. I am considering purchasing a couple more."

5.0,Vibrant color! Crystal clear! Big size!
5.0,"It was purchased for my 9 year old's birthday and it fit her perfectly, but it was advertised for an adult."
5.0,"I really like the fit and the fabric of the shirt! It is a relaxed fit! And the material is light, not heavy! The original selling point was the message and it is perfect! It is printed very well on the shirt! Like that it’s two shades (white & pink)"
5.0,True to size. My grandson loved it
5.0,Makes my Alta a nice piece of jewelry
5.0,Good for working on your feet.  For sport I would recommend something with more compression (the light compression is perfect for work).
5.0,"my niece loved these boots, she is 4 and wore them all the time"
5.0,I am one of those people who can not tolerate those traditional masks for more than a few minutes.  This one allows me to breath and communicate expressions.  Awesome!!!
5.0,It was cute and I liked it but it was extremely short so I had to wear jeans under it
5.0,I'm sure he'll love it
5.0,Love it. So far so good. It hasn't damaged even when I wash my hands. Truly nice.
5.0,"Wife is 4""8 115 fit her great"

5.0,Cozy and soft with adequate arch support.
5.0,"I love these pants, good quality material, thicker than expected. I’m 5’4 140 lbs 30” waist & I get xl in juniors sizing...  I get compliments when I wear them how cute they are... I have 4 different colors, love this brand !!!"

5.0,"Pictures don’t do justice for the detail in this in this tee shirt design, and the shirt itself is very comfortable."
5.0,Came faster than expected! They are a little smaller than I thought but I quickly got used to them and fell in love. I use them for my septum piercing and they look amazing. TY!
5.0,"This little guy is so adorable. He has gold where the eye is so I will put nail polish there, but he is so cute. He will go everywhere with me and my spring jackets and hats. Just love him."
5.0,Cool comfortable and cute.
5.0,Snug in the armpit area but other than that it's an awesome jacket for my beetlejuice cosplay
5.0,Nice and soft not too thick
5.0,Super cute and fun socks! I love wearing fun socks. And the snowman ones are especially cute and have a different fuzzy top than the other two. I love all of them.
5.0,"I love the look of it, it's 99% the same as the one that comes with it. Makes me feel like I have a new watch.<br />Update-6 weeks later the pattern is worn off on the edges and isn't staying on as well.  It's not as vibrant as it was.  I think it would do better if you just matched it for certain outfits not for everyday."
5.0,I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. Very comfortable. I did remove the padding though because they don't stay in place.
5.0,this is very nice looking my Grand daughter loved it
5.0,Good looking sweats.  Needed to be a little bigger in the crotch.  Works great for hanging around the house.
5.0,"Really are wonderful sunglasses so far, just got them yesterday. Love the soft holder for them, and the two special protective cases. Put them on as soon as I opened the box, as the sun is very bright here in Colorado. They are perfectly lovely for driving.  The only suggestion I have is to make the beautiful frames with other colors than black. Thank you!"
5.0,Fit as expected. Very flowy and comfortable. I recieved many compliments when I wore these on vacation.
5.0,I got this pair of gloves for snow plowing because my hands get really cold during winter. It's warming feature won me over.it gest warm very quickly. It makes it very comfortable to do activities in winter tolerable. It's waterproof and very thick. It also has a 1yr guarantee.  Really happy about it.
5.0,The ring is great. You have to order one full size up. Stainless steel doesn't have the same type of give as silver. My daughter loves her ring.
5.0,Love the flow of the dress
5.0,Way cool glasses for the price!
5.0,"Getting a little older but still love skiing.  Wanted polarized goggles because it helps me see the slope better, and chose these because they were the least expensive with that feature.  My son has Oakleys and to me, these are along those lines at half the cost."
5.0,"Amazing quality for the price. Quality lens and sturdy, comfortable frame with spring hinges and nose pads. No complaints whatsoever. I've bought several pairs of glasses in different strengths and frames from this vendor and all have exceeded my expectations."

5.0,Really awesome bra! Especially for the price. Fits great!! Yayyy for no back fat! I’ll definitely be buying more colors. For reference I’m a 34D and got a size Med.
5.0,"Just like the old days! Perfect for my 4 year old that has friends with real earrings, but isn't quite ready for hers. They stay on all day, as long as a stray hair isn't under them when she puts them on. They've even stayed on through a few swims! If they get stuck on anything I've never had an issue with residue or marks."
5.0,"It fits my daughter great. She loves wearing it to her dance class. I got it at a good price, wish I had bought another before the price went up."
5.0,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters, since she loves anything Disney.  Well, she loves the Minnie Mouse pajamas!!  And they fit her perfectly."

5.0,"Just received it today. I tried it on and it was very comfortable. It fit just right(I'm 5'2 and 215lbs.). I ordered a XXL. I like the design and the feel of the material. I will write an update after I wash it, as to whether it shrinks or not and the durability."
5.0,"it was a test and it met the purchase...well made, attention to detail."
5.0,Bathing suit is very cute but does run small. Order a size up ladies. Other then that is it perfect!!!
5.0,Color and design are nice!
5.0,Great bowtie
5.0,I like different things..I don't like the normal things all the time..I saw this bag and had to have it..Its small but it still worked for what I needed it for.

5.0,Fits perfectly. I got the XL I'm 5'1 190. You'll love it
5.0,"Nice size, has enough room for all my stuff. Looks like real leather. Well made and I love that I can either have the long shoulder strap on just the handles. Just a really cute purse/satchel."
5.0,Awesome watch for the price! Has so many features. It's deffintly one of my favorites.
5.0,Awesome fit just needed to order 2 sizes up...love these
5.0,"The material of the robe is alittle thin, but its very soft, and its a great deal with the added headband. Perfect size for a young girl between 7 and 12 ."
5.0,Nice top - breathable material so it is slightly see through. Bright colors look great!
5.0,This is great for keeping your mask off of your mouth and makes it easier to breathe.
5.0,"I am 5ft.3, 130lbs, bra cup C.  I usually wear a Tshirt size Medium because I don't want the tightness around my chest.  The medium was way too large and they are out of the small now..I'm keeping the medium and will wear layers underneath...feels like silk!"
5.0,"Great dress for The price, makes a really nice evening or casual outfit. It is somewhat see through, but not as much."
5.0,I just received this suit today and I am in total love!!! I had ordered 2 others but they just didn't provide the support I needed!! I am 5'2 and 160lbs. I am a 38 D. This suit gives me all the support I need on top while covering all the trouble areas I want to hide!!! The underwire is a huge plus for us big busted ladies and I couldn't be more happy with this purchase!!!
5.0,Love this suit - this is my third.  They last a few years and fit great.
5.0,Order this for my younger son. He love's  it works like it should and still working great  after a lot of use.

5.0,Got these for my wife&#62; she really loves them. Says they are the softest socks ever.
5.0,overall look
5.0,This mask is well made and gorgeous! I love the touch of bling with my initial. I recommend this mask.
5.0,Way more comfortable than the strap the fitbit comes with
5.0,"Um...  they're bandanas. Nothing special. There's not,much to tell or review."
5.0,"This bracelet is lovely! It feels sturdy and sparkles. It feels and looks like a much higher end product than the current price of $22.99. The design is absolutely beautiful, and looks even better than the pictures. This would make a lovely gift. I recommend this bracelet!"
5.0,The fit is vey good and I was surprised that the fabric isn’t flimsy at all and very soft.
5.0,"Bought this on a total whim and I love it. It's super flattering! I haven't washed it yet, but it did travel well and needed just a touch-up by iron after a flight on a suitcase."
5.0,These shirts fit great. Wish they came in brighter colors.
5.0,"My wife likes this JULYCLO Women's Casual V Neck Shirts Side Drawstring tunic but she's not sold on the color in the description.  It is true to size, soft and stretchy. Very sheer, so layering is probably your best option. She got the one called ""apricot"" color but says it's more of a bluish pink. (I would have said dirty pink.) Anyway, I'm sure she's got something to wear this with."
5.0,This is the best purchase I've made this year!  No kidding... They keep my legs warm and therefore pain free. I love them!
5.0,"As noted I received the original bag without a shoulder strap, the same day I contacted Amazon, a whole new bag was sent to me within 3-days this time with a strap. The bag is heavy solid leather, I am able to carry all  the items I need at work in this bag. One of the physicians I work with also has the exact same bag, except in the lighter tan color, I prefer the dark brown leather, both are nice, I will buy this again if I ever wear this one out, should last for years, hopefully they will continue to make this product for years to come. If you want something light do not purchase,  this is a nice leather brief case with awesome pockets to store your gear, I carry a laptop and Ipad easily including all the accessories needed to plug in and  then some"
5.0,"Great quality, great fit, hail Varg"
5.0,I love these comfy jackets. I bought two others before this one that are similar. This one I bought too small and it was thinner than the others. I would have kept it but too tight around the shoulders. My fault though for buying to small of a size.
5.0,WOULD BUY AGAIN
5.0,My favorite work pants
5.0,Nice cotton summer dress
5.0,GREAT FIT!!! BEST TANKS!!
5.0,Pretty color and soft
5.0,"Love this.  This didn't list as a petite but I did search petite Maxi Dresses.  Perfect length with wedges.  Beautiful color, Pink.  Ordered in the green navy pattern since it was such a great price and fit."
5.0,It worked just fine.
5.0,Baby loves it
5.0,Very stretchy but fits perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,I got these in XL for my husband’s 10.5/11 wide feet. He says they are incredibly comfortable and can’t wait to wear them for a full day. They hug the foot nicely without being so tight that his toes are squashed together. They have little details that make them seem high quality - an embroidered “S” and a star pattern in the fabric on the toe are fun additions.<br />I like that the fabric content is listed on a sticker that is stuck to the bag. I also like that they didn’t come attached to one another with a little plastic piece (or 3) that has to be cut off. I find it very annoying when socks are packed that way!<br />If these hold up we will be buying more pairs.
5.0,Cuter then I thought they were going to be from the pic! The material is actual real  Jean material they're a good length not too long not too short. Overall pretty happy with the shorts!
5.0,They came flat so I had to stuff it
5.0,There is nothing quite so comfortable and practical as a ruby shirt.  So soft and warm.  Came from England but delivery was faster than I expected - about 10 days. I love it and will buy more.
5.0,absolutely beautiful earrings.  The price doesn't match the quality at all.  The clear stones sparkle is blinding and<br /> I just just ordered the black stone  earrings  for the price I just couldn't pass it up
5.0,"It's so comfortable, I can actually sleep with it on."
5.0,Very nice bracelet with some nice dangling pieces..<br />comfortable and not noisy!!
5.0,My Wife love it! Thanks!
5.0,"Love these mugs, use them in my raffle baskets for charity.  They are cute and catch peoples eyes as they are looking at raffle gifts."
5.0,"Beautiful pendant!  Picture on pendant is exactly as shown on Amazon. Just pay attention to the size when ordering... size is correct, I just wished I ordered the larger size."
5.0,"I loved, so comfortable and pretty"
5.0,"I love these, came early. I will be buying alot more of these kind of earrings. Droplet Earrings."
5.0,"I give it a 5 star because it looks exactly like the style but i would do a 3 for the color of it. I bought XL, fit perfect, and its my first time buying clothes online. It wasnt the maroon color like the photo originally showed but still pretty its 1 of 3 pieces for my halloween costume this year. Fabric is more polyester/silk feel to it, im afraid of ripping it for the fact it feels thin but all in all worth the price. Love it."
5.0,Very happy with purchase<br />Fits perfectly my two sons love it
5.0,Solid great price
5.0,"Bought this for my honeymoon and I can't wait to use it. I love that there's a pull closer at the top to keep sand out and everything clean inside. Looks exactly as pictured, except I like it even more in person."
5.0,"Excelente calidad, tal como aparece en la foto, lo use sin listón porque no senti que fuera necesario, si el color es diferente al de la foto pero pueden conseguir uno si quieren.<br />Solo arreglé la parte de arriba y el ruedo."
5.0,the back strap is an excellent idea to put the goggles on.
5.0,"This pants are a perfect weight for indoor or outdoor workouts. They fit perfectly, and the design is perfect."
5.0,This is a little smaller than I thought it was going to be but that is okay.
5.0,Happy with this product and it fits well. Will definitely buy again!
5.0,PERFECT FIT.... VERY FLATTERING FOR A FULL FIGURE WOMAN.
5.0,"I had a bag very similar to this several years ago and carried it until it was tattered beyond repair.  I searched until I found this bag, and it looks exactly like the one I wanted to replace. I have to say, this bag is far better quality. The leather is a good quality and very soft but thick, the workmanship is also of good quality. The lining and inside pockets are padded, unlike my old bag.  It is a little heavier due to the padding and real leather, but it's no worse than my regular laptop bag.  Overall, I can't find anything not to love about it thus far."
5.0,"very nice charm did not get the bracelet part, think I only order the charm...came in good timing, would order other stuff from this company"
5.0,Very warm a little bulky but never cold.
5.0,"My daughter wanted to be a dolphin for Halloween.  It was a little big on her since she was only 3 at the time, but she loved it, and it looked great.  We just rolled up the legs a little so she wouldn't trip on them. I would say that this costume is pretty true to size (size 4-6)."
5.0,"I bought this for a halloween costume and it came as expected. Fits fine, baggy in the right places"
5.0,"Really great, especially for price. Sizing especially."
5.0,I didn't even know you could order purse straps.  I love my cheetah purse but the strap was cracking in several places.  Yet I didn't want to give up the handbag itself because it was still in great shape.  I found this and it matches perfectly.  THANK YOU.
5.0,Requested by the recipient and they love them.
5.0,"What a beautiful winder for the price!  It was a gift for my father, and he loved it!"
5.0,I really love this belt. You are able to adjust the length to anything you would like. The locking system works great and you can click it in very small increments. Buckle looks great and seems to be quality to hold up.
5.0,"Love the packaging of the box, very premium feel to it. The box contains a smooth cloth, a cotton bag, polarized testing card, and the beautiful sunglasses itself. When wearing, the glasses look gorgeous. I was looking for something trendy for a long time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for premium sunglasses at a lower price point."
5.0,Sons gift he liked it
5.0,"This product is nice and thick. I wear them all the time, under dresses and under jeans. They have you to rip or run anywhere. They are fairly close to skin color but hide imperfections ok. They're a bit bigger than I thought they'd be. I ordered small and at 4'11 and 145 lbs I still have room to adjust. They don't fall down or bag at the crotch. They do roll down from the tummy though."
5.0,I loved these sandals!  I only got to wear them a short time because my parent's dog loved them too and chewed them up.  They were wade of real solid wood.
5.0,This shirt is a great deal. The price is excellent for a shirt that fits great and is made great.
5.0,Delivery is prompt. It is a beautiful bag & come in good condition. Has dust bag & nicely wrapped. Only no gift box.
5.0,"My husband likes these casual pants very much. At first he wasn't sold on the slimmer fitting legs, but he eventually came around and likes the fit. The main reason he lives these pants is because they have pockets. He is a mechanical engineer always tinkering with stuff, putting things in pockets, so he needs pants with pockets. Problem solved."
5.0,"Warm hat, Bluetooth works well"
5.0,I love these shorts. True to size. They’re very comfortable and have just enough stretch. They’re thin but hardy. The padding sits just right.  And I love all the pockets it has
5.0,"Nicely made socks,comfortable and warm."
5.0,Fits well comfy!
5.0,"I was very pleased.  It fits all of my stuff like a kindle, makeup bag, wallet, and a small umbrella very well, but it's not an overly huge bag.  It has a zippered pocket in the middle.  It didn't have a tag or anything saying it's real leather, so who knows, but if it's not, it sure looks like it.  The stitching is sturdy and the color is great.  I was pleasantly surprised!"
5.0,"I have had more complements on this than anything I have. Comfortable, warm yet not hot."
5.0,Excellent quality! Fit just as expected and looks just like the picture! My son got a lot of compliments on them and people can’t believe they came from amazon lol
5.0,"This bag is exactly what I wanted for grocery shopping.  Large enough for my phone, wallet and a few other items. It comes with a long strap for carrying it cross body.  Super"
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous!! So much more beautiful than the pictures!!
5.0,cute on granddaughter
5.0,"Flippin LOVE these!! They are super comfy, smooth like butter and breathable. They hold my momma kangaroo pouch in nicely. I will be ordering a LOT more of these!!"
5.0,Beautiful.  Love it.
5.0,This is a really cute suit! Looked perfect and got perfect!
5.0,Item is great quality and shipping came earlier than expected! Super happy with it and it’s so cute!
5.0,"These are the BEST slippers I have ever owned.  I am having tendonitis issues in my right foot and these really help abate the pain!  I liked them so much I bought a second pair to wear out to the store and on errands.  I don't wear anything else.  If I could wear them with my suits to work, I would!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
5.0,Giving this to my daughter for her birthday - will put it on her birthday table with some other special presents. We have a few silks from Sarah's Silks - they are beautiful and serve so many purposes for a little one's creative play! Would like to get a few more so we have several colors to play with!
5.0,It’s so pretty and a perfect gift for anyone
5.0,Very pretty it’s what i was expecting fast shipping!!
5.0,"Dress was beautiful, perfect for my brother’s wedding. The dress ran a bit bigger than expected so I wore a belt. But I got soooo many compliments about it!"
5.0,My wife loves butterflies...my wife loves accessories...this was a double hit!
5.0,"it is so big and flashy! exactly what i've been looking for. the algiz rune is a nice touch. the back is not flat/hollow, it has a simpler design. the chain is just right. 10/10"
5.0,"GORGEOUS ring!!!!! I'm so sad I have to return it because it's too small. The description states it's a size 7. NO WAY!! I couldn't get it past my knuckle on my ring finger, which is a straight 7. Very disappointed because it's beautiful!! Looks like great quality, so if you have a size 5-6 finger, this is a must have cocktail ring!!!"
5.0,Been wearing these for years. Best I’ve owned. Comfortable for wearing outdoors all day. Steep price but worth it to me.
5.0,ef
5.0,"It's a tote, and exactly as described and pictured. I am rating it based on what I expected from product description, and it fulfils that completely. Lightweight, open tote with handles, one interior pocket. It is within price range for size and quality. Very typical, yet has added benefit of rip stop waterproof material.  Color and print are clear and bright (even though mine is black cats & other graphics on white background, the colors and design are sharp, not muddled).<br /><br />Simply nice for any toting needs. I hoard totes, have a variety of styles and select based on my needs of the day. I have a small purse that gets tossed in a tote along with anything else I want to carry that day. My go to high quality ultra durable purse like tote has been this cute tote by [[ASIN:B07GQDT5CN Studio Oh!]]. But this Ycinas tote is tote-ally (totally) appropriate for beach, groceries, trip to the library, as a spare bag tucked into another bag, general catch all, etc. Unless it falls apart soon, I see no reason not to give it 5 stars for what it is.<br /><br />19.7"" wide x15.7"" tall (not including shoulder straps) x 5.9"" deep"
5.0,"I usually worry about the temperature of the sand when I'm playing beach sports, but I felt comfortable and confident in these!"
5.0,"Love this headwrap, you can do many styles with this wrap. It's the right width and length. I bought the dress with same pattern and it looks fabulous together. Got many compliments"
5.0,I bought this as a gift and the person loves it. It's very comfortable!
5.0,A really nice necklace that goes well with the fitbit flex 2. A+ product
5.0,Ordered these for Coachella and they're everything I wanted and more! Rainbow fractal vision! Every person I've showed them to wants to buy them from me hahah! Thanks for the excellent product!
5.0,absolutely hysterical and even more satisfactory in person lol<br /><br />10/10 the poor mans humble profit
5.0,I love it.. its beautiful I made smaller to fit my wrist as you can see it looks great and I bought the gold face protector so my fit bit look gold when I want it use it gold.. I got a lot of compliments the only thing doesn't  come with the tools to make it smaller I had the tool from another band silver the I bought before .
5.0,"It is a wide tie, beautiful gold, doesn't look cheap, tie clip.  It has good color, it's the same tone as my 14 karat crucifix.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,love the sandals just wish they came in  1/2 sizes
5.0,Nice quality and quick delivery.  I ordered and was wearing my necklace within just a few short days!  Everyone has been complementing me on how cute it is!  Nice quality and love the story of helping people with the purchase of this product.  I will be ordering the one with the Bike charm next!
5.0,Perfect fit and exactly what I expected! I was a little worried that the cape would not be as long as I wished but when I got it I was very surprised by how long it was. I am 5'9&#34; so it is hard for me as a woman to find things that are long enough. This was a great purchase! I would recommend.
5.0,"Love the fit, great price for this item"
5.0,Got this for my husband and he is very pleased.
5.0,"I'm 5'8 size 10 and these were a perfect fit! I can NEVER find pants long enough for me, so I'm so excited! Can't wait to wear them to the lake, they're so comfortable and light."
5.0,The grey is a nice cotton material that has washed really well. Ordered the olive green as well after loving the grey so much but returned it because it was a different fabric. The green was more form fitting and stretchy which wasnt as flattering as the grey was.
5.0,Very nice fabric and flattering fit.
5.0,loving all the colors and rockin the purple one :)
5.0,"These bracelets are really pretty! The quality  is excellent, much nicer than more expensive bracelets I've purchased in  the  past!!!"
5.0,Love how they fit my face stylish and in different colors.
5.0,"I'm 5'9"" and they said for up to 5'7"" they fit perfectly and my Master loves them! Thanks for the great product 😍 very soft and comfortable, can wear anytime."
5.0,"These help to protect the eyes, without being too dark. Fits nicely over larger eyeglasses."
5.0,"The Wife really likes this black cocktail dress. She likes how it fits and how slim it makes her look, it is a very flattering (err, forgiving) type of dress to wear she says.<br /><br />My Wife is 5'3"" and about 135lbs and typically wears a Medium. This is a Size 6 dress. My wife can wear a 4/6 or 6/8 dress and she feels this is closer to 6/8 in size. (ie. not closer to a 4)<br /><br />My wife put this on right after taking it out of the package and it looks great with zero ironing. Every woman needs a little black cocktail dress and this is it and it has pockets!"
5.0,"I LOVE THE GIRLY GIRL LOOK, FEMININE GYPSY FEEL.  COLORS PRETTY, NICE SWING AND LINED. PERFECT LENGTH AND DRESSY."
5.0,This is a very nice suit.  I love it.
5.0,Glasses look great have a nice fit feeling on my face
5.0,Great and looks good
5.0,"I ordered a set of ‘Primesons 18K White Gold Plated Cubic Zirconia Clear Swarovski Hoop Earrings’ for review.  These earrings are of course costume jewelry, but for the price these are surprisingly well made.  They white gold is well polished. The halo stones catch the light. The larger stone is of course not real, so it does not look real, but it is sparkly.  The posts are long enough to go through the lobe and have enough post to clasp them closed.  When clasped they stay secure.  If you bend the post however, they will not close correctly and you could have it come loose.  My wife does have skin sensitivity to certain metals, but these do not bother her at all.  No soreness or any skin reaction even when wearing them for a full day.  They are lightweight and do not pull or drag down the ear lobe.  Overall, these are a well-made, economical pair of costume earrings.  My wife will enjoy wearing them."
5.0,"Very comfortable, looks great, fit perfect! Get many compliments on it. Will buy more like it, love it!"
5.0,"I love these pants.  They move with me.  It feels like I'm not wearing anything at all.  They don't feel heavy like baggy shorts.  I got the medium, but I can go medium or large in these.  The material is great, it breathes well while wicking away sweat."
5.0,My six year old grand daughter loved it!
5.0,This hat is very cute and goes with everything. Fits really well and is made with good yarn.
5.0,"It is a thoughtful gift to remind my brother that he's the best.  He was suprised when he opened it, and liked it a lot!"
5.0,Love the sign language!<br />Fit was just a bit tight- order 1 size bigger
5.0,"Pretty sweet sunglasses, definitely worth it! Comfortable and pretty sleek looking, the blue green tint looks pretty badass. Never buying gas station sunglasses again, amazon for sure"
5.0,"My 10 year old was super happy with these wings. I would say they are kid sized. The headband was ok for a short amount of time, but she complained it was a bit tight. The wings are sweet and well made for the price."
5.0,These are very nice earrings.
5.0,"Very nice face cover, but much too large for young children."
5.0,This product was awesome! the gems are super shiny
5.0,percfect
5.0,Great quality. I use it as my daily case. Leather feels great.
5.0,It’s as beautiful as I was hoping it would be. I love it 😍
5.0,I love my new shirt. I had to order this shirt since I am left handed. Awesome saying and makes a great gift for anyone who is left handed. I love the different selections of colors.
5.0,i loved this product because it came pretty fast since its from china and all the chokers you see in the picture came in the package :)
5.0,I bought to use for gardening since I have a lot of roses
5.0,Got these ear rings to match an abalone necklace which matched great.
5.0,"I’m getting back into running and my calves are not too impressed, lol! These have made such an improvement in the last week. My legs warm and and stay loose and my recovery is much more tolerable."
5.0,"Ordered it a size up and had to return it. No problems sending back the old one, especially with the free return. Received the refund within a couple of days as well as the other ring.<br /><br />Quality of the packaging was great and the ring was even better. I'm glad I was able to buy such a nice ring for my future husband!"
5.0,My 13 year old daughter loves them. She loves anything with dinosaurs.
5.0,Perfect!! Just beautiful! Very happy!
5.0,I like the shoes you don't know you have them on. I use them for my swimming class.
5.0,"I had been spending so much money on totes that would double as a purse.  This bag arrived a few days ago and I LOVE IT!!! Perfect for everything I need.  It is so lightweight, yet made sturdy.  Getting my daughter one! Best bag ever!!"
5.0,Pretty but not my style. I showed it to my Goddaughter and she's so in love with them that I gave them to her. I'm rating these sunglasses on her behalf. She's 18. The case is die for though. That was my fav part.
5.0,This bag was perfect for my weekend business trip. Got on my suitcase perfectly and had plenty of storage for my laptop and snacks.

5.0,"Me gustó mucho, es tal como se muestra en la imagen y se ve increíble ya puesto"
5.0,Bracelet is just as it appears in picture. Super nice! Love the big metal piece.<br />(Came quickly and well packaged.)
5.0,This striking watch has a bold face a d a comfortable band. In addition to keeping time it has a calendar. Solar powered it tells time accurately and precisely. The face is large and there are dots where numerals usually are. Still easy to read. I was not impressed with the packaging which consisted of a bright blue branded box and a cheap plastic holder.  The watch is well made and worthy of better. If you like big and bold you will appreciate this timepiece.
5.0,Super sexy and hides any cellulite lmao thank goodness for textured leggings!
5.0,Well made. I use it in a stone coloured stetson
5.0,"I LOVE THESE LEGGINGS. I won’t workout in anything if it’s not lulu but the fit of these is so flattering and they are squat proof and don’t fall down, i am obsessed. I am 5’3 130 pounds and in the grey i got a XS and based on reviews I got a S in the blue marl and they fit perfect. so happy i’m getting every color"
5.0,"These glasses were excellent in overall quality. Really felt like a $200 + pair. The only 8ssue for me unfortunately, they were too wide on my face. (Medium face) Abnormally wide. Too bad. Sent them back but, for those with a larger face, buy em. Though they were wide in terms of lenses, the actual arms fit tight to the head. A plus for me but, maybe not for others."
5.0,"I started work in a lab and would like to have my personal safety equipment. Just received it fitted on my face, the glass is clear and it’s not heavy at all."
5.0,Nice bag. I luv it
5.0,"I absolutely love the color, fit, and feel of these glasses! Definitely will be buying again!"
5.0,This came just as expected

5.0,Came in handy!
5.0,Super cute! Love Love these sunglasses!
5.0,Soft and cozy. Would buy again.
5.0,"Before I purchase,is this going to fit a plus size person? becuz i like thiz"
5.0,Robocop.
5.0,Love! So cute.
5.0,"Bought this for my kid and he loves it! Great material, colors look brilliant, fit is perfect."
5.0,"Product just as advertised, good quality."
5.0,For my mom gift
5.0,Very soft and warm. True to size.
5.0,"I’m obsessed with these glasses ! They come in a box case, have a sunglasses fixing tool, and they feel so sturdy ! I have over 4 pairs of Sojo’s glasses and I honestly don’t think I’ll buy another brand !"
5.0,"What time is it? Time to get a watch,"
5.0,"These ties are great. They are made of cotton so they have the rugged/rough or textured look to them and look great with suits. I have a couple ties of similar material from The Tie Bar but these ties are just as nice as those, and you get 3 for less than the price of a Tie Bar tie. If you're looking for some classic floral print ties, definitely get these."
5.0,Comfortable and stays put.
5.0,Fast delivery!  Beautiful
5.0,Very nice my husband loved it and he isn't a bracelet kind of guy
5.0,"I had to use these to combat that funk in my sons soccer shoes,  and I won.  I've had them for 6 months and use them for my snow boots and basketball shoes.  Nothing beats putting on a warm and dry pair of boots in the winter."
5.0,I really like this watch and bracelet. It keeps time really well. It's within 5 seconds per day.
5.0,"Awhile back I gave this 3 stars. The wood was wet.. well I sat on it for about 2 plus years.. and it came to life. The grain is fabulous.  I just ordered two more pieces.. this is excellent wood.  Sometimes we should sit back and relax, and be in a hurry.. happy wood working"
5.0,Opened and secured easily. Segmented portion is not very noticeable.
5.0,looked all over for this band at a great price.
5.0,"This is a great belt that is comfortable, durable, and looks great.  The large metal studs and hardware look great with a pair of jeans, and if you are the type of person who still keeps his cell phone clipped to his pants, it works great for that as well.  The leather is stiff, but not uncomfortable.  I got a size 34/36, and while my waist is a little smaller than this, it was no issue because there are holes all around the belt.  There wasn't too much tail sticking out.  The belt has a retro look, but I like it, and it is my new &#34;weekend casual&#34; wear.  Recommended!<br /><br />Note: Free sample provided for review."
5.0,Fits perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I get compliments everywhere I go.
5.0,"How many times can I write 'love' before the meaning is worn out? I LOVE these! I was nervous about the fit because there wasn't a size mentioned, although the seller told me when I asked that it was the size I was looking for - but you never know.... until it arrived and they fit perfectly! I absolutely love these - the color is fantastic and bright, they are so comfortable,  and everything is just love- I think what made me question most was because the price was too good! But everything came together full circle and love is in the air! Did I mention I love these?"
5.0,"This was probably the best purchase for the money that I have made.....all 'high end winders' were 500+....I am using 3 of the 4 winders in this thing, and it is working to a T and has not missed a beat"
5.0,Great keychain. Excellent quality.
5.0,"Material is soft and &#34;slinky&#34;.  Fits well and looks very nice.  The necklace is nothing to write home about, does nothing to beautify the blouse,  and could be eliminated"
5.0,"I purchased this watch for nursing, I wanted an inexpensive watch but one that I can see the ticker move when completing pulse rate, etc, this will work great!"
5.0,Gifted it and it was loved. Young chess player appreciated sentiment spelled out.
5.0,"I WEAR THIS UNDER A U.S. FLAG PIN ON MY JACKET (CONCEALED CARRY JACKET) TO SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND HAVE RECEIVED MANY COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF IT. (TO ME, IT STANDS FOR PROTECTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS)"
5.0,"Cute, but the thong piece wasn't attached to the sole piece. Nothing a little glue or apoxy can't fix though"
5.0,"I liked it when I didn't have a lot in it, and I liked it even more when I had to carry many things."
5.0,bought a few of these shirts for my nephew and he wants one in every color
5.0,Cool weather
5.0,Beautiful and just as described
5.0,These are extremely comfortable. I bought them because I need arch support for flat feet and ankle arthritis. The price point is great and the comfort level exceeded my expectations.
5.0,"Non slip, perfect width, withstand intense workouts & keep sweat out of my eyes. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,I got this for my niece. My son had a similar one that she loved. We looked for one for awhile and finally found this one. She loved it!
5.0,"Beautiful automatic watch. Blue and red with Milanese mesh bracelet. White face. Omega Seamaster Commander (Bond) Replica (no 007 on the second hand but that’s fine), still a gorgeous piece overall. Minimal lume. Not really expecting too much for the money. Better build quality than 95% of watches in this price range. Not worried about dive capability as most scuba divers don’t wear watches like this anyway. Screw down crown. Automatic movement is quiet and runs well. Really impressed with Pagani so far."
5.0,"Beautiful color, very comfortable! Got lots and lots of comments. It fits just right and it's not to long."
5.0,This item came on time. It was a great price for its purpose. My son loves loved it
5.0,Daughter loves.
5.0,I bought theses for my two year old daughter. Perfect size for a toddler. Good backs that prevent her from pulling them out and losing them.
5.0,"Wooooow, lovely dress, will be my Christmas dress to church. Very pretty."
5.0,"My wife loves it! Only issue is that the built in light’s a bit dim, other than that, this is a good inexpensive watch."
5.0,This dress is beautiful and great quality. I just got it altered to make it a shorter dress because it was longer.
5.0,"Very nice dress, fits just right. Modest yet attractive."
5.0,"Just as described. Daughter loves them. Cute and soft, but not super warm."
5.0,Smaller than expected but very very pretty. The little jewels are a pale mint. My favorite color.
5.0,"My son is a huge penguin fan, and loves his crazy socks for wrestling tournaments! These were perfect for his personality and fit great!"
5.0,I love this night dress it's thin but not see through thin. It fits very well but if you have boobs and plan on sleeping in it be prepared to have a boob or two plop out! Other than that I definitely plan on ordering other colors!
5.0,I was skeptical about ordering these but I got them and love them. My ears are pierced twice in each ear and I wanted something kind of small to wear in the second holes. They are great and can be worn with so much.
5.0,look amazing in my wife
5.0,This hat is so cute on my daughter! She loves it.
5.0,It fits well looks cool great for any aot fan
5.0,"This is really a great bra. Honestly, it's probably the most comfortable bra I've ever owned and I feel like that says a lot considering that I've always been on the busty side.<br />Mine is fitting a little large right now, but I'm still pre-partum. I ordered on the larger side to accommodate for engorgement and general milk supply growth once post-partum.<br />The material of the bra is so soft that I can barely feel it. I wear it around the house as well as to bed. It's so nice to have a nursing bra designed by someone who has had to actually use one. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the design.<br />Thank you for a fabulous bra!<br />I will try to update this review once I'm actually nursing, again."
5.0,My son liked them so that makes me happy.  He had just joined a gym and needed workout clothes.
5.0,Our daughter used this as a Halloween outfit.  It was good.
5.0,I love this top. As a short plus size woman I was able to wear this shirt and feel completely comfortable.  I am a 42 DDD bust and I just wore nipple covers under the top and it fit and felt wonderful.  My husband absolutely loves when I wear this top.
5.0,Very nice quality and bright colors. I bought these to make masks unfortunately 12X12 is to small for masks.
5.0,The wife liked how soft the inside is. She immediately tested the touch screen ability by using her phone while wearing the gloves.<br />She was very happy with the gift.
5.0,"Just love these glasses!  I'm the type that always needs to read something and without reading glasses I'm toast.  The only problem is I can't always carry a pair of glasses around in my pocket for obvious reasons.  Enter the folding reading glasses and problem solved!  Sturdy and fit well in the soft case, soft being the operative word here because a hard case would be just as much a nuisance as a regular pair of glasses.  I'll buy again - when my vision deteriorates a little more."
5.0,"Perfect for my husband, we had a hard time finding the hinge type, he doesn't like the magnet ones. This one is great."
5.0,"I was worried about the sizes. I’m 5’3,wear a 14 and have a large bust. I bought the size Large. I had to hem the dress about an inch and it fits perfectly. I will be getting more in different colors!"
5.0,Bought a a gift for my son and he loves it.
5.0,Fit a little small but my son loved it

5.0,Better than I expected. I love it and all my items fit perfectly.
5.0,It’s can be good for work
5.0,LOVE this top so much that I just ordered another in a different color! Cute with skinny jeans and boots or leggings. It's comfortable and slimming. A must have for your wardrobe.
5.0,Great! 😀
5.0,So stinking cute! I loved it! Thank you so much!
5.0,They were perfect for the funeral.
5.0,Girly card holder..Recommended..
5.0,My wife loved the color of the stones and the overall design of this pendant. Very well done!
5.0,My boyfriend loved it! The perfect gift for someone who is into tech!
5.0,I bought these glasses for my summer vacation and they went with every outfit! I love them!!!! I would recommend buying a case though!
5.0,Very attractive. Good quality.
5.0,This is the perfect addition to my sons newly designed baseball room. We use it for his metals
5.0,Love this for my keys
5.0,Beautiful ring  Fits perfect. Husband remarks it shiny every time the light hits
5.0,This type of glasses is very useful for me when driving at night. It has high quality and looks great
5.0,Tells time. Can swim and play with it. Rugged.<br />Solar powered for when you washed up on a desert island. Try that with an Apple! The salt water alone would stop it.
5.0,They were perfect for New Years Eve Celebration! and reasonable is $$$$ too!
5.0,Love these and so does everyone else. All of my friends want a pair. They’re very sturdy and very flattering.
5.0,Fits great! Warm and cute. Love the fact that my ponytail can fit through!!
5.0,My granddaughter absolutely loves it. It fits her perfect and is so comfortable she just wants to wear it all the time.
5.0,This tank is a Next Level brand Ideal T for size and fit reference.  The material is soft and resists fading and wear.  I love this brand and this tank is no exception.  All edges are finished and the graphic is super cute!  This was a great purchase!  And it comes with a bonus sticker!!
5.0,"This fit perfectly and was as pictured. I get a little nervous ordering clothes from Amazon, but was happy with this skirt."
5.0,Arrived on time with perfect condition. Just as advertised. Many thanks.
5.0,For working out and walking
5.0,"I got the small (5'4"", 110#) and I absolutely love it.  Very soft and cozy.  My husband wishes they made one for him!"
5.0,"I really enjoy this sweatshirt. It is a bit thinner than I expected, but so comfortable and it does a great job at keeping me warm. After using it a few times, I actually really like that it is more lightweight because that makes it easier to wear during outdoor activity such as jogging. It is not too long and not too short. It is borderline on the cropped side but still not too short for my torso. It is very casual, flattering, and goes with virtually any fitness clothes. It’s perfect for chilly, early morning runs.  I love how comfortable it is."
5.0,The shirt looks just like the picture and fit my husband true to size.
5.0,"I searched numerous brands for something this compact to give as gifts but was leery because of mixed reviews.  Was hoping these wouldn’t be flimsy and cheap. Not the case. Very sturdy and not lightweight. You won’t be building houses with this but it’s perfect for changing batteries in toys, fixing household things or putting together small items. Very impressed!"
5.0,The style has a nice drape and the shorts/skirt combo design is very comfortable. The pattern is lovely; suitable for both casual and more dressy occasions.
5.0,Comfortable and easier to put on than most compression socks.
5.0,Loved this hat. Worn for Caribbean vacation. Stayed in place in water and through windy days. Dried quickly when wet and folded for travel. Great purchase.
5.0,These come in a package of three [all identical] and a bonus lens cleaning cloth.  I tried them on my daily RX glasses and my RX sun glasses [Ray-ban style/size as an fyi] and the rubber connectors fit well and very snug. It almost feels like they might not fit but just move it gently along and wa-lah! I got these for a very active trip to Alaska with lots of hiking and knew I needed something to prevent loss of glasses and these were perfect!
5.0,I really like it. I ordered a large and the top is pretty tight but will work. I’m usually a women’s medium size 8 but this does run small in my opinion. The bottoms are a bit cheeky but not too bad. Seems good quality and it’s a cute style.
5.0,"LOVED this dress, I will be ordering more of it. Fit perfect."
5.0,This bracelet is well made and goes great with brown & black.
5.0,Grandsons BT graduation
5.0,It worked on my new Model S keyfob...love it!
5.0,Nice glasses.  Great value for money.
5.0,Bought two of these. One for my sister and one for her husband. Both like horses and have a few of them on their property and I thought these were appropriate. They like the masks.
5.0,Cute charms. Really like them.
5.0,I loved it in my opinion. I have a small wrist and it fits pretty well. It looks exactly like the picture. I'm very happy with my purchase ❤
5.0,"Love this! Love the look, colors are vibrant & it is made well."
5.0,Perfect for organizing glasses and easily identifying them. I've ordered a few sets of these.
5.0,"These PJs, as pictured, show that the entire top is plush, including the sleeves.  The pair I received (size MEDIUM) had thin and lightweight sleeves and back.  That's not what I expected to receive.  What I received was constructed like the Puppy Dog Messy Hair Don’t Care Black Fleece Plush Pajama Sleep Set w/Socks."
5.0,"This dress is so soft and clings where it’s supposed to, drape is lovely."
5.0,"Great deal on these, one is tinted and one clear.  Fit adults and children 12 and 9.  Might be tight with glasses though."
5.0,Perfect for the bedroom!
5.0,always love Bernie Mev. Only thing I wear.
5.0,"You can find, keys, pets, kids. Super useful to have on a keychain or pet collar."
5.0,Cute canvas bags. Would make great gift bags. They are big enough to hold a couple of paperback books. They are smaller than I thought they would be but that is my fault for not really looking at the measurements.
5.0,pretty and affordable!!! Great but!
5.0,Great inexpensive tie. I bought this because I have to wear a red tie with suit to ref at Taekwondo tournament.
5.0,I'm Diabetic plus my left ankle is very weak and the boots act like a brace to keep my ankles straight.
5.0,"I am normally a M or 8-10, but after looking at the size chart I purchased a Large.  The fit was somewhat small, especially in the bust (and I'm pretty small busted) BUT I loved it so much I ordered the light blue one as well!  It's super soft and comfortable. It is very well made.  And a dress with POCKETS!!  Yes Please!<br /><br />Update: loved wearing my dress until I washed it.  I followed the directions but it came out smaller and I no longer can wear it.  I'm so sad that I bought two and now can no longer wear either.  The shrunk in size and length."
5.0,"I love the deep colors and they are made well. l love them. Was going to give one away but, l think l will keep them both for myself. Now, l will see how they hold up after washing. They were used for Thanksgiving just what l needed. And they have nice pockets. Now, l don’t have to wonder where my phone is and other things that l need close to me."
5.0,"Great ring, bought as a gift.  Will buy again"
5.0,Great swimsuit.
5.0,I love this soft and beautiful piece. Everywhere I go I get complements...I can use it with different outfits regardless of whether or not matches. I will buy another one when I can :)
5.0,I loved the fit and the look.
5.0,"I bought this product thinking that at this price, how &#34;nice&#34; it might actually be in person.  Honestly, it is a decent piece of jewelry and the three chains lie nicely.  It looks best either flat on the skin or lying flat on the top of a garment as in a tank top, sweater, turtleneck, etc..  Don't let it hang half on your skin and half on your garment...somehow then it looks a bit odd and lays like a not so nice piece then.  I love it.  I wear it dressy for work or casual with jeans and boots.  It's one of my staples."
5.0,"This is a great light weight 3-4 length sleeve tunic top that hits just below the hip with a graceful A-Line and Swing Skirt hem.  The lenght on this is long enough that if you feel good in leggings or skinny jeans they would be a great compliment to dress it up.  The print on the sleeve is a navy which gives you a bit of color to go with the black and white which I love as blue is my fav but was unexpected.  It is a tiny bit larger than expected.  I may have been able to have gone with a L but with winter coming and the possibility of layering, I decided to stick with the XL.  The look is great and I've gotten lots of notice."
5.0,Super warm and comfy.
5.0,Good quality chambray shirt. Great tailored fit. Shirt fit as expected.
5.0,Top Quality Hat....  Better than most
5.0,"Good, that is what i expected wallet---nice leather."
5.0,used these to make a leg brace for mad max cosplay.
5.0,"This is a cute top. I'm sometimes hesitant to order clothes online but in this instance, I ordered the size I most regularly wear and it fit well."
5.0,I am really pleased with the quality of these dog tags.  My engraving instructions were very specific and they followed them exactly how I wanted.  I was a little worried how they would turn out because the photo that I uploaded wasn't the best but when I received them I was amazed at how clear they both were.  Beautifully done.  I will definitely buy again and I will tell everyone I know to buy from them.  Thank you!<br /><br />Update:  I bought two more of these because the first transaction went smooth and I am just as pleased with these as the previous ones. Thank you!
5.0,Great fit and very sexy! My partner loves how these look on me. Super stretchy and the right amount of risqué.  Love so much I ordered a different color.
5.0,Love this.  Happy I can rep my flag of Trinidad and Tobago on my face
5.0,Excellent quality. It looks great on quality leather belt with jeans. That's everything I would expect from a quality buckle. And it is also very reasonably priced.
5.0,"This suit gets a lot of compliments!  Colors are bright!  Suit is very well made but just a tad big. Order your normal size but you will find it is a very forgiving, comfortable suit."
5.0,Regalo!
5.0,They were great at addressing my order. They made sure it was exactly what I wanted. Knowing how things can get screwed up with special orders they were spot on. In fact the design was so loved I'm getting ready to order several more and will be at ease knowing they will make sure I'm happy with every aspect before making and shipping. Cheers!
5.0,Sturdy and clear.
5.0,"Great sunglasses, my daughter has to have a pair anytime she goes outside. These flex so when she takes them off they don't bend. Best sunglasses I've ever bought her. They fit perfectly (she's 3) and will probably fit for a couple more years (if they dont her lost.)"
5.0,These are the most comfortable leggings I've ever worn. I'll be ordering them in more colors.
5.0,Very pretty bracelet. Does have some sharp edges.
5.0,I used these after my mastectomy and will use them if I have drains after my reconstruction. It’s very convenient so you don’t have to look at them and for when you need to measure fluid. I love that there’s one for the shower as well.
5.0,Great dress. Fits wonderful.
5.0,Love my Harry Potter wallet. Plenty of space and I hate carrying a purse.
5.0,Perfect for the job. That's what I needed to do for work
5.0,"I bought this for my wife, so I am quoting from her.  She truly enjoyed the comfort of this top.  She looks great in it too! ;-)  I purchased it through a discount site, but in all honesty, she loved this top!  It's like a terry cloth, but only smoother feeling. very sexy on her!  The color was spot-on, Appears well made.  Hangs well and machine washable.  I hope this helps you to decide to purchase one. Good luck and thanks for reading my review."
5.0,Absolutely love a good graphic tee and this one is so fun. Fits perfectly. Washed once already and still looks new.
5.0,"Good materials, design and layout.  Practical without being bulky."
5.0,It was pretty. But it fit me big. I think it's my fault though. They were really nice and I was able to return it and get a refund.
5.0,My uncle loves it- Best birthday gift 🎁
5.0,Sexy AND comfortable!
5.0,Awesome fast perfect
5.0,"As advertised. Works great. Fits nicely. Used it to present my favorite monkey lover some roses for valentines day! GAG was a hit, now it is stored for Halloween."
5.0,My 5 yr old grandson loves everything about this raincoat. He's ready for it to rain so he can see the robots. He's been sponging it wet since it arrived. Very good quality. I will buy it again when he out grows the size 8
5.0,It’s lightweight. Lined. Has some stretch. Short. Fits relaxed. You can go down a size for a more fitted dress. I’ve bought two of these. I liked it.
5.0,This dress is such a great value for the price! It looks amazing and feels so comfortable. I would order your normal size because there is a lot of stretch to this dress. I wear a size 6 and ordered a small and it fits perfect!!
5.0,It looks way better than the picture. The dress it self fits great and the top part was not to big! i will be buying in all colors!
5.0,Nice fit also a good grip on what ever you are handling.
5.0,Love it . Very well made and  lots of room !
5.0,Love these.  Idk what I thought the cut out on the sides was when I ordered but it was a surprise.  I still like them alot.
5.0,"Really soft, really cute and comfy. I bought and extra large because I wanted it loose. I normally wear a size 12."
5.0,I like these pens because the colors are a little different than the POSCA pen colors.  They are vibrant and work well..
5.0,Super cute and soft! Makes you feel dressed up even while feeling relaxed. Ordered more colors. I got the XL
5.0,"My 8 year old grandson loved the shirt. I bought him the sneakers a few days ago,  that go with the shirt. He is so excited to wear them both together."
5.0,This was a gift for my grandmother.  It fit her perfectly. It’s stylish and warm. She loves it!
5.0,"I totally love this bag ! I was skeptical about buying it because it had no reviews but it's great. I wanted a double zippered purse. This purse can be carried two ways, by the handles or on the shoulder. (There's a strap to accommodate that). The bag was supposed to arrive February 17- March 3 and I received it February 11 which was a plus. Today is February 12, 2016. The delivery was on point. I ordered two bags from this vendor. The other bag came first and I was wearing it but once this arrived, I quickly changed. It's very sturdy. The zippers work well. It's cute and compact. I wish this bag came in more colors. All in all, it was a great buy❤️"
5.0,"I go for a run each morning around 5 am, and it can be pretty dark in many areas around my neighborhood. After taking a pretty bad fall I knew I needed something to light my way. I wasn't going to carry a flashlight while running or use something that would weight me down. These are perfect! They attach to your laces and are surprisingly perfect! The different options for the light gives you a choice of how bright (even flashing) to set the lights to. I feel much safer knowing that I can be seen my others and that I won't trip over something hidden in the dark. I highly recommend!"
5.0,Cheap and effective. What else could I say?
5.0,This dress is wonderful. The fabric feels silky and wonderful. The print is beautiful and I received numerous compliments on thw flattering fit.
5.0,Holds Heat in as expected
5.0,I absolutely loved this dress .. I tried several others from Macy's and this dress beat them all. The price is amazing!
5.0,I purchased these as a gift for a friend. She is extremely happy and excited to have her first pair of Oakley Sunglasses.
5.0,It will last to the end of time
5.0,"In love with these ! The fit is amazing , I have ordered about 6 more colors now !"
5.0,This dress is amazing! It is so soft and fits perfectly! I will definitely be buying this brand again!
5.0,"I workout 5 days a week and wear leggings when I'm in the gym.  I bought these in a size small, which is my normal size.  The material for these leggings is very high quality.  The waistband sits comfortably around my natural waist, which is exactly what I wanted.  The fit is slightly more snug than my other leggings.  Perhaps with a few more washings, it might get a little looser (though not too much, I hope).  At the price I paid, this was a really good deal."
5.0,Figure hugging and very classy. Love it
5.0,"these earrings are great for everyday use.  however I do plan on changing my plastic backings with real gold ones because they are a pain to deal with, and they sometimes get stuck on the earring causing them to be quite difficult to remove."
5.0,I wear a 36DD and am average build and this for exactly to size and love it for the summer with shorts
5.0,"My husband likes comfortable, nice looking and longer shorts just for hanging around."
5.0,It look really good and cannot wait to wear tonight
5.0,Great I love it I have bought a set for my wife as well great buy !!!
5.0,So CUTE! My daughter is a size 8 womens so we ordered the 6 kids and they fit her perfectly.  The heel is only 1 inch tall so they aren't too tall. Plus they are so stylish. She loves them.
5.0,Love the color! Fits perfect!!
5.0,Perfect. Comfortable. Sturdy. Doesn’t fall out.
5.0,GREAT hat!  I love the extra large brim and the sun protection it offers while still being super cute.
5.0,Birthday Celebration is was lovely.
5.0,The hubby loves the hat!
5.0,I love it and it’s great when BBQ.
5.0,It’s a Christmas gift and my granddaughter will be thrilled.
5.0,"I am always leery when it comes to low cut or no-show socks, but these are amazing and very comfortable! They don't roll down and they do stay put. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Love these hats, I have four or five.  They last a long time, none of them have lost gems and I always get tons of compliments when I went them.  This one arrived within two days and it is beautiful! Love that it's a trucker style, will be good for summer."

5.0,"Very nice sun glasses, they look great on, I would definitely buy them again!"
5.0,"The glasses arrived in a timely fashion, they look cool and I can wear them comfortably. They come with this white plastic film on the inside of the lenses to add more detail and give you &#34;spider-eyes&#34; but they obscured my vision so  I peeled them off with some tweezers and now  my visibility is perfect."
5.0,"This are so awesome. I get compliments on them all the time. The pink/yellow color of the lenses are very flattering for me. They do show finger prints very easily, but that’s just the nature of the beast. My roommate will be gifted a pair of these bad boys for Christmas."
5.0,Delivered and was as expected!
5.0,Bought because I found a great deal. Wasn't sure on the size but they fit perfectly. My daughter loves them and wears them all weekend. They are easy for my 4 year old to out on and go.
5.0,It fits perfectly and the material is nice
5.0,"The pajamas are cute, soft and fit great."
5.0,I ordered up a size so it fit perfectly.  I love this dress. They do run a little small so just order up on size. But they really fit perfect.
5.0,I actually use these on my therapy dog when we go to the hospital to visit. Seeing a dog walk in with sunglasses and a lei around her neck brings a smile to patients and staff. They are well made and sturdy.
5.0,Nice belt really fancy.
5.0,"Good fit, looks cute. Planning to wear a petticoat under the dress to give it more of a flare."

5.0,Very classy and a classic! Tons of compliments while wearing.
5.0,"A beautiful color, fits as expected, love the hemline & the fact it's not made of a &#34;hot&#34; material as I'm hot-natured.  Love the neckline, just a wonderful top all the way around. I love it & highly recommend it."
5.0,Great option for the budget-conscious dance mom.
5.0,"I love the look of these caps and this one looks and feels great. It fits as expected and is better constructed than I thought it would be for the price. Very pleased with this, would buy again."
5.0,"It fits big but I still love it. I have a short hair style now but if my hair was longer and I had it piled up in a bun, I think the hat would be perfectly snug. But with my short hair, it danced around my head."
5.0,Love it😚😚
5.0,Order larger
5.0,Love this product satisfied with that will be ordering again
5.0,It's perfect it looks absolutely genuine leather and I like the color combination

5.0,My favorite thermals!
5.0,I went ahead and ordered a size up thanks to the reviews. Got so many compliments and felt great wearing it. Will be buying the other colors soon!
5.0,"These may be the nicest pair of moccasins I've ever owned, and I've owned quite a few. My wife laughed the moment I put them on - she hasn't seen me dance in a while, and these just felt that good. The insole is the biggest contributor - a hefty layer of memory foam beneath the plaid lining cradles the foot, making it feel somehow lighter. The leather-like suede upper is breathable and therefore not too warm, although there's no question these would keep your feet cozy on a brisk morning. The sole has a good tread and is unlikely to slip as readily as a flat sole; it's flexible enough to walk or run in but stiff enough to keep stones (or Lego blocks) at bay. The stitching appears strong and even. Fit is exactly as expected.<br /><br />I'm particularly pleased that the CCVON Mens Moccasin Slippers are machine washable; even if they're only worn indoors, footwear will by design accumulate floor dust while protecting your feet. If worn out of doors, cleaning will of course be even more important.<br /><br />I have no complaints, but having owned many similar pairs of moccasins I have generally found it best to secure the decorative bow knot with a dot of waterproof glue, as the thick lacing from which this feature is made tends to loosen and untie itself over time. I can heartily recommend these CCVON moccasins."
5.0,Laurel Burch is so talented.  My niece the cat lover is very pleased.
5.0,"Lovely belt, very substantial. Packaging was beautiful."
5.0,"These kids swim goggles are great! I was a little worried they would be too big for my nephew who is 5, but they fit perfectly. He wanted to wear them around because they were so comfortable and he thought it was awesome that everything he was seeing was blue! They even fit my 1.5 year old nephew! I can't wait for them to try these out in the pool next year, but they suctioned to his face even out of the water so I'm sure they would be awesome for under water use."
5.0,Great for relieving eye strain. Fashionable. I keep one pair at home and one at work.
5.0,Love this set of necklaces I wear them all the time
5.0,The dress is perfect for a casual event . It is just the right length and the colors are true to the picture.
5.0,These swim shorts fit as expected and a welcome addition to my husband's collection of Dallas Cowboys apparel.
5.0,"Beautiful, my wife loves it and it fits perfectly. The chain appears to be adequately sturdy enough, at least as far as any inexpensive jewelry goes."
5.0,"These are my favorite late fall/winter headbands. They’re thick and keep my ears warm during runs, but are less restrictive than a hat so my hair can be pulled up. I absolutely love these headbands and all my MT gear"
5.0,I love this product. Material a little thin but overall great but.
5.0,"Very nice bought as a gift for my sons girlfriend she loved it , she’s a big Lucy fan ..,"
5.0,The item is BEAUTIFUL! It sparkles like crazy! I love it.
5.0,Kid loves it wore it all the time
5.0,I have received several compliments.  Nice quality.  Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"I really love this swimwear, I usually wear a size small - Med or size 6-8. I am 5’1 140lb 34b and it fits me nicely. I don’t think a person with breast could fit the top. It’s kind of small. I have a thick butt and it looks nice and fits well. Very well made."
5.0,I bought this a long time ago but remember liking it. End of review.
5.0,Surprisingly good product!
5.0,Very nice and sturdy. Nice dark lenses. Quick shipment!!! Thanks!
5.0,"Cutie blouse. No problems with size, color and the fabric is good."
5.0,i love this one i gave to my sistr se like it
5.0,These face mask inserts are comfortable and easy to use. They make breathing easier.
5.0,"Best features: (1) warm vest even when not turned on. (2) looks good, nice quality (3) best of all, two separate heating zones.  The two separate heating zones really adds versatility and battery management.<br />If you're skiing and your chest is cold, you may only need the front, and conserve battery. If you're sitting at a camp fire and your face is melting but your back is cold, just use the back. I really love that feature. I'm very pleased with the vest and wear it often, even with no battery in it. as for the battery, it will accept all kind of sizes and I can easily go 8 hours on the low settings. if you cant, don't blame the vest. you probably just have a worn out battery."
5.0,"This is what I was looking for and I am very pleased with it, it works great.  Fast shipper too!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,I love the pendant. Everyone of my grandchildren has one of these pendants. We feel it is a good product and is a protection from our Heavenly Father.
5.0,I loose my sunglasses often so cheap and easy is good
5.0,Everyone compliments this dress . Super flown and soft I love how breezy it feels and it hugs your body perfectly. Worth every cent.
5.0,Love this dress on me!
5.0,"I've always preferred leggings to pants, and the added plus of a &#34;free size&#34; means I don't have to worry about every inch like I would ordering pants. That being said, as I stretched the fabric to put them on, I could see through the material, and that makes me think it would not be a full opaque color if I were a large. They are kind of in-between matte and sheer, and they are surprisinly comfortable. Depending on how you like the fabric to appear, these would be fine to wear like pants. I'll probably put them under a longer top."
5.0,Beautiful color and fit great.
5.0,I love colors and it’s very comfortable
5.0,I sized up and it fit perfectly. Comfortable and super soft fabric.
5.0,"Awesome keychain, I love it"
5.0,Got one for each of the family
5.0,"Nice, soft and elastic, good for travel."
5.0,"Great band!<br />Stop giving away your money.<br />Comfortable, quality and inexpensive"
5.0,Love these!!  They are so soft and warm.  I need to order more but they’re out of stock!!!😭😭 These are literally the only socks that I can wear.
5.0,"I guess I didn't look close enough, I expected silver accents on it but, it has gold. Still cute, the braiding on the front I love. It's really tall and has roomy pockets. Love it! Idk why people keep saying it smells..lol. umm spray some fabreeze? I guess? It smells like fake leather. Whatever."
5.0,Great SWAT shirt!!
5.0,My 3 year old loves this hat😊
5.0,"Fit as expected love it, just a little see through"
5.0,"I have gotten a ton of compliments on this shirt ahlince buying it.  I am always cautious when buying clothing on Amazon but this was a winner.  I typically am between a size xl and 2xl and I went with the 2xl. I could have gotten away with the xl, as the bottom is loose fitting."
5.0,The dress is beautiful!!!! The pattern is so nice and delicate! I got the grey one and love it!!!
5.0,I look great! Hides the gut and the girls look incredible! Im 5'7 and 140#. I ordered a size 8. Will definitely order other colors!
5.0,The earings look just as good in person as in the pictures.
5.0,These tops are comfortable yet cute.  A number of my gym friends have complimented them and asked where I got them.  Great purchase!!
5.0,love the earrings thanks!
5.0,so sparkly~!
5.0,This in one of my new favorite shirts.  Comfy and washes well.
5.0,"Love these, just as good as my qualo ring!"
5.0,"This has become my everyday watch. I have a smaller wrist and it fits great on the second hole, but it has plenty more so I'm sure this will fit even if you have a thicker wrist. It looks and feels like a much more expensive watch."
5.0,I loved the top. Really sexy and cute
5.0,I bought this for my 2 year old and it fit her perfect. Really cute
5.0,Le encanto a mi hija muy comodo y bonito
5.0,Top quality AAA
5.0,Arrived super early my daughter loves it goes everywhere with her
5.0,"Love this 2-layered top. It is a little shorter than I would have liked stopping just at the waist, but still a great style to wear with a variety of jackets and cardigans."
5.0,Even more beautiful in person. Very elegant. Priced affordability.  Highly recommend.
5.0,Love these. Good fit. Although the cardiac rhythm is not accurate at all haha.
5.0,I absolutely love this dress it fits all my curves. I am very tall yet this dress comes close to my knees which is appropriate for me. I love it. It's a must have.
5.0,love these glasses! I recently bought the floral ones as well because I fell in love with the first pair!
5.0,"Fits great and the material is very soft, so comfortable"
5.0,"Was looking for a new wallet for my boyfriend that had RFID blocking.  This is a good quality wallet. Bigger than I expected. It has everything you need. And area for coins, a large deep  area for cash, and nice areas for your cards that aren't hard to get out. I liked the feel of the leather. It's says I it is a man's wallet but personally I wouldn't mind using it either"
5.0,Fit  is great. Would recommend.
5.0,I have bought them twice because I lose them and find them. It’s a viscous circle :). These glasses are awesome and worth every penny!
5.0,Great looking purse that I received quickly!
5.0,Turned out great. Will definitely buy again.
5.0,"I don't like to buy dresses online because I do NOT have the perfect body, meaning Im not skinny like the model in the picture but since this dress is one that had free returns for prime members I took a change. The dress is very beautiful and its not too tied so it hides body imperfections. I am 5' 3&#34; and the dress fits a little too long but I really loved how it fits so I will keep. The material is NOT cheap, and I love the pretty red one. I think I will biy the black one in the future."
5.0,We have been looking for sweatshirts that fit right and these are fine.
5.0,"The packaging, material, and design of the costumes are super nice given the price! The fabric is stiff enough to help keep its shape but the material is light.  It does get kinda hot and uncomfortable after a while, but this is wayyyyy more comfortable than most other costumes.<br /><br />It's also nice that the costumes are in one piece so it's simple to put on, store, or even pass on to a friend. I would definitely recommend this!"
5.0,Great work out shoe for my cardio
5.0,little brother loved it
5.0,"Halloween costume, well made"
5.0,"So cute, so comfortable. The fabric is a great weight so it's not too thick to wear in Texas summers but still not cheap or transparent. Very true to size. Maybe even a little on the big side."
5.0,"These pants are very well made.  One reviewer said that the first ones she bought were to small and suggested to order a size up.  I did that and they are perfect.  They did not shrink after washing and I suggest using a gentler cycle than regular wash and warm, not hot water. I was extremely pleased with how well made these pants are.  Well worth the money."
5.0,"Super soft and comfortable.  Especially around the arch of my foot.  Shall see how they perform on a five hour flight.  If not so good...well, I still have a really nice pair of socks that make my legs and feet feel terrific !!!"
5.0,"Todo me agrado,  es para un regalo"
5.0,excelent i like
5.0,"Very good made of materials , comfortable,and fit perfectly."
5.0,"i'm 5'0 and about 140 pounds and i went with the medium because i like my stuff to fit a little loose. This fits exactly how I like it to, but if you want it to be more form fitting I'd recommend the small. This robe is extremely soft and it actually stays closed once you put it on. It kept me nice and warm after my shower but not too warm. I will definitely be wearing this year round."
5.0,"For sun protection .,stays in place well ."
5.0,Great grandson loved them!
5.0,Great quality belt definitely looked good while being worn
5.0,Love the stunning red and the length is perfect. Wish the collar was a little more stiff to stay up
5.0,Beautiful scarf....perfect size for wearing it different ways.
5.0,Great value and my kids loved them. I bought 2 weeks ago and they still work!
5.0,Fits as expected. Spandex material.
5.0,"Holds up well for my young B baller, fits good and comfortable."
5.0,"I love pockets. It's hard to find leggings with pockets big enough for a phone and keys. I love these. Bought another pair in a different color. They dont show any wear, yet. I've had them a couple of months."
5.0,Nice looking sweater
5.0,I love love love these earrings!!
5.0,"It’s a rare occasion where socks can actually change your life.  However, all things will become clear when you slip on your pair of Pitfall socks.  I wore these to an interview and got the job the following week.  Was it my experience or were all the interviewees so floored by my sock game that they had no choice but to give me the job over my asking salary?  You tell me."
5.0,Nice Socks.
5.0,Fits well and looks good for gf
5.0,Second Pair of these that I've bought. My dog liked the taste so much I bough him another pair. Better than the other pairs that I've bought.
5.0,"Arrived quickly. Material feels soft and light. Washes great, no shrinkage or pilling. I've been reaching for it in my closet regularly, so that means it looks and feels great on me. I got the medium. The fit is loose. I'm 130 pds and 5'4"" ."
5.0,"What an awesome title this is! The commemorative belt is the way to go if you're not looking to spend replica money. The strap is similar, if not the same as the replica. You cannot change the side plates, but I am completely fine with that. It is plastic but it is glossed over nicely and the buttons and end strap seem like the only thing that is steel based. Overall I am very happy with this title and totally recommend it to anyone in the market looking for titles."
5.0,This is my second item from this brand and I will be buying more. The fabric on this shirt is incredibly soft. It has a nice amount of stretch to it too. Runs true to size. Love it
5.0,Stylish and simple. Love it.
5.0,Nothing says that you are classy and like to party like a tuxedo t-shirt.  I wort this shirt to a wedding reception and it was all I could do to keep the impressed ladies from doing inappropriate things to me right there.  Wear with caution.
5.0,"I ordered a pair of these shorts and after I wore them to one spin class, I immediately ordered another pair.  They are so comfortable.  I love the light weight fabric and yet they still have enough padding to keep me comfortable during class.  These are the best bike shorts I've owned."
5.0,I love the color and details.
5.0,Very cute sundress.  Could wear casually or dressy.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"Lot's of compliments on these things. No problems at all, durable and goes with pretty much everything."
5.0,WoW dress! I can’t tell you how many co<br />Plume ya I get in this dress. I wear size 4<br />34 DD and I’m 5’4. I got this dress in 2 color combo
5.0,"I'm thrilled with this.  It is very lightweight and can be easily rolled up and stuffed into a carryon bag.  I often find myself in situations where my arms get cold inside planes or air conditioned restaurants/museums etc.  We are planning a lenghty trip through Europe in the fall when temperatures can still be quite warm but I'll still need something to fight the chill.  With baggage weight limitations, this is perfect.  It's soft, the sleeves fit my somewhat chunky arms perfectly."
5.0,Love them. I had my script added put in them!<br />Love Love Love them. Great sun coverage.
5.0,Modern boys fit. True to size.
5.0,These are so comfortable. I love these.
5.0,"Got it for my husband, he was in between sizes, so I was worried, but it has great stretch and then some in the waistband. It’s a thinner fabric than expected, but it still looks phenomenal on him. He finds it very comfortable and even wants them in more colors, and I’m all for that lol."
5.0,"The fact that you cut it yourself is awesome! I hate having extra belt or not enough. The latch holds it in place perfectly. I was worried about the release being pressed on accident but after a night at the bar shooting pool, it stayed exactly where I wanted it. I’m gonna order a few more soon"
5.0,Very cute swimsuit.  I like the way it fits. I will use it this summer.
5.0,"This was a gift for my 2 year old, she absolutely loved this shirt. Sizes run a little big but after washing and dryer they fit perfect. Only complaint is the smell when first opening, smells of plastic or maybe packaging but nothing a wash won’t take care of."
5.0,Very stretchy and durable
5.0,Very sexy and fit well
5.0,"I love this dress! It’s super flattering - tight where it should be, looser where you need a little more forgiveness. It’s low cut but doesn’t feel like you’re at risk of falling out of the dress, which is nice! It’s cute and fun."
5.0,Beautiful in person! But beware- the band is HUGE. Most people will have to remove links to wear.
5.0,I'm giving the bathing suit 5 stars because I loved the look. The top was too big(I ordered a 2xl)after reading it ran small. I usually wear an XL. The bottom fit ok. It was just a little big in the front. I suggest following the size chart.
5.0,The person these came from was obviously a heavy smoker. I’ve had to leave the shoes the air out and they still smell like someone blew cigarette smoke into them for a year.  Otherwise they are great.
5.0,Very chic finishing touches for a special event.  I wore them to a semi-formal holiday party.
5.0,Great glasses. I bought them on sale for $20. Well worth it.
5.0,"I really like this skirt. It's junior's sizing so typically, go up one size from whatever you wear in standard women's clothing. I also recommend searching Van's Women's size chart online to compare. The skirt is exactly as I expected. It was well packaged and arrived free of any damages. My only contention is that it rides up my hips and behind but that happens frequently due to my curvy shape."
5.0,"Love it!! I was not sure about how the bag was going to look & feel: wristlets are not meant to be huge! But this is the perfect size and it fits not one, but 2 iPhone 6S Plus!! My ID, credit card, some cash & a lipgloss!"
5.0,"Great ratings, beautiful! I already lost one so I might buy them again."
5.0,Great shirt for the price! Very comfy! Wish there were more colors to pick from
5.0,These were nice quality pants for the price and look great!  Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"This is a good shoe for looks, but I wouldnt recommend it for a running shoe"
5.0,Beautiful pin.  Love it.  Very good quality
5.0,"Love these glasses..they are a bit oversized though...so if you have a small face, I wouldn't purchase."
5.0,"Feels super soft, printing and design are great and size was spot on! Oh and great price ;) I’d say is a definite yes for a Disney fan, birthday mom like me or even for a chill costume."
5.0,"These are SO comfy, fit perfectly, above my expectations! I went a size up because I wanted baggy sweatpants, and with the drawstring, it is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"Absolutely love this necklace. I bought it as a gift for a friend and it is beautiful. Very affordable and looks wonderful in person. I would recommend others to buy this product, specially if you are looking for a gift."
5.0,It's good quality and shipping is quick! :)
5.0,Great. Wearing it next weekend for a wedding I'll be in.
5.0,This product is nice and fits well. Is also great because my gun holster fits on it and I've had some problems finding one that wasn't too wide.
5.0,The leggings are for me. Fits great
5.0,My tween daughter ordered these and absolutely loved them!!!
5.0,I love these. I ordered a pair in red & in black. So cool!
5.0,"Kinda small, but very cool."
5.0,My favorite slides and I will buy them again
5.0,"I’m a busty gal, so I was afraid this would rip as so many have in the past. But so far so good."
5.0,I wasn't going to buy an $80 pair of sunglasses for my kid to use them to their breaking point. That's where these beauties come in. Inexpensive and holding up to a ten year old boy playing baseball.
5.0,Soft and flattering. The burgundy color is rich. Glad I selected it.
5.0,this is my mommy suit! It hides and lifts in all of the right places.
5.0,Good quality at a reasonable price! SUNGAIT backs it products up with an amazing satisfaction guarantee. I will be getting my sunglasses from them from now on.
5.0,I am totally satisfied this company is a class act well built durable I am very impressed
5.0,"Fun tie for little boys (and girls if they'd like). Beautiful bright blue exactly as pictured. The ice cream design adds the perfect touch. The one design change I'd recommend is to make the neck more adjustable. As it is currently, it's loose on a kid with a regular neck."
5.0,"I admired this kimono for a while and finally bought it.  It's a great, versatile piece and looks great with jeans or a dress.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Beautiful, beyond belief!? So much details on each angel!! Like art!"
5.0,Wow I love it didnt expect the fancy little box I am gonna wear this for my wedding Thabk you it is beautiful better than the one I lost.
5.0,Very nice design. Lots of room and durable.
5.0,The shirt looks and feels nice but it’s too short
5.0,This Cardigan is very Beautiful. It is very durable and inexpensive. I didn't dislike anything about it. It was just perfect!
5.0,"I love banded collar shirts, and this one fit me perfectly,, its practically wrinkle free and very light."
5.0,"I ordered a size small for my 14 year old daughter who is 5'6"" 110 lbs. Fits her perfectly and it isn't revealing. She told me this was her favorite bathing suit and that is was comfortable. I have washed it in cold water and I hang it out to dry. She's worn it a bunch of times and the colors haven't faded."
5.0,I like the quality if this jeyring
5.0,"Make sure you measure around your hand according to instructions.  I would have bought a small but after measuring ordered medium size.  Fit perfectly.  Finger length for middle finger is 3.25"" / ring finger is 2.75"".  For me it works perfectly.  Very classy looking and feel durable."
5.0,I love this dress and got so many compliments!!!! The length is perfect!
5.0,I haven't had it for too long but it's a very nice bag for the money and the bivi  it comes with is a nice touch the bag could probably hold a ton of stuff but I'd stay at about 45 - 50 LBS with these straps they are padded to a decent point. The zippers are high quality
5.0,They are long and fit perfect
5.0,"Very cute top! I was worried that it would be too see-through, but it was not a problem."
5.0,"This is the PERFECT tote for the beach. It is sturdy, the handles are long enough for me use on my shoulders, and the pockets hold a lot. Easy to clean, rinse out or just shake sand out. Love it."
5.0,"Fantastic. Great fit, especially if you have an Afro. Like myself, 🙂."
5.0,Love this suit! Very flattering and size medium was true to size.
5.0,"The silicon grip keeps them in place, and they truly are no-show socks. Works even on smaller feet (I'm a size 5-5.5).  Perfect!"
5.0,Nice product and very practical. It is very strong and I use it to transport my laptop and iPad and some additional things (books).
5.0,"Exactly what you need when you're working out in the cold. For is as expected. I'm 5'11"" 200lbs and a large fits me great. Most comfy set I've had yet."
5.0,the pin is really well made i can tell they were not cheaply made they came on time and i am happy i can wear them on a suit if need be
5.0,I love everything about this dress and I got a lot of compliments and I really love getting attention
5.0,These were for my daughter.  She loves them.
5.0,My son bought me these for a gift and I love wearing them.  They are well made and look terrific!!
5.0,Love this! Perfect size. Unique with its 3 pearl colors. I can wear 3 different earrings too with it! Nice quality too
5.0,Excellent shoes but would recommend going up a half size due to the inner lining. I have 3 pairs of these and have no complaints.
5.0,Great! I wore this dress to my graduation and I loved it
5.0,I wear these all the time. I tried other types but these last the longest and glows the best.
5.0,As pictured and super cute!
5.0,"Soft, warm, generous. Very pleased."
5.0,Love this shirt it's comfortable and just like the picture . The fit was also perfect . I got 4 other shirts and they are all great
5.0,It is very thin material however if you where a nude strapless bra you will be fine. Love it!
5.0,The fit was just right. It didn't stick out too far or snag anything. Better quality than piercing rings. I have very sensitive skin. I had no reactions.
5.0,"These are awesome! I need something that helps block ALL light when sleeping but still comfortable enough. These work great, and I love that there are 2 in the pack because I'm always misplacing mine. Also it gives you one to keep at home & one to keep in your suitcase if you travel often. They are made well. I recommend these & would buy them again."
5.0,my husband loves it.  the link removal tool was pretty easy to use.  I was able to do it and not damage the bracelet.  :)  I showed it to several people at work before I gave it to my husband and everybody really liked it.
5.0,"As long as you DEFINITELY size your PattyBoutik shirt by the bust sizes they list, the bust will fit as expected. I adore this shirt. It came in on time, great material quality. No buckles, rips, frays in fabric.<br /><br />The zipper works VERY well (boyfriend tested and approved).  The sleeves are a bit snug, but not bad.<br /><br />This shirt and all the other shirts I've purchased from PattyBoutik seem to be built for tiny women like me with large busts and small waists. If you don't fit that, it may not be the brand for you. I've purchased several shirts from them so far and all have been 10/10 amazing."
5.0,"Love the feel & fit....the fabric is light/semi-sheer, so wear a cute plain or lace cami underneath! I will be ordering this wonderful shirt again! :)"

5.0,"This is a great bikini top for a large chest. I have struggled to find halter tops with underwire for a DDD cup but this top has a layer underneath that hides the underwire.

5.0,"I bought these because they looked so much like Freddie Mercury's sunglasses in Queen's video for 'We Will Rock You'. They are somewhat oversized, but look wonderful and are made very well. I am really happy!"
5.0,I love this top. The material is very nice and the fit is good. I will say it’s a little bit small so it wouldn’t hurt to order a size up if you like things more loose. I only paid $9.90 and I think it is a very nice fall top. I might order the grey one but it’s more expensive. I’ll see after washing how well it holds up.

5.0,took stain out
5.0,Beautifully piece for the price. Only downside was the four weeks it took before I recieved it. But definitely worth the wait.

5.0,How did I ever sew without it? Great for &#34;convincing&#34; thick material to go through my sewing machine.

5.0,"Daily dilemma for me when I'm out of the house... where can I store my mask so it's easy to put back on when I need to?  The answer is this wonderful 7 piece lanyard set featuring every color of the rainbow.  Great if you are into matchy-matchy accessories.  Personally, I'm not so I ended up giving a few away to family and friends.  They all loved it.  The selling point for me was the adjustable back cord.  If the mask straps begin to irritate my ears, I pull the back cord of the lanyard tighter to take the pressure off of my ears.  Super handy to have!"
5.0,"Great sunglasses for men.<br /><br />My son just broke his expensive sunglasses and desperately needed a new pair. When these came in he put them on, and these fit comfortable, and do not slide down his nose.<br />These are a plus being Polarized, and UV protection like his more expensive glasses were.<br /><br />He said the color of these do a better job of protecting his eyes from the sun without having a glare.<br />There light weight, fit good, and are comfortable.<br />For the price very happy."
5.0,Ok I was iffy about this for my little girl but it’s ABSOLUTELY adorable! I bought a little bigger so we can layer under it which will definitely work. I’m so excited for her to wear it out!

5.0,"Beautiful dress, great price.  Very flattering!"
5.0,Shoe look pretty good and fit perfect for my son
5.0,They are really cute. I like the different colors of the septum rings.  They go on easily enough but are little painful putting them on. But it's good because once they are on they stay in place.  I like all the different shapes and designs.  Can't wait to wear them.
5.0,"A nice apron, exactly what was expected when purchased.  Mother-in-law loved it!"
5.0,"I Love these Blue polarized aviator sunglasses!<br />They come in a nice sunglass case with a cleaning cloth, which is a nice added touch!<br />I was not expecting those added in with the shades.<br />The plastic is so soft and smooth when sliding across my face and the blue is a beautiful shade of blue!<br />These fit my head perfect and feel so lightweight and are easy on the eyes!<br />Definitely a great pair to have!! I highly recommend these!!<br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The review I have provided is solely based on my own personal experience. I was not compensated in anyway to write a positive or negative review."
5.0,Daughter loves it.  She says it Stays on well and doesn't slide off constantly like some other slouchy beanies do.

5.0,This was a gift for a 10 year old girl and she really liked it.
5.0,"A friend had a pair that I tried on while visiting and absolutely LOVED them. I was so excited to find a pair for less than half of what my friend paid. They fit incredibly well, look great and are perfectly lightweight for really hot days - you hardly feel them on your face. I would recommend these to anyone."
5.0,This really is an amazing brand for babies!! It washes well and looks practically new still!I do wash my baby clothes on the gentle cycle and dry on low heat. I have had no problems with shrinking or pilling of the fabric. I would highly recommend to anybody who has a winter baby!

5.0,Item exactly as expected. Good quality!
5.0,Muy buenos !!!
5.0,Arrived on time. Very sharp and the blunt end works for “finger pressing”. Maybe just a bit expensive.
5.0,"These boots are wayyyy prettier in person than on the pic, very sparkly!  Absolutely love them but did have to do an exchange for a smaller size, they seem to be made a little big.  Normally I can wear an 8 in boots with thick socks on but need a 7 with these.  Great tread, color, etc!"
5.0,"If there's anything I would want to change, it would be some thicker material around the stomach area to give you that shape in that area. But other than that the fit is really comfortable and it's great for wanting to be comfortable but also having a slip on underneath a  dress. And honestly it's great for summer!"
5.0,Fits  well
5.0,It looks really good.My daughter loves wearing it.

5.0,"I love these socks! I wear leather shoes to work every day and my old socks made my feet feel hot or clammy. I never even think about my feet anymore with these socks. I've purchased bamboo socks before, which I also loved, but these have lasted much longer than the other brand I used to buy (my old sock brand became threadbare rather quickly)."
5.0,"I couldn't ask for a better pair of jeans! They fit perfectly! The price is great and the quality is perfect! They ARE NOT light weight...I like the stretch. The only thing is I wished the legs were a little more tighter! That's not because of the jeans it is because of my legs being thin! They are pretty close to true size, they do run a little big! However, I would highly recommend these!"
5.0,These glasses are too fab for me - but I'm going to figure it out. I love them.
5.0,They were a hit for our valentines! The quality far exceeded the price and worth every penny! The side guards are flexible so it was perfect for kids to play with them! Can’t say enough positives!

5.0,"Cute, I returned it because it was too big.  I did order a smaller size"

5.0,Adorable! Perfect for a day/night at the beach!
5.0,My kids love these. I like that the straps are adjustable so even my 5 year old can wear them. My oldest (11year old) says he likes them because they are soft and he likes the camo design. I highly recommend these!
5.0,I like it anyway
5.0,"I'm not sure if they are for men or not, but I'm a woman and I love them! I have had 3 pairs and will buy them again. The color is perfect the size compliments your face especially if u have bangs.  Buy them you won't be sorry"
5.0,These are now my daughters favorite glasses. LOVE THEM
5.0,"For the price, i couldn't believe how well made the suit was.  I wore it nearly every day on vacation.  Very sturdy and more like a premium product.  I am a full figured woman so the size only  matters part of it, you need the coverage and the better material for it to wear well.  Was very happy with it."

5.0,It's good for the money I suggest metal but I've used this before and if your carfuly it works just as well and is cux a beautiful color. It's a little harsh to use for me personally but I don't. Have the proper ear butter so it's user error there
5.0,"These LiveBox baby girls crochet knit soft sole shoes are adorable.  I bought the pink ones and it is a true baby girl pink.  These shoes have a soft sole with anti slip stars on them.  I bought the 12-18 month size and they fit my granddaughter who is 19 months old well with a little growing room.  The label in the shoe says 'these shoes are not for walking babies', I am not sure what that means.  There is not an arch support but the bottoms are non slip.  The sole is fabric so it would not be good for a rainy day or a wet surface but I think they are okay for walking.  I love these shoes and so does my granddaughter.  They are cute easy to get on and off.  They fit well.  There is a strap across the foot that helps to keep the shoe on. I am very happy with this purchase.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review."

5.0,FITS AS EXPECTED!!! The straps may have to be adjusted based on height.
5.0,THIS IS THE BEST ROBE THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE!! The fact that the ties are attached to the robe makes so much more sense then the ones that pull out! And the sleeves are perfect because they are fitted and you can push them up out of your way. The feel and color are perfect too!

5.0,"These are great everyday, casual wear shorts.  The length and the width of the leg opening work well for me.  I have purchased a half dozen pairs in various shades and they get a lot of wear."

5.0,"These are well made, comfortable, and keeps all the extra cushioning that you are wanting to control for the day in place.  Do follow the sizing chart listed in the info section, I'm glad I did because if I were to go by the sizing that I normally go by these wouldn't have fit at all."
5.0,My husband loves these socks!  He said they’re the most comfortable socks he’s ever had.
5.0,They had a great mechanical advantage and made my shoes fit the way I had hoped to!
5.0,I ordered a small. But after reading reviews and asking if the small will cover D cups I was nervous it would not fit. I just received it and immediately tried it on. It fits absolutely perfect!! I love that it has the lined light padding on the top to hold them in place. The bottom is scrunched and looks great as well. This is the best crochet monokini I've received from Amazon. It's always a gamble when you order online not knowing the quality. I think it's definitely good quality and great fit.
5.0,Best joggers ever!!! These are so comfortable and you will need more than one pair. I own 4 of them now. For reference I’m 123lbs 5f 4” and I went with the small. Very stretchy and soft material.

5.0,They roll down some but I wear them to tone my arms and I keep pulling them back up.
5.0,Seriously surprised by the quality. My husband loved it. It looked like a $50 belt. Has held up well so far too. Buying a different version now.

5.0,"A workout to get them on, but my achey loose joints felt amazing while they were on"
5.0,"Absolutely the best design and style I have seen. Work perfectly, good quality, and interesting design. Lots of complements, such that I am tired of everyone asking to handle them and getting fingerprints on the lenses. Do not let idiots handle them, I have had to yell stop!<br />Basically, go for it.

5.0,"The old stories and traditions have multiple layers of meaning.  Varg looks at the information that is available about the cycle of the seasons and the cycle of human life and rebirth, and explores the Ragnarök story in that context.  In doing so, he maps out a coherent, integrated model for the old religion.<br /><br />I am not sure that all of his premises and assumptions are completely accurate, but they work.  &#34;Accuracy&#34; is perhaps a misleading concept anyway, because the practices of Eiríkr Þorvaldsson at Brattahlíð may have varied quite a bit from those of Hengest Wictgilsson, for example.  What matters are the underlying values and beliefs.  Varg has clearly done a lot of thinking about how the pieces fit together, and has produced a working model for the core mysteries.  There are writers who go into specific aspects of the old religion in more depth and specificity, citing source material in a detailed way.  Varg takes a different approach, and does the heavy thinking required to put it all together so that the reader can get a sense for how the religion might have functioned.<br /><br />Varg seems to spend a lot of time in nature, and appears to be strongly motivated by a sense of family and tradition.  One gets the sense that by living on the margins of modern European culture, he is better able than most to conceptualize the spiritual needs of our forebears, and connect what is left of the lore to these needs.  I guarantee that once you read this book, you will never think about the old religion in quite the same way again.<br /><br />A final note - I appreciated the rugged binding and paper of this paperback.  This is a tough little book that one can stick in a jacket pocket, and pull out and read when the moment is right.  An excellent formatting choice."
5.0,For the money this Is a really good watch. The small chrono dials work like way more expensive watches. At this price point they are usually just for show. Band is real leather and is decent quality. I will be buying more from this company.
5.0,I've had this for months and haven't seen any discoloration or had any problems with it. I still get compliments on it.
5.0,I like that there are three and they are good looking....
5.0,Beautiful! Fits nicely and does NOT look cheap
5.0,I like that they are not soft and squishy like a lot of strings are.
5.0,I ordered another pair because I love them so much. Received the order today and they came without a wrapper and tags? I feel like a li got a used pair of sunglasses. I would like another sent.

5.0,Love Saucony shoes.  They are so comfortalbe.
5.0,The color is actually more of a dusty pink and it fits perfectly. I am 5'2 and wear a medium for tops.
5.0,"These leggings are a tiny bit tight compared to other size large leggings I have.... I have curvy hips and a very narrow waist, size 10 pants 5'6&#34;. The large fits well, but I could almost have gotten XL. If you have a little tummy, I would recommend the next size up. These do feel AMAZING and they don't stretch out and get saggy!!!!! They are the BEST quality I have ever worn, thick but not hot... And no underwear lines or visible cellulite through the fabric! They are very figure flattering and shaping. I almost would wear these to the gym because of the great firming effect! The waist is smoothing (about 2&#34; above belly button) and I don't get any weird muffin top lines on top of my hips/waist at all. Also, they don't cut into the skin on my calves. DEFINITELY buying more!!!!"
5.0,just break them in and your good to go ! true fit to size!
5.0,Bought this for my son who attends Rutgers. He loves it!!

5.0,"I’m 5’3” 125# and ordered a M.  I was leery about ordering this shirt since it seemed the pictures advertised might be from a different site, however, I was pleasantly surprised!  It is sewn cuffed, which I like so I don’t have to keep re-cuffing them to a better length.  The shirt is soft and fits great."
5.0,My nephew loved these as they are comfortable and he lovesMinecraft.
5.0,The dress is very comfortable and figure flattering.
5.0,"I think if you’re average height or not long-waisted, you’ll love it.  If you’re 5’8”, maybe not so much.  It snags up easily, but such as sweaters with larger loom, right? Otherwise, totally love it and I just wear a tank top under it. I got the blue and it’s a nice baby blue color."
5.0,Great organizer.plenty of pockets for various items.
5.0,"The belt is very attractive, and seemingly well constructed. I like the fact that the 38&#34; belt is perfectly sized for the middle hole. Good thinking!"

I wear a medium in this shirt.  Worth getting, just know it’s really a man’s shirt. I ordered several colors for my husband and they’re well made and look terrific on him."
5.0,Not sure if it works well at all yet...  Just gave as a Father's Day gift!<br />Great idea!  Hope it works as a repellent!

5.0,Love this band.  Easy to put on and take off and looks great. I had a little bit of a problem with the tool that came with it to remove links so I did have to use a gadget I had to remove some of the links.  Really dresses up my Fitbit and I've had lots of compliment on how nice it looks.
5.0,"Convenient and nice looking hanging in the kitchen filled with Onions, Shallots, and Garlic."
5.0,Purchased these as a stocking stuffer for my son who is a HUGE fan of Kobe Bryant and Lebron James…. And he loves them!

This bag has such a good quality feel to it. I love that I can wear it as a cross body and at the same time carry it and take the weight off my shoulder. I like this bag so much that  I ordered another.  To me, Tignanello makes the best quality bags at a more affordable price."
5.0,loove

5.0,5'10&#34; daughter loves these!!!
5.0,"It is beautiful, that is BIG but it is beautiful, the fabric is a little hard, but it can be used, again it is great but it is the intention, if you are size L maybe you can value M, that if you must take into account the length of the sleeves. The length is approximated at the knee level at the front and logically behind it is longer.<br /><br />Perfectly can be used without lycra or pant underneath. Keep in mind that the bags can be a little small and you can feel them very high."
5.0,"Busty women rejoice!!!  This is the perfect layering option for those &#34;NSFW&#34; tops.  So much cheaper than buying a camisole-bra; and less cumbersome than wearing a tank under those v-neck tops and dresses. Now, it does seem to run small.  I wear a 38DD and ordered a 2XL which is a perfect fit."
5.0,Love it the frames look very rich!! Fast shipping also

5.0,Beautiful dress. Fits my granddaughter perfectly.
5.0,"Material is thick and has a spandex polyester feel to it. The sides come up quite a bit. Overall I like the top, it does run small."

I pair it with a belt, leggings & knee high boots. Color & material has held up after many washes. Had a stain on the back that came out in 1 wash. Many compliments, highly recommend."

5.0,"Ordered this dress for a havana nights themed party and I received so many compliments.  It was so comfortable too.  I used the size calculator and it put me in between sizes.  It stated for a tighter fit to use the smaller size, so i did.  I thought it might be snug, but it was not.  Great purchase with a great price!"

5.0,I love these beanies they loos so cute on my little fella and are so soft a d warm!
5.0,"The sewing is very well done on this shirt and a lot of attention was given to details.  The material is very good quality too and it's a very attractive men's shirt.  Hubs likes it a lot but will probably not wear it with the sleeves rolled up.  I washed it in the regular cycle and it came out of the dryer crisp, but will still need some ironing.  This shirt makes for a great dress or casual shirt. Also, it's not orange but a very soft pink/red."

5.0,"I love this dress but could have gotten a Med. Rather that a large. It’s very forgiving for any type figure. I also bought a black bow  cinch belt on Amazon which I also love and I wear it with the dress. I am 5’3 147 and I know I will be  comfortable in it all night at my granddaughter’s wedding. I did have to hem it, took off 3” because I wanted the toes of my baby doll black  suede heels to show."

5.0,Have preset 3 because I wear them all the time. Great gym/yoga cover up and also wear lounging before bed.

5.0,"Very pretty, soft and fits great!"
5.0,The masks are comfortable and nice material. Husband like them.
5.0,"This is a really pretty metal lanyard.  The alligator clips seem to stay better than lanyards with loops.  My glasses are much thicker at the hinge, so I have to fasten the clips an inch or two further back than I prefer."
5.0,"Dress is comfortable, colors are bright, and the fit is very good! I was worried because I am short. I got size Large and it comes to my knee, not too long which is fine. I ordered 3, each fit the same. I am happy!"

5.0,Loved it! All my co-workers wanted the same thing for themselves! Fits so good and comfortable on an 8 hour work shift! Bought more for myself 🤣😎
5.0,This ring is beautiful and very high quality!
5.0,"These bright earrings were perfect, flawless looking ""diamonds"".  Whenever my wife wears these earrings out you can tell that people looking at them are wondering how did I ever afford such perfect stones.  My wife has never had any problems with an infection in her ears.  She is a natural blue, eyed blond, so I know she has sensitive skin.  These earrings look beautiful on my wife.  I would recommend these earrings to a friend."
5.0,Husband wears this to work under his work jacket to keep warm on those very cold days we get here in Northern Illinois. And for those not  too cold days he has worn it alone. I hear nothing but thanks for getting it for him.
5.0,This sunglass works well on the driving and in normal occasions. Package including a test card so you can test that they are truly polarizing.
5.0,"Gorgeous, black and classy. I'm short, so had to have it hemmed a bit, but worth it."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:39152f9fefbcc1465e443bb14b01706c]] I received this for free in exchange for my review:<br /><br />This is an excellent belt.  If you're in the market for one and you like this style just buy it already.  I normally wear a size 32&#34; belt so I just cut off 10&#34; and it fits me perfectly.  I was a dummy and cut off part of the wrong end but it still works fine.<br /><br />I love the ratchet system since it allows me to the belt EXACTLY the way I like it. With traditional belts one hole is too tight and the next biggest one ends up being a little too big, which is annoying.  This belt clicks in small increments to get the perfect fit.  It's also very easy to take it off.<br /><br />The belt itself is durable, comfortable, good looking, and of good quality.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,"I love these sweatshirts.  I bought one a few years back for my daughter.  I think she's owned it and heavily wore it now for 3 years.  However, it has no holes despite daily wear 7 months out of the year and many, many washings and dryings.  I bought this current sweatshirt for my second child.  He's 13 years old and though a Men's Medium fits him a little large, with a wash and dry and given how quickly boys grow at this age, I think it looks great on him.  Besides, boys wear tops somewhat large.  The color is rich and the fabric is very hearty and soft.  Perfect and at a great price!  Better than even old navy."
5.0,Great sweater for a cold weather to ware to school.
5.0,Beautiful color comfortable fit they fill worth more than I paid for them great deal
5.0,Great nose studs
5.0,"Got these for Halloween this year inside. They were colorful and cute, they fit the 12 year old up to adults but was loose on my 8 year old."
5.0,"Easy to put on, great support, looks great. Will buy again."
5.0,"Round neck is perfect, not too tight or low. Slimming, but not too tight or loose. The green is a great color!"
5.0,"Urban came through again. I ordered this a couple of days ago and it was delivered in record time. I love this cross it's got a little weight to it but it's ok. The cross is very detailed and I like the stone, very cool looking. The chains ok but, look for a better one, I think mine is the j style chain, anyway you will be happy about this buy it's awesome."
5.0,Super cute high quality earrings! Got lots of compliments at work on them!!
5.0,"Simple, delicate, absolutely beautiful! I'm in love!"
5.0,"Excellent quality.  I wear vibram Five Fingers daily, but in the fall and winter, wearing them without socks is a problem - they are just too thin and cold.  These socks solve that issue and are perfect.  They are not too thin, not too thick and hold up well for daily wear.  They also work well for wearing with regular shoes or boots."
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress and made with quality.  The material is quality and the sequins seem securely attached.  Unfortunately you need to carefully read the size charts and will likely need to go up a couple of sizes.  The cups in the dress are not sufficient to keep the girls uplifted and in place, because they were too big, but hopefully a custom size would alleviate that problem.  I was testing it out for my daughter's wedding in February to see if I like it.  I will likely order a custom size, but I was dismayed to learn that I had to pay return postage, when the original post offered free returns.  The supplier was very good about staying in touch with me every step of the way and pushed to have me keep a dress that did not fit (he did offer a slight discount)."
5.0,My daughter loved them !
5.0,They fit perfect with my o bag.
5.0,Buena calidad no se oxida
5.0,"I love this sweater.  It’s exactly what I wanted, well made for the price."

5.0,I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SUMMER WHEN I GO OUT FOR DINNER OR ANY WHERE WITH AIR CONDITIONING.
5.0,This was the cutest outfit and great quality for the price! I got so many compliments on it when I dressed my 12 month old in it on her birthday. I went one size down due to the reviews and it worked out perfectly as it does run a little big.
5.0,Got this for my trip to bali and it worked out perfectly.
5.0,This was the perfect vacation bag! I got the smaller size and highly recommend it if you’re only looking to bring a few things to the beach or pool. Definitely a must buy and the price can’t be beat!
5.0,I bought this for my Husband and He loves it.
5.0,Pretty color<br />Fits perfect
5.0,"I love them! Great shape, great fit for my face.  My wife agrees they make me look like a million bucks.  They are comfortable to wear for long periods and don't feel cheap.  My only complaint is that the rubber earpiece came off on one of the ears, a quick dab of glue fixed that and now I've had no problems."
5.0,"i seriously dislike shopping for sports bras. they never fit right no matter how you measure yourself. and, once i get them on, practically dislocate my shoulders taking them back off. I bought these bras based on the many positive reviews and glad I did. They are super soft and comfortable and the bottom band goes down far enough to NOT get curled up by the upper tummy roll i am attempting to get rid of. It stays in place all day and the BEST part is they are stretchy enough to not dislocate my shoulders trying to get them off. The day after I wore one of these to the gym, i wore one of my older sport bras. When it came time to take that one off i gave up and cut it off my body knowing i had these to wear now. I am going to purchase more!"
5.0,"lovee it. fits over 30inch box braids. stays all night, well made, and really cute"
5.0,"This shirt is totally adorable. Logo is the correct size. The sizing is also true. I’m usually a size 18 and went with xxl. Fits comfortably and was able to knot it. The T-shirt is the Gildan brand so it is nice quality, not too thin. The vendor delivered quickly, just in time to wear to my bffs baby shower (ordered Thursday delivered Saturday morning). Worth every penny, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!"
5.0,"Is perfect, thank you"
5.0,This is a great hat! I wear it every day!
5.0,Cute! They fit perfectly on me and look exactly like the photo!
5.0,"Great glasses for kids. Son has crystal blue eyes and is extremely sensitive when out in the sun. These give him enough protection to where he can walk outside without a worry, while looking super stylish. Carrying case is great for being a soft case. Has some rigidity to it, and is soft lined on the inside."
5.0,LOVE IT!!! THEY ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE AND CUTE.
5.0,Cant say enough good things about these. I wear them all the time. I followed other reviews on how to place them to avoid slipping. They stay in place and no more chaffing.

5.0,Very good quality. Fits perfectly my size. No complaints
5.0,"I have long thick hair, and this cap captures my hair and hold it in place out of the way while I work."
5.0,Love this shirt. The quality is amazing. Similar to something you'd find in Macy's or forever 21 for 25+ dollars. I usually wear a small in tops but I ordered a large based on the sizing chart and other reviews. You can dress this up or wear it casually. Would recommend. The sleeves fit me like a 3/4 sleeve shirt. But I have really long arms. So yea
5.0,I bought this as my husband's wedding ring because gold would not stand a chance the way he abuses his jewelry.  This has held up beautifully- no scratches or marks whatsoever!  My husband loves it!
5.0,Love these boots! Nice quality and fit!
5.0,"Lightweight, adequate coverage and pretty."
5.0,Very well made has some nice stretch to it size is true .  Also bought the matching mom socks and I love them.  Would highly recommend
5.0,"These earrings match a charm I have on a Pandora bracelet. I love them, but they could be a little larger so you can notice the detail of the stones on the tree better."
5.0,Esta perfecta.
5.0,Son really likes it!<br /><br />It matches a lot of different things and is not too flashy.
5.0,"I love this! Bought it for myself, it’s exactly as pictured and I get so many compliments on it!"
5.0,"I’ve worn these gloves for over a year now; they’ve loosened a bit which is fine as were snugger than expected for the size I ordered. But, I get compliments on them - they are very nice looking and the packaging was so nice...worthy of impressive gift-giving. Very pleased with these gloves."
5.0,Fits true to size and is comfortable. Also has a nice length.
5.0,"So far, I like my purse hook.  It is heavy duty without looking industrial.  I leave it attached to my purse and it is so easy to use.  It doesn't look odd to have it there."
5.0,"Fantastic backpack, fantastic seller. Even tossed in a mini hiking speaker. 100% will buy from again."
5.0,Well made and definitely used on my last few days on the road.  Convenient zipper placement and good storage.
5.0,"I love this band!  It's really comfortable, easy to change and easy to fasten.  I do change my band a fair amount, but I haven't noticed any fading that other consumers have mentioned. I may spring for another color ;^)"
5.0,These piercings worked great. I needed non-metal for surgery and these fit the bill and also look great with the little bit of sparkle they have.
5.0,"Nice and warm and didn't experience any shrinkage from washing and drying. It is big so you can pull it all the way down over your ears. But if not, there is excess on top of your head."
5.0,Good set of sunglasses to wear over prescription glasses. Not as dark as some but work well for driving. These work inside the car while driving unlike chromatics.
5.0,Wings were much nicer than I thought they would be !  They will be great for my granddaughter to use for quite a while.  She is 4.
5.0,"I love these purses, I have a few different ones, and I love that they are large, and hold up great. Perfect for a gal who has to carry a lot of things. And it fits my 13 inch computer, or my tablet with ease."
5.0,Great pack. Better quality than expected. The layout is nice. The only con I have with this pack is that the straps are fixed. I would prefer a removable strap as those for me are the first part to wear out. Didnt rate the durability because it has to take a summer hiking first. Hopeful on this one thogh.
5.0,This dress is super cute and was just Luke the picture
5.0,Good product<br />Extremely comfortable and just as pictured<br />The material is soft<br />Would recommend it
5.0,"Material and style is very comfy, but shows lots of cleavage. My favorite part is that the front has two layers, which is best with the ruching for optimal belly flatter."
5.0,Very pretty stones and looks just like the picture. Very satisfied and a great price!
5.0,This was a great fitting comfortable yet stylish romper. I loved it! Highly recommend!
5.0,"Best joggers I have bought all time. True to size, very soft and the color is perfect. Normal wear a medium but order a small, they fit perfectly."
5.0,Bought for a concert but continued using after! Fits all the essentials!
5.0,Good quality and just like the picture. I bought these for my daughters for the beginning of gator season and they did not disappoint. If they offer more of them online I will buy more of them for myself and my mom and my cousins! Go Gators!
5.0,"Nice, very nice considering price"
5.0,Very.... very happy. Thank you:)
5.0,Yes they are beautiful. Perfect size
5.0,"My son LOVES IT. I got it for him for Christmas and it's still in excellent condition.<br />It's well made, the patches are sewn on very well.<br />The sizes are only 1 size smaller. So if you wear Small get Medium, and so on...."
5.0,As described but don’t shower with it
5.0,Smaller than my last rfid wallet.  holds everything nicely - even change
5.0,This watch is a nice smaller size and looks nice.  It keeps perfect time when worn  or wound up!
5.0,"The shoes not only look good, they are comfortable as can be. I love em."
5.0,BEST SOCKS EVER. I walk a lot for work. Mine are over a year old and still look and feel brand new. I actually buy shirts to match these socks not the other way around. I will never stray.
5.0,Super comfortable and good looking shirt!  Standard American sizing.  We ended up buying two more for gifts.
5.0,"Love them!  Fun and easy to transport to any shopping experience, they easily fit in my pocket!"
5.0,Husband said he liked it. It looked well made and looked nice on him. He said something about the bronco being the old version and not the new but he still liked it.
5.0,This bracelet is so cute and super easy to pur on. It was a gift for my sister this Christmas and she loved it!
5.0,"Very soft and flexible, not stiff at all, and waterproof enough to last me the day!"
5.0,Last-minute purchase came in the mail fit to the T we needed a bigger size good quality
5.0,This item works great and is sturdy enough for small to medium loads.<br />The ring is a bit bulky compared to most steel ones out there but it also seems to work well.
5.0,small and perfect!!!
5.0,Comfy and cool on your feet.  Cushioned and great to walk in
5.0,"The quality is great, breathable and does not itch while at the gym. Dries quickly. If you stand 5'8 and weigh around 165-170lbs and would like yours to be a bit snug, small will be perfect for you."
5.0,"I loved the color and thick, soft fabric, however it was a snug fit as a plus sized woman. All things considered I think it's beautiful."
5.0,"I love these, bought a pair after purchasing a pair of 6g plugs (wooden) and almost always you get one that's either small or large.  These both came in the exact size for 6g plugs!  Wooden plugs are nice to keep out the funk, but I'd rather have these any day!"
5.0,I’m really happy with it great product
5.0,"Plastic is flexible and clear.  Good value,  and I have recommended them to many  others"
5.0,It's so beautiful. I hope it can be cheaper.
5.0,"Now this dress is a bargain. It is pretty, comfortable and fits perfectly. I just throw a pretty scarf around my neck and I am good to go! It washes well and if you hang it right away, the wrinkles fall out. The material is very nice and has a nice weight."
5.0,"This is a console code to download the game from the Xbox store. Great game, great price."
5.0,I love that this company uses genuine stones. Classy and sophisticated. I got one for myself and will give in to a friend! Great buy!
5.0,Daughter loves it. Since it is fleece lined it is not &#34;itchy&#34; as all other hats were
5.0,"I was expecting just a cute, comfy sweater for the LA winter and I got so much more. Its the perfect bagginess to be slouchy/comfy as a robe or over workout clothes to and from anywhere and looks dressy enough over dresses for a chilly commute or in a cold office. I’m 5”1 and a size 4-6, it fits me and a range of significantly taller friends.<br /><br />10/10 if you need a good sweater for the winter season, this is one to consider."
5.0,This kimono bath is perfect!
5.0,These look good and feel good. I enjoy the colors on the lens.
5.0,"I have seen a lot of negative feedback regarding this shirt but I actually love it. its somewhat loose fit but very comfortable and super cute with jeans and boots. Its not too hot to wear in the summer, its kind of thin but I just wear and undershirt with it and it looks great."
5.0,I have 3 paris and Love it perfect ! Will order more soon or later.
5.0,"Shipped fast and arrived in great condition.  The watch keeps great time and the quality of the bracelet, case, and crystal exceeds expectations. I've been wearing this watch for a couple of months now and I'm still impressed with its quality.  It's only water resistant to 3ATM, so it's not really safe to immerse fully on your wrist (don't hand wash dishes with it) - but other than that, it's a terrific value."
5.0,love it.... it’s so me
5.0,Awesome. Helps cut the wind
5.0,The necklace<br />Was very pretty<br />Good length<br />Doesn’t turn green etc<br />Sturdy<br />Durable
5.0,"Heavier and sturdier than expected. Nice material and you can easily remove dividers or change the top one. Good size, but huge rings will not fit standing up but work fine laying. Happy with it!"
5.0,"Soft, comfortable and easy to wear."
5.0,Received a nice variety. Each was different. A good pick!  I added a bead to the end of the chain to the one I kept and gave the rest out as gifts.
5.0,There was a small issue with my order and the company corrected it right away. Love these bands!
5.0,Love wearing my new pendant!! Fits perfectly on my necklace! It would be a great gift!!

5.0,"I am 5 foot, 135 lbs and I got a medium. I have bigger boobs so it’s a little snug there but not TOO tight. I love this dress. I am wearing to my college graduation! It’s not bad quality either, jersey like matierial."
5.0,I bought it for a friend he loves it.
5.0,love this purse. very good quality love the color. I get lots of compliments
5.0,Beautiful necklace and great packaging.
5.0,using as shower slippers. quite comfortable. can go long time wearing these too
5.0,Socks are very soft and well made but they are very tight around my ankles.  I still wear because are so soft on my feet and wash well.

5.0,Absolutely love this wallet. Holds everything. I get compliments every week on it.

5.0,Quick service and arrived on time.  Fits my glasses nicely and does the job intended.  I would and will buy another again.
5.0,"Seems like a small thing,but when you need a couple of these, WHERE do you get them? Seems like no stores sell them anymore, and the ones that come in your purse/wallet don't last forever! These are good quality, came, quickly and saved me driving to any more stores, wasting time looking for them! Well worth it"
5.0,"I bought these to use with my walker and my wheel chair, very comfortable, good grip, easy to put on and take off"
5.0,"Very sturdy and durable. Matches my switch lite case!! I love the colors, fits all my insurance cards. Got my value for my money!"

5.0,The shirt fits according to the size and is very comfortable.
5.0,My husband says this is the best belt for his holster. And previous belts appear to last forever. This is just another color for his wardrobe.
5.0,Had for a bit now and it fits just like day one. Very comfy and doesn’t stretch or stain.
5.0,"Just got this in today and I absolutely it!!! The color, quality and fit is great. I will be ordering it in all colors. What a great buy!!!"
5.0,Adorable. I love it. It came in a sparkly diamond shape box. I haven't worn it yet. It says 925...I might have to get a thicker chain for it. Other than that it's perfect and beautiful.
5.0,"Soft and comfortable, yet cute and feminine. The pockets are fantastic!"
5.0,I love these earrings.  They are nice and light.  Doesn't pull your ear lobe down at all.  I've worn them a couple of times and have recieved compliments.  I think the price is fine for this product.  After Christmas I'm ordering the silver one.
5.0,"Love this dress!! I love the style, the print is really cute and the length is perfect! Really comfortable. It's a tad lose around my waist and chest, but not enough that anyone would really notice. I am 5'6, 128lbs, 34D and I ordered the Small. I don't recall if XS was an option, but I would probably go for that next time I order."
5.0,perfect and good quality. love the design. fits good. thank you
5.0,Nice & super as a gift.
5.0,It is a nice looking bag. I bought it as a gift.
5.0,The watch looks very luxury with beautiful fancy band lock. The moving gear star on the dial makes watch look like over $1000s lux. watch. Any man can compliment the watch with gold or silver cufflinks that can match any man's outfit.
5.0,"In shoes I normally wear size 8.5 to 9. I've bought the Tavi Noir Barre Socks in size small and also size medium, and I have to say the size small has a much better fit. Size medium left me with extra fabric in the heel because they're too long for my size 8.5 feet. Size small fits so much better and they don't get stretched out. I keep buying these socks because they're the best ones I've found so far!!"
5.0,Just bashful
5.0,"Got this as a stocking stuffer for a 1990 Integra driver, and they loved it! The blue color matched the accent colors of their car perfectly."
5.0,Very nice well made belt. I cut it a little short so start longer and you can modify from there.
5.0,"I love this set I ordered two and they are both amazing. I do have to say the bottoms are a bit bigger than the top it also feels much thinner. There is not a lot of compression for the shorts but I don’t mind; they were really comfortable. I got a large, I’m usually a medium so maybe that is why the shorts were a bit big and the bra is adjustable which is great. Will most likely order more."
5.0,"love the color, fit and style."
5.0,Nicer in real life
5.0,"Love these! Usually exactly an 9.5, bought a 9. Glad I did! Fit well with a little room for thick socks in the winter."
5.0,"Comfy socks, nicely done and really like the themed design."
5.0,Looks great! Spacious. Wet/dry sections are a plus.  Compartment for shoes have enough space depending on shoes size for 1-2 shoes.
5.0,Best nose ring I have had in a long time perfect fit I would order again
5.0,I LOVE these jeans.
5.0,"I was really surprised by how nice these are!! They are comfortable and also do a good job at lifting the girls and keeping them in place. I’m usually a 34C in bra size, and I bought a Medium. Definitely would buy these again or in other colors."
5.0,I love these! great for working out and they stay in place! Cute designs as well
5.0,"Bought these for my niece who is a fan, they were such a hit! Good quality and they line up when you align them in front while wearing them."

5.0,These were a birthday gift for my daughter. She loves them!

5.0,Much better than expected

5.0,My son seems happy with it.  He's very active and it has not shown any signs of wear and tear.
5.0,My daughter is over the moon wearing her brand new sneakers made her so proud. We talked and agreed to only turn the lights on while on the bus and while in gym class. Checked with her teacher and she was being an angel the entire day.
5.0,"Works great!! looks very cool!! I wear it almost every day, it doesn't look like a cheap watch  jajaja XD"
5.0,These were so pretty and great gift ideas.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:4059de27e35d7393a3f17b3b3ca469f8]] I actually use this for my keys+ cards for when I go out with the kiddos! It's a lifesaver on play dates:) no more worrying about leaving my cards/cash in the stroller/car= more present mama🙌🏼
5.0,Keychain was just what I wanted. Thank you.
5.0,Necklaces
5.0,Image a little fuzzy but you can still tell what it is and it looks great.
5.0,Beautiful earrings. Stones don't seem to charge well under artificial light.
5.0,"The description says it's for 14"" laptops but I've been able to use fit my 15.6"" HP Spectre. I wouldn't go any larger though.<br /><br />The materials are high quality. The canvas and lining have held up to daily use for several weeks, despite a larger than recommended laptop being used. The stitching on the decorative leather is sturdy. I'll admit that I've grabbed the bag from the backseat by the decorative loops a few times when I couldn't reach the handles.<br /><br />The handles themselves are nice and large; they're big enough for me to loop over my arm like a purse when my hands are full. The messenger bag strap has enough padding to be comfortable and is what I find myself most commonly using. When not attached, it fits in the back pouch with the backpack straps and isn't really noticeable.<br /><br />The backpack setting itself is something I'm likely to use rarely. It's even surprisingly comfortable considering, but it's worth noting the pockets in the front large pouch aren't zippered so anything in those is probably going to fall out. Every time you put the backpack on, that front pocket can become a disorganized mess.<br /><br />One last thing worth noting, the two front-most pockets have very small openings. I have small hands and had trouble getting my fingers in to get things out. Someone with normal sized hands could potentially have much more trouble."
5.0,"This tie was perfect for my son to dress up like Harry Potter. For the price, can't beat it."
5.0,"Love this wallet!! Been needing a new one for a while, and this one was a definite upgrade!!"
5.0,perfect overnight bag
5.0,"Great readers - keep a pair in my purse, nightstand, car, desk -- love them!"
5.0,I've got multiple colors now these are my favorite dresses !
5.0,Bought for postpartum photos. My chest was large from nursing but the dress held up LOL buttons are functional and the fit was so flattering.<br />Highly recommend
5.0,Fit perfectly on my face and very comfortable. So light...cab barely feel them on my face.
5.0,Got this as a gift for my husband. It's so funny
5.0,"I love this soft, beautiful top, but it doesn't fit to size. Many clothing items bought online in general are labeled wrongly and are much smaller than stated. That's the only reason I've ever had to return an item. :)"
5.0,Loved his dress! Perfect for my two year old! She is tall and skinny so the dress was just a tad bit wide but not too bad. She normally fits 18 month shirts and 2T pants for the length and this was perfect.
5.0,Very pretty earrings. Quite small but really nice. Bought them as a gift to match an elephant necklace and they were perfect. My friend loved them
5.0,These are absolutely so adorable.  Perfect size for an adult.  They would be too big for a little girl.  They are very shiny and blingy.  Very happy I purchased them.
5.0,"These are probably THE most comfortable pants I own. They are soft, durable and warm. I love all the zippers as I plan to wear them walking and hiking. I love them so much I have ordered a second pair."
5.0,Everyone loves my Pug socks :D
5.0,My daughter love it. Used as charm on her bracelet
5.0,I bought this shirt and others with bee messages on them for my daughter who sells Mason bee houses.  Great way to advertise and they are very cute and she gets lots of comments on them and she is able to tell people the importance of Mason bees to our environment
5.0,I loved the fit and it was high quality material. Fit as expected. Fabrics feel really nice! Highly recommend!
5.0,Great comfy shorts. I wear them almost daily.
5.0,"Very pretty, size is real."
5.0,"Bought some for my whole family and they work for all of our foot ​type. Falling arch, flat feet, and husband stands all day in work boots. Definitelyrecommend. Love these!"
5.0,Love them fits perfect and very comfortable
5.0,Christmas present 🎁<br />Not opened yet
5.0,Was a good bit larger but wasn’t a problem because the draw string will pull tight and keep pants on. The shirt works out well and gives him more time to wear. This is one of his favorite outfits!
5.0,"Beautiful, true to size, and really happy to find the 12 in length which is nearly impossible. Looks expensive and got lots of compliments 1st day wearing it. Don't know how it will hold up but first impression is A+"
5.0,Light weight and durable
5.0,It was just like the picture size was well and it was very comfortable
5.0,Good old trusty!
5.0,Beat buy ever!!! Hangs well and feels nice!!!
5.0,These fit very well and the fabric is nice. Well made. Instantly became my husband’s favorite shorts.
5.0,"Great price! Great fit! Love it! Not too thick, not too thin."
5.0,"So comfortable. Like wearing sweats, easy to dress up if needed."
5.0,My wife  loves  it.
5.0,"This bathing suit is very nice. It looks great and I love how different it is. It covers the important areas very well and I feel comfortable in it. I have had a few compliments on this bathing suit. It is different and not like others I have seen or worn. The design on this crochet bathing suit is very intricate and beautiful. It is so different and I love that! I love the side the most, how they swoop in and then the ties add a bit of flair. I am a little worried about it getting snagged and tearing. But I just make sure I wear this bathing suit when I know I will not have anything around wher I will snag. Or I am not doing anything strenuous besides swimming.<br />I really like this bathing suit and would suggest it to friends and family.<br />I received this suit for a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!  I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter!!
5.0,This product is exactly as expected.
5.0,These shirts are so comfortable! I have 5 of these shirts in different colors and I wear them to work almost daily with leggings and different types of shoes.
5.0,Loveeeeeeee it. So cute. Looks more expensive that it is. Great birthday gift for my friend.
5.0,Good quality and great value. As nice as original 250 dollar band!
5.0,"I like them! Very comfortable as house slippers. I don't plan to wear them outside of the house at all, so can't tell if it's durable enough for outdoors."
5.0,"I originally ordered these gloves in size 7 but they were pretty tight. I returned them and ordered the next size up, 7.5, and the fit is perfect. I really like these gloves. They are warm, and flexible. The stitching is well done and I do believe these will wear well. I like them for driving and they grip the steering wheel well. I don't text or email with gloves on so I can't say if they work well that way but it doesn't matter for me. Best of all, they look great and the price is right. I might buy another pair because I do tend to lose gloves no matter how hard I try."
5.0,Great Value/Expensive look
5.0,"Love it exactly what I was looking for , except I do have to say it's summer time and this top is hot . I think it will be perfect during winter under a jacket ."
5.0,"These fit perfect. I am a size 14/16 in pants and got the 2XL. I love the rips in them, especially the one on the back, it's perfectly placed. The two larger rips in the front can show your panties if you aren't careful. I realized after taking the pictures that the pockets weren't pushed in which will cover up majority of the larger rips. Aesthetically, they are the perfect length, but I just know when i walk my thighs will cause them to rise and will rub together. Nothing i am not used to. Overall, 10/10. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,True to size. Was PERFECT for my daughters bday and after. Washed well. Wears well
5.0,"It’s light, which is very nice."
5.0,"Leather is soft, but sturdy, good stitching, good fit. No lining gives you the dexterity to pick up smaller things easily while still wearing the gloves. Not great after it gets down to about 10 degrees, but to that point they keep your hands nice and warm. Snaps at the wrist are a good touch."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. She asked for work out clothes, and she likes it."
5.0,"Super cute, just like the picture."
5.0,Heeding to size advisories from other reviews (order larger than your actual size) I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Shipping was fast received sooner than expected that's always great. I will definitely be getting more colors!
5.0,"Super comfy and breezy! I am 5 &quot;7 and was worried it would be too short and look odd but it fit perfectly. They're not paper thin, but they're not too thick either. Great for walking around parks, boardwalks, going to trhe beach, etc l"
5.0,My granddaughter loves this hoodie!
5.0,"This dress is very elegant.  One thing I realized is that I tied the bow on my back, but this is to be tied on the front haha.  Anyway. This dress can even be worn for a wedding.  This is very beautiful.  (Wife here)"
5.0,Very comfortable and access to bun
5.0,"I've been on the hunt for a small puffed heart charm for a long time.  I just like the way they look on a thin gold chain.  This one is just lovely.  It has a good weight to it and is pretty small.  It sits perfectly on a then serpentine chain my husband bought me so I wear it often.  Beautiful color and very shiny.  It has a nice heavy duty jump ring as well that's welded shut, not simply crimped shut.  Great little addition to my casual jewelry.  Love it!"
5.0,Love the moomin products - the key chain does not disappoint.
5.0,Ordered it a little loose<br />Super warm great fit
5.0,"The small bag is a nice car bag.  Keeps small items intact.  Great quality.<br />The large bag is perfect for books/hiking/etc.  Lots of room.<br />I applied mink oil to both bags, now's they're waterproof and will last much longer than without."
5.0,This is exactly what I needed it to be. A nice silver chain; it's very fine and delicate. I ordered the 24-inch and I'm very happy with the length!
5.0,Looks nice. A little short though for a large man.
5.0,Lgb
5.0,Really cute style. Love the color and fit! 😊
5.0,"Looks great, feels great. Looks the same as the original sport band that comes with the fitbit."
5.0,They are great bit super flexible  Confortable but Niger si go for a small size than your normal size
5.0,Breathable clothing material..I like it’s fitting too
5.0,LOVE THE SWEET CARD LIKE CASE IT CAME IN. ITS ADORABLE AND PERFECT FOR A TEENAGER .
5.0,"A beautiful well made hat, it will be great for the summer. It is designed to go with anything casual, very stylish."
5.0,Simply Beautiful !
5.0,"This was a gift and the kids just loved em.  They are into Legos, and this was just enough to keep them busy while they built a larger toy."
5.0,"The masks close securely over my nose, with an extra panel under my chin for good coverage.  The ear loops adjust for an ideal fit.  It doesn't touch my mouth if I talk while wearing it, which is what I look for."
5.0,"Junior sized (women size up) Great spring and summer colors in a lightweight denim-like fabric with some stretch. Comfortable fit. Mini skirt is long enough to cover everything that should be covered, but short enough to allow ease of movement. Will be ordering additional colors!"
5.0,Nice weight and very nice looking. Boight as a gift and was very well received. The color is not very saturated and is not a match for true LGBT colors but it is a very nice quality
5.0,"Hunter Rubber Buffer (HRB) worked great! My boots had a slight ashiness, purchased to try and clean them…the boot on the left was treated with HRB and the boot on the right was untreated. Great purchase, if you take care of your Hunter Boots they will last!"
5.0,It was smaller than expected and the middle stones are very tiny and hard to see. The company was great when I put in my comment and 3 stars. I am upgrading my review because of the feedback i got with company. I would definitely buy from them again
5.0,To be completely honest. I wasn’t expecting to love them. I ordered them for my kids emoji party theme we are doing. They fit very nice and for the price are more than I expected. The material is very light and soft. Definitely needs to be worn with a long shirt because the seems don’t line up. But that’s not hard to do. Love it!
5.0,Beautiful & lightweight! Love the colors
5.0,My daughter loves to wear this shoes when the weather is warm...
5.0,Thunbs up
5.0,"wears well ,washes well, don't recommend dryer does better if you just lay flat to dry but I would buy again"
5.0,"Beautiful Chain, I love it!"
5.0,"Great design. I originally bought the large size, but discovered that even though it's pre-shrunk cotton, it does shrink after a bunch of washings. So, I bought the extra large."
5.0,"This dress is awesome!! I'm a 36C, 5'2, 150 lbs and a medium fit me perfect. I didn't want the &#34;nightgown effect&#34; so I got a size smaller than I usually wear, and there was still plenty of wiggle room without it looking baggy. The color is vibrant and the fabric is soft, can't wait to wear it out!"
5.0,Best goggles for swimming.
5.0,"I bought this for a friend's birthday gift and was very impressed with it! The construction feels SOLID, the size is just right (not too large, not small), and the cat design is just subtle enough so it still looks sophisticated (it's not overly cutesy or tacky).<br /><br />My only negative feedback is that when you unzip it, there's a very strong chemical smell so you may have to air it out for a day."
5.0,Loved it. Fits loosely and has pockets. Very cute and comfy for a day or evening out. Was very pleased.
5.0,"Fit is just right. The amount left over on belt does not hang over too far, just enough to slide into pant loop. Measured just right. Belt leather seems to be good quality even though it has China stamp on it. I've always just bought leather that said cowhide or Italian leather,but I like it and gave it 5stars even if you can't change out buckle."
5.0,"These socks are 🔥!!! My son wore these for silly sock day and mixed and matched it with Sponge Bob Stance socks and he loved them! Pattern is beautiful, colors haven’t faded after washing and they are just so darn cute!!  My 4 year old loved showing off his socks (and still does) and he wears his socks around the house and in our backyard paved patio all the time and still no holes!"
5.0,looks great.  my 9mm shield fits in the compartment.  I am able to carry regularly.  thank you.
5.0,These boots are gorgeous!! I absolutely love them and I recommend them to anyone!
5.0,My daughter has been using them as her only pair of tennis shoes for six months and they still look great. Wide feet friendly. True to size. Best of all no more stinky feet. I am buying a second pair now that school is starting. RECOMMEND over name brand.
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for a friend. I was pretty pleased with the appearance, but wasn't sure what she would think. Its very pretty, but is clearly a little lower quality. For the price, I expected it and she loved it, so it worked out fine."
5.0,One of my favorite sweaters
5.0,Don’t dry it. 😩
5.0,"My left wrist is 8 3/4 inches, and the extra long watch band fits perfectly (with two holes to spare). The brown leather is<br />soft and comfortable. I took it to a nearby jewelry store, and they replaced the silver buckle with a gold one at minimal<br />cost. The gold buckle now matches my gold Seiko watch, and the leather watch band is a handsome compliment to what<br />was a thoughtful birthday present from my wife last month. She is as happy as I am, so thank you."
5.0,My little ballerina loves this ballet leotard. Fits as expected and seems to be holding up well.
5.0,Love the graphics and I have received multiple laughs!
5.0,It is a beautiful chain. Definitely feels like good quality . Unfortunately when I dropped my phone and tried to grab the chain it completely broke.
5.0,"and don't let the size when you 1st see them throw you off - they look really small, but they are very stretchy."
5.0,"We've gotten this type of shirt before and wanted another. Came quickly, looks as expected, great price and fit as expected. These shirts are great!!"
5.0,So gorgeous!! Amazingly great quality as well.<br />Very satisfied with my purchase. :D
5.0,"First at all I love the way it fits me ,I like the material it feels stretchy not tight just perfect , and I feel sexy.. lol..<br />I was unsure what to expect,  but now I just love the dress."
5.0,Really cute and so soft!
5.0,Love this necklace.  So pretty.  Looks even better than the photos.
5.0,Nice quality...well thought out and well executed.
5.0,My daughter loves these!  The colors are very pretty. They were inexpensive and  look exactly like in the picture. Glad I got them!
5.0,Nice casual and comfortable top.  Fits as other shirts do in the same size.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted for my eyebrow
5.0,"Look great, work great. They *are* completely plastic, but that doesn’t bother me. My dog liked them also. Chewed up one pair within 24 hours, which is why this value pack is such a great deal for me!"
5.0,"Great shorts for sports, just kicking back or even sleeping in."
5.0,"This pullover hoodie is very nice quality and has a classic look with clean lines and zero flash. Both of my boys are understated and can't stand wearing stuff that screams, Hey! Look at me! So this hoodie works for both of them. It looks great and is obviously well made, but doesn't garner too much attention. Overall, a solid buy."
5.0,I got these for my husband for a last minute wedding gift. They are great quality!
5.0,Love this watch.  The color combination spurs compliments.
5.0,i wish you have one in navy blue ir another color of the same style.... really comfy. please let me know.
5.0,Well made sweater
5.0,"This jumpsuit is really cute! I'm normally a size 10/12 and I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly on me. I'm a 36ddd top, 31 waist, 42 hip. 175lbs. Go for it!!"
5.0,Fits a little loose. But better loose than too tight.
5.0,I'm 5'9 and a size 12. These fit great. Lots of firmness and stretch
5.0,This product was the best thing I got! I got a big head haha! And it fit comfortably. It’s silk inside and out. And this was exactly what I was looking for !
5.0,"Cute top, decently made"
5.0,I love it and cannot wait to give it!
5.0,"The earring is wonderful. Great quality. I absolutely love it.<br />When I ordered this, I didn't really catch that it was handmade. I just looked at the picture, the five star rating, and the price...so I bought it. When I received it, I thought maybe a friend of mine had sent me something. It came in a cute little package and a handwritten thank you note. That alone makes me want to buy more of their products. Oh! And a piece of candy!"
5.0,"Super cute dress and the fit is perfect. Fast shipping and product is better than I had expected for this price! My friend ordered a similar dress from another company, paid more than twice what I paid for it, and honestly, I think this one is better quality."
5.0,"My daughter has sensory issues with clothing and will only wear sleeveless dresses that don't bunch up or leave soon feeling itchy. These dresses are amazing- they're lightweight, soft, and she loves all the cool patterns. Most importantly, she puts them on without any fussing and life is so much more comfortable for her. Thank you so much!"
5.0,I have a size 11 foot and they fit just fine! They are very comfortable and my favorite socks to put on! The band in the middle and the padded ankle make them my favorite!
5.0,"Love this skirt! Goes with pretty much any shirt, material is good quality, knee length so acceptable for work and went thru the wash well."
5.0,"Stays in place under my hard hat, helps with cooling and  helps control my hair. Exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,Been a Helly Hansen fan for a long time. Quality is great and fit is just as expected.
5.0,Like that the quality of this hat is good and love that we can still get the insignia of Strategic Air Command which<br />was part of the USAF from years gone by.
5.0,It's beyond beautiful and I love that they include the story behind it.
5.0,I love the feel and fit. I see other colors in the reviews but only black as a purchase option which of course I went with. Please get more colors! Love this dress!
5.0,Very comfortable and washed up well. Athletic fit. No thumbholes but that’s ok. Looks nice enough that I can even wear to work.
5.0,"Inexpensive, water resistant, light weight and fits my 8 year old son's wrist just fine. He thinks its awesome and comfortable. Now I kind of want one."
5.0,Bought it for my boyfriend and he love it
5.0,Fit nicely. Thicker than anticipated.
5.0,I get more compliments on these boots than anything. Love them but the run about half size too big.
5.0,Great relief.
5.0,"I have to give this product a full 5, even though it was not exactly what I wanted. It is very pretty & nicely comfortable. Not quite as supportive as I had hoped, but it did not claim to be my new VS replacement. It is a nice addition to my lingerie collection though."
5.0,Love anything Scottish.
5.0,"Fits great, super soft, good quality."
5.0,I purchased 2 pairs for my granddaughters. The earrings were perfect gift for Valentine’s Day! Granddaughters are 7 and 9.
5.0,"The leopard design is really cute, I love it"
5.0,I was reluctant to buy this because of the conflicting reviews. Some said too small or too big. I’m usually an XL but always order an XXL on Amazon and in this case it worked out perfectly again. The fit is great. I like it so much I ordered it in Navy also. It’s going to look cute with shorts and Converse on the 4th of July.
5.0,Fits great and got delivered really quick!
5.0,Love it and will get more as soon as they have some more colors!
5.0,Looks much more expensive than it is
5.0,"I love these earrings. They are simple, super light weight, and cute. I get compliments on them all the time. Slightly smaller than a dime. Often inexpensive jewelry starts tarnishing after a handful of times being worn, but these still look great after 3 months!"
5.0,"Daughter is a orchestra geek, and she loves it. Much nicer then what I was expecting."
5.0,"The item looks as it was shown in the picture. It is very lightweight and comfortable, for a cuff bracelet, which often doesn't fit quite right, but this is the most comfortable cuff bracelet I've ever worn. I purchased it hoping it would match my other purple turquoise jewelry pieces, and it matches perfectly!"
5.0,Great price and cute for a little outdoor active shoe! Bought for a cruise and they worked perfect!
5.0,My husband loves these boxers
5.0,Too cute! My granddaughter will love it!
5.0,Seem awesome
5.0,Really pleased with how this adjusts. The extra band lays flat underneath the outer band. It’s easy to slip in and off yet still fits snuggly on my wrist.
5.0,The carryall turned out to be a coveted gift this holiday. My son is eager to use it on his next scuba trip to carry and store his gear.
5.0,Very well made and worth the price.
5.0,Got for my son who is 5’11” and 170ish pounds. Got an XL and it was perfect. The sizing chart was super accurate.
5.0,Bought 3 sets my wife loves your product. Tik Tik is very high quality. and cool in Florida Summer nights.. glad I found them for her online..
5.0,Love Love Love them! Perfect fit and exactly as described
5.0,"I just love this tank , it just fits perfect !!!"
5.0,I am very pleased with my new magnetic accent kingdom wrist band. Very nice. Thank you
5.0,I really like these.  Just for reference - these are way more sturdy than the drugstore ones.  The bag they come in is really nice.  The shoes themselves - the size large drugstore ones for my size 10 wide are waaay too small.  These in the size XL are perfect for me.  The bottoms are not that thin fabric like on the drugstore ones.  These have a nice sole on them that should last a long time!  Nice and light!  I can't really say about how long they last because they will be worn very infrequently but it looks like I will have them a long time.
5.0,I really appreciate the quality and nice appearance of the necklace. Wear it daily. Highly recommend!!
5.0,"I typically don't write reviews, but this corset is exceptional. Now, I don't pretend to be an aficionado on corsets (actually this is my first one) but I know well constructed quality when I see it, and for the under $50 price point, I was blown away! I am 5'6&#34;, 170lbs, and the XL fits me perfectly! Do measure your waist before ordering. Note to the manufacturer: included instructions on &#34;breaking in&#34; your corset would be helpful, I used google as recommended by a previous review."
5.0,"I have a feeling this was meant to fit the wrist of the average adult male, however, I love this bracelet. I will more than likely order another"
5.0,"I'm a man with small feet (insert your joke here).  The standard adult man sock size, 10-13, is just too big for me.  But it's difficult to find good socks size 9-11, that will hold up to the demands of a man's feet.  These socks do so and at a reasonable price.  These socks meet those standards. My thanks to the seller."
5.0,"I tend to stay away from sleeveless tops. As a plus size woman, they're not usually very flattering. This one fits much better than I expected. Usually the arm openings are too large and end up showing my bra. This one is really the perfect size. My bra does not show at all. It doesn't hide my bat wings, but such is the nature of sleeveless tops! This is a cute and flowy top, but it doesn't make me feel (or look) like I'm pregnant. I think this will be a cute, summer top to wear on girls night out!"
5.0,It wasn’t the size I meant to buy but it was great quality
5.0,Awesome Earrings! I wouldn't mind of I saw alot more of these earrings.  What a great pair of earrings! Thanx!
5.0,Very comfortable. So easy to switch out
5.0,"Lovely, Rich luster.  It offsets a black top perfectly.  It's a flattering accessory to any outfit, and I wear it every season of the year."
5.0,My kids are very fussy about clothing. They both like the cut and fit.
5.0,"Fits as expected, very roomy, arrived early, great jacket."
5.0,"I ordered a size large, I’m currently 7 months pregnant. I love this look, I plan to use for my baby shower. The dress feels very comfy & soft. I love that I can still wear it even after my pregnancy. The dress is perfect!"
5.0,"I have a small head and usually, hats don't stay in place.  This is the perfect fit and not so tight that it ruins my hair. The pom pom is soft. I'm going to buy another for gifts!"
5.0,I absolutely love these. I bought one pack and when they arrived I immediately bought 2 more lol
5.0,LOOOVE THESE SHOES THEY WERE PERFECT FOR MY CHRISTMAS OUTFIT ❤️ I'D DEFINITELY BUY FROM THESE GUY'S AGAIN (also price can't be beat)
5.0,"I got this this as a bathing suit cover up for our vacation in Hawaii and it will be perfect! It’s cute, the material is light weight and flows nicely. It’s perfect as a summer dress or to go over your suit."
5.0,Very cute for the price. True to size - no need to size up!
5.0,STYLISH & JUST RIGHT
5.0,"Super cute and reasonably priced. Not a super heavy winter jacket, light enough for fall."
5.0,Ultra warm.
5.0,Got a small and my daughter is 95 pounds
5.0,This will be a Christmas gift.
5.0,I love these travel cubes. Def makes for better organization. I think at least it deters tsa from messing up your neat packing if they had to go through your luggage. I've tried buying these in store and the difference is the extra compartment in each cube for dirty clothes gives this one up.
5.0,"Strange super powers of knit silk, i think thats what its made from woven silk, like cotton or wool, silk does not stretch but this sure does. Its breathable, keeps your hands cool when it hot, sweat goes through and evaporate. When its cold it magically keeps my hands warm, strange magical powers. Like a cacoon snuggle bug. I'm sure if your stuck under 10 feet of snow then it might not be so magical."
5.0,Wish they were a little bigger but absolutely 😍 love!
5.0,Awesome. Not too warm but a nice amount of cushion. Worked great for my several day camping/hiking trip.
5.0,"Super cute on, slit is a little higher than expected but definitely hugs the body in the right places. My husband loves it on me."
5.0,These pants are so soft and my daughter says they are soooooooo comfortable. Stretchy waist band and ankle bands which is nice so she doesn’t step on the pants. Color is a nice blue color as shown. Washes well. Fits on the looser side but fits well. Highly recommend
5.0,Sorprendente diseño
5.0,"Made for a man, but used by a woman. Before viewing this item, it never really crossed my mind that men might have a need for such a thing. Obviously, you can can tell that I'm not a runner. I got these for those situations where wearing a bra is not needed, too much trouble, not possible, etc. I'm incredibly self conscious that my girls might give a heads up about the weather or just decide to wake up all on their own. I like these because I can simply put them on and then discard them afterward. They are large enough to cover the entire space so that even if the top is tighter, you can't tell that you are wearing these. They adhere well and haven't been irritating at all and I have very sensitive skin. I have never experienced nipple chafing but I'm gathering that it is a very uncomfortable and painful experience. So glad to know that these exist so that I can share this information as needed. This is a huge value with 50 pairs. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"I was surprised at how nice this set really looks. All except for the chain are very sturdy, not thin and flimsy as I had expected them to be. They were actually priced extremely low and I am so pleased . I figured that since they were 925 I would give it a shot because even if they were cheaply made I would just give them to my grandaugther to use for playing dress up. Now I'm wishing I would have gotten more than one set because I am going to keep them to use my self. They are the prefect size to add the finishing touch to my little black dress."
5.0,"Love the sweatshirts, they are a little larger than I thought they would be."
5.0,It's a sun glass pouch made out of soft lingerie type velvet. What is there not to like?
5.0,The first one arrived damaged (unable to close the case) but they sent a replacement right away when I followed the steps on Amazon’s return. The new case is just right!
5.0,"My favorite earrings. They are pretty,light weight and go on easily. also if you snag it on clothing,they slide out easily with out tearing your ear or hurting."
5.0,"Love the dress, just a little more yellow than expected."
5.0,"This is the third brand o copper mask that I’ve purchased and it fits the best by far! Clips around the nose to avoid glasses fogging, comfortable on the ears, and molds around the chin.  The shape sits the mask away from the nose so you breathe a little better.  Too big for my petite teen daughter, just right for those  of us in the 150-200 lb range.  I’m buying more!"
5.0,This is a really good thing to have for you to keep everything organized. Now my backpack is so much more clean and easy to be handled.
5.0,Very pretty watch. Bought this for myself and I couldn’t be more pleased.
5.0,Icy asf
5.0,"Love these multi-strung earrings. Elegant, simple, exquisite!"
5.0,Comfortable. Bought this for my baby shower and had no regrets.
5.0,"My daughter loves her shoes; they are super cute. She is only 5, but she didn't complain about her feet hurting. The only thing is that the shoes buckle is not velcro, so you act actually have to fasten them."
5.0,"This product was perfect!! It is very nice for the price!! **Personal Details - I'm 5'2 over 200lbs with a mom fupa and I ordered a XXXL. It is long enough, loose enough and comfy!! I will have no problem wearing this for 4+ hours!!! It's a great buy!"
5.0,Good buckle
5.0,Fit perfectly. Used them to keep the sun off what le working outside.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d629d46e5fbc1c7e3a623b08f9a4bae6]] I love this waist trainer, it covers my entire abdomen from the top clear to the bottom, not just ""part"" of my abdomen.  It is very comfy and if I wanted to I could even use it the whole day, I am 250 pounds. I bought a 4XL and it fits me perfectly.  I like that it helps me sweat so that helps me lose weight, but it also helps contain my stomach and makes me look skinnier.  It also helps me contain my posture, which is needed to help my back.  Great quality and a wonderful price."
5.0,My daughter loves it. It fits well and looks nice.
5.0,Yes will buy more.
5.0,This is a great product. Not too hard and not too soft. Does run true to size.
5.0,Ok! ;)
5.0,"I LOVE THESE PANTS! I got them for casual but also date nights, and they are perfect! They are so comfortable! Very stretchy and light. I am a size 6/8 and got the medium, and it fits well! Seriously so cute! I may get the ones in black now!"
5.0,very nice shoes and great price and quality
5.0,I love the way they feel I love the way they look and I enjoy getting the compliments I get every single time I wear them!
5.0,"Love the glasses, great for a hazy day..highly recommend."
5.0,"Bought for my mom. The design is lovely, and it makes it look more realistic than the typical flatlined tennis bracelet."
5.0,I bought these for my son with Autism and they fit him good just run short.  My son is a tall and slim and hard to find the right length and size.
5.0,These are trending comfy durable warm socks.
5.0,I have a number of Celtic pieces and these earrings go nicely with my pendants.  They are nicely executed and very detailed.  They cover most of my earlobe so the description of size is accurate.  They are very lightweight so I cannot feel them when they are in.  That is a plus for me.  I would recommend them.
5.0,Love it nice and shinny. Goes with anything. Goes best with my pot leaf earring from JBlue. For the third time thank you JBlue
5.0,Great value for money! So happy I got it.
5.0,Love it...the color is not as bright as what is shown but all in all the color is still nice!
5.0,Excellent quality and quick delivery!
5.0,Does not make my feet sweat or smell.
5.0,"This is an excellent replacement for my Pebble (original model) that used to have the silicone band. It fits the watch width (22mm) perfectly and is plenty long enough for my large wrist. It's a little stiff when first installed, but within a day or two of wearing it, the band shaped itself and is now very comfortable.<br /><br />It has 5 metal loops on it, which give it a more rugged look, and hold the excess band beyond the buckle so it doesn't snag on anything. The black coating on the loops begins to wear off after a while, but I use mine in a somewhat rough environment, so it find it acceptable that they develop a bit of patina. They are certainly strong and well made. There are two of these loops at the end of the NATO part that goes under the watch, one of which seems redundant, but I think that is a styling decision. It certainly works as designed.<br /><br />Having almost lost the watch when the original silicone band broke, I am very pleased with the design that won't allow the watch to come off your wrist if it slips a retaining pin. As for the band ever actually &#34;breaking&#34; I cannot imagine that, as it is tightly woven high quality nylon, similar to a miniature seat belt."
5.0,Fit perfect like usual
5.0,"So comfortable.  No tags, no seams, super comfortable."
5.0,My wife just HAD TO HAVE to leopard design.  Highly recommend.
5.0,My daughter loves this dress and wears it all the time. She especially commented on how comfy the fabric it.
5.0,My daughter loves unicorns so this was nice for her. These earrings were cute. They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. They were colorful. She liked them.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure. I thought they were a reasonable value. I would recommend them.<br /><br />It is nice that they are real sterling silver.
5.0,This kit is amazing. Cleaned messed up Timberlands with this kit and the boots look like new. Was astonished.
5.0,I have been buying Stafford T-shirts for some time now it is the only brand that I buy.  I wear these shirts all winter long on a daily basis.  They usually will last me 4 to 5 years all the other brands I have purchased will start to get holes after the first or second year.  These just keep on going!  Comfortable under your clothing not to hot and neck is cut low enough that it is not seen when leaving the top button of your shirt unfastened.
5.0,she love it I have to  buy 2 more
5.0,"This is a purchase that I'm thrilled about.  I purchased this coat in blue, and loved it so much I ordered another in chocolate.  They are so soft and they look great with jeans or leggings.  You can dress it up with a scarf or just wear it casually.  I ordered a 3X so that I would have room if I decided to wear a sweater or jacket beneath it.  It reaches the freezing level in my neck of the woods, so I dress in layers. However, I would say the coat is true to size.  You can't beat the price for the quality.  I would highly recommend it, and I would also recommend that you order it in several colors.  I did!"
5.0,"I just love this anklets it’s so comforting and beautiful 😍 so soft not much heavy to uncomfortable feet ,Definitely recommending to everyone"
5.0,Perfect cover up love it!
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like these sports bras. They fit perfectly and are flattering. I usually have a hard time with thin straps hurting my neck, but they’re really comfortable. I’ve washed them a few times (but did not put in dryer), and they’re holding up great. The padding hasn’t shifted at all."
5.0,Good price for a lightweight down coat...
5.0,Arrived quickly and exactly like the pictures!
5.0,the different styles for any day
5.0,"I purchased the Tallis Prayer Shawl to use in a Scripture course I teach to demonstrate the commonality of Judeo/Christian faith and values, despite differences in liturgical practices and attitudes about the fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament."
5.0,I love this sweatshirt. It fits perfectly and is so comfortable.
5.0,I am always in need of Warm socks during Winter at work. The length is great and they're soft and comfortable. The fit is nice and snug.
5.0,"I love this dress. It's super flattering and fits as expected. I'm a size 16, 5'11'' tall, and the XXL looks really good."
5.0,Loved them!!! Fit nicely but are not quite as stretchy as Jeggings
5.0,"Nice clipons, flip up, flip down. cover my lenses completely. I found this style of sunglasses difficult to find and expensive when I could find them. some vendors were asking in excess of 65$ for these. My frames are marked as 52++ 18-140mm, don't know which number indicates lens size, but there you have it.<br /><br />Really cuts the glare and their polarized so you can look at clouds all day long if it strikes your fancy. Arrived in a clear plastic case with rigid sides and and a snap fastener, handy case keeps the lens from getting scratched up."
5.0,"I love, love, love, this outfit. It is so comfortable. You can dress it up or wear sneakers with it."
5.0,continue to satisfy your customers
5.0,Perfect for my family when they need to adjust the masks I make for them.

5.0,Works great heavy duty

5.0,Value for<br />Money
5.0,My wife likes this very much. Better than buying a pair of costly prescription sunglasses from the eye doctor.
5.0,"I have only used the bag once so this might change, but it was admitted into a festival and held up well for the day. It’s a great price too, so I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,I love them so much they very light
5.0,"I love this mask, it's so lightweight and airy! I've had 3 ladies stop and ask me where I bought this!"
5.0,Perfect for younger girls who aren't ready to care for the larger AG dolls. I bought our generation accessories for Kendall & Ashlyn (found clothes on Etsy) & I am sure my daughter will love them both Christmas morning.
5.0,Love it bought 2 more in different colors. Very comfortable.
5.0,"This mask has optional filters for safety. It is beautiful, breathable, comfortable, affordable, and admired by others when I wear it! Thank you!!!"
5.0,I like the case- I have a pair for my husband and I that I throw in my purse and the case protects them.  They are great for restaurant use or unexpected times you need to read something and don’t have your regular glasses with you.
5.0,"I haven't wore them yet but so far they fit fine, I just tried them on I haven't wore them outside yet."
5.0,"These have been super handy in organizing my daughter's room. She has more bags and backpacks than I can count. This helps to make them all accessible to her. This will work better for lightweight bags than heavier items, but worked out perfectly for us!"
5.0,It fit like a glove and looked so cute for my first cruise.
5.0,Soooo cute and comfy! Very happy!
5.0,Bought for my grandson and they fit perfectly. He loved them

5.0,It is the biggest side but still a little small for me but fit me
5.0,"Don't like hats, but because I had to wear one I selected this one. It was a good selection."
5.0,Grandson Loved it!!
5.0,"Fit perfectly, and very comfortable."
5.0,my daughter love this product she wears it all the time
5.0,"Holds a 16oz Tall-Boy, firm & steady, during the golf swing  -  what more could you want ???"
5.0,"This is my new favorite hoodie. I do wish the sleeves were just about an 1"" longer, but you can't beat the quality and style for the price.<br />I prob shouldn't complain about the size, since this is listed for woman, but my wife said it looks fine on me. I'm an average size dude, and I got the large."
5.0,"I’m 5’8 and weigh about 160 lbs and I ordered a Medium. It fits great and it’s not light material, not thick."
5.0,These PJs are the softest flannel and made to last. Really cute designs too! I’ve had them for years. Just remember not to put them in the dryer because they will shrink a lot.
5.0,This piece of luggage was great.  It held up well in my summer travels and was the perfect size.  I love the color and it was so easy to spot when collecting luggage at the airport.  The outer shell was made out of material that was a bit flexible...it is not hard inflexible material like I was thinking it would be.  That was not a problem for me at all.  I just thought I would mention it in case that mattered to someone.  Love this and it was a great price.
5.0,Love it perfect!  More of silky feeling than cotton.
5.0,This is the most comfortable summer dress I’ve ever owned! Kind of low cut in front so may need to wear tank or cami underneath. Pockets are wonderful!
5.0,"This kit is working great for gauging my ears. I'd buy it again, that's the best review I feel like I can give anything"
5.0,"Love it, but smaller than Imexpected"
5.0,Great gift and fit the way it listed!
5.0,"The purchaser loves it. They like the color, the look, fit and style. She's happy with the purchase."
5.0,Purchased this mainly for my daughter to wear them under dresses and they are perfect. She wears size 4 jeans and bought the 4/5T and fit perfect.
5.0,Would purchase again!
5.0,"These are fabulous. I was thinking I was going to share one with my husband, but they're so nice I'm going to selfishly keep them both. No kidding. They are thick, but not ridiculously so, and the soft lining makes them very comfortable. There's good stretch, so there's no struggle getting them on, and they're not so long that I feel choked when I pull them down. Mostly, they're very soft, and nice and warm. Exceptionally comfortable to wear. I really like that I get a black one - always handy - but I especially like the gray with black trim. It's a bit more lighthearted and fashionable. Fashion, btw, always takes a back seat to quality and something actually serving its purpose well. I recommend these! I think you'll be as pleased with them as I am."
5.0,"Me gusto mucho este vestido de baño, la calidad de la tela me encanta. Gruesa y te sientes comoda y Segura"
5.0,Too big.  They said size up.  Don't.
5.0,"These are nice fitted left foot right foot hiking socks in fun colors (I ordered several colors).  They stay up & are very comfortable.  They are perfect for early spring & fall.  They are not thick enough for winter.  For winter, I use Maggie's Functional Organic Wool Killington Hiking Socks (available on amazon) & my husband wears LLBean wool hiking socks (available at LLBean).<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with these socks."
5.0,good for the price !!!!!and fast delivery!!!!
5.0,Went to a sneakers and skirts party with my sisters and these dresses were perfect for the occasion. I love that you can dress them up or down.... I bought the black one and she ordered the green one.<br /><br />Colors are just like the pics and you can style them like the pics. I ordered the medium in black and my sister ordered the small in green. If your looking for it to be more snug I would say go a size down. We wanted it a little big so that we could tie it up like the pics..... hope this was helpful.
5.0,"I like the color a lot. I wear them for fishing, and driving and golf. They look good and stay put, that's important, they do not slide off my nose in the heat."
5.0,Luv the color and the fit. It matches the outfit I put together. Seems really sturdy considering it's made from jellies. The slingback closure is a concern. I still recommend them.... Very playful.
5.0,Got for prom.  Fits good very tall shoe but looks better than in the picture.
5.0,This dress draws so much attention. I get a lot of compliments wearing this dress. Fits true to size. All I have to say is BUY THE DRESS!
5.0,I got this for my Mother. Make sure you know your appropriate ring size.
5.0,"I was really shocked by this product and the quality. I love it! I'm 5'3 and 180 lbs. I ordered a large and initially was worried that it wouldn't fit. But I love the hook feature! Was so much easier than I thought! Zipped right up once I had it hooked. It was definitely very snug though. I don't think I could wear it on ab day, but to run or do my other workouts, I think it will be perfect"
5.0,"My 10 year old son loves this hat!  It is well made, vivid blue and stylish."
5.0,"These shoes for my granddaughter are adorable! I wasn’t expecting them to be as nice since they were inexpensive, but very pleasantly surprised. Quality is comparable to any converse shoe. Love them!"
5.0,"Fantastic hat!! I bought 3 more after that. It is roomy, but also fits nice and snug around the ears. Plus, it has very soft and fuzzy lining that make it both and not itchy. The colors are great too."
5.0,"Gifted these at a baby shower I hosted, my two neices were getting a new baby sister so this was the perfect gift for the 3 girls!"
5.0,Love these. I was looking for dark sunglasses and these are true to what they claim.

5.0,Really great looking watch. Prestigious
5.0,[[VIDEOID:67ef995a114a009670423db57f537d98]] I can actually feel these spirals on my wrist and arm. This is a good reminder for where my keys are. I like that a total of 11 pieces each have the metal silver rings. I like the variety of 11 colors.
5.0,"I have bought several Casio watches over the years and have never been disappointed. They keep almost perfect time, they are waterproof and the batteries have lasted for 8-10 years.  The price makes them one of the best value items I buy. There only weakness is the band which only last 4 to 5 years."
5.0,gave as a gift and he loved it
5.0,Love this. Versatile piece. Lots of compliments when wearing it

5.0,Fits a little small and material not very stretchy.  Design is super cute
5.0,"I am self conscious so do not wear swimsuits, but needed SOMETHING to wear in the water occasionally.  These swim pants are perfect!  They fit.  They pair very well with a swimsuit top of your choice.  Very reasonably priced.  Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I was afraid this shirt would come as a slim fit, but it didn't thank God...I love a regular fit shirt. I am by no means a clothing model...lol. I am an your average American guy who needs a regular fit shirt and this one fit the tee perfectly. Lots of compliments on this one , Thanks Roper... and quit the slim fits, slim fit or slim cut is a women's fit, and deff not a fit for men."
5.0,I've been looking for a small navy purse for quite some time..  this is everything I was looking for.  Very nice looking and stylish.
5.0,love the brightness of the colors & the sizes of skulls. wish there was more color combinations.

I wasn't worried about the size or structure cause' I have a pink one of my own and I absolutley love it! As I opened this one I realized they accidentally gave me two for the price of one so I guess I'll just give my dad the other one, lol."
5.0,Omg. This is a must purchase. So beautiful/well fitted. Ordered the 3x..I wear a 1x..fit was perfect. 2x would have been also.. Girls!… go GET this!!!!!
5.0,used them for the 4th of July.  Kids loved them.  No duds in my bunch.  A cheap way to entertain a few kids
5.0,i get compliments overtime i wear it
5.0,This dress has a lot of stretch to it and is very flattering and perfect for spring!
5.0,"I was deeply impressed when I opened the box. The quality of this watch is superb, they take a thorough care of everything: packing, presentation, finishing of the parts, etc. It is not an small watch, its diameter is 50 mm (2 in), however is very confortable to use and beautiful. I'm very glad with it.<br /><br />I was also happy when I realised that it is made in Japan. That gave me a lot of confidence since Japan has high quality standards.<br /><br />The only detail I found, is that the instruction manual needs to be polished since correspond just to a similar model.<br /><br />Note: I just found the manual in the manufacturer's website: http://www.shark-watch.com (good support)"
5.0,The size was true.  Material feels great.  Just wash and wear -- no wrinkles.
5.0,It's more than worth it
5.0,Love the socks. Super comfortable.
5.0,I’m wearing a large it fits true to size maybe smaller lg instead of bigger lg! Washes up good feels kind of smooth soft thin maybe almost silky like! I love it very comfy and thin
5.0,I love cotton clothing. These nightgowns are very comfortable and do not shrink in the dryer. It is like wearing a long tee shirt to bed.  I am pleased with them.
5.0,"This necklace is heavy and high quality metal. The skateboard is a little short, but I bought it for my nephew and he absolutely loves it. I will definitely purchase from this company in the future. :)"
5.0,A perfect lil Valentine’s Day gift for 4 yr old g’daughter.  She loves it.
5.0,"the quality is nice.  DO NOT WASH IT LIKE PEOPLE INSTRUCTED. its a great scarf but once i washed it like other reviewers here recommended, the fabric became fuzzy and was totally ruined.  i dont blame the company for this though. its still a very nice scarf. dont wash it."
5.0,I got these almost 2 weeks earlier than expected! Its Valentine's day so I'm pretty happy (: These earrings are stamped with 925 on them which is one of the reasons I bought them. They're exactly what I wanted. So simple yet so cute! Good for every day wear!
5.0,I like these lenses better than the originals that came with my Oakleys. I bought the polarized lenses originally for my fishing sunglasses but then ordered another pair for my second set of casual sunglasses. Definitely worth the money
5.0,"Being sick to death of not being able to tell the difference between navy blue and black socks, I bought six pairs of these beautiful and distinctive blue socks to be my ""go-to"" blue socks.  They are great.  The color works with dark blue or light blue jeans, and they don't make me nuts when trying to match socks in the laundry.  Very soft, comfortable, and have good durability."
5.0,Purchased for my nephew. It’s AWESOME! It’s a really nice embroidered hat. I would buy this item again.
5.0,"I love dogs, but why anyone would want a dog's mug on their's like this is beyond me!  However, the dog lover we gave this to is super happy to do that very thang.  Yikes!"
5.0,Great product for the price. I receive a lot of compliments from men and women on the style of the watch. Comfortable for a small wrist that usually has trouble finding a good watch fit.
5.0,Love this skirt. It is a big and full as pictured.
5.0,"These are nice, lined, leather gloves. They seem very warm and I can use my electronic devices with them! Shipped quickly and the seller was great! Highly recommend!✌️"
5.0,"The package is nicer than I expected. It can be a nice gift for anyone during winter. These socks keep my feet warm during night. My daughter has one pair of heated socks. I tried once, but it’s too tight for my calf. This pair is a nice fit."
5.0,My son loved and loves this jersey set. He will wear it at least once a week and when it’s cold he wears them over some athletic leggings. Would def recommend
5.0,"If you’re searching for a pair of boot laces that look good and won’t  keep coming untied, look no further. I couldn’t be happier with these. Highly recommended."
5.0,Its fit perfect
5.0,Beautiful ! My friend loves it ! A great gift for wolf lovers !
5.0,"I bought two of these for my Granddaughters ages 4 and six. They are petite but I had to order sizes xl and xxxl because I have bought clothes from China before and they run super tiny. The girls loved them, they are very soft and look to be well made. They have a nice lining inside. Both the sizes I chose fit very well so I guess they are roughly equivalent to a size 4 and 6. I hope this helps!"
5.0,The wife loved these. I was skeptical about how they would hold up in the washer but they have held up very well. She likes how lightweight they are and don’t feel like they are pulling down on her like ones she’s used in the past. I don’t know if we will have to buy these again with how well they’ve held up. If she ever did need more she would like these again.
5.0,The waist of the shirts were a little small
5.0,Loved it but could have went one size bigger
5.0,The dress is adorable. I bought a red belt to go with it and I have red beads that will also look nice with it. The dress is lightweight and will be perfect for spring.
5.0,"I did not buy from this vender, but wanted to show what it looks like on.<br />I love mine & get tons of compliments. The only thing I don't like is the bottem part of the knoit on the hat where the ears are, it dies not snug your ears.<br />But otherwise all is good.<br />Love the bling, cause that's my thing!"
5.0,Pro:<br />My wife loves it<br />Reasonably priced<br />Cons:<br />None
5.0,"This dress is so girly and trendy. It flows nicely and lightweight.. You can wear this for all seasons. I like that the fabric is so stretchy and soft. Love the length too, not to short not too long. If your petite like me You definitely buy this Plus the price is affordable. I will definitely be ordering one of these in every color!"
5.0,This dress looks much more expensive than it is.  The colors are beautiful. It drapes nicely. It is very low cut but paid beautifully with a tight scoop neck tank in a complimentary color.
5.0,Absolutely loved the hat. I wore it to a tea party.
5.0,Gorgeous & comfortable to wear.
5.0,Love it! Diamond kinda lose but all you have to do is twist it and it's tight
5.0,Product was delivered within a reasonable time and the product was better than expected!  That does not happen often !
5.0,"I love these briefs!  Great price, great product, fast service."
5.0,These work very well for a more discreet look.  They stay on miraculously without adhesives which I like a lot.  They blend naturally without a hard line showing on their circumference.  Very nice accessory to my wardrobe!
5.0,I really like these pants and I have order my 2nd pare now. They fit well and keep the cold off the legs when the temperature drops. I am 5'11&#34;  185 lbs and the medium fits good. I have used them once for biking and they worked well for biking too. I am not a winter bike rider so that is why they were only used once on my bike. Great for running though.
5.0,My teenage son looks so handsome and grown up in this sweater.
5.0,Product arrived as advertised
5.0,"I like the cut and fit / it does run large so per reviews I ordered a smaller size and it still fits loose. It doesn’t bother me, but the lines on the front and back don’t match up and it’s not a cotton but polyester."
5.0,"I'm a nerd and this was one of the few moments where I indulged my nerdom. I get complements on my wallet and how sleek it looks, though no one has noticed the emblem. That or they just chose not to say anything. This is a really well made wallet, it holds a lot of stuff. I don't know if it's real leather but it certainly feels like it. Just wish it had a strap to add a chain."
5.0,"I read a review saying this wasn't for plus size so I was skeptical but I ordered anyway. I really love this outfit. At first I thought the shirt was horrible because it is straight spandex, but I get it because it gives a leotard feel so when you put the skirt over the shirt, there are no issues tucking it in. I ordered a 5X and wear a 20/22 in pants and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'8 and I'm an apple shape, carrying most of my weight in my mid section and I think it disguises it well. I don't have any spanx on in the pic, but plan on wearing then to eliminate the lumps and bumps. Overall, I really like the outfit."
5.0,Fabric very soft pineapple bride has some glitter fix it look festive. Very nice work not patchy. World's a bit large
5.0,Beautiful shirt & great quality! Can be worn under a blazer for work or on its own for a night out. I hope more colors come out for this top. I will buy them all!
5.0,Great sunglasses very comfy and cute
5.0,I bought this belt for my husband (his second actually) and he likes it. No complaints whatsoever.
5.0,Camo was a good design.
5.0,"It looks pretty good. Elegant, fresh and comfortable"
5.0,Love the colors and quality. They will last.
5.0,So warm and soft. Very relaxing to wear!
5.0,"This dress is really well made and is very soft. I liked that the skirt is lined.  I'm on the shorter side (5'4"") and it is a bit longer than I expected but not by much. Also, I like that the belt is separate from the dress so I can tie it whichever way I prefer."
5.0,"This hat is great quality and fits perfectly.  The material is soft to the touch and is the perfect amount of thickness with a great size ball of fluffy fur.  It's already scrunched so you don't have to try to figure out how to make it look good, you just put it on and wear it.  Love it!"
5.0,Love these to jazz up ordinary black top.
5.0,Beautiful quality and price.
5.0,"Got this for our 14 year old nephew, who's only recently begun to be concerned about what he wears.  He likes is a lot.  The dark color scheme with the bold contrasting block stripe looks great, and gives this simple t-shirt a more stylish look.  It's versatile and works well with shorts, jeans, khakis, etc.  The sleeves are shorter than on a typical tee, but not so short that they stand out for it.  The quality level is very good: nice heavier weight cotton with good stitching.  Like it a lot."
5.0,"This was a really great fit for me, and it’s cute!!"
5.0,"I bought this in both colors, blue and black, for a masquerade ball.  It is well constructed and classy for a more formal event.  Packaging was appropriate, and delivery was quick."
5.0,"These pants are stretchy, soft and comfortable!!!  I purchased as scrub bottoms and they are perfect 👍🏾"
5.0,"These are great.  They fit well.  I am short 5' so they are a little longer than I had hoped, but that is normal for me.  I wear Amanda jeans and love them.  These are just as great."
5.0,"I was Really! impressed. So pleasantly surprised :):)can’t wait to give it as a gift. Quality appears nicer! in person.  Loved this product I will probably order again. I ordered a personalized mask, just expected basic product, but got so much more. Nice Looking Very Professional, placement of logos SPOT ON and beautiful THANK YOU:):):)"
5.0,This choker is gorgeous.
5.0,"I wish Toad & Co would give a full description of the product for us to make an informed decision. I usually don't order when the description isn't adequate but I took a chance because I'm familiar with the brand and it turned out for the best. The skirt is worn at the low waist, 22 inches long, a knit made of 48% Tencel, 48% Organic Cotton and 4% Spandex. The waist band on me isn't as gathered as shown on the photo. An ideal skirt for travel."
5.0,Loved this set of earrings! A little smaller than I expected but adorable.
5.0,"I bought this robe for my child a couple of years ago. I originally got it to take to the beach. It worked perfectly to dry off, as a cover up, and for keeping warm. I love that it's a longer length and has deep pockets. I also love that it has a zipper and not just a tie, because kids seem to find zippers easier and there are no worries about the robe tie slipping undone. The robe is such a nice quality that we ended up using it as a bath robe as well. It's been over two years with regular use, washing and drying, and it's still like new. I came looking to buy one for my other child and was disappointed to find them out of stock and unknown whether it would come back in stock. I went with a similar style robe from another brand for the same cost and it was a terrible disappointment! The material on the other brand is so thin and the sleeves so snug that it's difficult to pull on and even more so with wet arms. I was reviewing the items on my saved list and saw this robe still listed as out of stock. Out of longing for this quality robe, I clicked on it anyway and there was just one available!  I bought immediately without a second thought. The 2 year old robe will now be a like-new hand me down for my younger child and the new bigger size for my older child. I'm so relieved to have found one in stock. Originally, the cost seemed high to me, but now I know it lives up and is well worth it. I only wish they made this one in all sizes from kids to teens to adults."
5.0,"Or maybe I have just been spoiled by the my large clothing orders being mostly perfect for my frame.<br /><br />These were a little long and the waist too high for me BUT I am 5'3""<br /><br />As far as the fabric, stitching and color, this is a great pair of pants, just too long for me.<br /><br />I still think they run a little big for a large so I am giving them a personal 4.6 stars."
5.0,As expected ... great price just waiting for the green to come in stock.
5.0,Great fit. Nice light material. Great for the office.
5.0,"This patch from Mil-Spec Monkey is a great addition to any 24-hour pack or MOAB pack.  I like the construction of the patch, the threading feels smooth and the lines of the design are clear and well-drawn.  And it's a bulldog- best dog face in the world."
5.0,My daughter loves playing with this band. It replaced her fidget spinner as those are frowned upon in class. This definitely was infinitely better for fidgety fingers and it always gets a compliment. Love it!
5.0,Great quality. Cute gift for future mother in law. Nice packaging.
5.0,"This was the perfect outfit for my daughter! It's well made, washes great, and fit perfect."
5.0,Super cute and lightweight! They haven't made my ears turn green either.
5.0,Love this set. Its pretty. Great price.
5.0,The lace is pretty and feminine compared to the plain nude Hot Sox Originals I own. The black lace ones are sexy and work well with dress up occasions and you still have bare legs but some foot cover. My feet tend to sweat a lot and when I wear the peds I dont get blisters from by bare skin rubbing against the shoe. What I love about the plain Hot Sox (with the Hot Sox logo stamped on the ball of the foot)  is the rubber gripper in the back of the heal that practically guarantees they will never ever slip off. The lace ones do not have the heel gripper but do manage to stay nicely in place even when Im wearing strap back sandels. They come out perfect from the washer/dryer. The lace is quite durable as my nails and toes nave not poked through at all.  I would buy them again.
5.0,Def runs small per prior reviews so i ordered XL and normally wear M/L or 8/10 cress size AND fits great
5.0,"Very comfortable, soft and light weight"
5.0,"Nice sweat jacket. Not real thick, graffic looks good. For some reason did not have an actual tag on it. Got one next day shipping, came on time."
5.0,"Just got these yesterday and wore them on a short run.  They fit well, and are incredibly light.  I didn't even know I was wearing them.  Time will tell how well they hold up, but at this price, replacing once or twice a year wouldn't be an issue."
5.0,My lil girl liked it alot order 2 of them different sizes but when I got them they were the same size no sizes on the dresses but all in all if they my daughter and my granddaughter
5.0,The Henschel hat I received was a perfect fit and every thing I could hope for. It's just what I needed for protection from the sun on the golf course' where I play almost every day.<br /><br />Thank you for the quick service and a wonderful product.<br /><br />Allen A<br />Ark.
5.0,Will buy again whenever I need another hat!
5.0,They stay on and are really cute
5.0,Many many compliments!!
5.0,My grandson just loves the socks
5.0,Just had the pic
5.0,Very well-made and fit my Maiden Form t-shirt bra perfectly. Be sure you measure the distance between the hooks before ordering to get the right size for your bra.<br />I will order from this company again.
5.0,Beautiful hat - very soft and warm.
5.0,Love. Love. Love!!
5.0,"it’s a classic, came out in 1968, millions have been sold, an still selling them, if one is a watch collector, this should be in your collection as in mine, very small, it’s very light to wear, my every other day watch, very like able watch to have on my 7 inch wrist 💪💯😁"
5.0,These worked great and were very durable for our party favors
5.0,For me work prefect when use my cellphone
5.0,Actually does run true to size. I usually wear an XL and the XL fit fine. Nice item for the price so I bought a second pair in a different color.
5.0,"Love this bag. I'm a &#34;pocket freak&#34; = the more the merrier, and with this bag I still have two pockets that I haven't been able to figure out what lives in them! The pockets are all roomy, loads of space to tuck away anything you could think of. The inner phone pocket is deep enough to safely secure my smartphone, and the zippers on the outer pockets seem to be good quality too.

5.0,fits perfect on a charm bracelet
5.0,I love the material. It’s very soft and easy to breathe through. The fit is very comfortable. I’m an adult with a very small face. I’m not sure why someone would give these a bad review. The material is not thick or difficult to breathe through whatsoever. The filters are nice too.
5.0,I havwe had it for about a year and it dose its JOB.. thats all i needed
5.0,"I bought one size too large—that was my error—but I love the look and feel of this product! There are circular areas where it is not sticky so it’s easier to apply and remove from “sensitive areas”. To clarify, I am a 32A and I accidentally ordered a B cup, that was the only error. Otherwise it would have fit as expected. No worries!"
5.0,What a fun scarf! Can't wait to wear it.
5.0,Love. Fits good.
5.0,Sturdy material. Fits as expected.
5.0,It was finally time to replace my pjs. Comfort as well as feel is very important and these pass the test! Really great.
5.0,Real nice ring. I wear it daily.
5.0,Used this for Disney
5.0,"Very cute, fit is larger than expected which is honestly a plus. I have a 28” waist and ordered the medium<br />Skirt is partially lined and not see through.<br />I’m excited to wear it out!"
5.0,My son loves it. Good Material
5.0,Purchased this item August 17 and delivered August 31st came sooner than expected! Great quality and true to size .
5.0,"My product arrived sooner than the original ship date, woo hoo!!!!!  I had been shopping for a pair of Miss Me crop pants for several months now and finally found a pair that had the design, the fit and the look I wanted.  So, I quickly purchased them and I'm glad I did.  The fit, the comfort and the design are awesome.  I love how soft the demin is, it's like wearing your favorite pj's.  These crop pants were worth every dollar I paid for them."
5.0,"I was nervous about purchasing the mask at first but it was completely worth it! My witch character turned out great and the mask definitely completed the look. I removed some of the feathers and replaced them with beading, the inside of the mask was also stark white upon arrival but I painted it black and it helped make the piece look more realistic. My head is a bit small so the elastic straps didn't fit quite right, but I used the leather cording to tie the mask behind my neck and tucked the elastic up underneath to hide it. Overall a really great piece for the price, I definitely recommend it. I was not paid for this review."
5.0,Love the saying and graphics.  Got one for my daughter and granddaughter they loved them wore them to the zoo and got lots of compliments.
5.0,christmas present they loved it
5.0,"Very nice watch<br /><br />The bidirectional bezel rotates smoothly.<br /><br />The knurling on the buttons is very nice.<br /><br />Setting and synchronizing the time on it was easy.<br /><br />The bracelet clasp snaps crisply and closes securely.<br /><br />The only bad part was that the box did not come with the customary instruction booklets, but this was not advertised in the product description."
5.0,this works good
5.0,pretty and looks even better than in the online photos.
5.0,Very beautiful dress and it fitted me very well. The black lace is very soft and very comfortable to wear
5.0,This product was true to size it was warm and stylish. I wore it for Christmas and received a lot of compliments. Loved it.
5.0,"super cute, I was concerned since i have a bigger head lol that it would be a little small. IT FITS PERFECT! also came in a cute case for protection."
5.0,"My husband's birthday wish this year was for a &#34;nice&#34; watch that he could wear outside work.  However, there was a caveat... get one with PURPLE (his favorite color).  Little did I know how daunting this task would be.  There are few men's watches with faces that are not 1-1/2 to 2 times to width of my husband's wrists.  And of those that would not make him appear to be playing dress-up in his daddy's watch, the number with purple was almost nonexistant.<br /><br />I had not seen this brand of watch before and was leary about purchasing it, especially since the price on Amazon was SIGNIFICANTLY (hundreds of dollars) lower than the few other places I found it.  However after spotting it here (at the time it was sold out), I started looking in stores and found that this brand is quite popular and well respected.  Needless to say Amazon did have this gorgeous watch back in stock and I was able to purchase it where it arrived just in time for his birthday and more importantly his party (so he could show it off).<br /><br />I ordered it on a Sunday evening and it arrived on Friday morning.  It came well packaged in a high-end box (that my husband keeps it in when he is not wearing it) with absolutely NO damage.  This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon and is the reason why I keep coming back... high-end merchandise, rock bottom prices, and sellers like Timepiece Trading."
5.0,The shirt is standard fair but made very nice with the image put upon it. This price here ain't that bad considering the shirt is 6000 yen. I got mine from Cospa itself in the store in Akiba. Though when buying Japanese clothes always buy a size up because they nonsensically size everything down
5.0,Love it Love
5.0,Great paisley design. Hubby loved it.
5.0,This shirt is a lot softer than I expected and truly is one size fits most.
5.0,"Not what I thought it would fit like ,"
5.0,Love them. These keep my frank and beans neatly tucked while working a long hard day. No more nut squishing while sitting in the work truck
5.0,"I made a wise choice, Dr Scholl's tennis shoes are sturdy and extremely comfortable! Very pleased with quality and know these were well worth the cost and will last  longer than most others. Very pleased, very cushiony."
5.0,Looks like a high quality shirt that you'd find at a nice boutique. The detailing on the white lacey fabric is beautiful. I got it in white and its not see through! I can't wait to wear it out. I will say that it runs a little bit on the big side so buy true to size or size down. Great quality for the price!
5.0,This was a great fit for my 5 yr old.  The chain will fit an adult and be a little long for a child.  The pendant is very well made and detailed. My son loved it!
5.0,Very good quality material and soft. Very nice
5.0,Good fit and design. I would recommend :)
5.0,"These a great sock for Pilates. Silky, they stay on, and don't have an annoying seam. I can't stand the grip socks that are toe-less, so these have been a great alternative for me and the quality is great!"
5.0,Great bag! I love this new collection from Matt and Nat. Lightweight and super chic. The strap is comfortable and adjusts as needs with the super cool MN logo. Silver hardware is cool and lends a retro vibe. This bag holds a ton!
5.0,"Raglan sleeves- more puffy than flat. Not my thing, so I gave it to my Nana. Nevertheless, she adores it. And it fits as expected."
5.0,I wanted something soft and cozy but not to hot and this is perfect the lining inside the jacket is soft and smooth I will buy another color !! Love it 😍
5.0,They kind of seems like what you used to get out of the quarter machines
5.0,So pretty. My daughter loves it.
5.0,Very nice quality and styling for the price!
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress! So glad I ordered the package deal with the petticoat, makes such a huge difference in appearance. When I tried this on, I got a ""Whoa!"" from the husband. My kids love it because of the ""twirly skirt."" Will update my review once I've worn it out!"
5.0,"Emulates high price and quality fashion shades tons of compliments, love them."
5.0,Beautiful ordering more
5.0,"This is a really cool design and looks so pretty on! I like the space between the two rings and the overall elegant look of it all. Very shiny, and the stones sparkle beautifully. Happy with this."
5.0,Love this product!  Exactly what I wanted and extremely fast shipping!!  Highly recommended. I'm excited to see the outcome over wearing it for more days.
5.0,Totally beautiful and looks so much more valuable than it is. Very happy with it.
5.0,My grandson loved the pj set. He wore it to school for pajama day!🤗
5.0,This is a good upgrade to the venerable old key ring. Just push the end sideways and even thick car keys can be attached.<br /><br />The titanium has an even finish and the edges are uniform. My guess is they were either laser or water jet cut.<br /><br />Would recommend.
5.0,My husband very satisfied with this key case.  Difficult to find one like it in a store.
5.0,It was a beautiful accessory
5.0,I bought the scarf for my wife ans she is very happy with it. It is warm and comfortable.
5.0,"These are so nice and cute! So happy with them that I bought them in a larger size just in case they are not around when my baby needs to size up. Fun patterns and cute colors - and as a Swedish American, I really like that they include what I decided to see as &#34;Swedish&#34; socks (the yellow and blue ones)! :)"
5.0,"I wish shirt was alittle longer but it was well made, and fits ok."
5.0,"Material is great, color s gorgeous, if you have medium to bigger boobs you maya"
5.0,I like it but its too big like really big lol I think I got a small or medium so idk yeh ok byeeee(•̀ᴗ•́)و
5.0,This product was so convenient when going to restaurants and allowing for us to keep our masks clean while at the table. At home we easily rinsed them for the next time!
5.0,I love them. They are comforts and look good for casual or dressy depending upon the top I choose to wear with them . I love the little invisible pocket on the insidetoo.
5.0,"SUPER CUTE!!!! Love this dress. Paired with a cute pair of heels this is perfect for the summer. I am obsessed with it. The only thing is it’s kind of sheer, so a nude slip or underwear is best... also a bandeau!"
5.0,Great color received a lot of compliments . Fits great.
5.0,"If I could get 10 more I would! Made very well, and still looks new after wearing daily since Christmas."
5.0,"My husband really likes bracelets - well, bracelets and watches. So, I am always on the lookout for interesting new bracelets for him to enjoy. Because he's a little rough on stuff, bracelets don't last too long. He actually had a similar style leather bracelet that we got about six months ago, and we had to superglue it back together - so I am hoping the metal clasp on this one is sturdier. The three bands means that it is more breathable on his skin and as warmer weather approaches, I think that this will be a favorite. The brown leather is nicely braided and he was pretty enthusiastic about it when he opened it. It makes a great gift, and has a nice velvety bag with a drawstring enclosure that is included. My husband has a larger wrist size, and this fits him snugly, but not too snugly, so I would say that it definitely runs to the larger side."
5.0,Love these earrings!  They are light weight and look exactly as the image.  Definitely worth the buy.
5.0,Great caption. Everyone loved it and thought the comment was perfect.
5.0,"I love love this dress. Wore it for my sons first communion and it was perfect.  I am 5'5 145lbs and bought a Medium.  It fit great.  I would definitely buy more, this would be cute for work too.  Ill post a photo when I can upload it."
5.0,"I like my hat. It's my first ever, and It keeps my ears warm."
5.0,Great coat. My husband loves it.
5.0,COOL LOOKING
5.0,"I have struggled to find quality belly button rings for a good price, but I ordered these and I’m extremely impressed with the quality! They looked even better than the pictures, they were delivered so quickly, and I had no issues with the order. I can’t believe they’re less than $12. Definitely would recommend!"
5.0,"These polarized glasses fit well over my glasses and block the sun really well. They don’t slip and slide on my face or scratch my regular glasses. I will definitely buy again.  They are ideal for cloudy, overcast days and for early evening.  I'll be buying again."
5.0,Very beautiful. I’m all for beautiful pretty things.
5.0,"Wearing it now!! Super comfy and soft. The armpits come down a little further than expected (nothing a bandeau bra or tank top won't fix), but other than that it is exactly how I thought it would be!! True to size."
5.0,These feel great and stay up all day just like my other nurse mate stockings.
5.0,Great tanks. Order more now
5.0,My daughter loves this. Fit true to size and is super soft.
5.0,I plan on buying these as a novelty item. If people are expecting an $8 pair of glasses straight out of the Sci fi channel be anything more than they have high expectations.
5.0,"The Shoeslocker boys winter slip on slippers are so cute. The quality is good as the elastic band is not too loose, it’s a tight elastic yet expansive enough to offer comfort.  The interior has memory foam while the soles are hard & waterproof for outdoor use with tiny beaded treads for grip. The colors are dark navy blue with vibrant colorful cartoon dinosaurs which is perfect for any little dinosaur lover. These slippers appear durable, warm & make a great introduction to a little ones first big boy/girl slippers. The item is out of stock at the moment so I can’t comment on pricing, but would recommend."
5.0,I wear these all the time and get a ton of compliments!
5.0,I love this bling mask!  I got it to wear to an upcoming formal wedding and think it will look fabulous.
5.0,Love this green sport bag a lot! It’s so much space in it.
5.0,"I notice my eyes don't burn while using a smart phone or tablet. Less eye fatigue. These glasses don't distort colors, and the strength I bought for close-up use is just as accurate as my other store-bought readers. I do wish these came with a token  storage case or pouch: they came in a thin cardboard box.<br /><br />Also-- glossy magazines pages are easier to read, as the glasses cut the glare"
5.0,Worked great for our project with iron on transfer
5.0,I adore these and really wish I had more places to wear them! They're on the fancy side for me. GREAT size.
5.0,It's exactly like the picture. The printing was perfect & the case was so soft.
5.0,My daughter loves these shades and she loves the carrying case too. (Which can also hold other treasures!) She’s a fan and therefore so am I!
5.0,"Great quality, but discolored pretty quick and had to change out after a little over 2 months"
5.0,"Very comfy and after many washes,  they still fit great."
5.0,"Love this dress! Bought it to wear to work and it is great-- super comfortable, good material, perfect length. I am about 130 lbs and 5'4, and got a small; it fits great. Got a ton of compliments!"
5.0,"I purchased both the Chasse dance bag, which is more like a compact duffle bag, and this bag, the Arabesque, which is more like a tote. Both are of the Principal Bag Collection made by Danshuz, and both are well constructed, stylish and suit my purposes, which is to carry around my ballroom shoes and such.<br /><br />When I need to bring more than two pairs of shoes and other stuff with me, this bag, the Arabesque, is my go-to bag because it is roomier and has more zippered pockets. Also its side pockets for water bottles are deeper, so the bottles are less likely to fall out. But since the Arabesque is deeper than the BPC04 chasse bag, you have to dig around more to find stuff.<br /><br />So both bags have their merits and are good buys, depending upon your needs."
5.0,Awesome dress. I got married in the ivory dress XL. I am 5'11 210 lbs.
5.0,The bathing suit was just to large.  It has a very nice look and wish I had ordered a smaller size however I went by the recommendations.
5.0,My little sister loved this and it's super cute
5.0,"First pair bought 5 years ago. Great for oldies like me with tired eyes. I love the twisting legs so it makes them so easy to store anywhere.<br />Just gotta be careful if you put them in your trouser's pockets, as they might bend when you are sitting.<br />Lens quality I find it good since I do not perceive any deformity in my visual."
5.0,I've been buying Russell crew neck sweatshirts for years because they are made well fit perfect and warm and comfortable
5.0,I wore this on my bridal bouquet
5.0,very simple item
5.0,"Love these, they fit awesome with my boots!"
5.0,"Perfect fit, for my not so small son. Lightweight and cool."
5.0,Útil y práctico para llevar en el bolsillo
5.0,"These surprised me! I pulled out of package and thought too small, even though I ordered a large. I usually wear Med-:to large depending on maker. But these are true to fit ! Super soft light weight ! Dog hair -lint roller right off ! Nice deep pockets, draw string waist w/ elastic . I haven't washed yet, but they should b fine if use the recommended wash instructions. Jet black! Also I like that the cuff can slide up your calf and holds in place ! All way stretch ! ❤️❤️❤️"
5.0,This is a pretty watch and and softens the look of the Apple Watch. Easy to attach and well made. Exactly as shown.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:41fe3ecd21841b30aa5bfb6e3a92e4a5]] Excelente calidad y súper trendy
5.0,The picture does not show how pretty and delicate the necklace is. It looks very expensive. You can't find anything this nice for such a reasonable price in a store. LOVE IT!!
5.0,"I love the stylish colors of these scarves. They can be used in a multitude of ways, and they are a great size. The design is timeless and you can use these to wear as an accessory, in your hair, or even use in home décor. They are durable and silky soft. Very pleased with these!"
5.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and 165#lbs.  ordered large and very happy. The sides do go down fairly low so I may alter it so I can wear around the family.
5.0,"I bought my first pair while on vacation in Ogunquit, ME. Loved them so much, I went to Amazon to see if they carried them - and, of course, they did! I purchased two more pairs for me and a pair for my daughter for Christmas. They are a little pricey, but I definitely think they're worth it!"
5.0,Gorgeous boots and great quality!! My new favorites!!
5.0,"I'm so pleased that I found these locking earring backs! They work perfectly. I purchased the sterling backs, and they look great."
5.0,"The summer cricket hat arrived in time for the Cricket World Cup; delivery ws fast. The cap fits, a not unimportant concern. It is, like most things, made in China. Washing instructions, if it can be washed, are in symbols. That aside, it is a good fit for the summer: the sun is blocked from one's eyes; the hat is cool and comfortable; and it has the Three Lions of England."
5.0,The best legginssss!😻😻❤️❤️  135lb 40 hips... small! ✅
5.0,My fiancé loved it! Thankyou! Perfect size!

5.0,The paint on the hook is starting to come out from rubbing on the card holder. Great product though. Tactical look and good materials.
5.0,"outstanding shoes, has helped me with plantar fasciitis tremendously"
5.0,This pendant fits nicely around my neck.  Not bulky or uncomfortable to wear.  It has an excellent look to it with a great shine.
5.0,"I bought both the brown belt and the reversible belt and I love them both.  Both are very high quality.  I've had the reversible belt for more than 2 years and, so far, it has no signs of wear. These guys know how to make a real leather belt that lasts. They may be a little more expensive, but they are completely worth it."
5.0,Great gloves.  Great fit.  Bought size Youth-Small for my 6-year-old son who is about 4 feet tall and 48 lbs.  They fit great and look like they will continue to fit for this year.  I wish they had gloves this cool when I started to ride!
5.0,Quality of item was superb. Ever so grand packaging. Speedy to send. Seller is fine and superlative.
5.0,Great earrings.  These were a replacement of my old ones and they are perfect.  They do not make my ears hurt.

5.0,Love this....looked even better in person!
5.0,"This was a great addition to my wardrobe!  Probably my favorite.  Fits very nice, and the ties at the bottom allow me to determine how lose or tight I want it."
5.0,"More than amazing! Very good quality, and very shiny!"
5.0,I love it! Wear it as often as I can :)
5.0,I really liked these ear rings. The price was great and quality good. Not to big just the right size.
5.0,"I love these things.  When you have something that is really hard to get on a regular key ring, just slip this guy in in then screw it closed to get a ring.  Nice and solid and plenty of threads on the screw so that it stays secure."
5.0,"It is a gift for my husband.  It is so soft, we both love bamboo products.  Haven't washed it yet but I've never had issues with bamboo items shrinking or fading when washed."
5.0,"This summer dress is STUNNING!  The colors are bright, bold and sharp (""high definition"")!  I wish I'd purchased a smaller size, however I will keep it and tailor it to fit!"
5.0,Cute socks which will work great for summer weather.
5.0,"Love this shirt! Bought it as a maternity shirt,  will probably continue to wear it as a regular shirt. Very soft."
5.0,I love it but sometimes it gets to tight at night my arm swells so I don't wear it while sleeping!! Other that I like it !!
5.0,This is a quality product so don't be fooled by the cheaper ones from another company. This is the one you need. Well worth the money. I will buy again.
5.0,I have bought several types of socks for my wife and these by far are her favorite. The fit is as expected and they are comfortable for her when running. They actually are compression socks that work.
5.0,very pretty but huge.
5.0,"using this has helped with sun rash, which has now cleared up.  I wear it when working outside as volunteer at the Botanical Gardens.  Also helps somewhat avoid insect bites"
5.0,"Cute, fun, easy-to-wear...let your ankle shine."
5.0,Use it for a keychain or hang it on your handbag. It’s very well made and looks great on my beige and black handbag.
5.0,Very Well
5.0,"The Unicorn necklace is so sweet and beautiful the Mother and Baby , oh so wonderful and the little phrase I love you for always and forever is so calming and so beautifully sentimental, you'll love this piece , oh also the pendant is a nice size a nice thickness but not tremendously heavy its just perfect ,  what I used it for a treat for myself of course well a pre Christmas treat for me 😆😊"
5.0,"Received today, beautiful shirt, fits perfectly, rugby shirts should fit loosely,usually wear L or XL., purchased XL, price of shirt for the quality is better than rugby shirts twice the price."
5.0,These boots are the cutest boots I have seen in a long time.  I get so many compliments on them.  Everyone wants to know where I got them at so I refer them to the Amazon website.  The fit is very good and the first time I wore them I was able to wear them all day.  My days are about 15 hour days and that says a lot about this particular style and comfort of the booties.
5.0,Very cute and look like the picture. Got them for my daughter and she LOVES them. They fit and wash well.
5.0,"Im 5'3, 36-31-36 & Ordered a Small. It fits sexy and not as &#34;loose fit&#34; as shown on model."
5.0,&#60;3 Beautiful and comfortable.  I wear 8- 8 1/2 in most shoes. Ordered size 40 and they are perfect.
5.0,"Beautiful, love it!!!!!!!<br />I like this necklace and earring set so mush that I just bought another one.<br />I've had many complements on it."
5.0,beautiful and quality was great
5.0,"I live in California, and these were shipping from China. However, this thing shipped to me in about 6 days. I don't know about you, but from China to California, 6 days is a fast shipping rate for me. The straps themselves are a little short, but good enough for my clay charms. If only they had a mix of the basic colors, that'd be great.<br /><br /> Overall this item is great for it's price and shipping. I would def. recommend this to anyone."
5.0,"I ordered the 22mm black size band for my Samsung Galaxy S3 Frontier. I own several bands for that watch - a Milanese loop band, a leather band, a metal link band, a Velcro band, etc. The only rubber band I owned was the one included in the purchase of the watch itself. However I found that band uncomfortable - so uncomfortable that I had to take my watch off every 30 mins or so to readjust it somehow. When I saw this watch band for a 6 dollar price, I impulsively bought it. It looks like an apple watch strap, so I was intrigued. When it arrived, it arrived in a small bag with the strap itself, an extra quick release pin (in addition to the two already in the strap) and a sort of necklace like contraption and I'm not sure quite what that's for. Based off of first impressions, the band was easy to put on, comfortable to wear, and exactly the look I was going for.<br />Seems like a great band for working out or casual wear.<br />Will update in a few weeks to address the durability."
5.0,"i love it, it feel really nice and the bra is slightly loose but still have the support."
5.0,Over 60 decided to get these to wear to work I clean houses. I wish I had gotten a bigger size. Just one size bigger. I wear large in shirts two x would work better for me I think there too small understand the arms.
5.0,My husband needed a key chain for our new jeep but did not want one that was bulky or too heavy. This key ring/chain is perfect! It is not too heavy or too large. It is also very easy to get the keys on without fighting with the split rings that can be so frustrating.
5.0,"Im 6', 195 and a bit on the athletic side with just a bit of a belly and a medium that fits perfectly.  I look pretty good in it and the bf likes it, so even better."
5.0,I use this wallet everyday I love it!<br />No complaints!
5.0,"I bought it to test out having a septum piercing if it would be too annoying etc, and so far, except for the pain part, it has done it's job. And it looks great!"
5.0,Great for a party
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!  I ordered 5 for bridesmaids.
5.0,"Love this sweater. I paired it with my favorite dark denim, though I feel like it could really pop against white or gray denim too! The thick yarn makes it not the warmest sweater I own, but very cute and cozy!<br /><br />For your reference, I ordered a small and my personal measurements are:<br />Bust: 35 Waist: 29 Hips: 36 Height: 5’4<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful! If it was, would you be so kind to mark it as such? Also, if you appreciate this review and enjoy other great deals, I’d love to connect with YOU! Come say hello on FB/IG!  Happy shopping, friends! @prettycheapmama"
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and she is in love with them. They are real cute and soft
5.0,This perfect!  Classy enough to wear to work or out on the town.  Night light weight material.  Go by the size chart and you will be fine.
5.0,I'm lovin 'it
5.0,Love this dress and so does my daughter
5.0,"Well made, looks classic and clean and like it costs more than it does. A great staple."
5.0,"These are a great buy. I have one on my key chain to get in doors, on my dog leash to pick up...after dark, by my washer when something falls out of a pocket & underneath. I even put one in my fusebox for when the power goes out. Bright and handy! Gotta love it!"
5.0,"I should start by saying that I am cold natured and do not like being cold, so this is a fabulous addition to my life!!<br />It’s really warm, really big, and super comfortable! The fabric is soft and fluffy. It’s warm without being heavy and confining. The fit is really big on me. I’m 5’3” and this hoodie goes to my knees. It’s built wide, so when I sit cross cross applesauce or curled up, my legs are in the hoodie. The sleeves are long enough to cover my hands (with length to spare) but the cuffs are fitted enough to keep the sleeves out of my way. The overall construction and quality is excellent. It’s really well made. It washes and dries well, stays fluffy, and doesn’t pill or shed.<br />Out of all of the “blanket hoodie” or “Snuggie” type things I have gotten over the years, this is my favorite!  I’m so pleased with this hoodie that I have ordered a 2nd one for me. My mother in law and daughter have already tried to steal this one away from me, so I’ll also either have to get them each one or convince them to buy their own and leave mine alone!<br />If you need a snuggly, sit on the couch hoodie-I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,"Came much faster than i expected concidering it came from china. This is nicely made, doesnt feel cheap, and fits the wrist well- not too snug and not too loose. My daughter will love this"
5.0,Comfortable fits good. After being washed and dried it stayed in tact and didn't stretch out or pop threads. The pads inside did move but of course they would but there adjustable.
5.0,tough as can be long battery life i love these watches some people don't like the light because it's not that bright but keep in mind the brighter the light the faster it eats the battery
5.0,"Great quality, great look. This jacket is exactly what I expect it to be (except for the name &#34;toddler boys&#34;-- I bought this for my daughter. Girls can dream of flying too)."
5.0,"Look small before you put them on but have plenty of stretch and really look nice on your feet. The fabric was a bit different than what was expected but nice just the same. The gray can be worn with so much. I'll very likely purchase another color or two, at a later date. Other than trying them on, I can't vouch to their performance as I have not used them, yet."
5.0,I LOVE this top! It’s so comfortable and is the perfect summer top!
5.0,"Love the fit, larger in shoulders then it tapers<br />down"
5.0,Looks great!!!
5.0,Very comfortable and fit great
5.0,"very nice, came with extra ring for attaching to charm bracelet"
5.0,This is perfect for what I need it for.  Great on sizing.  Looks great.
5.0,"Fits well and not snug, nice material"
5.0,"I love it, I have gotten so many compliments on it. I love Bella Taylor"
5.0,Elastic waistband and side pockets make this a great workout short. Phone in side pocket does not get in the way while doing squats or any other bending exorcise.
5.0,It was just what my daughter needed.
5.0,"First I hate carrying a large purse.  Normally I just want to grab my keys, my phone and a wallet of some sort.  However, it has become an issue doing so because my phone is too large and cumbersome to fit in my pants pocket.  If I am wearing a skirt or dress, I am struck carrying it around with all my other junk.  This is wonderful clutch that my iPhone fits in perfectly.  It combines my wallet and phone into one item and has a lead to put around my wrist.  The perfect solution to my problem.  The clutch itself is well made, looks like real leather and the mustard yellow color is fantastic."
5.0,I absolutely loved this dress! It fit so well and true to size. I was so comfortable in it and the material didn't awkwardly hug my body. It hung just right and flattered the parts that needed flattering and hid the parts that needed hiding.
5.0,Just received my flip ups the other day after a less than good experience with a more expensive pair. They are great.
5.0,Amount of pressure exactly what I need
5.0,This is a nicer looking skirt than I was expecting for the price. It fits well and moves it well. Very satisfied.
5.0,The leather quality on this watchband is wonderful! I was very surprised by how nice it was. It looks like it will last a very long time and the color is very true to the photos.<br />I did receive this at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest review of this item.
5.0,I purchased this apron as a gift for my mom. She absolutely loves it. Its durable and stylish.
5.0,"Lightweight material, comfortable, and fits just right. Will get again."
5.0,I love it!! I ordered an xtra small  - I'm 5' 3&#34; - weigh 129 and it fits perfectly. I covered it in silver jewelry and wore it to a play; I got so many compliments that I got embarrassed!
5.0,Lovely tops my little lady love them perfect fit looks just the picture nice picturs on each top.
5.0,The fit was perfect and a great value for the money.  The material does not feel cheap...very nicely made.
5.0,made my beautiful princess look more beautiful-er!
5.0,"Sturdy construction, works well in the wind because of the venting, no issue with the mechanism for opening and closing. The spring for extending the umbrella is pretty strong, so it took a minute for me to get used to, though I do have fairly weak hands, and my partner has no trouble with it whatsoever. The actual canopy material seems quality, and i at first thought it was a double layer because of how well it blocked the sun. Hopefully the silver doesn’t wear off too much over time!"
5.0,"fits all belt loops, stays locked, no slip.<br />washable web material... 5 stars."
5.0,I purchased these for my husband that suffers from plantar fasciitis and has flat feet. We did 3 days at Disney World from sun up to sun down and he had no complaints! This will be the only brand of walking shoe that I purchase. He was impressed and so was I. They also came with an interchangeable insert (less of an arch support)
5.0,"I didn't expect it to be as thin as it is, but it is a very beautiful scarf, perfect for spring... I actually went back and purchased 2 more..."
5.0,"This is my second order of these hooded shirts.  They're good year round.<br /><br />I ordered XXL.  I'm 5'11"", broad shoulders, 40 waist, 50 chest..... fits just fine without the sleeves.<br /><br />I've washed them several times and am pleased with the quality of the material."
5.0,It was a perfect gift for someone who likes dragon.  It has a very nice weight with delicate details.  The size is just right.
5.0,Absolutely stunning - from the product to the packaging!
5.0,I was expecting a t shirt but very cute with a stretch.
5.0,Great little item.
5.0,Very pretty - as Pictured on the site.  Haven’t worn it yet but will very soon.  I am very pleased with the necklace.
5.0,Fun additions to your look.
5.0,Love the color and the saying
5.0,"Super soft, I wish I could have a blanket this soft. I will be getting more."
5.0,Fun and fits well
5.0,Makes life smell sweeter!
5.0,"The sunglasses arrived 2 days after ordering. I was worried they might be damaged since the box was dented/damaged but they weren't. Yeah! Because I love these sunglasses!<br />I like how both pairs fit. The all black ones fit snuggly (don't slip) and feel/seem sporty without looking like sport glasses. This pair doesn't have an adjustable nose bridge. The white with stars pair fit nice and the adjustable nose bridge allows for a customized fit. This pair looks a little dressier.<br />In my opinion, these 2 for the price is a great deal! While I've only had them a day or so, I think they're sturdy and will be good for years, unless I lose them. If I lose them I'll buy more!"
5.0,I really was leery about these and wasn't going to buy them but they arnt bad at all. They are comfy and hold up pretty well. Doesn't fall apart like the foam ones
5.0,Good quality and shipped fast! :)
5.0,I purchased them for my support.  I need to tie the laces really tight so my ankle doesn't slip out of place..
5.0,Thank you for my order very stylish
5.0,"Well since this is our sons second Christmas, (he was an infant the first Christmas), I thought it would be fun to get us all matching Christmas jammies. For size reference, I wear a 29 in jeans, and am 36B and generally get a size Medium in my clothing, so I ordered a medium. It fits perfect on me, not too tight and not loose. Very comfortable even to sleep in. My husband wears a 36 in jeans and generally gets a large in T-shirts, I ordered him a large. It fits him well too, just as expected. And Nixon is 1 year and 2 months old. We ordered the smallest size for him which was for a 2 year old, other than being a little long in the pants, it fits him perfect too. We all think they fit comfortably. We have posted a couple pictures of us online and received many compliments. The colors are vibrant and rich. The light bulb designs are very festive and pretty. The material is stretchy and like T-shirt material but softer. About the same thickness as a t shirt but not stiff. All the stitching is good, they are well made. I recommend these to get your family in the Christmas spirit."
5.0,FUE EL ACCESORIO IDEAL DE MI ARREGLO
5.0,The dress is very pretty in person and fits as it should
5.0,no doll. just robes
5.0,Gift for my aunt. She loves them as we are Dutch
5.0,These are great warm socks
5.0,This dress runs really big and I definitely got the wrong size
5.0,Love it1
5.0,"I'm always hesitant to order clothes online, especially from unknown brands. Unfortunately I usually end up wearing them once or twice and donating them because I just don't feel great in them. This dress is an exception! It's actually very flattering and the material feels great as well. I'm 5'9"" and ordered a L. When I ordered it I was just over 200lbs and now I'm 170lbs - it was tight when I ordered it and now it fits very nicely without being TOO loose. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,My grandson wanted this for Halloween. Great decision to buy. He loved it and received great comments from neighbors and friends.
5.0,I was looking for something unique to wear during this pandemic that kinda looked like I had a smile. This design is very well made. Fits perfectly and looks like it were my actual lips.
5.0,My husband love it!!
5.0,I bought this for my daughter who says it fits great and she likes it.
5.0,Did not fit but customer service came through
5.0,Bought this for my 4-yr old nephew. He's assisting with holiday cookie baking; he loves pretending to be chef. This apron and hat added to the fun!
5.0,My husband loves the hat and especially the snaps!
5.0,"So ""flirty"" & ""flattering"".<br />I purchased two!"
5.0,Best case I have had dropped so many times pieces were broke lose from case phone was never damaged
5.0,Beautiful pearls. They are so long I wil have to think of different ways to wear them.
5.0,Didnt have my size so I bought it to make into a pillowcase for Halloween. Love the colors & the fabric will last many years. Glad I took a chance
5.0,OMG these were amazing.  Loved loved loved them.  Yo would never be disappointed and very well made
5.0,"My son LOVED it!  The quality is nice- not as thick and plush as some robes but still a good weight and very soft.  The fit is 99% as expected for a one-size fits most.  We wish the sleeve length was a tad longer as they are perfect now but with washing/drying and shrinkage-they will be above the wrists. (My son is right at 6 ft tall) Over-all, very happy with the purchase and would order again."
5.0,They fit me well and I am happy with them.
5.0,"Quality is something not often found in clothing for kids anymore. However, this bathing suit set is the exception. Really wonderful colors and super durable. Highly recommend."
5.0,I love this shirt it is seriously just so soft! I love the way it feels and it is 100% flowy as stated in the product info. I couldn't be happier!!
5.0,Bought this for my mother for Mother's Day. She loved it. We bought it because she had wanted onyx/gold jewelry. Item arrived as advertised. And delivery was faster than advertised. Would do business with Golden Dragon again without hesitation.
5.0,I was surprised how much I like these glasses. I wear them driving and the lens quality is amazingly good at this or any price point.  Make no mistake: these re really pretty inexpensive sunglasses and they will not take much punishment. I keep these in my car and only wear them while driving and the polarization and dark lenses are perfect for what I need.
5.0,I like the bag and cannot wait to get it and use it.
5.0,"Seriously,  this is my favorite pj set i own! Good quality. Very soft, I'm 5'7 & 165lbs, and a medium fits perfect. Definitely going to grab another style ( once they go back on sale :) )."
5.0,Wow... it's very beautiful set!!
5.0,They were  for  granddaughter
5.0,My nephew cried when he opened them.. he said it was best gift ever
5.0,It was so beautiful and thick and comfy to wear.
5.0,"Absolutely loving this watch! I can't understand how can this $7 make me smile like other more expensive automatic watches. The quality is remarkable for the price, all details are crisp. The bracelet is very well made as well. It is so thin and lightweight you will forget you have it on, perfect for the gym, the pool, and for work as well if you work in a casual workplace like me"
5.0,So comfy and cute! The fit is flattering and the color is pretty.  Goes well with leggings and jeans.  Definitely a must in your closet!
5.0,Awesome fit and great socks
5.0,"Perfect color and fit. I love the fact it's not super short, going bellow my knees. I wear 36C and the Large is somewhat loose on the chest, so it's great to wear with a bra."
5.0,"Fits great. Not a heavy sweatshirt, but just what I was looking for. It doesn't have that fleecing lining that pills. I haven't washed it yet but it looks like it would wash well. Wish they had more colors. I would buy several."
5.0,The item fits and the ends of eyeglasses. I use them for ballet and modern dance. In ballet the eyeglasses stay on in multiple pirouettes and other postures. In yoga and fitness classes the eyeglasses stay in place in every posture even standing on my head.<br /><br />Some exercises require my placing my face on the ground in the prone position. Those are the only times I remove the eyeglasses completely. They are extremely uncomfortable even though the item holds them in place.
5.0,"I was a little skeptical when I ordered these lenses, based upon the price but...Wow, I have to say that both the &#34;build&#34; and the optical quality is excellent! For the crazy low price you get lenses that are polarized and dare I say it, probably better than the original Oakley lenses. The lenses are slightly more opaque (meaning you can see your eyeballs through them) than the original lenses but I have absolutely no qualms about recommending this brand of lenses!"
5.0,Worked perfect and convenient
5.0,"Very pretty and big, just the look I wanted."
5.0,These are the perfect tie for all the groomsmen at my sons wedding.  Thanks for your help and your timely shipment! Quality is good and color is perfect.  As my son said &#34;they are SICK&#34;... ie. We LOVE them!  Thanks!
5.0,Nice wear…
5.0,"Amazing comfort, great value"
5.0,Exactly what I needed and great price.
5.0,"They're a little tight, & not as cotton-y as I would like, but they're beautiful, & a great value. Definitely recommend."
5.0,"It looks really elegant with any outfit I wear, can't beat the price."
5.0,Love the material and the color
5.0,"Cute, well made, medium weight.  Non skids on bottom."
5.0,Fit perfectly and super cute!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e160d6f349d34f241c4b97fd15de2ef3]] The price is great. I have a mission belt too and believe this to be a great value when compared. The 1/4 inch locks are just as good. The belt uses the buckle to undo it vs a latch on the side of a mission belt. This is easier to undo but can be undone probably in a very odd circumstances when it is not intended (unlike the mission). The leather does not seem real when cut and compared to the mission belt and my other geninue leather belts. But it does not feel as though it is going to fray like plether. I would recommend this to professionals who do not have a physical intensive job. I think having this in addition to a mission belt is a complete value set in my mind. One brown and one black. The buckle is a nice quality too. The belt is easy to cut to size too.
5.0,Muy comodos ajuste perfecto
5.0,Getting compliments on them !
5.0,Read the reviews and order one size larger and it was perfect
5.0,"Fit is good, the material is comfortable, and the design is flattering. Love the look!  The racer back is a bit of work for me to get on, but I have never worn one of these before. I am anxious to see how long the suit will last with 3 to 4  2-hour sessions of water aerobics per week in  a  chlorinated pool.  I expect it will last a long time. Definitely a product I would recommend."
5.0,"I needed a pair of slippers for my grandson who seems to have a funny shoe size, 11 wouldn't fit but 12 looked like clown shoes on him.  I saw these slippers and bought them.  Last year I couldn't get him to keep slippers on,I live in Boston and our floors are cold (no rugs).  MY grandson saw them and loved them he wears them all the time toy Story is his favorite  movie. They also fit good.  Quick delivery."
5.0,It’s exactly what I wanted and it came in a cute little bag!
5.0,"Nice detail, good size, substantial without being heavy, smooth and nicely finished.  My kid loves it.  Like the story card included.  Thanks!"
5.0,These pants are very well made.  They are also nice looking on (according to my other half).  I bought these to lounge atound the house in the winter and she is much happier to see these instead of boxer shorts.
5.0,"Awesome. Holds more then I expected, and is still super slim!"
5.0,Fit great. Great condition.
5.0,Many quotes to choose from for the price. Shipped quickly.
5.0,Very cozy and comfortable
5.0,"I received my  Tulsi Italian bracelet! It shipped promptly and arrived in a beautiful sturdy hard cardboard box, impressive. I absolutely love it and it fits perfectly , I got the 6.5 inch one. The leather is a perfect dark brown color and the turquoise stone is set in the leather very sturdy. Excellent quality. I wear it every day and it goes with absolutely everything. It speaks for itself. Couldn't be happier. Grazie!"
5.0,Loved this sweater!!!
5.0,"ORCHID ROW KIMONO PRINTED CHIFFON OPEN FRONT<br /><br />I love this shirt!  This is a one size fits all and that is true.  I am 5'4"" and a chubby girl and this kimono fits me just fine.  I just wish it was a little longer as it hits a tad below my waist.  I generally like to wear my tops below the waist -- but this kimono is so pretty and bright that I am making an exception!<br /><br />My kimono is bright red with leaf-like designs scattered all over.  These leaves are light blue, black, orange, beige and are very pretty and eye-catching.  The seams are all well made and sewn well.  These is a small tie in front that you may or may not wish to use.  I left my kimono hang open.  I wear this with jeans and a top.  I even wore it with black dress pants and a long black shirt.  I must say the kimono dressed up my outfit and I felt I looked nice and felt very comfortable.<br /><br />This kimono is 100% polyester/chiffon.  You should machine wash in cold water and line dry.  This worked well and I didn't even need to use an iron for any touch up.<br /><br />This is light weight and you can wear for any occasion and in any type of weather.  It is attractive, colorful, and comfortable.  The kimono comes in a variety of colors - I am sure there are one or more of these that will appeal to you!<br /><br />Recommended!"
5.0,This is the prettiest and well-made purse that I have ever owned!  I get compliments on it all the time. Because of the different surfaces it is so unique!  And I love the fact that it stands up and the bottom is protected by silver studs.
5.0,Interesting looking and confortable.
5.0,"This is a very well made wallet! It has plenty of rooms for a lot of business cards and the various plastic cards we all seem to accumulate, without resorting to the cheap plastic foldout card books found in many wallets. For an oversized wallet, it's also not much bigger than a regular wallet. It's not a big bulky wallet that you can't carry in your back pocket. The quality of the leather is nice as well. I pulled out my new wallet at my pharmacy a few days after I got it and the pharmacist said, &#34;Hey, that's a cool looking wallet! What kind is it?&#34; When I told him the brand name, he said he had never heard of it, but when I told him how much it was, he was impressed and stated he was going to look it up on Amazon since he was in the market for a new wallet also and really liked the looks of this one."
5.0,Exactly as expected - gift to myself...
5.0,Great for gift bags
5.0,This belt is better than I expected!!~! LOVE LOVE LOVE this belt
5.0,Grandpa loves it!
5.0,Beautiful but I wish it were longer.
5.0,"As of this date, I've not been able to find this tote in this color anywhere. In other colors, these totes go for anywhere from $99.00 up to $228.00. I paid a bit more on the high end for this tote because of the availability of the color. Overall, it's a great tote. I love the four pockets on the outside of the bag. The straps are adjustable which is also nice. I also love that the leather is very soft and that the overall weight of the bag is light."
5.0,Great purse! Lots of pockets and looks clean.  Material is really nice.
5.0,"I've gotten a lot of compliments on this shirt, I love it. It is very cool feeling cause of the sleeves, I usually wear Medium & ordered it, it was a little snug around bust area but I think it was fine for me. But, it you'd like a little more loose around bust area, I'd go a size up."
5.0,"Very cute cup, love it"
5.0,"These belts are reasonably priced work great.  One other advantage is, since the buckles are all plastic, they don't set off the metal detector at my work."
5.0,My brother loved this keychain it was a Christmas gift but I gave him to him early. He was so excited when I gave it to him.
5.0,I loved this earrings it was a present ! Very good quality!
5.0,Beautiful Tie set!!
5.0,Product fit true to description and was better than expected for $6
5.0,Very cute and comy socks! Great quality. Will buy again!!
5.0,"Item came faster than expected and was 100 percent as described. The Flint is easy to light, compass easy to read, whistle loud and clear and all around a quality product. Very satisfied!"
5.0,Minimal breakin
5.0,Fits great. Love the (whatever) on it.
5.0,"These pants are so comfortable, they are like pajama bottoms, but look really dressy. I love them. The material is really thin so I wear tights underneath."
5.0,I purchased this for a friend for her birthday. She loved it. The material fits her well
5.0,It's a very deep v but I like it like that :)
5.0,Looks great on. Nice thicker fabric so it is not see through and is super soft on the inside.
5.0,Nice gifte.
5.0,This was a gift  for my & year old granddaughter and she loved it!
5.0,This robe is super nice! I paid like $10 for it and it came with a tag that said suggested retail $68. The tie around the waist is attached which is great and it has pockets. Perfect!
5.0,Luv luv this hat I had one 2 decades ago and it was destroyed.  Glad to have it back in my collection.
5.0,I love this hat will order more Nike hats I wear a lot of blue shirts so this goes w a lot of what I wear I gotten lotta compliments wearing it
5.0,"Can I give these 6 stars? I got these to protect and cool my arms for 'sun-running' in Texas. 'Sun-running' is a silly game where I pick the hottest and most humid day to go for a long run, and hopefully, have a great run without having a heat stroke. Note: I have been doing this for awhile, and do not recommend you try this at home. In any event, I normally pay 2-3 times more for sleeves, thus I was startled when I received 2 pairs. So, wow, pretty good value. They do look fantastic (I will upload pics soon) as the colors really pop. My favorite thing about these, besides cooling and protecting my arms from sun damage, is the band strung around the inside of the arm that holds the sleeve up on my upper arms. This really matters to me because I have 17 inch+ biceps (bought the XL size and they fit perfectly), while other arm bands have slid down while running. You will love these."
5.0,Better than I Expected!
5.0,"Like one reviewer said, they are more substantial than I thought they'd be, which is nice. Style is classic contemporary and they are very sturdy (they stood up to my kids' &#34;helping me&#34; open the box and try them on...several other earrings have broken with that type of &#34;help&#34;) which was a pleasant surprise and just what I needed. The design is delicate, which is a nice contrast to the structure. Love the color. Super pretty! I'm am happy I had the opportunity to purchase these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  On another note, I had a question about my order and contacted the seller. She responded immediately and was so helpful. Great customer service."
5.0,"Right color, right design, right price"
5.0,Love love love this bracelet!
5.0,The material was very soft and the leggings were long enough for my hieght
5.0,My second pair of Cobian flip-flops. I like the material and the cushioning and the feel and the fit. I wear a size 9 shoe but I get a size 10 in flip-flops and this 1 extra size works great for this type footwear.
5.0,"I Love, love my new swimsuit! It fits perfectly. I really like that the chest padding isn't bulky nor stiff. Excellent product for the price. I ordered a size Large. I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 147 lbs."
5.0,Excellent colour!
5.0,"Overall it's good,  for me I prefer a more structured crown. But its fine"
5.0,cute and flattering swim suit.  I am impressed for the price how nicely this suit is made.
5.0,"Stylish and lightweight, these sunglasses are great for glare reduction. Everything looks crisp through them. Only odd thing to note is that I see a greenish haze for a few minutes after I take them off. Truly like these sunglasses."
5.0,Arrived very quickly in a nice box. The cuff links were nicer than I imagined. Sturdy feel and nice engraved style design. Many compliments from the honchos at work. Good seller to work with
5.0,"Easy to breathe through, lightweight"
5.0,Looks sporty and fits perfectly
5.0,The fit is nice. Good material. Just as good as the high dollar ones. Buy here!
5.0,I purchased this hat to wear to a Derby party and it is so adorable.<br />I arrived in fine shape and will be a hit at the event.<br />I ordered another one to wear next year.<br />Thanks Amazon for coming through for me.
5.0,"Got this to wear to a music festival under tank tops! Got a TON of compliments on it and it held up spectacularly. Not amazing quality, but it was only $12."
5.0,Looks great on my Wife
5.0,Love love love the cape drapes beautifully over your body good quality I highly recommend
5.0,Good purse
5.0,"The watch looks even better in person! I specifically bought it because of what it looked like in some pictures posted by reviewers and I am not disappointed. I've had it for a couple weeks now and it's very accurate. I haven't needed to change the time since setting it. Something cool that I didn't know is that you can set the language for the day indicator. I think the options are only English or Spanish, but it was a neat thing to see. Also the red Sunday letters are a nice touch.<br />The only negative I can say about the watch is that it is a little big for me personally. The watch fits fine, but I would rather have one a little smaller. Of course this is simply personal preference and on a bigger wrist I couldn't even make this complaint. For the price, it is one of the best watches out there!"
5.0,This is a large pin!  Looks great on heavy scarfs and holds in place
5.0,I work maintenance and was going through other bands and destroying devices. This band has held up great!
5.0,"The boxers are great!  Exactly as described, and came with gift bags.  I have not washed them yet, nor have my children tried them on."
5.0,"This bear is very cute although, the new size is smaller than the 3.26 bear. This one is about 1.5 instead but still very cute and I actually like the smaller size for my 12 year old daughter. Now, she can wear this everyday and not be too huge on her. I was concerned at first the bear I thought I ordered was still showing the larger bear, it wasn't until I asked before delivery and found out they are now selling the smaller bear instead. Overall still very happy and now want one for myself."
5.0,Good choice for me and others
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I realized there was not only one pair of backs but 2! These are fantastic! What an awesome idea! I'm 60 and had zero idea these were even around! Lol
5.0,quality is best of all the apple watch band available
5.0,"I love this tunic. It works great with leggings as far as length. I should have ordered a small. I am 5'4, 130 lbs and it's a little big. Even a little big it's still cute and comfy."
5.0,another great costume accessory
5.0,Amazing quality and great delivery. Fits just right. Good grip.
5.0,darling suit
5.0,"Folds up nicely to fit in a suitcase, wire brim molds right back to restore the hat's shape.  Elastic strap on the inside prevents losing it to the wind if it's windy but can also be easily tucked inside when not in use.  The hat is a one size fits all, my hat size is generally an 11, it fits perfectly."
5.0,Very pretty. I'll buy more as gifts.
5.0,"Very nicely done, vibrant colors, soft, and comfortable. I like to accessorize, and this neckerchief is perfect addition to my collection of scarfs. Price was very convenient.<br />I recommend this product."
5.0,Looks good on my wife and she loves it.
5.0,"Medium fit me perfectly, I like the way it’s texture feels. Stretchy good for exercising etc…💯"
5.0,I was getting headaches being in front of my work and home computer so much.  My manager told me about these and they work great.  Now when I get a headache its not from screen brightness or eye strain.  :)
5.0,Great dress glove
5.0,Quality piece. Very happy with this set.  Superb stitching and lovely hang.
5.0,"I purchased and extra small and the fit is fine. For reference I'm 5'8"", 32:25:35. I have a small bust which helps with the fit and the fact I require minimal support. I can see where that may present an issue on the strapless side for bustier women because that side does ride low. The bottoms are very cheeky and tend to ""ride in"", but I think that goes hand in hand with this style. The ribbed fabric is very nice and the seams are well stitched and even. I'm very happy with the quality of this swimsuit."
5.0,"Perfect for carrying my viking costume. Light weight, foam. Seems well made.<br />I spray painted it black to go with my all black theme. Good buy! 👌"
5.0,"Fine shoes, run a little short for Saucony."
5.0,"Feels amazing! I would recommend going 1 size up if you are hitting the gym hard, or at the very least use tumble\low heat when drying. I'm extremely cautious when it comes to these Chinese ABC companies on Amazon, but Neleus knocks it out of the park. Will buy again!"
5.0,"This is a lovely ring. Color is lighter, more diluted than most aventurine, but it's a really nice shade. Fits comfortably. Size of the gem and its ratio to the band is perfect. Love it!"
5.0,Fit my kids really well (9 and 5 year old). Stays up.
5.0,"Beautifully made, excellent quality stone and silver. In love!!"
5.0,"Me agradó la tela , es muy suave , de verano como lo esperaba, el tamaño se ajusta muy bien y los colores son brillantes y como se ven en las fotos"
5.0,It was a Christmas gift and it was beautiful and my daughter loved it
5.0,Awesome purchase.  Fits like a charm on first wear
5.0,"5'3"" - 133 lbs. Absolutely perfect. I'm thrilled. Not heavy like some, but not paper thin either. Can't  wait for a breezy day to wear it...PS: I bought a medium!"
5.0,"My son LOVES this belt! It functions like a ratchet, very, very cool indeed and it looks really good. Terrific value."
5.0,They are excellent and I can use with my sports shoes
5.0,"Grid-it's are an amazing product. I first spotted them on the Lifehacker website, and quickly added it to my Amazon Wishlist. My wife, being awesome, bought me one for Father's Day (not this model, but the idea is the same). Anytime I pull this out of my bag I get oohs and ahhhhhs. People want to know what it is and then, where can they get it. I love that I can quickly get the most important stuff out of one bag, and then into another without the feeling that I've left something behind. I've often changing bags, and the Grid-It makes it easy.<br /><br />I typically carry the following:<br />1. Portable charger for phone<br />2. Wall charger and plug<br />3. Tide Pen<br />4. Ink Pen<br />5. Flash Drive<br />6. Ear Buds<br />7. Business Cards<br />8. Small Gerber multitool<br /><br />If you find your bag is always a disorganized mess, buy a Grid-it. Even if your bag is clean, buy one. They are awesome."
5.0,Purchased for Christmas for my eldest grandson. Loved it so much I purchased one for each of my younger grandsons.
5.0,"This is for my anniversary and i can't wait dor my husband to see it. The lace.is absolutely beautiful and so very soft with plenty of stretch. I love this and have plenty i want to wear it under, but not until after my anniversary.  Love.to recommend this for your sexy wardrobe.<br />Rcvd.for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion"
5.0,"As described, really quick shipping"
5.0,Very cute but extremely to small. The size 5x will fit a person that is a size 6.
5.0,Perfect food for looking like a creeper
5.0,"This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon! Amazing quality, used, washed and dried daily and look the same ! Very comfortable, fit great and just look great."
5.0,Perfect little purse for carrying important items
5.0,Amazing tie!!! So beautiful
5.0,"I love the earrings! They are cute, they look good and they don't irritate my ears."
5.0,loves these
5.0,"Very cute tee shirt. This one comes in red with gold lettering. It has a V-neck design, which I like and prefer. The design is printed on regular plain tee shirt that you would purchase at the store, therefore the sizing is pretty accurate. I chose an extra large and probably could have gone with a large. I ordered it a little big because I was worried about the sizing, but with this one there is no need to so feel free to order the normal size you would wear and it should fit. The lettering is more of an iron material, but it is done well. The letters are bright on the shirt and are not cracked, bleeding, or faded .The cotton material is the more thicker cotton material and not the thin material you see on more of the stretchy shirts. I will have just a few photos up soon. I have to upload them from my phone. So, overall nice shirt. Love the humor of it. This shirt fits well, running true to size, and is made well too. I received this shirt at a discounted price to give my honest review and this is my honest review of this product."
5.0,My son's eyes lit up when he saw what was in the box. Definitely with the money. I would compare the box to one of the old school cardboard pencil boxes-but it's cute.
5.0,"The Mirity boot-leg yoga pants are really comfortable to wear when either exercising or lounging around the house. I normally wear an 8 or 10 for pants, so I ordered a medium. They fit me perfectly, they are not too lose or too tight. I was not sure if they would be true to American sizing, but I am happy to say that they are true to size. I am 5'8&quot; and the pants are a good length for me, they go all the way to the top of my foot and actually go just below my heel. Sometimes I have issues with pants being too short, but these are a great length.<br /><br />The fabric is 95% cotton and 5% spandex. It is soft and stretchy. The fabric helps wick moisture away from the skin while you are working out. At about 2.25&quot;, the waistband is thicker than many pants that are similar to these, which not only makes them more comfortable, they stay in place better too. I also like that the elastic in the waistband is only 5/8&quot; thick instead of being the whole width of the waistband. I really like the fit and feel of these pants. I would definitely recommend them. They are going to get a lot of wear, as a stay at home mom, I live in pants like these all the time.<br />I received this item free for my open, honest, and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Really what I was looking for. Just firm control with a very smooth feel. I cannot wear the Spanx with the elastic type band at the &#34;waist&#34;.
5.0,"It looks exactly like in the picture, it is really cute."
5.0,These were all more classy then in the picture
5.0,"It's beautiful, fits wonderfully, bright and cheerful. This is more of a light yellow, not the mustard color one normally sees, and I cannot wear without looking bad. This is the color that looks good, but very rarely find. It's all over, here, Canada and  England, everyone loves this color! Just a small pop of the color makes one feel wonderful. Oh, and the dress is very soft too. A definite five!"
5.0,I got these for my husband and he LOVES them! I am very glad to have found these socks....
5.0,I like them very much thank you
5.0,These are gorgeous! First pair came in broken but when I reached out I was provided a new pair even before I sent back the broken pair. Nice customer service! The second pair are great quality and holding up great!! They look so much better in person!
5.0,"I was given this exact model as a gift when I was 11, and I keep buying it every time I need a new watch! I've read how it lasted so long for many people, but watches just don't last more than 3-5 years with me. But I still love this! Very reliable, light and comfortable. Great as a first watch as it's cheap too. I recommend it to anyone thinking of trying a new watch."
5.0,Purse / wallet exactly as expected
5.0,Perfect for jewelry making
5.0,Got this for my fella for Christmas! He loved it!
5.0,"I've had this for a few months now and it's still my favorite choker. It's cute, and fits my neck perfectly. It's durable, and great quality for the price."
5.0,It fit perfectly and it looked the same as the picture I got a size small because of the elastic waistband.
5.0,They are absolutely cute. I had to buy the black pair too. I also bought my little sister a pair because she liked mine some much.
5.0,Super cute and goes perfect with my birthday outfit.
5.0,"This was purchased as a gift for a dear friend. She loves Kipling (as do I). I almost kept this for myself but decided against that. I am glad I gave it to my friend. The look on her face was priceless. The bag itself is great. Lots of compartments and they all zip!  That is a pre-requisite for my friend as she likes bags that zip all the way (she does not like open/slip pockets, button/snap closure or areas where there's exposure even after the bag is zipped). She really enjoys the bag and she is using it daily."
5.0,It fits great in my stadium backpack purse that I plan to carry around at Disney
5.0,This is the perfect fit - flattering and just the right length for my 5’ 2” frame. Comfortable fit
5.0,These legging are wonderful. They look great and they fit great.
5.0,Very well made.  Excellent customer service - they replied IMMEDIATELY when I had a question. Looks exactly as pictured.  Probably a woman's size hat - not a man's .
5.0,It’s beautiful I ordered white and black in M! The white fit  looser than the black  . The black is perfect !
5.0,Good fit as expected. Wearing it to gym everyday since it arrived and I like it. Soft and comfy. Color is also nice.
5.0,"Great, easy costume. I pinned the wings on a turtleneck and forgot I was wearing it. I received a ton of compliments. The mask is too flexible to wear, but I just wanted the wings and antenna, anyway. Vibrant colors. Good buy!"
5.0,"I ordered these masks to wear with an inserted filter - I am amazed at the excellent quality and construction of each one in my order. The floral patterns are so pretty. It's super simple to insert a small filter pad for extra protection in a pocket in the mask lining. The ear straps are adjustable, and included in my order was a lovely surprise - a plastic strap you can wear across the back of your head with nubs to hold ear loops. No ear fatigue, and it's small enough to wear under a layer of your hair. I couldn't be happier with this mask purchase."
5.0,"I wish it was less bulky, but overall its a good wallet and I really like the change pocket."
5.0,nice backpack. well made. good price
5.0,"I am a female and I LOVE these pants. I ordered the size large and they fit nice and loose! I love the cuffed ankles and the large pockets! These are so comfortable, I wish I could wear these everyday instead of jeans! If you are a female and have fears about this product fitting poorly, DON'T worry! This is basically the same as women's clothing except for the lower crotch and the large pockets. I bought men's pants because I wanted big pockets (something women's clothing often lacks) and that is exactly what I revived. My iPhone 6 and wallet can easily fit in these pockets!!!!<br /><br />Stop reading this review and buy these pants!!!"
5.0,Even more stunning in person. Excellent quality as well.
5.0,"Great! Fits well and looks good, no complains, very flattering."
5.0,This jacket fits well and very light and comfortable.
5.0,Is beautiful! Definitely worth the money. But I'm 5'2 so it was a little long. Which is what I figured anyway.
5.0,My sister loved it. It came on tinge andlooked beautiful. I love the added butterfly!!!
5.0,"Perfect fit, Perfect color and very light weight.....Love this dress."
5.0,"I have over 30 watches, and I rotated them frequently based on need: dress, work, casual or play. Since I bought this Casio Pro Trek about 6 months ago I haven't worn any of the others. Not once. For me this is the ultimate watch. It's the perfect combination of function and durability. Everything about it is perfect, and after hard use it still looks just like the day I first wore it. Having OCD, now I just need to figure out how many more I need to buy to ensure that I always have one.<br /><br />8/17/2021:<br />Coming up on a year of ownership. I had switched out the original band for a velcro wrap. It needs replacing, but the watch itself is still in pristine condition.<br /><br />I wear it every day and beat the crap out of it; how can it still look new? I  still occasionally pull out the manual and learn new things about it. Everything functions perfectly. If more people knew about this watch, there would soon be no other watches.<br /><br />Edit 12/24/22: I gave my watch to my son when he left for Army Cavalry Scout training. Needless to say, it endured extreme punishment and was the envy of his fellow soldiers. I tried going back to my other watches, but finally gave in and bought another PRW-3500 for myself!"
5.0,"The Ponosoon Sports Sunglasses are a fairly terrific pair of sunglasses that have 5 interchangeable lenses, a nice carrying case and even a cloth to keep your lens clean and fresh looking. The different lens come in quite handy depending on the time of day you use the glasses, and the glasses are very lightweight which is really important for people who use them for undertaking long exercises. The price is also fairly reasonable for everything that you receive.<br /><br /> I use these glasses frequently for cycling, running, and even just to wear around outside the house to shield my eyes from the sun. I wear these glasses outside often and worry very little about harmful rays ruining my eyes; the glasses allow just enough sun through the lenses and keep the rest out. The set also comes with a really nice hard case that allows you to take them on trips without fear of breaking, and also comes with a cloth case that makes travel lighter and more compact. The glasses are also unisex so both men and women can wear them and they look stylish and comfortable.<br /><br />As an overview, these glasses are a very nice product for the price that you pay. I’m a long distance cyclist and enjoy wearing them with every ride, but runners or any outdoorsy people would have luck with these glasses.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced in any way or by anyone of my opinion of this product."

5.0,fit as expected. Im 5' and a 38DDD and ordered XL and it looks decent enough for family day at the beach. it looks like a regular short skirt goes right bellow the underwear.
5.0,The football team loved them for under their uniforms
5.0,I love how these fit. Not too tight that they are uncomfortable but definitely not loose enough to ride down. They are so soft and the color is beautiful in person.
5.0,They are just what in needed.
5.0,I ordered a XL so when it was washed it didn't shrink so bad. It is soft and I really like the night gown so I ordered another one.
5.0,I am 5'5/145/36D. I ordered the medium and they fit great so far.
5.0,I was able to wear the dress right out of the package because it didn't come with a bad smell . I am average height so the length is doing all kind of sexy with me looking modest. The stretch is amazing because of the elastic and the technique used .The shoulders are very comfortable I paired these with some strapping gold heels and gold accessories. It holds great to wash.
5.0,"What I like about this pair of gloves is that they are thick and long. The surface is ribbed for good traction. The thing I don't like is that there is no lining. Your skin sticks to the rubber. After a while, with long narrow sleeves and no linings, they become sticky and sweaty."
5.0,Love my sovis its like wearing a big pair of sunglasses .
5.0,Perfect for the summer time.  The Faneuil is very thin breathable Fabric air flows right in. Even though it's a thin material it is not see through.
5.0,The fit is just right love the color and it washed very good. It's  a little longer then I thought it was going to be but that's ok. Love how comfortable it is I'm most definitely going to get it other colors.
5.0,"Had to go a size bigger than usual so the arms are longer than needed, but my son loves it so much he just rolls them up. Will fit him for a while and he loves wearing it"
5.0,I really did not expect these to be so nice...even bought and returned 4 other styles  as they were too heavy with so much decoration. I am just buying a 2nd pair of these. I do not mind having 2 prs. 1st review I ever left on a product....that is how much I love these.
5.0,Husband is a HUGE Dr. Who fan. Absolutely LOVES this robe. Fits him well. It's nice thick material and very soft. Color is bright blue and accurate to the photo. Good quality made with nice embroidery. Would recommend to other Dr. Who fans.

5.0,I use this cap every day at work. It’s just as good as any Stihl product.
5.0,"thhis shorts are really comfortable and durable, been using them for a while now, they are a bit pricy; but you can find good deals on Amazon"
5.0,"I've been riding in all weather since I decided a rain or shine attitude in 2008. I've been on coast to coast and back jaunts and 1000 mile trips over many days and climates. The rain Jacket and pants are impressive!<br /><br />Pants have super sealed side zips, waist to ankle. Very good lining below the knee. Sometimes a rain storm just comes on, taking off touring boots won't be necessary with these pants. I won't get soaked!<br /><br />Waist is high so riding in a high wind storm won't get me wet. Pants have one thigh pocket, jacket 2 waist, zipper pockets. It has a high collar and a hood. Never needed a hood previously but it'll make a nice rain jacket for walking around on trips this summer.<br /><br />I got yellow not sure it's high viz but my helmet is and I got reflective tape on it and my V-Strom.<br /><br />Very well made jacket and pants from the looks of it. Will update next fall. BTW, pants have solid, removable suspenders. I'm going to try them."
5.0,The belt was exactly what I was expecting.  It arrived on time and I was very happy with it.  The price was right also.  I wanted it for one of my out fits and this worked perfectly.
5.0,"Nice and soft. Pretty tight but was able to stretch them over my ankle shoes and jeans without problem. They feel warm too. They only thing is the bottom, won’t be surprise if it frays at some point ,but time will tell. For now 5 stars."
5.0,"Excelente producto, buena calidad y muy cómodo. Envío rápido"
5.0,Great shoes. Lots of compliments.

5.0,"I use this for my dogs training clicker.  Doesn't scratch your neck, its soft and a nice length."
5.0,Super satisfied with this product so much so I bought two.
5.0,Very satisfied with the slippers. These slippers replace the exact same worn out slippers.
5.0,These are surprisingly comfortable. I've had similar things before but couldn't keep them on for more than a minute or so. They were awkward and painful.<br />I forget these aren't regular readers.<br />I even tried to slide them up over my forehead - felt like a moron.
5.0,a little long. wear to work
5.0,"Feels like a solid cardi.  I ordered the green one and loved it so much I ordered another in black.  It's a bit tight in the arms, but I have big arms so that is expected.  Love it!!!"
5.0,Light weight and comfortable. Fits true to size
5.0,"Bought these for my husband for his workouts. He’s very broad-shouldered and barrel-chested, so the y-back is great for allowing him ease of movement and range of motion. Fits well according to the measurements provided, and the material is very soft and comfortable."
5.0,"These are so cute! I got a set that had stitch in it along with the dinosaur, unicorn, and alligator, and they’re so darn cute! I got these for a gift for my niece and my best friend. All of them were so cute, but the alligator is a little awkward to put into an earring gift box."
5.0,"Fits very comfortably, excellent purchase"

Used to be just that. Wish they had these back then!  Beautiful Dan Post Boots. Well worth the price for craftmanship like this.  Recommend Highly"

5.0,"I love these. Cozy, good quality and flexible style with all my outfits. Not hard to keep track of and pair up because they are distinctly different color greys. I am very grey. My soul is all shades of gray at once. Be well."
5.0,Good-looking watch winder box. Paired it with a Staur automatic watch as a special gift. The recipient was impressed with both the watch and the winder!
5.0,"My 6 year old loved it!  Looks great on him, and really good quality."
5.0,"I have had these slippers for over six months now and any other slipper (I've owned at least 6 pairs from various manufactures) would have fallen apart by now. These are amazingly comfortable, adjustable to comfort and fit, and durable. You can trust me, that I am hard on my shoes/slippers. I would recommend these slippers any day of the week and twice on Sunday."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a1281ded3020a6c1fbdcc8353f7545d6]]

5.0,"These earrings are beautiful. I bought 3 pairs for our daughters and niece. Some fading was mention. But I think the size and design are excellent. If they fade in color, I’ll color them with nail polish."

5.0,This watch is terrific!! Looks a lot pricier than it is. Looks great on.  Keeping perfect time. I got it because description said I could swim with it on but I like it so much I’m afraid to get it wet!!!
5.0,Loved and appreciated how it made championship hates look more professional. Will definitely be giving this to other coach colleagues.
5.0,"so far like it very much, light and works."
5.0,"There's a ton of this sweatshirt posted on Amazon but only this one had Prime option available. It's worth it. The fuzzy material is very stretchy, the waffle pattern material is stiff but steam-able. I got a 3XL and it is the size you would expect. Due to the stretchy/fuzziness of the material, it is a bit clingy to your figure -- so dress accordingly. I'm sure if this was made of a different material you would notice the quality of the sewing etc more, but because it's fuzzy -- it's all hidden and you can't tell. See pictures for up close details"
5.0,"I really like them, they  I could use a a half size smaller"
5.0,Nothing says fashion like this watch
5.0,"This was one of three ties that I bought from this seller and I love it just as much as I love my other two. Buy it, you will not regret it."
5.0,Super fun! Runs a bit small
5.0,LOVED especially for large wrist
5.0,"I bought to replace a brown colored watch ban which had fallen apart. I like the blue color much better. Appears to be good quality so far.<br />I would recommend this buckle band  clasp  because it won't fall off the wrist, if band unhooks."
5.0,"I am not expecting it as pendant only. I was looking for a pill container where i can bring it everywhere to place my emergency pills. How can I return it. Let me know how to return this pendant. As I was browsing, I thought it’s a pillbox because that is what I am looking for but I was disappointed. Let me know how to return, give me instructions please. It’s pretty ."
5.0,"Se lo regale a mi esposo por el día de Los padres, el no es muy fan a esas cosas pero este regalo le gustó mucho🤗"
5.0,Very comfortable and not so hard to breath!
5.0,The prices on these keys from other sites or car dealers were ridiculous. At this price I bought 2 and they work perfectly.
5.0,"I loved it but it was too big for me because I lost weight. However, I gave it to my best friend and she looked awesome. The blended colors were Beautifu, making it feminine but simplistic"

5.0,Works like a belt
5.0,Great value…super comfortable!
5.0,Good quality. Perfect for sports.

5.0,Fits as expected and so cute for dinner date night or party.
5.0,I bought 2 different colors I love the color.  Very feminine.  One is a little scratchy though.  Nothing a light undershirt doesn't prevent.  Also I have Lupus so everything I wear has to feel good against myou skin.  VS used to carry a similar version.  I was very disappointed when they discontinued
5.0,Awesome for the price. Good stretch and not bad quality. I am 5'5&#34; 136lbs and the medium fits well!
5.0,"It is hard to buy jewelry on-line, but this is the best experience I've had.  The price, the service and product are all of the highest quality one could possibly expect.  The chain is a great quality, sturdy, sparkly, well made.  I have several silver pendants that I would like to wear at different lengths depending on my clothing, so I will eventually buy all sizes."
5.0,I am always looking for a good black purse. This one is the best one I have found! It is large enough to hold everything I need for a full day at school and work. It fits comfortably on my shoulder. The leather is nice and soft. It has just the right amount of pockets inside.
5.0,love this dress just hate I stained it on the first day dropping make up on it smh!!!

5.0,Wash these capes gently and dry on delicate. They are beautiful. You will not be disappointed! Highly recommend! Thank you Folobe!!
5.0,"Honestly this is a watch. You probably won't like it if you don't like how it looks. It tells time well, and that's what I use it for. It helps that I like how it looks. For these reasons, I give it a 5 star rating."

5.0,This isn’t my first order. Nice to have a small token as a reminder that we are never alone.
5.0,Our grandson loves them!
5.0,"These are so cute!  They look exactly like the picture. I ended up sticking a ring through the hole because it felt more secure than the little chains that come with it, but other than that, this is a win!!!"
5.0,"Love these shoes, cute, well made and will definitely buy this brand again!"
5.0,Soft and comfortable.  Good price.
5.0,These are comfortable no-show socks. Love the fact they're a cotton blend (all-polyester make me itch). These form to my feet and are not tight at all. They have little clear rubber grips in the back to cling to your ankle to prevent them from slipping down. As you can see in the pic they're barely noticeable in sneakers (you can easily adjust them so they won't be seen at all). I'd recommend these!
5.0,"Great good looking and light-weight, versatile duffle-bag. Convenient side pockets for keys, passport, tickets and misc."
5.0,Do not have to ware two different strengths of eye glasses anymore.
5.0,"I bought this shirt for my boyfriend, and while it was a little smaller than we'd expected, he still loved it."

5.0,I bought this for my hostess mother when I stay with them at the Beach. I loved it so much I ordered one for myself :)

5.0,"My granddaughter loved them , great value for 6 pair"
5.0,"I like the clasp, less likely to come undone. And it's cooler to wear, which will help in the heat."
5.0,Softens and preserves. Company is long-established and also sells excellent dyes; familiar with them from my time in USMC.
5.0,32 weeks pregnant at my baby shower in this dress and got a medium which is what I normally wear and it fit perfect. I’m 5’8 and was wearing wedges and the dress still touched the floor. I’m normally 140lbs but weighed 170s in this picture.
5.0,"Well, got this for my bf, and he loves it!"
5.0,Truly Awesome!

5.0,Great gift! My daughter loves them!
5.0,Very good product.  Worked well with my shoe stretchers.
5.0,"I'm a size 12. The extra large is hanging off me. I'm used to Chinese sizing being on the small size, not so generous. I wish I had gotten the L.<br />The bathing suit is a beautiful cut. Nice material and color. I would mention that the ""tummy control"" is ruching in that area. No control / spank panel.<br />Wonderful suit for the price."
5.0,Love this style!!
5.0,cute and comfortable to wear - either as a crawler or hanging down.
5.0,My son gets so many compliments! It's definitely a head turner. Fits perfectly!

5.0,"Great necklace! Its nice in person, it has some weight to it. My son loves it! Thank you!"
5.0,Buy these if you need a comfortable shoe or even an orthotic and can find cute sandals. These fit like a sandal made for comfort and look sooo cute I think ill get another in black and one in brown. They fit exact to my size. I am a 9 in almost everything and the 9 fit great.
5.0,This Kente Cloth met all of my expectations! I will definitely purchase again in the future for myself and family members!
5.0,I like the lose fit
5.0,"Super cute! Loved the material, it's similar to athletic leggings. It's confortable and stretchy, I was 17w pregnant in the picture. I'm 5'4"" and the medium was long enough for me to be able to wear 5"" wedges. I have a small chest so I did have to safety pin that a bit or my bra showed. I plan to buy another in a different print!"
5.0,Love the shape of this sports bra. I wear it everyday
5.0,pretty short but I rocked it in Vegas!
5.0,Very nice set of barbells! Can twist off either side
5.0,Wonderful worksman ship and comfort

5.0,"I order this suit as gift for my daughter, she's only 5'3 and very skinny so she always has issues finding a good suit for work that fits and looks good. I was worried that the pants may be too long but it fist just perfectly, my daughter loves it!"
5.0,Great product and good experience.
5.0,I bought these gloves for my husband who is a volunteer firefighter. He loves the style and comfort of them. Many of his friends are beginning to buy them too since they are durable and tough.

5.0,Fits true to size and very comfortable.
5.0,it is beautiful and a lot of people thougt that it was a genuine diamond earrings.
5.0,"Perfect for what I needed!  This little package includes everything you need to replace your band.  It was relatively easy to pry off the old band and pretty quick to install the new.  I kept the original screws and used them with the new band (per a suggestion from another customer).  It looks great!  One little note... I had an issue getting one of the screws in.  The reason was that the hole on the new band was filled with some excess rubber.  I used the little screw driver to poke out the excess, tried again and all worked great."
5.0,Husband very happy with shirt.
5.0,"My granddaughter looks so adorable in this, she loves nightgowns.  I would buy this again."

5.0,"Good quality, fast shipment and love the cable to attach that is sturdy,"
5.0,Perfect for my &#34;I love Lucy&#34; costume.
5.0,"These are definitely oversize, just a bit close to comically so for my taste and I usually likes 'em big. I don't know. I like these a lot and they're cute and seem fairly well-made though not the most durable pair I have in this style. So as much as they're all of the above, they're just not for me  for whatever reason and the best I can come up with is that they're just a shade too big.."
5.0,I am always skeptical about large belly rings because of their weight but surprisingly this one is very light! It is good quality and just like the picture.<br /><br />I have a larger belly button so I can see this being a little too wide for smaller belly buttons.
5.0,The mask fit great I keep walking around and yelling donkey!
5.0,Super buenas y una tela excelente
5.0,I purchased these earrings for my granddaughter for a Christmas gift. I sent them directly to her. She loves them.
5.0,Super pretty!! I was so excited to recive this bracelet and am very happy with my purchase!! :)
5.0,Such a good do it your self kit I had no issues and loved the outcome
5.0,"This is a beautiful shirt, which runs small in size, which is unfortunate.  If you normally wear a Medium, you should probably buy a Large for it to fit you comfortably.  When I received the shirt, it was so snug that I couldn't enjoy it.  However, since it is so pretty, it will not go to waste.  I have passed it on to my daughter, who wears a smaller size!  Again, it is a beautiful shirt!  If you purchased this, you would not be disappointed by its unique appearance!"
5.0,"Came before estimated delivery date (about a week and half) and every choker was sealed individually. I love them. Paid under 2 bucks and I'm glad I caught that price because I see they are now $9.99 lol, still not bad. Good price. Good shipping. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Needed some grip socks for the hospital. Good price for the amount of pairs you get. Very comfy, and they worked great during my hospital stay. Will be using them during yoga too. 😄"
5.0,"cute well made item, got it for my 2 yr old and I think it will last her a while. she is tall girl but is very stretchy"
5.0,I looked around and this seller had the best price. It looks better in person - its really beautiful and they deliver FAST!
5.0,"So cute and sturdy. For sandals they are very versatile,  we put them with alot of different outfits, dresses things up a bit sometimes"
5.0,"I think this LAISHEN Women's Summer Sleeveless V Neck Split Tie Back Maxi Long Dress is beautiful. I ordered in the first floral version which is the prettiest in my opinion.<br /><br />The leaves are kind of like a deep forest green. Other colors mixed in are white, light pink, dark and light oranges, yellow. It is colorful without being excessively bright which I love.<br /><br />I actually really like the materials. The tag says 97% polyester and 3% spandex. The inner fabric layer is green and a little smoother, while the outer layer is patterned and feels pretty textured. The fabric is light, airy, flowy, not particularly stretchy. It feels like it could be scratchy, but I don’t think it feels uncomfortable to wear at all. The outer fabric doesn’t necessarily look transparent at first glance, but if you put it over yours eyes, you can see through it. Same with the inner material but to a much lesser extent.<br /><br />This dress is definitely long, if I step up onto something, I have to avoid stepping on the dress. I love the long slits on the front sides of the dress. You can’t see them when you are just standing straight. I don’t think it overexposed anything. I like the v neck and the open back. There is a zipper down the side to make it easier to take on and off. The neckline ties back to straps that are adjustable. You can tie as tight as you like to get a different look with how high the neckline falls which I love.<br /><br />For reference I am 5’6” and about 145 lbs. I was planning on ordering a medium like I usually do, but large was the only size left. I actually think it fits very well, but is comfortably roomy. I am able to slip the dress on with the side zipper up, but is much easier to take off with it zipped down. Like I said before, I love that you can tie the neckline as tight as you want. I like the neckline to fall fairly low and I’m able to do that with this.<br /><br />Anyway, this dress is beautiful. I think the medium would have fit nicely as well, but this  large does not look too big on me at all. I’m not huge into dresses, but this just seems perfect for nice day on the beach or something.<br /><br />I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!"
5.0,Bought these for my self. Ended up buying  a second pair in a different color for.my husband.

5.0,"Sooo.. am 203 but I don't look it... with that being said.. I went through all the reviews they were very useful... I used my best judgement and order a xl... &#34; I usually order L.. my dress came and I was super excited and open the package and got disappointed cause the xl looked so huge.. am like oh boy I really messed up on this...I keep saying I should just ordered the large ..  Anyways I tried the dress, and  to my surprise the dress fit me  prefectly... No ideas why it looked so huge.  &#34; Maybe it's me !!  Maybe I don't realise how fat I am lol&#34; .. Am 5ft2.. is it's not very short in the front which works out perfect..... &#34; My breast size is 36d and I wear 12 in pants&#34; if this helps you ladies out... My advise is, .... order one size up...  If you are tall the dress will be super short in front... Keep  that in mind  when ordering... Best of luck.."
5.0,"What is there not to like about this pair of beautiful pink cz earrings set in sterling silver?  They are a lovely soft pink that will match anything and the size is enough to be noticed! I highly recommend them for the price if nothing else, but honestly I think they will be one of my ""go to"" pair of earrings."
5.0,I like the dress! Only thing is the models sleeves don’t show what they truly look like. The sleeves aren’t fitted.

5.0,"I have an iPhone 6 with a Mophie case and a swivel ring on the back, so my phone unit is pretty thick.  It will still fit in the other side and zip up just fine.  Great price!"
5.0,This bonnet is the best! I recommend to all the curly girls out there who want to maintain their curls frizz free!! The band is just perfect!!! Not to tight not too loose... just enough to keep it secure when you sleep... im a crazy sleeper so it stays on all night. My curls look amazing as the cap does an awesome job at minimizing the friction. Don’t think twice ! Buy this! Look no more
5.0,"Bought this as a cheap work-watch. Can tell time, date, has an alarm, and a stopwatch. Stopwatch cycles every hour. The alarm isn’t very loud but makes a good back up in case your on those 3-hour sleep days like me, and may miss your primary alarm. It has held up well to work abuse, and has a nostalgic look to it. Overall happy with the purchase."

This is great for rain or shine.<br /><br />The C-shaped hands free handle is awesome! You can easily hold you're phone, bag and umbrella easily. Its the little things that make a good product become great! And this one nails it!<br />And I'm always fond of any company that stand behind their product with a guarantee... and this one does! Not that I will be needing to use it.<br />This is an innovative well built umbrella with the best design - absolutely the cutest flower for all rain showers! 🌹🌼🌺🌸☔"

5.0,"I was so excited to receive my Utopia luggage 2 piece. This comes with a 28 inch and a 20 inch I purchased the black ones and I am very happy with my purchase. I will be going out of state soon and cant wait to try this out. The are made of great high quality material the look very sturdy and durable, best of all is how much room they have you can fit so much in these luggage since you are able to use both sides its like having double the space. I love the lightweight design with the 360 spinner wheels makes it very easy to move with not much effort at all. You can roll them upright which which makes it light and no weight is on you. Everything can be neatly packed since it does have the cross straps and full zip interior divider. I am very glad I was able to receive at a discount price in exchange for my honest review and lastly I love the texture of the luggage since it is scratch resistant. Very very satisfied with my purchase I love all of Utopia products."

5.0,"To be honest, if you don’t like seeing definition and the results of your workout. Do not buy this product!<br /><br />I feel confident in this style of tank and comfortable doing another set without worrying about looking like a sweaty mess."
5.0,"Seriously stunning dres, right out of the package. My 16 year old niece agreed and was oohing as soon as she saw this dress. The chest area and arms are much smaller than normal. I was barely able to put on the dress let alone close!  Tried size 18. Normally 12-16. I'd need at least 22 or larger. Opted for a more modest dress as a bridemaid but I will def keep in mind if I need for special occasion. The dark green/real color true to photo."
5.0,Quality of dress was better than expected.  Comfortable and easy wear.
5.0,I love PattyBoutik clothing and this shirt is no exception. Fits well and does a good job covering the parts of my body I'm less comfortable showing.
5.0,They're perfect! Color and fit!
5.0,"Happy with my purchase. I ordered the ""Midnight Blue"" strap for a Bulova watch. When it arrived I noticed it was more of an indigo color, which I think looks better than it did in pictures. The listing makes it look darker, so if you are interested in this color just know that it is somewhere between a green and a blue. It seems to be well made and good quality. Been wearing now for over a month and it is comfortable on my wrist. Great product for the price."
5.0,I loved the necklace and my daughter will love it when she receives it on Christmas Day. Thank you for making our day.
5.0,"For the price, this dress was great. It was very comfortable and perfect material for summer (very light). I read some reviews that the dress was a tad sheer. Maybe, but I didn’t find that very noticeable. When ordering, based on my weight and height, it was suggested to me to get a medium or a large. I went medium, and thank goodness I did because the dress is very loose. If I had one negative, it would be that. I felt that I was constantly pulling it up in the front and down in the back because it didn’t want to stay in place. If the waist band was a tad more fitting, I don’t believe that would be an issue. Regardless, for the money, I really liked the dress, it looked great on, and I am already contemplating buying it again in another pattern (I might just try a small next time to see if the waist is less loose)."
5.0,Bought these for a Christmas gift...they were exactly what I was looking for to match the calf sleeves
5.0,Great rain jacket for the price
5.0,The product arrived on time and is an excellent product.
5.0,"I am a Sterling Silver fan. I love shiny and blingy.<br />These pretty, simple earrings are perfect. The infinity symbol has lined with Cubic Zirconia as is the beginning of the ear hook.

5.0,This was a gift for a friend who is a fellow fan of Destiny.  He liked it a lot.
5.0,"I wish it was longer. I'm 5'1 and it's about mid calf on me. I like it though, it's comfortable and fits very well for my plus size shape."
5.0,Great hat for referees!  No markings on it and durable.
5.0,"I bought these in each of the metals (gold, silver and rose gold). They are super sparkly and well made. I get so many compliments when I where them. So easy to adjust and wear different ways."

5.0,Good value for money. Lenses a little light
5.0,I don't have to buy prescription sun glasses anymore.  I simply place these sun glasses over my glassess.
5.0,"This is my fourth pair of these leggings and I just can't say anything negative about them. They arrive quickly. Fit as expected. For the price I wouldn't expect such great quality, but they are!"
5.0,Well packaged and the size is just nice! I definitely going to wear it at all times!
5.0,"Soft, long enough (to ankles), fit me just right. I'm 5'4"", 158, but smaller back, 34DD, size 8/10 on average, bigger booty, and I got a medium. Showed sweat marks after walking in heat and sat down.."
5.0,"I've had these socks for about month,  size 11 shoe.  They fit well, cozy, warm but not bulky.  It your feet are always cold, these are a worthwhile purchase.  Washed on cold,  dryer, low setting-no problems."

5.0,Nice and silky pajamas. Bought the whole family matching sets!
5.0,"This is a crop top, but however, not too short. It is fitted as expected and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,"Sadly,Jerseys were sent back.  Bought a lot of 6 jerseys in size Large (early Christmas Gift).  It was ordered based on previous jersey that was ordered in size Large as a birthday gift and it fit my brother perfectly.  (He is 6' - 2"" @ 185 lbs (athletic fit)<br />Out of the 6, he kept one.  5 were too tight and too short.<br />This manufacturer needs better quality assurance with their sizing.  Loved the graphics on all the shirts.  Probably, I have order in Extra Large (XL) next time.  Amazon Refunds were processed and credited promptly - they were dropped off at a local Kohls Store.  5 stars because they are nice jerseys. Be aware of their Inconsistent Sizing when ordering."
5.0,Very nice sunglasses. Fit nicely on my face and I enjoy the tint. Good buy.
5.0,My girlfriend loved it. Original product. Thanks!
5.0,greta product

5.0,Absolutely love these glasses cannot beat the price actually went back the day they were delivered and ordered more of them because I now don't want to be without them!!!
5.0,The skirt color is very pretty and true to how it is shown in the picture. The fit and side slit detail are exactly as expected as well!
5.0,Great goggles but difficult to adjust straps.
5.0,"Love the fit, the feel, the non-slip bottoms. These stay put. They don't sink into my shoes and come up a little higher than others. The quality is high, the loft is cushiony. I use them for rebounding and hanging out around the house. Love them. My favorite socks, bar none!"
5.0,"These are so comfortable. I've written then as a beach cover, out to dinner, fur yoga class and for pajamas. Very versatile"
5.0,Let me start off by saying these frames look great. Unmatched is most aspects.  They are heavy-duty and fit so well on the face. I recommend these glasses to anyone who wants to stand out but be warned...pay attention to the dimensions of the glasses.
5.0,Fits great! Nice quality! Son said it’s comfortable! Hoping it doesn’t shrink in dryer.
5.0,Ordered for my mom who normally weard extra smalls. We got her a small which was form fitting without being skin tight. If you don't want to feel like a sausage probably order one size up like we did. Super cute.
5.0,"Great quality,  looking 👌"
5.0,Great shorts for the money. I will probably buy a second pair.
5.0,Nice simple dress
5.0,Item was amazing
5.0,"I was trepidatious about ordering these, as I had never heard of the brand name.  However they also appeared to be my favorite kind of bra. I don't like foam on the cups, mainly because it makes it harder to fit in a prosethis as I have had a masectomy.  I'd prefer no wire but Zi don't mind wearing them. I just need a two layer, or lined cups. That way, I can simply cut a slit in the one cup that needs it on the inside lining an voila' there you go. Well these turned out to be perfect.  I ordered my usual size I usually do in my Hanes or Barely There bra.  When they came, I tried all of them carefully not removing any tags because I expected to have to return them. Well, not only do I not have to return them but I've already worn one color out and it was not only comfortable, but didn't ride uo, shift, straps dig or any of the other hundreds of things a bra can do to you when it isn't exactly right&#34;<br />Thanks guys, it's rare to find such a bra in a place you don't usually use for bras but also a manufacturor, you are not familiar with.<br />Again thank you. Yes I gladly reccommend them"
5.0,I love the bracelet_!! Its awesome!
5.0,As advertised. It traveled well and made her Christmas
5.0,Great deal for a cute top!
5.0,"This is a nice little watch for the price. It's got a standard quartz movement and it keeps fine time. I like the military look of this watch and it makes me happy to have this in my collection for the small price I paid. The band says Genuine Leather and I have no reason to doubt it, but it's definitely not high-quality leather. The band feels very, very stiff when you first try it on, but in a day or two it loosens up. For the price, the band is quite adequate."
5.0,Love these so much!! My favorite boots!
5.0,Bought these for our kids who are learning to snorkel. They don’t mind wearing them so the masks must be comfortable. Easy for mama to get them on & off too! Thankful for the extra one because … kids ..
5.0,"Bought it for my sister,she's a nurse who's on her feet for long periods of time. She loves them"
5.0,"I'm 34D, so I ordered medium, both pieces fit good.<br />Top has not support, it comes with two ugly removable pads, so I took them away because they looked funny, the bottoms are cute as well, but I decided to wear a black one that matches perfectly!"
5.0,"Nice, cute, not too big."
5.0,"These are great! The stones haven’t fallen off yet so that’s great, for the price I thought they would be super flimsy"
5.0,"I couldn't love this more. I'm 5'9 and about 160. Long legs, goes right to the top of the knees. Shows off every curve perfectly!"
5.0,"These are fantastic! I wear my mask all day however when I do get to take it off, this allows me to take it off without worrying where I put it, leaving it on a surface, and it's always right there for me to quickly grab. Also great for errand running, I always have the mask with me! The colors are fun! I have received many compliments from people at work!"
5.0,"Great fabric, not too thin, cotton with spandex blend. Seems to be well made, love the wider waist band. Thinking about ordering a second pair."
5.0,"Cute, perfect size."
5.0,Comfortable fit ordered two more
5.0,"The perfect fall outfit for baby girl! The cute sunflowers and bright yellow colors just make this whole outfit shine. The sweater is good for when the fall weather starts to cool. This was made really well, too."
5.0,Great product for what I needed it for.
5.0,"well, I will say I imagined them a little larger looking at the pictures, but then again, i might imagine myself a little smaller also. I wear 46 pants, and these fit, and are not tight, but do not think they look as loose a sthey appear, the ones shown are on very thin folks haha. But these are great around the house and yard, have a hardcore pajama feel, loose, comfortable and easy to tighten up. I decided to try just one pair, and will now prolly buy some more."
5.0,It was exactly what it looks like in the picture. Very cute.
5.0,"I've been looking for a cute dress i can just slip into, and i found it!  I can wear it casual or dress it up.  The dress is flowy and I love pockets!!"
5.0,"I have 4 colors of the same dress! I can't stop buying. I got so many compliments! Wish they had more color. I am 5'2"". Bought small. It's little long. But it's truly beautiful"
5.0,"My granddaughter isn't born yet so I can't be specific on correct sizing but this outfit is absolutely adorable.  Comes with matching headband with bow, has the tutu attached skirt. Very cute. To me it looks much better in person. I just love it."
5.0,"Fit well, cute, inexpensive. They seem comfortable."
5.0,"Very comfortable, light weight, looks just as pictured. Absolutely love it and very reasonable price."
5.0,It’s exact same as shown in pictures. The color is pretty and material is so good. It’s so beautiful and amazing to wear.
5.0,"Todo, era lo que esperaba"
5.0,"Pocket watches as a whole are a bit impractical but at this one's price point and wicked cool design, I rate it as a top buy. Had it for a month without any problems. 5 stars!"
5.0,These headbands stay in place like no other headbands that I own!  Great for hot yoga!
5.0,Comfortable and Pretty Swimsuit! I received some nice compliments while wearing it.
5.0,I love them! very cute and awesome

5.0,Just as advertised. Arrived in great condition and on time as expected. Nothing to complain about.
5.0,just a little too long but it was perfect  otherwise.
5.0,Product fit well I have not used yet
5.0,I LOVE my dress !!!!! 👌😁😍😍
5.0,Super cute and love the towel ring!!
5.0,Had a old sunscreen that dents were brittle order the replacement incame in less than two days and fit perfectly
5.0,"This top is absolutely beautiful and I got many compliments on it. The fit is a little snug in the chest area especially but I was able to make it work with a minimizer bra!  I ordered a medium which is my usual size, but I probably should have gone with a large. I have not washed it yet so I can't report on that. Really lovely top!"
5.0,Beautiful coat!!!
5.0,Fantastic!<br />Excellent detail!  This was larger than I expected too!
5.0,This racer back is supportive and also helps if you have shoulder strains or rotator cuff issues and don't want the bra pressure pressing on your shoulders.
5.0,My daughter loved all the shirts. They fit her good.
5.0,"Very nice jacket, at a great price, as it's out of season.  I look forward to wearing it this Fall."
5.0,I love these boots! Super cute! I'm normally a 7.5 with a little bit of length left in the toe area but with these boots they JUST fit. So you might want to order a half a size up and add an insole in.
5.0,I can drive at night now and see much better. I even wear these when I'm the passenger.
5.0,"The hand muff (ordered in black) is very soft, warm and pretty. The strap is real leather. However, the odor it gives off is over powering. I have had to put the muff outside to air-out. It has been hanging out there for 6 days and I am still waiting. Until the odor subsides the muff is not usable.<br />UPDATED REVIEW: After several days the odor subsided and I am able to use the muff. It is warm and soft both inside and out. I have ordered small  hand warmers to tuck inside. My only regret is that I did not order the muff with the pocket inside.  That would have made my muff more usable."
5.0,This is a perfect outfit for spring season.  I wore this at work today and received compliments from my officemates.  The material is soft and the color is better than the picture.
5.0,I love this!! It's really pretty. I got a size medium because I read a lot of comments saying its to small. Honestly I wish I would of gotten a small. The medium is a baggy on me. But the material of the product is really nice and it's looks gorgeous when you wear it.
5.0,Great sunglasses for the money.
5.0,My son-in-law and grandson love their bow ties and like to wear them to Church! Very nice quality and a great price.
5.0,"True to size our granddaughter is almost 4 and the 4-5T fits great with room to grow. The skirt portion of the dress flows and is not clingy. The built-in panties fit without being tight around the legs. The top portion has tank top straps. The little extra details (beautiful colors, glitter, chiffon and tulle) all part of this leotard made our little granddaughter feel like a ballerina. The only downfall is it should be washed by hand."
5.0,This is the perfect cardigan! Fits great! Will go with everything. Normal US sizing. You can also tie it and it looks super cute! Love it!
5.0,Got this in the lightweight as well as the fleece. Love them both.
5.0,"I needed a dress for a wedding, but I didn’t have time to shop at any department stores so Amazon it was. This dress exceeded my expectations completely. It hugs my curves while still being incredibly flattering. I’m 145 lbs. and 5”5’ and purchased a small. Fits like a glove and the slit does not go too high."
5.0,Very comfortable. I wear a 4 in pants but definitely needed a medium.
5.0,I'm actually jealous.  If I wanted a beanie like this it'd cost the prettiest penny and def wouldn't come 2 more color options.  Like what?  Gimme some adult deals like this yall.
5.0,"This BODY SHAPER is Worth IT!!!!<br />After reading reviews I purchased the 4X<br />I am a size woman 8/10 ......It RUNS SMALL☆<br />The 4X is PERFECT for a sized 8-10 woman...<br />I purchased the Purple one....It is made with durable material double layered....for the price it is AMAZING!!!!!<br />The Lace is woven in the material<br />It hides Everything....Even My Back Rolls,whew!!!!<br />I Really like the Double BELLYFAT enforcement with outter attached Corset!!!!<br />Wide Crotchless opening helps for bathroom breaks!!!<br />I Recommend it!!!!!!"
5.0,"These are the softest, warmest socks ever made.  They keep my feet warm, they stay up, they're the best.  Thank the Alpacas for donating their fur."
5.0,does the job well. I am able to wear my deep necked tops without any issues now. Will buy more of these in different colors if available. Fits perfectly - I am a small size normally and bought small size of these.
5.0,"I wanted to get a super comfortable AND stylish headband to wear and I've found it! I was really attracted by the color because it is a soft pink and looks comfy. I'm very happy with the color and it is extremely comfortable! I've sweated in it and just lazed around in it and it is super comfortable in either case. It fits perfectly and doesn't scratch at all, which some headbands do. I love it!"
5.0,perfect fit i like it
5.0,These are fantastic for new walkers.  Protects their little toes when they fall so much at first!  New twins will be getting these same shoes when they are ready to walk!
5.0,Just as needed. Working great for cleaning.
5.0,"Beutiful, legant and great quality! I very highly recommend it. Great service from seller too!"
5.0,This band fits my Tissot well and seems to be made of very good quality material
5.0,"I work in a medical lab, so I've worn all kinds of masks, but when I'm not at the hospital I prefer to wear these. They don't hurt behind my ears like masks do, and the air seems to be directed down because of the extra space in the neck, so my glasses are unlikely to steam up even when exerting myself."
5.0,"Fast shipping, could t find these shoes anywhere in my size. They were sold out everywhere. I say get a size up however I like my shoes to be snug."
5.0,Very pretty and strongly constructed.

5.0,"I liked my first pair so much that when I lost them, I had to get another pair.  I love these sunglasses."
5.0,"I am so in love with my new jacket! It is absolutely adorable! It’s so soft on the outside and smooth and silky soft on the inside. The last two photos I have attached are the inside and it’s hard to do tell what it looks like but it’s a very soft, silky material.<br /><br />The fit is perfect. I am 52 o weigh 185 pounds and I got an extra large. It’s not too tight, it’s not too big. It’s just right. I could not have wanted for a bigger size, which I was worried about.<br /><br />It’s the best jacket and I’m going to get lots of use out of it."
5.0,Amazing look.
5.0,This nylon bag is perfect!! I love it!! The zippered pockets are just what I wanted.
5.0,"This ""CURLBIUTY Women's Long Sleeve Plaid Cardigan Button Down Sweater with PocketsCURLBIUTY Women's Long Sleeve Plaid Cardigan Button Down Sweater with Pockets"" is great! It's soft, flowy, and comfortable! I definitely recommend it!"
5.0,"I love Champion tennis shoes, and as someone that works 8  hour shifts on her feet all day doing insane amounts of physical labor, they work wonderfully! The shoes themselves are absolutely beautiful and are so comfortable. I've bought them before and so I knew what size to buy, and the new pair obviously fits because I knew what I was getting into. They last for a long time, so I'm super excited. They were also 10 dollars cheaper online, 20 dollars if you use prime, so I highly recommend these shoes!"
5.0,"These were a gift for my wife, she loves them."
5.0,The ring is gorgeous. I wish it came in a smaller size so I could wear it on my ring finger.
5.0,very nice look
5.0,"I love these. They were larger than I expected and that was great. For the cost of these, they cannot be beat. I would suggest these to anyone making necklaces, earrings, and bracelets."
5.0,My go to nose ring
5.0,Really cute. Perfect size. Inspected thoroughly and found no flaws. When it arrived the purse and every strap wrapped in plastic to preserve. Plan to order another color.
5.0,Being a poker player it's the best hat for me bring me Good Luck !!!👌👌
5.0,Great look. More pleather looking but still a good buy!
5.0,I bought these to have at my house for my one year old grandson. They are so easy to get on and he walks very well in them.
5.0,"This is beautiful! Colors are vivid and bright! Fit is great, although I am only 5'4 and weigh 170, it is alittle long, but if I ordered a size down it would be too tight across bust (42 dd. But it looks good with white tank underneath and it is alittle off one shoulder on me. It is nearly perfect and I love love love! Am constantly amazed by the quality of Amazon products."
5.0,I bought this banner as a birthday gift for a friend and she loves it! Great buy!
5.0,"Really liked it, other than the font and pictures could be a bit bigger because it's a big shirt. The pictures on the shirt are good quality."
5.0,Love it is exactly as described great price fast shipping
5.0,"I like it when everything I have makes a statement, and this keychain says it all.  I have three kids and I am always telling them if you believe you can then you will and now I have the keychain that proves it.  It is also important that the keychain will last and from how it feels it will.  It is made well and with quality."
5.0,"First, I love the deep eggplant color.  There is a nice sturdy piece that goes on the bottom for extra strength.  I’ve used these for grocery several times without any issues.  The bag can be packed full and very heavy, and still no problem.  I recently filled one with books and it is very sturdy.  I might get more for my family."
5.0,Gave a girl this and she went crazy
5.0,"Looks good, washed well and comfortable."
5.0,"My toddler daughter wants to be a ghost for Halloween, but she does not like scary ones (we tried to get her another costume in the store, and she refused it). I saw this one and I thought it would do because it's a combination of a ghost and a princess; in any case, nothing too frightening. It arrived today (to the seller's credit, a week before the expected time), and so far I am very pleased with it. It looks great on my little one, and it does not scare her. In fact, I could barely take it off her to put it aside for Halloween. She absolutely loves it, and it looks very cute on her. The material is not exactly the sturdiest, but it will do its job. It is in any case much better than the one the costumes in the stores I've seen are made. I'm glad we're settled for this Halloween.<br />I highly recommend it!"
5.0,I love this skirt  im so exited !! Cant wait to wear it on Christmas partty
5.0,WOW!!!! Awesome buy.<br />Am going to order more.<br />Arrived very quickly for an item sent directly from China.<br />Thanks.
5.0,I have extremely sensitive ears - so much so that I haven't worn earrings in over 3 years - but I have a collection of dangling earrings that I love and I wanted to start wearing again.  I have double-pierced ears and wanted a pair of dainty earrings I could wear every day in my upper pierced spots and these are absolutely perfect for that.  I wore them for three days straight and only remembered they were in there when I happened to brush by one.  No irritation or pain.  Perfect!
5.0,Love this dress although it did have a seam issue but nothing that I couldn't fix!  It was comfortable and I got alot of compliments on it!
5.0,i bought these for my daughter and my grand daughter. they were these all the time because the material is a little thicker and much softer than anything they can get in any department store.  they fit great and last a very long time. they are great.
5.0,Very useful to wear casually
5.0,Good for a shower sandal
5.0,Love this dress ! Very pretty
5.0,"These are super cute and exactly what I wanted. It’s difficult to find jewelry in rose gold, especially this inexpensive. Would recommend"
5.0,"Such a cute top, very soft and comfortable my daughter loves it."
5.0,"I wish it would have fit me, but it was small.  I am and XL regularly and ordered the biggest size available, it was still like one or two sizes too small."
5.0,My son and I bought the backpacks when we traveled from the USA to Africa. We lived for 2 months in Africa doing mission work. The backpack held up perfectly. We now use it back home whenever we need a backpack.
5.0,Very comfortable with a strong clasp. Fun colors to choose from. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Why do I buy expensive glasses, these are just as comfortable and I don’t care if I loose them, which I did in Sedona, now I’m buying them again."
5.0,"Having two sunglasses is sweet.  I prefer to use the brown lens for driving, and the dark lens for bright outdoor days on the beach."
5.0,I love these. I initially purchased it to bring with me when I buy produce at the grocery or farmers' markets... but it is extremely  useful for a lot of things as well. I am currently using this as a bag when I go shopping and I also use these to store veggies from the garden. I am currently hanging this as well with some herbs - trying to dry them in the next few weeks. Definitely useful and versatile - love that it comes in 12.
5.0,"Made in USA, Phoenix AZ.<br /><br />A co worker of mine has been using these for years, and I wanted to pick one up. I am a mechanic at a outdoor industrial plant here in AZ. It gets really hot, this thing is a life saver. Easy to put on, and fits comfortably under a ball cap or hard hat. Sweat is absorbed by the material well, and the back cover sufficiently protects your neck and ears from the inferno sun we deal with."
5.0,"It's a skirt, a shirt, a shawl, a purse, a wedding veil... It is whatever your child can imagine. Such a wonderful toy that really encourages your child's innate creativity to emerge.<br /><br />The silk, though thin, is very durable and Sarah's Silks hold up well over the years."

5.0,"I wear it all the time in honor of my sweet deceased cat, Luna."
5.0,"This is an amazing watch band! The leather smell is addicting!! It makes my watch look that much better and a great alternative to the sport band. The leather is a bit stiff but I rolled them up individually placed rubber bands around them and kept it like that for a few days. I put them back on my watch and perfect!! The bands are stiff only because these are genuine, thick, quality leather!! I love the band and will be ordering more!"
5.0,"So I made the mistake of ordering a 3XL when I typically wear an XL... Imma say it's true to size, so just use your judgement when choosing a size! Apart from that, it arrived ahead of time, and is really nice. The print looks immaculate, and the shirt is super comfortable to wear! If you're debating it, I definitely recommend!"
5.0,Perfect gift for any nurse!
5.0,"Best feeling, wearing, fitting, durable satin cap ever! Nice not to tight fit, does not cause sweating and stays in place while sleeping! Loving the color! Best buy."
5.0,Loved the fun blingy sparkle this added to my keyring!
5.0,"First, I expected the lightweight, (so called solid stainless), however; to my surprise these were actually the real deal heavy solid stainless gauges that so many others claim in their ads. The stone placement is on point and I expect them to last , as all of the other fake stainless do not. A+++++"
5.0,Grandson loves them!<br />Exactly what I ordered!
5.0,"Very pretty watch. No second hand, but that means no ticking, and it doesn't bother me. Been wearing it for a week, have gotten several compliments, and have no complaints!"
5.0,"This robe is well made, the fabric is just the right weight for summer evenings and mornings.  It is like putting on your favorite sweatshirt.  You will be very happy with this robe."
5.0,"It is a relief to deal with a manufacturer who you can count on to deliver a quality product. The niches in which I use Land End, jeans and parkas I have found the quality lifespan and overall Construction to be first-rate. While sometimes pricey if you are patient and shop for sales you're going to get a great value."
5.0,"I’m 5’5 130lbs and got a medium. I love showing off my chest and this dress really does that. Since the event I went to was more conservative I had to safety pin it in the middle a little. It does lay thin or tight enough that I choose to wear spanks so you couldn’t see any bumps, cellulite, or pudge.. you know the things that everyone has and makes us human but society tell us it not ok... haha  Again a personal preference."
5.0,Very pretty for the price.  I plan to wear this at my daughters wedding.
5.0,Great Halloween costume! My 4 year still wears it for imaginary play. I’m usually Doc Oc. I don’t have that costume though. She’s very tall so I ordered for her height not age. She’s 46” tall and 45lbs.
5.0,"I ordered two of these--one for each of my boys. My sons are 4 years and 18 mos. old. I am extremely happy with these bow ties! They arrived quickly and are really beautiful. They're easy to adjust and seem pretty comfortable--at least, the boys wore them without complaining. We got so many compliments that I plan to order more of them in different colors!"
5.0,Very warm and soft. I'm looking forward to biking in this.
5.0,"These are the best clip-ons I have ever used. you have to get the right size/shape for your particular glasses though, and they only work with wire-rim style."
5.0,It fit perfectly. My son love it.
5.0,"These were my wedding earrings, and I'm so glad I picked them! Super bright and shiny. Photographer really well and didn't irritate my sensitive ears."
5.0,Had cataract surgery and needed dark glasses to wear over regular glasses.  These glasses were not heavy and wore very well.
5.0,"This has become my favorite bag. Black goes with almost everything, just enough pockets, just the right size. It's so soft and well constructed. This purse should last a long time and look great."
5.0,Love the Lycra material but it runs small. I bought a large and my tops are usually US 4-6
5.0,High quality footless zip onesie. I really like that the zipper goes sll the way to the foot making it really easy to put on and off. Material is soft. Great for Christmas!
5.0,Never can go wrong with Converse
5.0,My God daughter loved her birthday dress she wore for 2days.
5.0,"I purchased this dress and it is so beautiful the material, design and style is absolutely gorgeous looks exactly like the picture."
5.0,"It is what it is....I use this to run, workout, and beat up. Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin."
5.0,A little cleavage-y for my taste but a little lace bralette underneath worked great.
5.0,"This bad boys are just fun. I get comments everywhere I go with them. Hell, I even drove home from an event with them on, and it's nice how a singular shade gives you uninterrupted view while driving! GET THESE!"
5.0,These earrings are great! They're nice and light-weight and can be worn with hair down for a casual look or hair up for a dressier feel. Also nice and easy to put in and take out but no danger of them accidentally slipping out. I love them and actually wear them a lot!
5.0,Way too large!!!!!!
5.0,"Nice quality. My son loves it. I wishe i had bought him a 5T instead of 4T. Runs a little small, but so are a lot of PJs."
5.0,Great deal. People think it's far more expensive.
5.0,This is perfect.  Drapes nicely.  It was to long for me (I’m 5’3) but I knew it would be when I purchased it.  I added buttons on the sides to bring it up a little and it’s PERFECT.
5.0,"This pocket safe was definitely handy!  Some people say they can control their money and manage their wallet, but this pocket safe makes sure of it!  Saved me many times and made sure I broke even or stashed away any profit!  With $100 dollar bills, I was able to stuff $1800 or so using the slot opening.  The pocket safe is roughly the size of a deck of playing cards.  I would highly recommend this!"
5.0,This dress is Beautiful. I brought it for my granddaughter and she didn't want to take it off! She loves it so much that she wants me to by it in different colors!!!
5.0,Excellent socks for long distance flights
5.0,I ordered these in XL expecting them to fit as Large and they fit but I think one more size up would have been more comfortable. The waist doesn't roll and does slightly flatten the tummy
5.0,"The picture does not do this ring justice. It is so detailed, and there is no mistaking that this is a bulldog! I love bulldogs so I was so happy to get this. I've been wearing it almost constantly and I get so many compliments. I like that it's adjustable so I'm not stuck wearing it on the same finger. I love the packaging it came in, and the cloth bag it was in was really classy looking. This is a great ring to get for the bulldog lover in your life.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way."
5.0,"The invisible reusable push up bra has a comfortable gel cushion which makes it a little thicker compared my other adhesive bra. The adhesiveness of this bra is easier to remove and put on without the feeling like your skin is tearing off. It is a lot more gentle.<br />There's also a circle in the middle where there's no adhesive for your nipples. Another thing that I love about this product is the front closure. It's just like your standard front closure bra. Fast, easy, and to the point. I wore it the whole day, so comfortable and it didn't fall out. However, it did loosen up a bit. Not a lot but it was expected.<br /><br />Absolutely love this bra because now I don't have to show straps anymore when I'm wearing my dresses anymore!<br />It says to order a size up, but I just ordered my regular cup size for my regular bra which is a B and it fit perfects.<br /><br />(For sizing reference, my cup size is 32B, 32 inches around the bust, and 30 inches under the bust)<br /><br /> The product can be very durable and reusable if it is cared for properly. I just clean it each time I use it with warm water with some soap and gently rub it, then air dry them.

5.0,The pants are very pretty and comfortable. What I didn't like was the see through. I returned them.
5.0,My son LOVES his Vans. They look great with everything are comfy. They are one of his go to shoes.

5.0,Its pretty cool beans. I like it fits alot
5.0,Perfect earrings and the clamp works well.
5.0,Love Mud Pie!
5.0,"I was instantly drawn to this sweatshirt.  It's classy, sturdily constructed and the materials look expensive.  But I expected a more fine tailoring.  I'm handy with the sewing machine , so I altered the serged  hemline.  In any shirt, the hemline should be sewn not serged.  My discerning taste thus satisfied,  I'm very happy with this garment.  The pearl fastener at the nape opening also adds an elegant touch."
5.0,I get many compliments!
5.0,Looks very good. kids loves it.
5.0,"They are PERFECT! I want a pair for myself haha. My daughter loves them! They fit perfect, too."

5.0,Sooo cute! My daughter in laws loved them and so did the grands.
5.0,I like everything about this outfit
5.0,Beautiful jacket/coat.  Fits great. Very warm and comfy.  I would call the color &#34;pewter&#34; as opposed to &#34;granite&#34; as it has a metallic look.
5.0,"Seems to be a great show, made well and son loves it"
5.0,Perfect!  Receive lots of compliments when I where this dress!
5.0,I used the cape to finish off my ladybug costume and it was perfect!  The cape is much higher quality than a lot of Halloween costumes. I purchased the ladybug dress itself separately and wore black tights and a black mock neck top under it.  The cape brought it all together as “wings”.
5.0,Nice looking wach!!
5.0,I was very pleased with this bra.  The fit was true to size and has a lot of support.  Easy front clasp. I will definitely be buying another one.
5.0,"Bought this for my little and she loved it. It fit really well, she’s 5’ and was a bit long on her, but the quality was great!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e56482090c045fad20ac4d0c11d55bcc]] Trust me this set is true to size and is even more gorgeous in person. A must have 💯💯
5.0,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because the design she liked and there has been a shortage in Pajamas lately and hard to find in a Youth large. So I bought her a extra small and it fit her good! So if you have the same problem with your tween I would recommend these Pajamas.
5.0,They are the stars shown. Its so soft and shines like crazy!
5.0,nice dress - use size chart when ordering - like the 3/4 sleeves - so reasonably priced.
5.0,"Good craftsmanship, they do not look cheap at all, neither too big nor too small - happy with the purchase."
5.0,"This hat is perfect, and you can't beat the price. I bought the charcoal gray/black one for myself (I'm a 33 yr old mom with really thick dark hair) and it fits and looks great. It also looks great on my husband. What I wasn't expecting was that it also fits my 2 yr old son too! Granted it has more of a slouchy, hipster fit on him, it still fits him. Pretty handy to have a hat that works for everyone in the family - if I feel like sharing. :)"
5.0,"Madewell fits well, I did order a size large and usually wearing a tan dress size fits perfectly absolutely love this dress"
5.0,"I am over the moon with my purchase. It fits perfectly, even if you have been blessed upstairs. (*)(*) I would let this review persuade you into buying one.  But only one, I don't want to be all ""matchy-matchy"" with my fellow species. Y'all gonna love it."
5.0,great visor

5.0,"The simplicity of this watch makes it elegant in my book. Love that it can be worn with jeans, to the office, or dressed up with other jewelry."
5.0,I needed a new ring to wear as my wedding ring for a new job I started working. I couldn't be happier with it.  It is true to its size and looks wonderful on. I love the thickness of the band. I've received many compliments on it.
5.0,This fit perfectly and was great for winter
5.0,though rather expensive it works really well to soften and darken leather
5.0,At a polo match this is the best outfit for a fancy baby!<br /><br />We took our little girl to her first polo match and we decided to get this outfit for her.<br /><br />She looked casual chic and super comfortable as well.<br /><br />As she started to take her first steps in the Field I was making sure that she would not sit on the floor cause I was not about to wash this beautiful pair of shorts full of horse doodoo.<br /><br />The little romper has buttons and I love that since it makes so easy for me to do her changes specially out on the field if I have to cause the ports potties are not the best for baby changes you know.<br /><br />And the pants are the best! the fabric is silk and soft.<br /><br />The colour of the outfit is not the best for a super warm day but it is good for those days that can get pretty warm during sunlight hours but can get chilly later.<br /><br />Our girl seemed to be very comfortable while wearing it and did not fuss to put it on or take it off at all! she loved it I dare to say!
5.0,The tie case will be very useful.
5.0,These shorts fit so well. I’ve bought many shorts and they just fit awkward on me. They are so comfortable and cute. I’ll be buying more in different colors!!

5.0,Great deal for the price!!  The jewelry is very well-made and very shiny!!
5.0,"I have several tops from this company.  I ordered this to see how I liked the longer version of the tunic top.  I love this!  It is long enough that I can wear it as a dress, (I'm 5&#34;3), yet I could also wear this with leggings.  This material is very soft.  I wash in cold water, delicate cycle, and dry on low heat, then hang immediately.  So far, for the price, I am really happy with all of the items I've ordered. I ordered this in a M, and it is loose and flowy, which I like. I could probably wear a small, but I think it would be tighter across the bust than I like, and not as long.  (It hits just above my knees)  I think I have 6 or 7 of these and love them all. Be aware that the fabric is on the thin side.  Not see through, but lightweight.  I was ordering from one of the larger MLM companies, and found that they were super overpriced, and the quality of Larace is better."
5.0,Just what I needed to fix the sun shade
5.0,"I have purchased all that were in my size, I absolutely love these! They are comfortable, breezy, and perfect for my Florida weather!"
5.0,If your looking to replace or add to  the one you have for years this is it!

5.0,"So worth it. I’m not a big fan of sunglasses, especially spending $100+ on glasses but these are amazing !!!!"
5.0,Great shorts and love the stretch!
5.0,"This is so beautiful , not girly looking , My husband was in Vietnam did 2 tours & I wish I had this to give to him when he left to Vietnam,  but he did get it yhis fathers day. .. thank you for making this lovely coin for our &#34;&#34; Hero's&#34;&#34;"

5.0,"Beautiful, simple, cowrie shell bracelet made with an intricately braided wax cord. Natural cowrie shells are attached to the cord throughout the bracelet. Very soft pink colored enameled shells.<br /><br />The bracelet length is adjustable from 6.7” to 13.4”.

5.0,Daughter absolutely LOVES IT !!!!

5.0,I love these shoes.  I have brought bought three different kinds of them  First time was at the Mesa fleamarket and since then I’ve been buying them from Amazon
5.0,"It seems to be sturdy and a good quality bag. I've used it many times.<br />It's a little bit bigger than most crossbodys and it fits my things perfect.<br />Phone, glasses, small wallet and a few other items. I love this purse.<br />Hope to buy another color soon."
5.0,"This was an amazon daily special.<br />This was purchased as a gift.<br />The wool is fine and soft, almost delicate.<br />The print is well defined.<br />The size is very nice. It’s longer and at least three times wider than the average scarf.<br />The recipient loves it! I am a hero!"
5.0,"I love it! It's a bit tight on the hole I have it on, but if I wear it one looser, it's too lose. Maybe that's my incentive to lose a few lbs. Other than that, it was super easy to out on and looks great!"

5.0,Made a welcomed Mother's Day gift.
5.0,I love it . It’s a perfect dress ❤️.
5.0,Love it!! Nice color and quality!
5.0,"I was kind of skeptical because nearly every review seems to be a biased review (even though they claim it isn't) since they got these for free. I took the chance and bought them and I'm actually pretty happy with them. For the price ($13) they seem pretty premium, and they come in a decent case. They are pretty clear and the polarizing does seem to be effective. I'd choose these over a $20 pair of Target sunglasses (I went to target and compared them to make sure I wasn't wasting my money on these). So if you want an inexpensive pair of sunglasses, go ahead and get these. If I give these a five star rating, I would say Targets sunglasses are probably three stars comparatively."
5.0,Love love love it!!  So soft and light.  It's just perfect
5.0,"very cute, reminded me of summer, the charm has been holding up on my bracelet well"
5.0,Kid loves them. Perfect fit. Comes with carring case.

5.0,"Great fit, good material, highly recommend this brand."
5.0,"Does the job, allowing easy removal of the fob from the key chain"
5.0,I am 5’5” and about 135 lbs. I ordered the medium and the are the perfect length and fit. They are a tiny bit loose around the lower calves but not annoyingly so. I plan to wear them for yoga and spinning.
5.0,Great return policy and very responsive!
5.0,"Beautiful piece, I've used it many times in the past year and it still makes me smile to display.  Clasp still locks tight after constant use, metal still nice and shiny.  I highly recommend this product and seller and will consider another purchase in the future for similar items."
5.0,Fits great ! A little long but they shrink a tiny but in the wash. They are pretty thin material so they snag easily but they’re comfy and they fit around my waist line.
5.0,Received so many compliments.
5.0,"Bought this dress for my niece she loved it ,"
5.0,"Tightly grips glasses and holds them close to your face. Since I've had them I haven't had to readjust the tightness, they are high quality. Great for glasses that ""slide"" down your nose or fall off your face."
5.0,Love it and every time a wear it I get a complement
5.0,Love soft silky
5.0,"The gloves fit well and are comfortable.  The color is true to the photo.  The mitten tops folds back easily and stay put.  I had tried a pair with magnets to hold back the mitten tops, but those did not stay put.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for comfort and ease in a convertible glove/mitten."
5.0,"I ordered Vetelli black leather gloves as a Christmas present for my son.  I love them!  They are so soft, wonderfully made and they look like they will be the perfect fit! I ordered the medium and had my husband try them on. The size looks great!  From the smile on my husband's face he might just be getting a pair, too!"
5.0,"Crazy how such a large watch is still so light and so comfortable. Easily my favorite gshock now. Seems to be made from the good kind of resin that absorbs wear/abuse without showing signs after. Has typical downsides to a negative display, but still one of the better negative displays. But if you don't like them, this won't change that for you. Always gets atomic sync."
5.0,"Nice material, bought gif a Christmas gift"
5.0,Yes the dress  was gorgeous!
5.0,I love this bag organizer. I like to know where everything is in my bag and this was the absolute answer for me. It has multiple pockets and compartments for all your needs. Please check measurements before buying. Can’t go wrong with this.
5.0,My niece loved these! She’s 3 years old but I purchased a 4T so she can still grow into them. She was obsessed and put them on right away. They wash great too and don’t shrink! Perfect!! Would definitely recommend!!

5.0,Awesome quality will recommend to my fellow Rangers!!!
5.0,It was very comfortable. I would not call it  dress though. Most definitely have to wear pants or tights with this. I added other laces at the bottom of the lace up part to put my own twist on things.
5.0,Great for the price and nice quality
5.0,My old slippers wore out.  These are great.
5.0,"This dress is a dream. It's soft and flowy, comfortable and sexy. I ordered an xl and it fit great. I'm a size 14/16 and very busty.<br /><br />I returned because I had ordered a few dresses for a white party and went with something short.

5.0,"The Ad graphic is great!  I got one for my son-in-law and loved it so much, I ordered another for my grandson.  Both were Christmas gifts!  They both loved it!"
5.0,"These are lightweight and give me clarity for all things near-vision. What I love most about them is 1. I can easily put them on my head when not in use, and not pull out half my hair when I bring them down to use. 2. The texture of the frame, nosepad and legs have a slight resistance to it (instead of a smooth/slippery and heavier plastic/acetate?) which helps it stay in position on my face and ears much better without sliding down my face. 3. The three levels of strength allow for a greater range of distance viewing than a single strength lens- ie from looking at my phone in my hand, to my computer screen, to documents in my cabinet, I can see it all with these tri-focus readers. Now all it needs is blue light protection and they would be perfect."
5.0,"Very classy as well as classic houndstooth pattern in a contemporary ruana style.  I love it.  It's of excellent quality and a bargain price, in my opinion.  I bought the black and white houndstooth as a gift and I think I'm going to order one for myself as well.  Also, super speedy delivery.  I received in two days, and that was without Prime."
5.0,Very pretty. Not as small as I thought it would be based on previous reviews. Just the right size!
5.0,"This product fits well. I ordered a size up because I wanted it extra baggy, but if you order your usual size it should fit well. Also, it’s the softest, most comfortable material."
5.0,Nicely made and beautiful. My 9 year old thought the set was great. She liked it because it was &#34;fun and different&#34; so I'm glad I made the purchase for her. Thanks again Amazon for bringing another great product!

5.0,"I bought the ghost design... Love the fabric and design.<br />Product is slightly large, which workers well for me."
5.0,"This item seems to be quite sturdy. Only complaint is that they are a bit too tall for my Suunto xlander watch strap. They do hold the strap well enough, but not as snug as the original  strap loop."
5.0,These were so cute and fit my 4 year old perfectly for preschool 50s day! Much better quality than I expected.
5.0,Excellent quality. Fast delivery time.  Thank you.

5.0,kinda awkward cut but I still like the tank to workout in!
5.0,My husband was able to remove links quickly and easily to make the perfect fit with the resizing tool included.
5.0,Stylish comfortable jacket. I wear a 50 regular and the 2x fits me perfect
5.0,"Beautiful color, style and fabric.  My daughter is an average to tall 6 1/2 year old. The length was perfect but the top was a little big so it hung a little lower than we wanted.  I just pulled it back and did a 1/2 inch long stitch in 2 places with my sewing machine.  Problem solved.  I can easily take them out when she gets bigger.  My only concern is that the zipper is in the back so using the bathroom at school on Halloween without my help could be an issue.  I may detach the top from the bottom and add elastic to the pants in the waist but I am comfortable with that sort of project so it wouldn’t be too big of a deal and could make it easier for my daughter to wear and play dress up. SUPER happy with this purchase, the price, quality and style.  So happy there is no bare midriff and sleeves!!!"
5.0,"I loved these boots. So cute, but unfortunately too small for me. They run true to size. I am always a 9 1/2 and I ordered a 9 because the half size wasn't available. But they didn't work"

5.0,Used for a wedding.

5.0,"Well made, great size and style for a great price. My daughter that we bought them for loves them!!"
5.0,"Adjustable, love the various designs, so far so good. Compfy, festive with optional filter. Hopefully wont be required to wear much longer"
5.0,"These are very nice made khaki pants. They are made of wonderful khaki material and are nice and soft. They taper down towards the bottom of the feet and there are several pockets for these cargo khakis. The color is a beautiful tan. It is almost as if it's a little bit tanish- yellow. My husband really liked these khakis however they were somewhat large around the waist area. I ordered him the large because that is his true size. Unfortunately, these pants run a little large. Other than that they have a beautiful drawstring to keep the pants up and an elastic waist. These are excellent pants for lounging around. They are made of a nice thick material and are very durable. Overall, this set of khaki pants is well made."
5.0,"Material seems like it'll hold up, we've only used it once, but we like it!"
5.0,"socks shipped quick, made of quality materials.  Strong toe and heel so should last with rugger workouts.  Make your feet and calves feel great.  I would definitely recommend these socks.  My father is a diabetic with neoropathy and these have really helped him."

5.0,"I like this dress so much! It's so cute and comfortable! I'm 8 months pregnant,  took S size, like my regular size before pregnancy."
5.0,BEST leggings I’ve purchased and a great price!
5.0,These are the coolest shoes. I wish they still made them and made bigger sizes. I really need a boys/mens 7 but they don't make them that big! I had hoped I could squish into the 6.5 but they are pretty uncomfortably tight. Definitely on the small side of 6.5 but they are SO cool that I still wear them sometimes when I know I won't have to do too much walking. They feel well made and I get lots of comments on them :)
5.0,"This tutu leotard is absolutely everything I had hoped for! The tutu is full and fluffy, the material is comfortable and the color is beautiful! We will defiantly be buying many more of these!"

5.0,So so pretty! The bottom is a heavy almost stretchy  material. Top part feels like cotton. Nice zipper on the side to help get it on and off.<br />I bought the black in extra large. I'm 5'5 and plus size.
5.0,"This is a wonderful top! I suppose it can be worn as a dress if you're young enough, it's long enough to be a bodycon minidress. I wore it for the first time today with a maxi skirt and a shawl scarf, and got nothing but compliments and inquiries as to where I bought it. It fits really well, and is very comfortable, I love it!"
5.0,This is a great pack. I use this for my trauma bag and it opens up for me to put my quick clot and trauma dressings. Great size bag.
5.0,I was looking to purchase a group of earrings for a great price. When I came across these I immediately fell in love with them as they were not only creative but also were a tribute to RBG.  I love that each set is representative of her but is also unique and design. If you love earrings I would purchase these
5.0,This is a very comfortable fleece jacket that can be worn in cold weather or without a coat in spring weather. It's light but still very warm. The overall look is good and it fit as expected. I bought a large and there is room for a dress short underneath.

5.0,Greatly package came as expected nice hat my dad love it. Thank you will be ordering again.

5.0,This dress is so comfortable and fits perfectly.  I love this dress.  Will probably purchase another soon.
5.0,Bought these for my oldest son for a pool party and he loved them. He really likes the biker short fit of the shorts underneath. He wants me to purchase more to just wear…not just for swimming.
5.0,Great for spacing pictures or paintings off the glass without the need for a photo mat
5.0,"It's a really sweet, girly belt. I love it. It'll go perfect with my dress. It's stretchy but I definitely wouldn't say this would fit everyone."
5.0,Its a x-mas toy for grandson...ty
5.0,It fits perfectly and it's helping with tightening my arms
5.0,"I have three piercings in one of my ears and like to use tiny studs in the upper two.  I also am too lazy to take my studs out every night to sleep, so these earrings with slightly flexible posts are perfect for a lazy person like me because I can comfortably sleep in them.  Because they're so cheap, if I loose one or the crystal falls out, it's no big deal.  I've spend big bucks on fancy crystal earrings only to have the stones fall out and get lost.  No more!  Also, all three boxes came with the backs--nothing missing as some of the folks said they had problems with.  Thanks!"
5.0,"I mean, I cannot stand clowns, so it was hard for me to buy this.  But my son was so excited and loved the costume."

5.0,Really great cheaper product but runs large
5.0,These glasses are great. Good quality. Lightweight and comfortable. The only thing is I think that someone else had them before me as some of the protective covering over the glasses was missing. I highly recommend them
5.0,Mobile drinking? Yes please
5.0,So cool. Sunofabeach.
5.0,I bought these awhile ago and they still stick perfectly. 3 came in the pack and I’ve only used 1 so far. I’ve used it 5-6x and it still sticks and looks great. These are the perfect bra for backless tops/dresses.
5.0,"This tote is super cute. It’s a nice size! I can hold my Bible and my sons Bible in it plus all of our accessories- pens, highlighters, notebooks, ect. It holds my cell phone and wallet as well! It’s heavy duty and I hope to purchase from you again soon."
5.0,"Warm, waterproof. Can’t really use phone with them on."
5.0,came quickly and was packaged fairly nice the only thing is with these ones is that they slip off fairly easily or at least for me.
5.0,"I had already reviewed this order a few days ago but I will go ahead and review it again.  The earrings are exquisite.  I sent them to our daughter in law for her March birthday.  They were just as I had expected, beautiful color and well made.  The company sent them to me on time so that I could send them on to her in time for her birthday.  I would order them again...they are very nice.  Thank you."

5.0,Best goggles I've ever had
5.0,I bought this item for my 15 year old daughter and she just loves it. She has worn it every day since i gave it to her. She tells me that other girls at school like it so much they are asking her where to get one. The quality of the ring seems to be very good and for such a reasonable price.
5.0,This is a cool item. Keeps you from wearing additional medical bracelet. Very easy to set up & use.

5.0,"MY FAVORITE SHIRT.  IT IS ELEGANT AND COMFY, LIGHT AND PERFECT.  I WANT MORE LIKE THIS.  I LOVE THE LACE.  THE SHIRT HITS ME ABOUT WHERE IT DOES ON THE MODEL.  I HAVE A LONG WAIST AND BIG TUMMY.  I HAVE GOTTEN MANY COMPLEMENT ON THIS SHIRT.  I WILL BUY MORE."
5.0,"Positives:<br />Fits a lot of types of glasses<br />Adjustable strap size<br />Connects to the glasses with a simple round grip<br />Stretchy band<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Was a bit tight on a larger head<br /><br />Review:<br />These are pretty nice! I didn't notice any quality differences between the 4 included straps, and they all worked properly. I tried them on some reading glasses with thick arms, some wire frames, and some thin plastic frames. It worked fine on all of them! I imagine if your glasses have particularly thick arms it may not work though. They were also just a tad bit too tight for me (i have a large head), but this definitely isn't the norm.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
5.0,Having had major right shoulder surgery I needed a shirt I could get in and out of without much effort and pain. These shirts did the trick and saved me from a lot of frustration when changing. Definitely recommend.

5.0,Don't know it's a Christmas gift I haven't given it away yet
5.0,Bought these earrings as gifts for my coworkers to wear at our annual Xmas luncheon. They're fun and lovely too and were really enjoyed by all.
5.0,I brought this to give myself another strap for my shoulder bag. It is just as advertised wide and sturdy . I hight recommend for any one wanted to change the way or replaced that strap for a favorite bag. I just wish that it were a large variety of colors and designs . This strap is adjustable making it easy to carry any item easy clips to lash onto your favorite bag accessory. I am satisfied with this I am preparing to buy another strap. I highly recommend this item.
5.0,A gift. Sturdy. Excellent quality
5.0,"This sleep cap is comfy, has a nice design/fabric, is cool to the touch given its satin-lining and fits well. Given it's slouchy structure, it doesn't flatten your hair and allows for moisture so your scalp doesn't get overly dry while sleeping. After wearing these sleep caps (bought 3 more) my scalp feels happier in the morning. Thanks."
5.0,Happy with my choice 👍
5.0,My girlfriend is very happy with this piece of jewelry.
5.0,I have used this for a little over a month for going in and out of work and going into restaurants and the grocery store. It has adjustable ear loops to assure a proper fit and two fabric layers and a filter to keep things from getting in or getting out if you happen to be sick. Plus I am able to support my favorite college sports team in the process! Just wish their were care instructions on the order oage or included with the delivery.

5.0,I bought this for my teenage daughter whom is about 5'6 and 120 lbs. This fit perfectly with no alterations needed. Just remember there is a button in the back to close the lace up. Everyone thought this dress was waaay more expensive than it was.
5.0,"Just as described - held up great for the cleaning job we needed it for.  We disposed of them after use, but I'm sure it could be re-used."
5.0,"I love this bag.  The hardware, zips and lots of pockets make look fabulous.  The material is just the right firmness so it holds its shape without being too rigid.  It is also the perfect size."

5.0,"Great for twirling, dries quickly. My daughter likes to play Madam President in this dress."
5.0,"What a great pair of work pants! Very, very happy with these. Except a snap came off and I don't know if I can exchange them here or in a store.<br />Why aren't these sold here anymore? Seriously, sort it and give the people what they want."
5.0,"I purchased this product at a discount or for free or my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way did this discount alter my opinion on the product.<br /><br />I was surprised when I received these shoes as it came in a flat box and I thought to myself, I didn't order a book. I didn't mind though as I thought to myself &#34;great! that makes for easy packing.&#34; They do not take up too much room.<br /><br />I have never seen half sizes for toddler shoes so I was slightly scared that I accidentally ordered childrens sizes for my 17 month old but when I got them they fit perfect. They easily slide on and velcro together. He easily walked around with them and his feet were well protected from any falling he did. There is no chance to stub his tiny toes as the front is well covered and protected. They seem well put together and thick so I will not worry about the abuse my toddler will put them through. I chose the brown leather as they still look fashionable. Honestly I thought they looked like the shoes my 60 year old father buys for himself so I had to laugh at them. I am happy with this purchase as I was struggling to find a good pair of sandals for the summer in stores. I wanted something that wouldn't easily fall off his feet and he can run and play in and it looks like I found the shoes."

5.0,I like the ratchet belts better than the regular belts now. Very easy to use and I like this one because I have been looking for an initial belt and it looks really good.
5.0,"First I ordered a pack in a large size as suggested by their size menu. They fit too big, elastic was not even noticeable to me. On active days I wanted more support, but the quality of the briefs was superb. I decided to keep the size large for sleep wear and ordered this 4 pack of mediums for everyday use. Top quality and fit. Super comfortable. Cool on warm days. I am 6 foot 2 and 200 lbs, and have a 32 inch waist, I am told I am average size down there and the medium fits perfect."

5.0,The size the color the look was great.
5.0,This pin is beautiful and classy. I am giving as a gift for a dear friend of mine and her sisters as they recently lost their Mother. She loved pearls so this seems precious and appropriate.

5.0,Really nice fabric weight. Color is deep and rich plum. It’s nice and roomy and easy to sleep in
5.0,just what i wanted. Very satisfied.
5.0,"Love the material, bought in a small its pretty roomy (36b general dice 6-8)<br />The sleeves are like balloon like taper to a tight cuff that doesn't really pull up but a few inches but in the past waffle knit tends to stretch and get floppy so this is probably a good feature. Would recommend"
5.0,"Great product, durable Sturdy and great colors."
5.0,"It arrived late but must say , Was very happy when I saw it and it comes very nice package Good Job."
5.0,"Really liked this suit.  I've had a double mastectomy. I removed the inserts (there are openings) and used foobs (fake boobs) from another company.  I tried it with and without foobs. With is better for me, but either work well."

5.0,The necklaces are just what I wanted and they will be Christmas gifts.

5.0,"These earrings are beautiful and look like the real thing. I wore them right away and receive many compliments. They arrived well before due date, were packaged carefully, and just as described by seller. Highly recommend."
5.0,"This product and supplier performed as promised, in fact better than promised.  An outstanding value in merchandise as well as prompt shipment.  Entirely satisifed that I made an excellent buy."
5.0,Love it. Got many compliments so far. So nice not to have my hair all bunched up under a hat.
5.0,"I really like the shirt. The color is nice and so is the fit.  The directions say to hand wash but I did not do that.  Instead, I put it in a laundry bag for delicates.  I then dried it on permanent press.  Hung it up right away and no need to iron.  I have 2 of them.  I definitely recommend this item."
5.0,Love the fit and feel of it.
5.0,So comfy and cozy. Love the green color. Perfect fit true to size
5.0,"I purchased this shirt with the intent of turning it into a cutoff and wearing it when it was hot outside. NOPE. Be extremely careful while wearing this shirt outside, as sloths act like a paramone for hoes and people who want to talk to you about Reddit. I nearly cracked a rib from the sheer volume of bitches this shirt attracted during one fateful stroll in Silverlake. Wear this shirt indoors, as it is powerful and can cause injuries in the wrong hands. DO wear this shirt to job interviews, as the majesty and soothing confidence of the sloth will convince anyone that you should run their company in the image of the tranquil and mighty sloth."
5.0,"LOVE THEM FOR THE PRICE, AND THE PADS ARE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING...."
5.0,Got these because I was sick of bulky paintball gloves. Didn't want any built in protection so I went with these. Really like the feel and the grip is good. Will buy again once they wear out.
5.0,"I order medium, and was glad it was snug-serves it's purpose. Well made."
5.0,Generous sizing very soft and comfy for post partum. I have several of these and want more !
5.0,"Perfect for shorter distances (under 5 miles) perfect arch support, springy. Love my Brooks"
5.0,My son loved it and it fits great! His sister keeps stealing it even!
5.0,Really nice bra.  It fit very well and offers good support.  Does give a little more pointy shall we say perky appearance.
5.0,It’s cute and works. Fabric is very thin so when you put stuff in and take stuff out on the long side (the side with no card slots) it waves up but I don’t mind. If you are looking for something super sturdy and thick this is not it but I love it because the snap is strong and everything fits and it’s slim
5.0,Love this choker! Looks great with my Medusa costume. Love!
5.0,Honestly so comfortable. Perfect fit when sizing up 2 sizes since they run very small.
5.0,Hello thank you
5.0,"So comfortable for work. Was and wear. The length was amazing, I am 5’9 and the fit wonderfully. I bought two pair and will be buying more! Great material and soft!"
5.0,My grandson loves TShirt!<br />He loves Chuggington!❤️
5.0,"Great design, fits my &#34;cheater&#34; glasses perfectly and very attractive."
5.0,Bought these for my great granddaughter and she called me today and she loves them.
5.0,"I love this! I want one in every color!! I like the way it fits. I am not really skinny but I am not too over weight but some dresses are too tight and unflattering or too loose and unflattering. This dress/romper just fits well and it looks good and it's comfortable. 👍😁I have the reddish one and the blue one too!! I want more of them! Haha..my only complaint is that for all rompers, how you have to take it completely off to go to the bathroom!! 🙄Haha"
5.0,I read one of the reviews before ordering this product and it stated that he should have ordered one size down from a 36&#34; waist to 34&#34; so that's what I did and they fit so perfect that I probably would have prefered getting the 36&#34; just like my levis. These pants are awesome bought them just before the cold season starts. Buy your true size dont go smaller or larger.
5.0,Bought for ear protection for work.
5.0,"Have never had a crossbody before, and I am now wondering why!! Love this purse is lightweight, but has many compartments inside & out for everything I need. Purse seems to be well made with no strings or puckers or anything to deter from the overall great look!!"
5.0,This is one of the better sweaters I have bought from Amazon. I get compliments every time I wear it.
5.0,"Amazingly comfortable. Some of the Klogs can be heavy shoes, these are not. If you do a lot of walking these are a great choice"
5.0,"Love it, beautiful and well made."
5.0,Love these so much ! Great quality & theyre so cute
5.0,Surprisingly good quality for such inexpensive glasses!
5.0,Great quality. Delivered on time.
5.0,"Professional quality. Sturdy construction that's built for longevity. It is very firm, but comfortable enough for my pre-schooler. It folds into a nice rectangle with a comfortable height. We use it as a game/play table when she's not tumbling."
5.0,"I ordered this bracelet to go with an outfit I am going to wear to go out this coming weekend.  The bracelet turned out better than expected.  It is really colorful, well made and slips on and off quite well.  The beads are quality and it shines when I put it on.  There are many bracelets in this one bracelet which makes it fun to wear.  Also I don't need to add anymore jewelry to my wrist because this does the trick.  I will be ordering in some of the other colors too.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Sleek and comfortable good buy
5.0,The design is very nice and cute! I just love it!
5.0,Originally
5.0,This might be one of my favorite shirts to wear.  A little sad it is getting warmer so I won't be wearing it as much.  :-)  I have to say the material is so incredibly soft.  I have worn it and washed many times.  I wear this pretty much once every week so it gets lots of use.  I has held up so wonderfully.  Highly recommend this one.
5.0,"Cute and simple dress.  Not as flattering as other Miusol garments I have ordered, but cute nonetheless."
5.0,Loved my gloves I got for my wedding as the dress was short sleeves and I wanted coverage. However my nails were done so these glove allowed me to still show my nails and ring.
5.0,I liked this item so much that I purchased two in different colors. Wear it also as lounging around the house.
5.0,Excelente me quedo bien y a la medida
5.0,Rich and gorgeous
5.0,Christmas gift - exactly as I expected.
5.0,"I'm 5' 9&#34; with long arms and medium frame, I normally wear a L-XL but read reviews and purchased an XXL. It's a purfect fit. This is a light weight cover, great below hip length with a nice flowy drape. It's not high end fabric, will likely delicate machine or hand wash.  I'm reordering other colors!"
5.0,"These fit great, from our 18m old to our 9yr old. Definitely a pair that I would recommend."
5.0,"Waited forever!!!! Had a lil hiccup and a few stones fell off, but I found them and carefully crazy glued them back! All good..."
5.0,help me ride roller coaster
5.0,"Super comfy, a bit more stylish then your regular hoodies.  A bit thin, but love it. And it's a perfect Philadelphia Eagles Green :)"
5.0,"Bought this for my wife for an evening formal dinner. She loved it, it fit great, she looked amazing in it. No issues at all."
5.0,Received this wrap necklace today and I'm loving it...I wanted something to cover an issue I'm having with my neck and this is taking care of the problem... Also very stylish looking....wish it came it different colors though.<br />Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Seems sturdy.  Loads of pockets.  I’m very satisfied.
5.0,"enough cotton to absorb in humidity but some spandex so it is dressy enough for work. washed well- I hung dry as it seemed it might have shrunk a tad, but am not at all sure, just loved it too much to take a chance"
5.0,Its exactly what I wanted it to look like! I love it!<br />I have 14 grandchildren...10 of which is girls...I'm thinking of buying one for each one of them! Keep up great job!
5.0,It runs a LITTLE small but otherwise - Totally LOVE!!!!!!!
5.0,Very very satisfied with this watch.  I was able to resize it for my wrist with the tool provided.  The packaging and service was great!

5.0,Excellent value. Looks great. I’m 5’ 4” and the length is perfect.
5.0,Seriously amazing quality for the price. True to size. Overall beautiful!!!! ❤️
5.0,"We have this leotard in another color (2) and it is a loved leotard. This is a beautiful deep red, so we got it also. It fits beautifully. Is super comfortable. Ordering and delivery was great also."
5.0,Strap hooks don't work well
5.0,"I ordered the 50 piece. I received 50 so no problem there. Actually, no problem at all. I was really happy with the variety. No doubles, very sturdy jibbitz. Everyone wanted to get them from me. (Of course I said no.) lol Recommended 👍👍"
5.0,Too small bust for my figure type but it was a good quality and lovely design
5.0,"Quedan perfectas, suaves y buen material. Las volveria a comprar."
5.0,grandson loves everything batman.  they were a hit
5.0,Basketball team loved them
5.0,Used for a wedding - very good quality
5.0,I loved everything in The Rachel Zoe boxofstyle spring 2018 and will be looking forward to more boxes!
5.0,it seems like good quility
5.0,I like that it holds in the places I wanted it to hold me in my midsection and rear end. But it feels funny between the thighs in order to do that but since I liked I how I look I won’t  complain it’s cute
5.0,I liked it and I recommend it for you
5.0,"Fit perfect, and looks good. Would buy again."
5.0,Great look. Sizes are off a bit. I went with a 12 and it was a good choice. Lots of compliments.
5.0,This blouse is perfect!! I feel great in it!! Perfect fit and lots of compliments!!
5.0,I love these pants.  So comfy & the fit is great!
5.0,Good for showers in truck stops and they dry fast.
5.0,Son loves it his and has got many compliments. As expected has a purple tent around bottom.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:cc0fb58078cfedd26a19daa71b4c5f75]] Not too big not too small just the right size to fit your personal . Love the color very bright. Good material. I’ll come back a couple of months to see how it holding on.
5.0,Exactly as described and a very nice shade of pink. Arrived quickly! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"I bought a pair of similar moccasins from an upscale outdoors store for $90, and these are actually more comfortable. I guess time will tell how they hold up."
5.0,"My husband loves Cinch shirts and jeans. I wanted to surprise him for Christmas, and this has turned out to be his favorite one so far. I love their attention to detail. There is a stripe of solid teal satin down the buttons/button holes. You can’t see it while wearing it, so I don’t know why it’s my favorite part of the shirt. It holds a starched press all day and can be worn tucked in or left out. My Honeybear gets lots of compliments on this one!"
5.0,Cute but definitely way cuter on the model lol
5.0,Got them as a gift and they are as described and packaged nicely!
5.0,I like it a lot. I had a little trouble zipping it up my self. It was a little tight but I dont mind that at all. I bought a L i was thinking if i went with a XL it might of been less tight and i might of been able to zip it up my self. It also pushed in the stomach and the ladys looks amazing and my butt looks good too.. so I cant ask for anything any in a dress. I am thinking about buying it in another color..
5.0,good quality and shinning!  Love it so much
5.0,really good bracelet
5.0,For a bbq
5.0,Bought to hold my grand son's super hero capes and masks. He loves it.
5.0,Super cute. Stretchy. Adjustable and have received many compliments. I love the colors.
5.0,This dress is so sexy! I love the material and the way it fits! I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 178. My bust size is 38DDD and I am able to wear the dress without a bra and it provides enough support. I bought a size large in the color black. I will probably buy it in other colors also. I will say that if you don't like form fitting dresses or too revealing then this isn't the dress for you because the straps go down low and so some of your hips are exposed.
5.0,Like the fit and comfort of pants for casual wear.
5.0,"very lightweight .. very comfy (except size) ... I'm 5'11 (6' on a good day) 200lbs .. bought an XL .. it's like a MD on me .. super tight once zipped up, doesn't get above luke warm on high setting using my Samsung 10k battery pack. was expecting hot enough to turn down once fully warm .. but wore vest for 30 min on high setting .. barely got warm enough"
5.0,Dress runs small. I can fit it but very tight at the top.<br />My chest size is 42D and it very tight around my chest.
5.0,Buy this hoodie..it is a quality item that looks great and washes even better!You won’t be disappointed!<br /><br />P.S.I hang to dry
5.0,My daughter loved it wears it all the time
5.0,"Very sparkly, yet simple & elegant"
5.0,"i use this every day, and ahve had it for months. Still looks great. I like how streamlined it appears. Would have liked an external water bottle pocket, but i guess that would have detracted from the sleek look. Also, it is built very durably, fits in a gym locker perfectly, zippers are heavy duty, and the internal pocket is convenient. I don't find much use for the shoe compartment, but it can be used for other things than shoes. Anyway, if you like the look of this bag, you will not be disappointed, because it is really well made!"
5.0,"I'm buying more of these. I have a couple and I've found I always search for one when I need a black base shirt, which is almost daily.<br />I love the shape of the v-neck. It's so flattering but not revealing at all.<br /><br />Edit 2023: Please start making these again!!"
5.0,"I love these smart-key key chains! I got two to hold both sets of my smart-keys. The case looks great, clips right onto my belt loop and is just the right size and weight - comfortable to have on. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Don't hesitate, just buy it.. I wouldn't recommend washing it before you wear it, just tumble it in the dryer.. we were afraid the colors would run by the time we work to an office party, if you get one or two uses out of it it paid for itself. Thin fabric but totally not see through"
5.0,I like the design of this purse.  It has a great deal of compartments.  I have purchased a similar style before.  Once I remember what goes in which compartment things are very easy to find.  Love it!  I wish it came in more colors.
5.0,I always am weary when buying products like this that are “mixed” Sets of things as usually I feel like it’s a lot of The same couple of things rather than an actual mixture of them. But these were so cute and there was a lot of variety. Perfect for epoxy
5.0,"I wore this for my gelfling costume. I'm 5'2"" and they were a good size for a party, I wasn't accidentally bumping in to anyone/anything. They're a little flimsy but is about on part with typical halloween/costume quality"
5.0,Everybody looooooved it! I wore it for my son's first communion. Looked super expensive.
5.0,"This set saved me! I had a wedding to attend. I viewed many evening bags, then ordered an expensive one. It arrived the size of a coin purse! My dress was an odd, but beautiful steel blue. Panicking, I spotted this, with the total set being less than the cost of my original evening bag alone. I really purchased for the clutch. I was worried about it being PU, but  surprisingly, it is a high quality, textured PU, that really looks as good as leather. The stiching and detail are good. The set is solid and durable. The clutch has a nice sturdy chain, with leather at the shoulder, and a wristlet strap to carry w/out chain (as I chose to for the evening). The credit card holder fit nicely inside, along w/cell, compact, lipstick, comb, and a couple other small items. The color was the same amazing color as the dress. The tote is smart and classy, with feet on bottom, and a nice dangle decoration. I opened to find a cute gift of a Bohemian bracelet! Nice touch! I was tempted to carry it, instead of clutch, but refrained.  After all the dressy clutches I viewed, I pulled it off with this, and received compliments on the total outfit. I can’t wait to carry tote!"
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my father, he was very happy with them."
5.0,keeps the toes warm in Maine weather!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry!  For Christmas I bought a ring with blue carbon fiber for my husband and tried to get a bracelet.  It was sold out so I shopped for Valentine's Day.  He is going to love it!
5.0,I love the way this bra fits. It is tight in the right places so I don’t have to worry about slipping out while exercising. I live that it doesn’t look like a traditional sports bra but holds everything in place like one! Super cute and stylish.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet and I enjoy wearing it. Would recommend to others.
5.0,Great item. Just as the seller posted.
5.0,Love this pair of glasses
5.0,Good price .

5.0,"These are the perfect size for my wife's daith piercings! They are small and dainty, which is exactly what she wanted! She has been wearing them since June and loves them! She is allergic to all metals except sterling silver and has not had any issues with these since day 1! I will be buying more of these as well as more products from this company!"
5.0,"I Love Every Watch I Get from this Seller; Prime Time NYC.<br />I have this style in gold and silver and waiting to buy it in rose gold.  I think I'll get the gunmetal black too😊.<br />  I get lots of compliments on these watches.  They're cute and inexpensive.  As a nurse I wash my hands frequently.  This style, the BANGLE, is fast & easy to take off so my watch doesn't get wet.  I pop it off and hang it on the neckline of my scrub top while I wash my hands.<br />I've noticed, after some wear (& a lot of hand washing) the finish on the inside is wearing off.  For this price though, that's understandable.  The outside still looks fantastic.  I'll probably end up giving it a few coats of clear acrylic to protect it further."
5.0,I bought this unwillingly knowing that it was a 3 pcs which was great once we received it and found out. My husband loved all 3 of them. It fit perfectly and came in a neat little bag.
5.0,Loved the earrings- Fast Delivery and the quality of the earrings are truly exquisite!!!
5.0,I’m very satisfied it compliments my cartilage piercing and my personal style very well.

5.0,"I loved it! It was just a little snug and squished my boobs a bit, but I didn’t mind too much. Overall, I loved it."
5.0,hand stitched looks anyway fits very well sigil is in great shape
5.0,A little small for a size 8 but otherwise they are perfect.

5.0,"Nice necklace, thick and strong"
5.0,I love this coat. Looks just like pic. It’s a nice warm wool unlike a lot of the thinner duster jackets this style. Happy with my purchase. Size small fit well and I’m typically a medium.

5.0,Compact and perfect to make larger wrists sized bangles

5.0,Easy to get in and comfortable
5.0,"I love this dress, I bought 2 sizes too big as this brand runs small"
5.0,Better than expected. Recommended purchase.
5.0,"I love these glasses! They are so comfortable and they stay on without sliding off like some glasses do. I think that is the comfortable spring hinges that hold the glasses gently, but snugly. I have a wide face, and these glasses are completely comfortable. I will be buying more of these for sure."
5.0,"I like them very much.  Small. lightweight, hard case...  These are the half focals and I can still see over them without taking them off..."
5.0,Great gift for those mourning the loss of this great lady.
5.0,Ware all the time
5.0,"This is hands down one of the best dresses I ever bought -- very superior quality, design and hugs my body to create a slimming effect while giving a longer height effect. The quality is so amazing I didn't expect this as it was my first buy from this brand.<br />Thanks! Would love to try more of your dresses"
5.0,"My daughter loves this mask (you can use this many different ways but this was the main reason she wanted it). She said her ears were starting to hurt with the traditional masks and wanted something like this because all the other kids have this kind. I believe this particular one is a medium and for size reference, my daughter is 8 years old. This is breathable and washes well. It fits her face and doesn’t slide off. The material feels silky and has some stretch to it. The pattern/print is pretty especially if your child loves unicorns such as mine does. Definitely would purchase this again because my son wants one now!"
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my sister after her service dog passed away. This is a gorgeous bracelet and I can’t believe how affordable to was! I would purchase again. Highly recommend! You cannot beat the price on this. I purchased this with my own money and received no discount for this review.
5.0,These are perfect for October outfits!<br />I wore one to Knott's Scary Farm this year and got so many compliments.
5.0,I have been looking for so long for a gold watch that was inexpensive without looking cheap and this one is perfect!  Simple but stylish and looks great for casual and formal events.
5.0,"I love this bag.  I bought it because I was flying back and forth to Florida every other weekend, often on Spirit.  This fits everything I needed, still fits under the seat, and seems very durable.  Love the zippered pockets on the outside...one fits my Kindle perfectly, and the other is handy for small stuff.  Inside the 2 small zippered pockets are perfect for my small electronics and cables.  Very surprised at the excellent quality for the price!  Fantastic bag."
5.0,Nice costume. Has held up well through trick or treating and general play.
5.0,Very beautiful...My wife loves it
5.0,"This watch exceeded my expectations. I was allergic to my old watch because of the metal that was on it. Since getting this one, I haven't had a single issue! It's beautiful, classy and works great! The only confusion was getting the watch strap adjusted but after looking at the other reviews, I was able to figure it out. Buy this watch!!"
5.0,"I needed a silver sandal that is comfortable and stylish - this is it. Heel is a little high, but the front's height keeps the back from being so tall. The elastic moves with your foot and allows it to breathe throughout the day. I wear them for an 8 hour day at work with no problems."
5.0,"Very comfortable dress, loose fitting, cool fabric, airy.."
5.0,"I was so in love with this dress. I’m 5,3, 196 lbs and I got a XL. The only problem is the underarm. After a period of time it became painful because of the sequin material."

5.0,I love the arm/shoulder openings! It definitely gives it more style!<br />Can be dressed up or down.<br />Nice fabric!
5.0,"Very comfortable, easy to wash true to size"
5.0,Bought this chair to use at my kids sporting events. Bleacher seats are too uncomfortable for an entire game. Folding is quick and easy and I life the padding...more comfortable than a beach chair. I'd also use it to take the beach. Fits nicely in my trunk too. Overall I am please with this chair.

5.0,I got a size up just to be safe and it fit great! The waist was a tad loose but still was flattering.
5.0,"Good quality of jewelry, but WAYYYY too big a piece to wear if you have a face dermal. The size of the gemstone is way too bit for me to have on my face and it doesn’t screw in all the way, so it was sticking out of my face."
5.0,Good product and prompt delivery
5.0,There were a perfect fit for my husband 👍🏾
5.0,I bought 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter and we both absolutely love these hats the sound is great they are so comfortable and the battery last for a long time. Great product I would recommend this to everyone

5.0,This is actually my second time ordering these. I lost one and I wear these fairly often! They are the perfect size and my sensitive ears do well with them so that tells me they are actually silver. I highly recommend!!
5.0,Buying clothes online is a bit risky，Because you don’t know if its size is right for you。Luckily I bought my size right。it gave me the impression that the colors are well matched。I want to give him five stars for the quality of the fabric selected for this product。He satisfies all my requirements for a casual jacket. That’s why I gave it five stars.

5.0,I bought this hairdress for my Mom  she was looking for something  like the original Dixie Peach .
5.0,Came really quick and was perfect. My daughter collects these and she loved it .
5.0,This dress was absolutely beautiful! My daughter wears a size 3T and I got the dress in a size 2. She had more than enough room in the dress. But she also has such a tiny frame. The flower on the dress comes as a sash to tie around the waist. You may want to steam the dress to get the tulle to lay down better. But all in all this was such a beautiful dress. It was perfect for their royal birthday party theme. Thank you so much for making such a great quality product.
5.0,"Comfortable, keep feet cool and dry. Well cushioned. Arch support is great.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,"I love it so much ,I love the color of it"

5.0,Pretty cool shirt love it!
5.0,Bought it for work to be different from co workers i love it
5.0,Carhartt says it all. Heavy construction with heavy zippers. I work with the railroad so I buy Carhartt so I don't have to replace them.
5.0,I love it soft and lightweight and not see thru
5.0,"I got the pink one for Halloween to go as princess peach. I wanted to get a dress that honestly I might wear again for non Halloween but also not super expensive. I think it’s a great cheap dress. 10000% would recommend if you are like me and just looking for a dress to add some accessories to it to make it a Halloween costume vs trying to spend a ton of money on a big box store costume. I didn’t have a problem with sheerness, but I did go with a size that would not be super tight since I could tell the chest area was already going to be more fitted. I am about 5’2 and 147- I ordered a large, chest is still fitted but more flattering. Comes down to about my knees."
5.0,Fits my daughter beautifully! This was a great buy!
5.0,"Perfect fit, doesnt lose the shape after couole times wash in machine.  Perfect lenth ."
5.0,Muy buena correa para apple watch. El mismo color de la foto

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:24434f0d51d89cffe2b9e909e2ba05a9]] I’ve read so many customer reviews on dozens of different masks that I could not keep the info straight, but of all the Masks that we’ve ordered so far, these are the best. Just received our third set. Video is a review on the first set.  These are a perfect shape and good coverage for my average size face. The nose wire seems of good quality & forms nicely to different size noses.  The material is not flimsy but not too heavy.  The construction quality is also good on the 17 masks that we ordered and received. Also received the bonus gift of the ear loop holders. All very good quality."
5.0,"The weight, size and pockets to place items."
5.0,Great shirt for the price and it fitted as expected!
5.0,These glasses “hit it out of the park”!!<br />I’m very pleased! Thanks!
5.0,Thin but not cheap-feeling or too thin. Color is good. No fading or pilling after a dozen washes.
5.0,"Perfect red color and very soft. It’s a great fit but not boxy, so if you’re looking for a better fitting crew neck, this is a good choice. This isn’t an oversized look, so choose one size bigger if you want it to fit loose."
5.0,"While I would rather be wearing 4 inch heels, the doctor said I need these because of non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  The shoes were shipped very quickly from Amazon's vendor, Elite Hero.  The size and width are true; they are as fashionable as these type shoes can be.  I am pleased and will purchase another pair in a different color in the future."

5.0,"I love all of pattyBoutik shirts especially this one. I love the off the shoulders look and arm design.  Sexy and creative yet still mature and professional. Also, once you find your size, I have noticed it is standard for each shirt I have purchased.  I have not had to order a different size because of the style. I am a small in all PattyBoutik shirts. They are fitted but not skin tight."
5.0,"love the feel, light but warm"

5.0,These Shoes are dope!
5.0,"I use these as liners under my hard-hat at work, for extra cushion and sweat.  They shrank from 27"" x 27"" to 24"" x 24"" after washing, which is still perfect for my oversized melon.  Dark colors are nice, quality seems good."

5.0,"I love SWS for myself and my little one, however the buckles are often cumbersome to deal with on toddlers. These are great quality with VELCRO closure! My 2 year old has tiny ankles and these can still be adjusted to fit hers to stay on well. I love the genuine leather and cute colors/styles. I wish they were offered at a bit more competitive of a price compared to the others, but I'm still VERY happy with these!"
5.0,"Being very pregnant you don't feel great and are uncomfortable every day. This dress is beautiful, comfortable, and helps give that glow everyone talks about for your baby shower day. I want to wear it every day now. Haha!<br />I was concerned it would be tight on my arms, but it is not!"

Excellent dress for the price!!

5.0,A little tight than expect given size range
5.0,"I wear between a size 4 and 6 in dresses (US size) and after reading the reviews and measuring myself I went for the XL. For some reason the measurements of the skirt size online led me to believe that it would fall off me but the shirt would fit and I thought that's more important as I could pin the skirt. However the product arrived today and it fit PERFECT. Mine also came with socks and an underwear lol. So happy with my purchase! Was worried about having to return it because it would be too big but it was perfect. Also I read some reviews saying the material feels stiff, but mine felt soft and flexible, so I'm pleasantly surprised! Amazing price too!"

5.0,My coworker showed this to me. It just reminded me of how annoying it is to look for stuff in my backpack when I consider myself an organized person. It also reminded me of how my wife can never find anything in her purse. This was the solution to my problem. It may seem like some silly infomercial-like product but it truly is practical. I honestly have no complaints about this.

5.0,"Very attractive--goes well with several of my green tops and dresses. The photo makes it look much we brighter (almost glowing) than it really is. I was a little concerned about that before purchasing, but I've been pleased with similar other necklaces. And for the price it was worth the gamble. In hand, it's bright but more subtle, and I love it."
5.0,I love the zipper!  So much easier for  this 72 year old lady to get on and off!<br />Will be getting more!
5.0,"The description of the product was a very accurate depiction! I am very happy with the quality of the glasses as they look even better in person, and plan to order other styles. I've lost many pairs of sunglasses to the water, so my favorite feature is the floating aspect! Highly recommend, excited to add other styles to my collection."

5.0,Perfect for sun glasses over glasses. It fit my Eagle Eyes!
5.0,"Material is nice, pure white. Only gripe, if you can call it a gripe, it was so much Material I couldn't manipulate it for different styles. You can always cut it though."
5.0,Great umbrella and a must have for a Porsche owner! A perfect fit for the glove compartment.
5.0,these socks are lasting awhile and they look nice

5.0,Wam and pretty
5.0,"(Sorry for the second picture, I wanted to blur my stuff so apologies if it looks weird! lol)<br />Best cosplay outfit I got so far. I was a bit unsure since reviews complained about it being a bit too small, so I took a large considering my measurements (I'm usually a M btw). And it was perfect! I didn't need to resize at all. The only issue I had was a missing button in the uniform, which was broken on the day of arrival. Luckily, the seller was really nice and even gave me extra buttons to fix it again! Loveee it."
5.0,Cute Mouseketeer ears!
5.0,Love this dress. Looks very pretty
5.0,"Exactly what you would expect from a wig, stands up well and arrived quickly. Worth the price and works great for my halloween costume."
5.0,We have been loyal Speedo goggle wearers for years because all others have leaked.  This year we decided to save money and try these.  They work great and my sons love them.  Glad we saved the money!
5.0,Very cute and comfy sweater. Have received a lot of compliments.
5.0,Jist what I was looking for!!
5.0,"It's a nice ring, but I find it to big for me as a stone on my hand ."
5.0,"The non-slip design is creative and unique.  I like that there are a variety of colors available as well as different sizes.  They were easy to put on(as yoga socks go) and were non-slip during my use time.  The packaging was attractive with easy to read information.  I have not yet tried the free download, but that is a nice plus.  I liked that the socks were sold as a pair.  At this time, I have not yet washed a pair, so I don't know if there will be shrinkage or color loss."
5.0,Amazingly comfortable without the teddy bear-like look some comfy Uggs can provide. Love them.
5.0,"The material is good quality, super stretchy and comfortable."
5.0,Nice and authentic...
5.0,Very nice quality.  A little smaller than pictured.  Which is what I prefer

5.0,[[VIDEOID:4c6cf495a3774bdc3cab7c6c8b346fe3]] She enjoys more of pedometer and photo snaps!
5.0,Love😍 fits perfect and looks amazing! Will be ordering more soon😊
5.0,I was delighted at the look and quality of this necklace. It looks nicer in person.
5.0,Well made shirt of good quality material. Plenty of length to suit my 6'2&#34; former marine husband.
5.0,Love the inner lining! These are the onlu hats my 6 months old daughter will leave on. I like that the elastic band helps hold the hat on their heads
5.0,Really comfortable! Stays in place when running.
5.0,This bathing suit is great quality for the price. I usually take a m in VS swimwear but after reading the reviews ordered a xxl it fit great. The chest doesn't have much support. Great buy for the price!
5.0,"I purchased this product through e-bags shortly after the purchase of my 14.1 widescreen laptop and almost 2 years later I'm still very pleased.  This bag has a lot of room for books, paperwork, accessories and your laptop.  There are plenty of compartments in which to store your extra knick-knacks although my only complaint (minor) is the water or drink holder is on the smallish side.  Furthermore, if you have a laptop wider than 15.4"" you'll probably have a difficult time fitting it into the included padded laptop sleeve.  This may be easily solved by getting a different one though.  It's a durable bag and the interior is bright yellow which makes it easier to find things.  I would highly recommend this product."
5.0,Sturdy. Holding up to daily use by kids.
5.0,I brought this dress to take on vacation and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it looked in person.  The pattern is great and it fit true to size for me.  And Kiddos to the company for adding a personal note and bonus necklace in the packaging.  It would be nice if IMBOAZ could make these maxi dresses in solid colors.
5.0,Very cute and a conversation piece.
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter & her mommy says they are nice.  She normally wears a 7 & that's what I ordered. They fit true to size.
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful and do not bother my sensitive ears. The size is perfect for me, not too small, but not too big or heavy. The price was fantastic!"
5.0,"My daughters love the masks. It is a little too big for my 5 yr old but if she shoves her ponytail into the back, it stays. They love the designs and are more willing to wear these than a regular face mask."
5.0,Awesome print throughout the shirt and the stripes in front are vivid.  Washes well and fits true to size.  My son loves it!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6f08e3625ad80b7015a50815e0c2c1b0]] I celebrated my 40th birthday. I dislike dresses, but wanted to look nice and this dress was perfect. I received all compliments. It fit perfectly. You have to pull on the sleeve first to make sure it's all the way on and then out the dress on. Try not to stretch it at neck area."
5.0,Nice pj’s.  Used them as a birthday gift.
5.0,Fantastic value for such pretty earrings. My 7 year old loses hers constantly and I give up spending hundreds of dollars on gold. These silver earrings don’t give any irritation and are so pretty! She gets constant compliments. Highly recommend!
5.0,"Very pretty and nice, I wear it during summer and when I go to the beach and pool"
5.0,This is my favorite item I've ordered off amazon yet! The material is durable and not cheap at all. It has a lot of compartments and meets my needs perfectly!
5.0,"I bought these for a 1920’s Gatsby Theme Gala on a transatlantic ocean liner cruise.  After looking at probably a thousand pairs of gloves, these were absolutely perfect.  I have large hands (U.S. size 9 ring) and these fit comfortably but we’re snug when I first put them on.  It’s like they stretched just right to fit me.  I would recommend this product to others."
5.0,Love them!! Super comfy and soft. Bought to wear for Bengals Superbowl! Who dey!!
5.0,I wear these for powerlifting and high intensity workouts with a lot of movement and they’re comfortable and the waistband stays in place!

5.0,Loved everything about it.  I will wear as lounge wear when traveling with mixed couples.  Fit is perfect highly recommend.  Fits true to size.
5.0,"I've received so many compliments after wearing this dress. Beautiful color and print! And it's very flattering. I usually wear a size Small and ordered the Medium, and it fit just right. It wasn't snug which is what I prefer. Only small complaint is that it wrinkles really fast but I think if you iron with starch then it would be fine. Highly recommend this dress!"
5.0,Great gloves! Exactly what I needed!
5.0,Great shoe. Daughter loves them.
5.0,Love them. Very warm.
5.0,Love the dress. So comfortable and looks nice at the same time. I get a lot of compliments and people ask where I got it... Amazon!
5.0,"This was exactly what I needed! I wanted something to cover my arms for a sleeveless dress for a wedding. It is soft, the sleeves were long, and it fit well. I ordered a small. I am about 5'1, 105 lbs, and small-framed. It fit perfectly. The sleeves are fitted, but not too tight, and the shoulders/length are great. The material is a little thin, so not something meant to keep you very warm, but that was not what I needed so I don't mind."
5.0,"Put Christmas presents in the bags, no wrapping...Then my kids and Mother has reusable grocery bags.no mess."
5.0,I bought this for my wife for her birthday and all I can say is WOW!  She looks great in this dress.  I hope she wears it more often.
5.0,Excelente purchase! Comes with tote bag for storage.
5.0,"Nice and delicate, it is stiff so I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like that or if you have a smaller neck."
5.0,Love the ability to clip to belt
5.0,"Really great shirt. Not cheaply made,clean and detailed images. Contacted seller and had a response within an hour. I am a very heavy set guy and the shirts fit quite well actually, they are not printed on cheap shirts. I couldnt be more happy. And they arrived within 3 days."
5.0,"I am thrilled with the quality of this costume! The outer garment is more a simple dress (with a side zipper!) than a costume. There are the usual little strings that need to be snipped, but overall, this entire costume is fantastic.  I actually bought shells to glue on top of the printed shells.<br />My only problem is that I bought both this and the warrior costume. I'll have to decide which one to return. I am so happy with this one I almost don't want to even try on the other one! I'll post a review of the warrior costume on that item's page.<br />I am 5'6, 135 lbs and am wearing a medium. The shorts are not tight around my thighs, but I may wear black leggings to stay warm-er at night anyway. The arm and leg accent pieces are great, but if you are muscular they may not fit.<br />Tip: Order soon for Halloween! This took 2 weeks to arrive standard mail, but it did arrive on the earliest date in the delivery window.<br />Hint: I bought the sword on Amazon too!"

5.0,"Lots of places to pack all the lights things, lotions, shampoo, makeup and more. Beautifully made too."
5.0,I ordered this and was struck how pretty it was for any age that I went back and ordered three more for small gifts.  You can bend it easily with a delicate touch that it will fit any head shape.  This just adds to the lure of it.
5.0,Years later these are still holding up on my PS4 and everyone always think I bought a limited edition one when they see it. Will be for my PS5
5.0,Very cute! Just wish I would have ordered a different color. The pink is PINK and makes me feel like a pink lady.

5.0,I purchased this for my supervisor who was retiring. She's a major germaphobe and this COVID joke was hilarious. She loved it
5.0,After I got my first pair of these I liked the quality so much I came back and bought another pair for my go back. These fit like motocross gloves but have high strength material in all the right places. I HIGHLY recommend these gloves for those who appreciate a good set of working/tactical/all purpose gloves.
5.0,Kids find them comfortable..I like the case so they will last and children know were to put away
5.0,Loving this bracelet!!!
5.0,These linen pants are snug but about right for the sizing. I like them a lot but won’t be drying them in the dryer

5.0,"Thick and warm, very comfortable."
5.0,I love this ring and I get tons of compliments on the color after having it for 5 years..  It starts out shiny like most other rings but after a couple of years it has turned to a dull matte grayish color which I actually like a lot and apparently so do others.
5.0,Very comfortable long sleeve shirt.  I normally wear a medium and ordered a large and the shirt fit snug but not too tight.  No issues with the shirt at this time.
5.0,"Look expensive, fit comfortably, classic look."
5.0,"Very nice shoes. Fit perfectly, run true to size."
5.0,Our little girl Loved this dress!! so adorable and excellent quality
5.0,Great earrings for the price point.  Look exactly as pictured.

5.0,These are the most comfortable masks that I've tried.  They stay in place and they don't fog up my glasses.  Plus there is a pocket for a filter.
5.0,"Daughter loves it, but they were the wrong size"
5.0,"An instant favorite! This is lovely pewter jewelry, not cheap in any way. I bought one for a friend as well."
5.0,Great T Shirt! Very comfortable and soft! Received a nice note from Scott with my package as well. Will keep in mind if I need to order again!
5.0,"This watch has so much that I like, i.e. alligator leather band, Roman numerals, white decorative face with gold trim.  And, second hand with date at a great price. It keeps good time, too."
5.0,Was more than I thought it would be wife very happy

5.0,Great price and great jewelry. Only took two days to get
5.0,"This is the second pair I've bought and I've stored them away because I'm still wearing the originals. They are good hiking shoes and are great for everyday wear. I wear them everyday to work.

5.0,This scarf is very soft and silky. The colors are vibrant. Great quality!
5.0,Awesome button-down!  It's lighter than you would expect actually!  It's perfect for the somewhat colder nights to keep you warmer without ever having to take it off because of you heating up.  It also looks SUPER nice!  Very comfortable!  Would highly recommend it!
5.0,"I enjoy this bag! It holds my MacBook Air nice and secure. I can also fit a notebook and pens inside. There are exterior pockets and an additional pocket I put my cell phone in. This bag is not super bulky, it's quite functional and very easy to carry. I will be buying these as gifts for family with MacBooks also"
5.0,These boots are too cute! They are a little loose on my calves but who cares?! They're adorable... I bought my usual size (6) and they fit just fine. Sad to see the price dropped a few days after my purchase but oh well! I'm buying more in a different color! 2 thumbs up!
5.0,Great buy for Four year old granddaughter. Only one pair had one earring that didn’t work.
5.0,"I love wearing oversized sweaters and I’m a sucker for pastels, so this is just perfect for me. Super soft, perfect for Fall. Although it won’t be warm enough for winter."

5.0,"Exactly as described, very nice piece."
5.0,BEAUTIFUL LOVE THEM!
5.0,"This fit me perfectly. Nice quality fabric, and a good price. Much prefer this to a standard cotton handkerchief. It is the right length to quickly tie around the head and not mess around spinning/folding something that wasn't intended to go around the head."
5.0,Super cute and flattering. I am on the thicker side so they are fitted but I love that about them. Makes my butt look so good. Very good quality as well.
5.0,Beautifully item!
5.0,Bought this for work but I’m pretty sure I’ll wear this even outside of work. I love it
5.0,My mother In Law Loved it. It dances gently and sparkles differently in varying lights.
5.0,"Love the price and look of this ring, hopefully it won't tarnish or turn colors soon but if it does that is okay for the price."
5.0,Like the vibrant colors and it gives me flexibility in wardrobe
5.0,Just as photo very pretty bracelets
5.0,"Bright print light weight I don’t know why I was thinking canvas was heavier, but this is definitely a very light bag. It’s pretty spacious for a typical beach bag. You could use it for lots of things. I got this as a gift for my sister. She has a two-year-old and I figured she could also use this as a diaper bag. The print is very bright and colorful."
5.0,"They are very suitable for my husband, but a bit big for myself and my children. Do you pull them to the back of your head/ears to make them stay."
5.0,The item was as advertised and is a very striking piece. Was given as a gift and was well received.
5.0,"I love this dress. It’s really comfy. It’s not quite as long as I expected. I’m 5’3” wear a 34 DD. it stops right at my ankles. It’s okay though! At least it’s not dragging. The material isn’t thin like I thought it would be. It’s perfect for casual work attire / casual<br />everyday wear. I order a size L. I typically ally wear a size 10 pants, so, it worked for me. However, I do have longer legs than most, so this may have something to do with the length being a little shorter but like I said, it’s great!"
5.0,Fit well remember to follow the directions to company give you for correct size
5.0,Very cute! My daughter loves them as they're easy for her to slip on & off. She has 2 pairs & gets a lot of compliments!
5.0,"These Instant Sunglasses  are an inexpensive and practical solution to quickly changing prescription glasses to prescription sunglasses. I have been using them for years. Easy to slip on and off. Only drawback is that they occasionally get lost, if you bend over and they fall off without your noticing. So order a larger number because the Shipping and Handling are not cheap."
5.0,The bust is a little snug but overall great dress for the price.
5.0,"These are the greatest thing I have found in a long time. When I read they were soft I didn't expect this.  These are soft, comfortable and fit me perfect. A nice change for leggings.  I am fussy about fabric and usually do not get anything but cotton. These are really nice and did I say feel amazing.  If you like LLR you know what I mean.  I bought the rose print. The print don't stretch all out in some places ansd look weird - you know like  on my big bum and legs.<br />I ordered two more. It is 92 degrees out and these are not hot at all.  Can't wait to wear with sweaters and boots in the winter, too.  Love.<br />I have washed them 2x and hung to dry with no problems . They stayed bright and look like new."
5.0,"I'm giving this 5-stars because it was very difficult for us to find a baby hat that had three features: (1) fit our son's large head, (2) covered his ears, and (3) had a strap to prevent easy removal.  We learned the hard way that finding a baby hat on the numerous beach stores didn't work out so well.  As our son is going to be a tall guy, we have to buy larger than the typical child his age so that meant buying several months out.  Thankfully, this hat is made of a slightly stretchy, breathable material so it gives a little leading to a more comfortable fit.  The strap underneath helps the wind from blowing it off as well as making it harder for our son to remove.  In general, he hates hats but he seems to let the hat be once we get outside and the fun begins."
5.0,Excellent mask for my son in the Missouri Attorney General's office.
5.0,The shoe is sturdy and comfortable but ends up looking a bit bulky
5.0,"Comfortable, elegant, simple but beautiful!!!"

5.0,I am currently 7 months pregnant and I weigh 200 pounds I bought XL and I was concerned about purchasing this product because of the reviews it hasbi began to think what if this fits me like a small shirt??  but I have to say XL was great for me long enough and with just enough space not too tight or too loose with a BIG OL BELLY so i would recommend 😇

5.0,Now she has a perfect shirt to watch Hallmark Christmas movies  🙄

5.0,Love this handbag!  The color of the blue one is wonderful.
5.0,I LOVE this shirt. So beautiful and comfy. I am marking as fit as expected however I knew from other reviews that this shirt ran small so I ordered an XL to begin with.

5.0,Looks & fits great!
5.0,Fits perfect.  Very comfortable.  Can wear all day. I've had knee replacement and deal with arthritic hips and this shoe gives me the comfort and support needed.

5.0,"Bought this size 8 dress for my granddaughter who is eight years and nine months old, and tall and slim for her age. Fits perfectly, is just the right length, and is positively augmented by the pleats that drape on one side. Very reasonably priced for a maxi length dress. Highly recommend."
5.0,"My brother doesn't appreciate wrist watches, so this seemed like a good solution."
5.0,It's very stretchy. It comes down to wear my waist pinches in so not very long how I expected. Lots of compliments. It's ever so slightly see through if you look closely and are wearing a very dark bra.
5.0,"Good quality, sized up one to a Large for length & can wear with leggings. Regular material T-shirt, not thin and design is exactly like picture. True to size."
5.0,"These (faux) wedding and engagement bands are just lovely. They're really sparkly without being gaudy. I get so many compliments on them even though the materials are totally fake compared to expensive rings! (Seriously...people see them on my finger and strike up conversation about them!)<br /><br />I bought these to wear after my fingers swelled up from pregnancy, and I'm definitely going to order this set again in subsequent smaller sizes as I get back to my normal size."
5.0,Loved the rings they are solid and feel like wearing the real ring.
5.0,My graduate friend loves it.
5.0,Nice product for the money!
5.0,Our son loved them
5.0,It does the job just great. It also looks smart. But I have to take it off at night because I find it hard to fall asleep with it on - I feel too energetic. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
5.0,"Purchased for a Disney and Universal Studios family trip.  Its waterproof, holds ALOT of items.  I had rain ponchos, water bottles, sunglasses, wallets in it and it held up.  The strap is comfortable on your shoulder which was important walking around the parks all day.  And we held our park passes in the little compartment on the shoulder strap for easy access.  Worked out great!"
5.0,I used this product to shield my feet from the harsh environment of my workboots.  They work well.
5.0,It's small and it brings its own bottle. So far I haven't had any issues with it. The design is very cute.
5.0,"Its not really gold, gild is brown"
5.0,I love this slim band. It’s looks great. It fits very comfortably. The design and quality of material are excellent. The band slides in place and snaps easily. Removing the band is easy also. Great price!
5.0,This is perfect for the ladies that don't like the necklace type eyeglass holder.  They are always too short and get tangled in my necklaces. This fits perfectly on my top or scarf.  Love the interchangeable pieces.  The magnet is super strong so no worries about it falling off your clothes.
5.0,It works in silver!
5.0,I love the material and thickness of these leggings. They are super soft too! I recommend them!

5.0,"LOVE this dress. I have received SO many compliments just the once I wore it, including the coveted &quot;I don't mean to be a creeper, but you look cute as a button&quot;. This dress is rarely going to be in my closet because it will so often be on me.<br /><br />Some stats for those wondering what size to order:<br /><br />I'm 32/27/36 and am wearing a size Small. I'm sure I could fit into a size XS, as there is a bit of wiggle room for me, but I think the Small is a Goldilocks (just right)"
5.0,So beautiful!! Great quality
5.0,These shirts are great. I had rotator cuff surgery and used 3 of these to get through the first few weeks till the incisions healed. The polyester/cotton blend is much more comfortable than the one pure cotton shirt I also ordered.
5.0,"Beautiful earrings. Exactly the size I wanted. Very well made and great, quick delivery."
5.0,It's a thick material that is not see-through I appreciate that thank you! :-)
5.0,Quality material and craftsmanship.  Clips work well.  I would buy again.
5.0,Very nice. It's for my 7 year old gymnast she will love it!
5.0,"They arrived on time and nicely packaged! I was unsure at first but tried em on a couple times and I am in love with my new Coach sunglasses. I actually get alot of compliments on them. Got a GREAT price for them and I would purchase from seller again. They fit perfect and do not slide off, came w/ coach case and cleaner."
5.0,Norcos are the most comfortable sandal i've ever worn.  I bought a pair for every family member after I tried mine on.  I literally yelled OMG when I tried them on.  Serious comfort.
5.0,I love these pink pants! 🎀 they are a silky material so they aren’t that flat polyester paper looking fabric. The belt I tied like a bow bc it’s pretty useless the other way. They are a little see through so watch those panty lines. Also I got these in the blue color and was not feeling them. It was dull and I was like I’d rather just wear jeans. Get a color that pops for these like the pink.
5.0,New favorite. My kids like the show and it has been a great reminder of that time.
5.0,Great to share with friends! Nice quality. They have held up well overtime.
5.0,The sunglass strings were cut when the package was opened
5.0,"5'7 and 190lbs, I'm not an easy fit and these shorts are comfortable and fit perfectly. If you have a similar build get these shorts in multiple colors, you'll thank me."
5.0,"These are really lovely, fun tiered tassel earrings for spicing up an outfit or date night. Love the look and the neutral colors make them a little more approachable than some of the bolder tassel looks."
5.0,Was really surprised how beautiful these are. You do get carbon on you so beware if you wear white. I love it !
5.0,A little bigger than expected but cool never the less
5.0,I get compliments every time I wear this ring.  Very pretty and durable.
5.0,Love that’s light and waterproof!  Can organize my bag with all the compartments and use it for everyday.
5.0,Nice water shoe for price
5.0,Good material. Worth the money. Style is really nice and it fits perfectly.
5.0,Very cute. Good material
5.0,"if you are a fan of T-Funk mics, this is a cool way to show it. Fit is a hair to the small side, I'm usually a large and had to get an XL. Love it."
5.0,"This is a lightweight, sturdy and very well made bag that has just the right size. It says mini but is actually bigger than many other purses I have. I like that it has a detachable shoulder strap. I don't use shoulder straps very often but I see the value in it so it's good to have options. The material feels wonderful and the scarlet red is a very stylish color that goes well with many outfits. Also, I don't have to worry about ruining the bag in the rain which is often an issue with delicate leather bags.<br />I am also happy to support a local business (made in the US).<br /><br />I just have a couple of issues with the bag:<br />I wish the handles were a little longer because right now it is not optimal to wear this bag over my shoulder without the shoulder strap.<br />Also, I find it misleading that some people think the material is recycled because obviously, the colors and patterns used by Harveys are not used in cars so there is no way this is recycled. As such, this bag can only be eco-friendly if you use it for years to come because the material won't degrade well on the landfill."
5.0,Love it! Just as pictured! Great quality!
5.0,"I love these pillow slides, so I purchased a 2nd pair in another color.  Tend to run a little small, so order a size or 2 larger.  Very comfortable!  I like that they conform to my feet.  Really good!"
5.0,"I had a friend tell me about these boots and I've bought them every year for the last 3 years. I love how lightweight, durable and warm they are. We farm and ranch so our toddler is out in the elements with us and these are absolutely perfect. They hold up well enough you can save them for hand me downs."
5.0,Love the strap. Comfortable and magnetic lock works great!<br />Update: this company is fantastic! The pin fell out and they are sending me a new watch band. Quickly!
5.0,"just what I wanted, made my granddaughter very happy!"
5.0,"The headline says it all.  ""Pleasingly graceful and stylish in appearance or manner."" (Oxford Dictionary)"
5.0,Love it!! its so comfy!! the short are kind of small but I domt mind it but if you do definitely size up. the shirt fit really well however :)
5.0,Beautiful! They look and feel great. The heel sits a little low for me so I put in a small heel insert and it's perfect. There is enough &#34;give&#34; when you walk to feel comfortable and still be supportive to your feet.
5.0,My children got baptized and this was a great dress for me to wear. Super cute pattern and I ordered early enough to order a Medium instead of Small for my 5'2 115lb body.
5.0,just what I exspected

5.0,Was the length advertised
5.0,Muy cómodos y durables me encantaron
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my 15 year old.  She loves the style and color.  The picture makes it appear like its a muted rose but in reality it's more pink so if you like that it will be perfect for you!
5.0,Love the dress! Heavier material than I expected which made me Very Happy. Looks great on and really compliments my small frame. Definitely recommend
5.0,"Fit well, nice quality. My daughter was very happy with it"

5.0,Beautiful sarong with vibrant color and soft material.
5.0,These leggings are great<br />They feel great also love the fit
5.0,Cute hand puppet for my grandson to enjoy
5.0,"Good quality hats! I love that they sent one of each color. As I have a boy and girl this set was perfect for them. They wore them in the pool, on the playground, everywhere! The straps keep the hats secured to their heads. I also liked that."
5.0,"It's real leather and  it has zippers and compartments. The brown is a super nice color too. I have already received compliments and disbelief from those who have asked me the price. I thought it would be a little larger as I had searched for totes, but that's my bad for not reading the dimensions. I love my new spring bag! 💼 ❤️"
5.0,really dressed up my vampire costume
5.0,Was perfect for my 10 year old son. Stylish and well-made.
5.0,Some of them had color/paint chipped or removed but overall not a bad deal for fun decorations.
5.0,Great watch all good
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Plan on purchasing more
5.0,My eight year old was a princess for Halloween and this dress was almost too pretty to use for dress up. She loves it!!
5.0,Cute! I usually wear a L and ordered a XL and it's perfect. Plenty long enough and I'm almost 5'9&#34;.
5.0,"Got them for my son, he wears them at home only, very flows material. Not suitable for formal or school wear."
5.0,"very nice belt, my granddaughter loved it. it sparkles and can dress up a dress but could be worn with jeans."
5.0,Nice firm fit without being too snug or too loose. Gladly recommend this product.
5.0,"Love these socks not just because they have my beloved Basset Assets on them, but also because they are of superb quality. I highly recommend them."
5.0,I was surprised by the quality and price. What a deal!
5.0,Wow! This dress was impressive and the flow and the way it just lays where it should....great dress. I purchased the royal blue too. Knock-out!
5.0,Fits my Child nice. Very comfortable. Easy and affordable.
5.0,"They do stretch, but during &#34;activities&#34; they start to roll off of the thigh and down to the leg. That is ok though."
5.0,"If I'm not comfortable, I can't sleep, but my husband complained about my ""ratty"" nightshirts. This popped up and I thought it looked like a good compromise - pretty, but also comfortable, and it is! The lace detail elevates it above an average nightshirt, and the fabric is buttery soft. Honestly, it could even be worn as a tunic top over leggings if you were inclined. And for about $13, you can buy one in each color."
5.0,I love it it's just to long on me cause I'm short
5.0,Great transaction
5.0,"It was the exact original, great. Thanks for the fast shipping."
5.0,Extremely prettty
5.0,"Quality fabric , love the vibrant color"
5.0,Wife likes it.  It is a little thinner than the others.
5.0,Lime
5.0,"I needed something affordable that i would only use at the gym go shower and these are great. Grips the feet, water dries so quickly. Love these !"
5.0,Love it. The skirt part is a bit thin but I absolutely love it
5.0,"One of the reasons I bought flats from this particular company, Native, is for their shoe recycling program. When your shoes are worn out you can send them back. They turn the shoes into playground flooring. The low maitnence shoe and style was also very appealing. I have very narrow feet, so they are slightly too wide for me, but I find most shoes to be like that. They are ever so slightly larger than true size (I bought in 7) but the size down would definitely be too small. The size being slightly big doesn’t bother me, since the backs come up to hug my heal. I am a teacher so I spend most of my day standing. In my other flats my feet begin to hurt half way through the day. With these shoes I don’t have this problem. The material (which is similar to Croc material) provides a nice cushion. So far I really like these shoes and can see myself purchasing more in the future!"
5.0,Love these earrings sooo much I quick ordered a 2nd pair!!!
5.0,"Ive been tanning for a a while and there's nothing worse than ""roasting your nuts!!"" I bought it a while ago to protect my ""man parts"" and works great and is still in great condition"
5.0,Perrrrrfect. Fast shipping.
5.0,"Okay, sistas! Listen up! Don't walk, Run to your nearest phone or tablet and order this dress, or the color of your choosing! I cannot say enough about this beautiful dress, I had to go up in size from a 14, I ordered a size 20 for my new COVID body, 247lbs 5ft 6"",  the fit is perfect! An 18 would have worked perfectly too but I didn't want it to be too clingy! Wow the fit is perfect! Not sheer at all! It is as soft as butter! The colors are bold and vibrant and even prettier In person, I feel sexy and comfortable in this well made casual dress. It skims the floor just like I like it! I didn't want to take it off! It would be great to wear at any function. I will be ordering more in my favorite colors! Sooo Amazing! Than you for a great product!"
5.0,A lot of sweatshirts now days are very long. We are senior citizens and I was searching for a sweatshirt for my husband that didn’t come to his knees. This was a great sweatshirt of great quality
5.0,"I loved this dress, but... it was about 3 inches too small according to the guide they give.  I wanted to trust that their guide was right, but I should've realized that this is a Chinese company, shipped DHL fro Suzhou, China and needed to be signed for!  I am a 12 according to their measurement guide, but should've sized up 2 sizes for it to fit comfortably.  Also, there are soft &#34;bones&#34; in the bodice as well as padding in the bust which is great if you don't want a bra, but the cups were about a size D and I am not.  With a padded bra on, the cups fit ok, but the zipper would not go up all the way in the back.  The sheer jacket that comes with it was way too tight over my whole sleeve, especially the upper arms.<br />If I had my it my way, the under satin lining would be about 2 inches longer, the bust not so large, the upper circumference about 2.5 to 3 inches bigger around to be able to zip and move comfortably in it, as well as the jacket with shorter sleeves (or an option to have half sleeves versus 3/4) AND larger circumference throughout the entire sleeve to give the ability to move better in it because the fabric does NOT give whatsoever.<br /><br />I really wanted this dress to fit!  But it has to go back...  On the upside, the &#34;white&#34; is a true white!  (I had issues with other dresses not being a true white when stated that they were)."
5.0,Received what I ordered and she loved it
5.0,Very good product.was shipped &received on time. I would recommend product and company.

5.0,Finally a link remover that works.
5.0,Love this dress I usually don't wear dresses bit this hugs in all the right places. I'm 5'3&#34; and 154lbs 36D and I got the large I probably could have gotten the medium but it's perfect.
5.0,Good for the last price
5.0,Good quality and held up well after multiple washes.
5.0,Daughter loves this skirt!
5.0,"This shirt is so flattering that I went ahead and bought the red one too. The brown is kind of a dark khaki (brown with gray heather?). It fits great, nice material, & true to size. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,"I've had a lot of hit or miss orders with clothes on Amazon. This one was definitely a hit. Fit perfectly, super comfy, and great quality. I will be ordering Allegra K again!"
5.0,"Gotta say, this belt exceeded my expectations.  The leather is soft and supple, the buckle is sturdy and elegant, and there is no chemically leather treatment smell.<br />It's easily as good as, if not better than belts I've bought that cost twice a much.<br />Sizing fit true to their guidelines."
5.0,It’s comfy but not super supportive sports bra.
5.0,This was so much fun for our trip to Disney. The kids got a lot of questions about it.

5.0,Hermosa tortuga.
5.0,it's very economic and so good.
5.0,These remind me of the earrings I got as a kid in the 90s.  They stick well and last all day.  Glad to find these for my 5 year old
5.0,"I am very pleased with my Humble Chic Vegan Leather Wristlet Wallet Clutch Bag - Small Phone Purse Handbag, Gunmetal, Metallic, Dark Silver. It’s sleek, stylish and it got to me fast. What would I do without my Humble Chic Vegan Leather Wristlet Wallet Clutch Bag - Small Phone Purse Handbag, Gunmetal, Metallic, Dark Silver?"
5.0,I drive a school van and keep one of these in the van and also keep one in my car for driving at sunrise and sunset.  Easy to put on and take off.  Very comfortable.  No more sun glare.
5.0,Love it. Fits right.  Well made. Nice fabroc. Long enough for me and I am tall.
5.0,"I was a little hesitant to order because this deal was too good to be true, but I was pleasantly surprised.  They are a nice size and very sparkly.  Just Beautiful!  I recommend this product."

5.0,Keeps pants up pretty well
5.0,"I bought these to go to my yoga class during the cold season. They are perfect for that; light and easy to slip on. A bit wider that I would like, but the band around can be adjusted so they stay on well."
5.0,Fits as expected and very cute true to size.
5.0,"I love these leggings!  They look amazing on. I have a few pairs now. They do tend to pill up after a few wears, but I can live with it for the price."
5.0,"Sunglasses were broken upon receiving, but quick return.  All good!"
5.0,This dress was everything my daughter dreamt it would be. She wanted to be a princess at prom and that she was. The dress is very full and long. My daughter is 5'11 and wore 3 inch heels and the dress still covered her feet. Which is what she wanted. She wears a 18-20 we ordered the dress in a 24 and it fit perfect. We did not have to do any alterations at all on the dress. Dress was delivered when promised after email was sent to change the delivery date.
5.0,"I loved this dress from the moment I took it out of the package. I was worried about sizing but the medium fit perfectly! I am 160lbs, 5’6’’, with a very curvy build and it comes to the tops of my feet but does not drag. It’s so elegant and flowy, I got so many compliments on it. The white background makes the red flowers pop. Pair it with a matte red lipstick and you have a fabulous outfit for a vineyard, outdoor wedding or day out!"
5.0,"Purchased two additional pairs of these pants.  First pair had 4% Spandex, next two pairs, only 3%. Still a good purchase"
5.0,"These fit amazingly well. My friend and I wore them, both very different size people, and these adjusted well. They lay very flat, so no one can see them beneath the clothes. the band is flexible, so you can pull it down when you need to get into it. I used this when my family and I went to Six Flags. It worked perfectly and I even forgot it was there until I made it home and took it off."
5.0,Loved the sweater. It fits well. Great to wear out casually. And nice for church as well. And it looks great on me as well.
5.0,I shopped at Pandora for the charms above and the prices are very high. I saved like $400 buying these online my wife love them all and also had extra to give to friends and family. I will only buy my charms to Amazon Prime from now on it's a great deal
5.0,"Great top! Pockets are a very nice touch. I have long arms so wish the sleeves were about 1/2-3/4&#34; longer. Other than that, the top is perfect! Have washed and worn this top several times now, and the quality, shape and color have barely changed."
5.0,Just beautiful on my little girl!!
5.0,"I've been using this kit for over a month now, (currently up to 6g)  I neglected to notice when I bought this stretching set that it started at a higher gauge...so I had to purchase additional jewelry to stretch my lobes each size up to the 8g to start using this set.  I'm happy with my purchase!  A few of the tunnels are tarnished which upsets me, but I will use the ones I can and substitute other plugs or tunnels for the sizes that I cannot use due to tarnishing of the metal.  I would recommend this stretching set to anyone who is wanting to keep growing!  The tunnels AND tapers are each individually placed in mini zip-lock-jewelry bags and labeled with their MM size, a huge help when keeping them clean and organized."
5.0,"Love these! They fit my long, skinny size 8.5 woman feet well. They stay up, but I bought them to scrunch down with high tops and boots, as pictured.  The toe seam is nice, which is often a problem area for me. These fit perfectly with my Chucks I'm breaking in and didn't leave any marks on my feet. I'd definitely order these in other patterns if offered!"
5.0,"Love this beautiful top! It looks and fits as expected.  I'm 5'2, 125 lbs, 34 D.  I got this in small.  If you are small chested it might be too big in the chest area.  And if you have a long torso it might be a little short.  It has a little stretch to it but not much, and the straps are not adjustable.  The shipping was very fast.  It came almost a month early!! :D"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:5af8802fc2c838c83ebde24ea74eb403]] Absolutely love this sweater and will be buying again in different colors! I wanted a good fall sweater and this was perfect! It’s loose fitting, but has the cuff on the wrist to be able to push up and stay in place, the material is soft and is a beautiful fall color I was looking for!"
5.0,"This dress is really soft, thick and fit like a glove."
5.0,"I like it a lot, very good quality and fast shipping."
5.0,"I got this as a christmas gift for my youngest daughter since she really liked watching Soul Eater and Death the Kid was one of her favorite characters from the series. So, when she opened up the package, I swear she was about to start to cry because of getting it. It turned out a little SMALLER than listed, but she loves it none the less."
5.0,Plug and play no reprogramming 10 Minutes and the back up camera is working
5.0,"The bow is huge, but it is really pretty and the white spots have glitter. Nice for Disneyland."
5.0,Like these socks a lot. The longer length is nice and the socks have nice stretch without looking sloppy. Will buy again!
5.0,So cute and very flattering.

5.0,Kid is happy. Roomy warm and comfy. Only issue is no curly tail. We will insert small wire to make tail curly.
5.0,"It is a little hard to try and open and close the piece but if you have the right tools it's a non issue. As always with these type of hoops you should take it out regularly and clean it well, pay attention to the hindge area.<br /><br />Over all, it's worth the price for sure, I got the black one and the silver one."
5.0,"Bought this dress is &#34;Red&#34; and it is exactly as pictured, a nice burgundy/wine color."
5.0,Bought this as a gift for a special little girl! It was the hit of the party! Perfect size for a few special treasures and looks just like the kitten that she gave us
5.0,Loved this dress! Perfect fit and very cute basic dress. My daughter said it was very comfortable.
5.0,I like these shoe trees.  I am using shoe trees for the first time.  They do keep my work shoes and cowboy boots from bending and wrinkling on the front.
5.0,true to size love the colors
5.0,The colors are beautiful!!! Perfect!
5.0,This bathing suit is really cute it makes me look and feel younger while still covering what I want it to. I’m going to buy a couple more in different colors!
5.0,"The top could have been a tad bit longer, but it was a hit!  The wig makes the whole outfit though."
5.0,I love this grooming jacket. It repels water and dog hair. I am a size 3x and everyone said to order big I got a 6x and it's perfectly  roomy.  The quality is great. I feel like this will last me a long time. I've already been using it for a couple of months 5 days a week.
5.0,"Beautiful and easy to put on, wear it with a skirt for dance performance or add a cami fun event."
5.0,I was sick and tired of the cloth gloves that rip and soak water into my hands.  These gloves keep the water out and my hands clean.  They are also very comfortable.  I would recommend these gloves to either men or women.
5.0,"I love these, they are comfy, stylist, better looking than your normal flip flops"
5.0,"I've used this for my phone/cards every day since 2017. Absolutely the best.<br />I didn't expect it to last long. Nothing fancy, but handy for running around shopping, etc.<br />I am buying two more today, 2021.<br />The metal clasp on the strap finally broke, but I had a lot attached to it.<br />Awesome product..."
5.0,So many cute ones all in one bag 🥰
5.0,HOTAPEI Women Stretchy Scoop Neck Cold Shoulder T-Shirt Blouse Top<br /><br />I purchased this V neck shoulder T-shirt top because I like that it shows off the shoulder. I ordered a size large not really sure if it would fit me or not. But I was very delighted when I tried it on to see that it fits perfectly. I love the feel of the fabric which is polyester and spandex so just very stretchy. I love the V-neck in the quarter sleeves. The elastic cuffs give it a unique look. It does not fit loose on me like it says in the description however I like the way that it does look on me. It is very flattering. If I to work I would have to wear a Cami underneath it because it shows a lot of skin. It is also something that I could wear and a very casual setting. But it is also the kind of top that with the right jewelry would be perfect for a date night.<br />i  did receive this top at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"Love it. Perfect. I have some designer bags. And I have to say this bag have the same look, quality and style."
5.0,Soft and comfy. Not see thru at all.
5.0,"I love this vest, period.  I have two; when I lost a weight I bought it again in a smaller size.  It has a fantastic set of many pockets and holds enough for my runs and even most day hikes (depending on how much water I will need).  I started using it for hiking because it's so comfortable and the pockets are so convenient.  I love having my phone handy to take pictures.  The vest holds a 2L water bladder plus room for a flask up front and more in the storage compartment if needed.  It holds a lot securely (i.e., rain gear or extra layer, headlamp, poles, food, wallet, lip balm, whistle, bandana, hat, gloves, sunblock, mask, knife, phone, batteries, phone, car key, electrolytes) plus has shock cord on the outside to hold another layer and to stabilize the load (works with a lot or virtually empty) .  It is extremely comfortable, and does not bounce.  The straps are of sturdy material and don't stretch much adding to stability without compromising breathing or movement.  And for women like me with larger chests, this actually fits well!  You can adjust the height of the straps to work with your body.  I tried on and in some cases ran with probably 10-15 other vests and this one was the best fit by far, held more than many, and had better pocket options.<br /><br />It's expensive but worth every penny.  I've used mine regularly for a few years now and it has held up really well.  It has been hundreds of miles.  I am impressed and have recommended this to friends and family, so have no problem recommending it to you!  Based on what I've seen of the 5.0, I like the 4.0 better!<br /><br />(The only changes I'd recommend to Ultimate Direction are further upgrades.  It would be great to have a native magnet on/near the lower left front pocket for the bladder tube and make the gear loops out of shock cord w a toggle to make them more stable for carrying trekking poles there instead of up front.  I wouldn't mind a pass through kangaroo pocket at the rear bottom either.  My regular headlamp fits in the side pocket making it easy to grab during sunset runs but my Icon does not.  I'd love to be able to just grab it without having to unclip.  Having said that, I keep it in the outermost rear pocket so it's still more accessible than in many other vests.)<br /><br />This review won't show as a verified purchase because I bought my two vests from other stores but I promise I speak from experience!"
5.0,"I honestly didn't expect it to be as pretty as it is, so I am *very* impressed! Fits very comfortably -- not too tight, not too big -- and looks great with more than just my vintage-inspired dresses. Thanks!"
5.0,Perfect length !
5.0,So many compliments! Love it!
5.0,Fits my daughter perfectly and she’s only 16 months 😊 hopefully it will keep her warm on our trip
5.0,I bout this little suit for my 6 month old and it fit him just perfect. He is 23 lbs and the 9-12 months was the perfect fit for him.
5.0,so dainty and cute.
5.0,My kid loved it . Was used for a hollween costume.
5.0,"Great compression - not too difficult to put on and take off, especially if you follow the way the little video shows you. They are very warm so may have to find something more light weight for the summer months. Love Copper Fit products."
5.0,Fits great!! Very comfy but will gain stretch as worn through out the day
5.0,I’m always hesitant buying clothes online but I’m happy to say this jacket fits perfectly. It’s exactly what I was hoping for.
5.0,"It’s so cute, looking at it you would never guess it has bat wings! They fold in and out with the umbrella so you don’t have to worry about the wings being broken off or being damaged"
5.0,"My finger got a little fatter after 24 years of marriage so I needed to get a larger band. Gold is so expensive so I've been looking at tungsten, cobalt, and stainless steel. I figured I'd buy some inexpensive rings until I found something that suited me and this was my first try. I like it but it was a little too big for my left hand. It fits my right hand perfectly so I've been wearing it until my smaller one gets here. It's a bit heavier and chunkier than my old gold band but I'm getting used to it and it's comfortable on my skin. If you're looking for a less expensive alternative to gold, I'd recommend trying this ring."
5.0,only downside is that the butterflies are slightly flimsy and can be bent pretty easily
5.0,Bought this for a friend for her birthday and she loved it. Very cute for a Sailor Moon lover. Came really quick too!
5.0,Very nice and well made bracelet.  Adjustable size and the convenience of wearing several bracelets in one.  I Love it!
5.0,My husband has worn this for three years. He never takes it off he swims and showers with it on. It has not tarnished or rusted at all. I am amazed at the quality for the price.
5.0,"Colors, patterns as advertised. VERY comfortable. Nice adjustable ear straps, and the metal pie ce for the nose really helps keep the mask in place and is surprisingly comfortable."
5.0,absolutely in love with this dress will post a photo shortly.

5.0,I just wish it came in a nicer display box rather than on the card! Other than that loved the necklace and it made a great gift
5.0,I used it both as a top and as a jacket. Love it.
5.0,"Bought this (Papa Bear and Baby Bear shirt) with another matching (Mama Bear and Baby Bear shirt).  I wish there was an option for just the 3 (Mama Bear, Papa Bear and Baby Bear) so I didn't have to buy 4 shirts.  Cloth quality is great.  It did not shrink when washed and dried.  It is not see through."
5.0,the seam around toes feel lumpy

5.0,"Super cute, and SUPER SOFT!!!  Will be ordering other designs!!"
5.0,"The white leather band for my Garmin Vivomove HR was the second band I purchased from Wristology. The first was the Gold (a little bling bling) worked perfectly. On the  White leather unfortunately one side just wouldn't stay in. I asked for an exchange and before I even got the original mailed back a new one was in the mail! I am very pleased with the bands and more so with the company response. We all like to grip and complain when things are wrong, but sometimes we forget to let people know when people/companies stand behind their product. Kudos to Wristology! You have AAA+ rating from me."
5.0,"Runs small so I ordered 2 sizes up, fits perfect. Customer service was very responsive and helpful in exchanges. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I wear royal blue scrubs at work and this hat is a perfect compliment. It fits great, is very comfortable, and is well-made. I’m really happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Beautiful skirt for the money.  Bought all 4 gorgeous colors as they are soft, chic, neutral and rich-looking. Age 69, 5’7”, 160 lbs - Large comfy in waist and not too poofy.  Nice length.  Well-made.  Wearing to wedding, but will also wear casually with ballet flats and sneakers.  Nicest of all the brands I tried on Amazon."
5.0,"I no longer tattoo but I use this for anything I can around the house lately it’s for my stickers, however it was great for my needles, pens/markers just the little things but it honestly can be great for anything!"
5.0,"i love the bracelet, not too tight, just right"
5.0,Beautiful! Great size! Mama loved it
5.0,"This product is awsome, my mother really liked it. Just remember to by a chain cause this doesn't come with one. This made a great mothers day gift."
5.0,Great Shirt for Star Wars lovers! Love Chewbacca. Got it for my Nephew and he loves it!
5.0,"Small but cute<br />More of kind of an overnight bag than a gym bag, it's small"
5.0,Very comfortable and warm.  Pleased with them!
5.0,Adorable. Great cor
5.0,"Love this fits really well, it's very soft and very supportive and it works fantastic with my halter tops that I also bought from Amazon!"
5.0,"I'm a paraplegic who decided to sit in the snow and make a snowman today.<br />NOT A DROP of water soaked through these pants. I have no idea how warm they are, and idk if they're advertised as waterproof, but I'll take these over snow pants any day.<br /><br />Fit was a tad short, but waste band was as expected. 5 foot 5, I bought a small."
5.0,Great product 👍🏻
5.0,Even prettier than they look in the picture.
5.0,great support and easy to wear

5.0,"The boot is adorable, my 2 yr old granddaughter loves them. Has a nice lining,and seems to be thick in the sole."
5.0,Super comfy and warm.. not too warm which is just what i like
5.0,Bought the jersey to show off my favorite team.  And one player I like on the team.  Wearing a Saints jersey shows that’s your team. Feels comfortable wearing the jersey.
5.0,"Very well made and works as well as the video. Great size, lightweight, but clearly built to last."
5.0,I can’t say enough positive things about this beautiful skirt! It fits perfect and I feel so feminine wearing it. Flowy and flattering.
5.0,This is a pretty good tshirt to have. The material is really good and flexible and you don’t need to wash it too often. This will look more good if you have some muscles on chest and have some biceps and triceps. If you already have some then it’s a really good tshirt to have.
5.0,"Very bright , will get noticed"
5.0,"Nice, thick, plush, kitty tail.... not lime you'd typically get in the stores. Loved it."
5.0,nice little bracelet
5.0,I love this mask so much - this is my second one. The material is so comfortable and the shape fits my face better than most. There's no bridge wire but the shape is such that you don't really need it.
5.0,Was a gift and she loves it. It is everything as advertised.
5.0,My hat came back perfect!
5.0,Wearing this to a wedding and it's super comfortable.
5.0,Love the miraclesuit regatta: makes my torso look longer and leaner and the high neck makes me super comfortable swimming.
5.0,"These are very sturdy, although I wish they were just a tiny bit larger.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be given the awesome opportunity to purchase this item with a discount on this product in order to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, in my own words with only how I feel about it, not an inflated review. As such, I do tend to write reviews as honestly as I can, but I also know that because I was able to receive the product at a discount that may bias my opinion of the product, so I try to imagine that I had had to pay full price for the product, rather than a smaller amount, so basically imagine that I did not get a discount, and base my review off of that. I am hopeful that that helps with the bias and makes my review a more accurate tool for judging the worth of the product, rather than just something that people gloss over and ignore because of the &#34;I got a discount&#34; disclaimer at the bottom of the review. As a final addition to this disclaimer, I try to base the length of the review solely off what I feel needs to be said about the product, so some reviews will be quite lengthy and wordy (kind of like this disclaimer), while others will be short, sweet, and to the point (like when the product just straight up works or is just awful - there's only so many ways to say that)."
5.0,Have many uses  for the key chain . vendor did excellent job.
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress. I am attending an African wedding, and it's perfect. It fits well, and looks very nice on me."
5.0,Love love love! Fast shipping as well!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:d11f7483f194a2b5323eac750bf4a3a1]] Comfortable band that’s easy to put on. Good for getting wet and working out in.
5.0,Had these awhile and they're great!!!
5.0,Came quick look good ;)
5.0,"Surprising amount of storage in such a small wallet. I was looking for a bill-fold wallet as they are so easy to transfer between bags. This is super cute, stylish and fits everything by my passport!"
5.0,Love this watch and looks way more expensive then it is. I always had issues before getting a watch that fit me perfect and this is the one that fits the best.
5.0,"It is everything you would expect a hoodie to be. It is perfectly fine. I always get compliments when I wear this, even though it's just a hoodie."
5.0,"I feel like a vogue 50's starlet riding around in my convertible top hehe. Super-cute scarf hat that keeps me cool and protected from the sun. Hat is a wide brim straw visor with an elastic band and dainty airy scarf attached to it. Protects forehead and sides of face while driving. Also, doesn't mess up my hair at all!!! YAY!!! Actually, the soft scarf keeps my hairstyle smooth and in place, so I don't have dreadful hat hair afterwards. Wish there were other colors because I'd definitely own them all."
5.0,"this product is perfect for everything it's awesome for a teacher, or a retail worker. Great  for church concerts performances  anything! great product this seller rocks for nailing plus size!!"
5.0,"love the bracelet!  Had to take it to the jeweler to get sized, mainly because the self sizing tool did not contain the small &#34;needle&#34; attachment that is needed to push the pins out.  However, the jeweler indicated that it was somewhat difficult for him to get the pins out and he thought that even if the small needle had been included in the package that he didn't think it would have worked in getting the pins out.<br />Again, love the bracelet(s) and a lady friend of mine is ordering a female type bracelet for herself."
5.0,Love it  ! Just wish its cheaper than it was
5.0,"Super cute top, nice flowy fit. A little tight on the arms but other than that true to size."
5.0,"This is good quality, just as advertised!"
5.0,I loved the look of this shirt. It was just what I was looking for. I need some more color choices in my closet.

5.0,Great Product that I will use every day.
5.0,Too beautiful for words!!! Very happy!
5.0,Great just wish they were a little longer!
5.0,Nice replacement for original plastic wrist bands. This band doesn’t make my wrist break out.
5.0,"I bought this dress twice. On the reviews rec' s I ordered a size up the first time and it was too large. I gave it to a friend who wears it unbuttoned with a tee underneath and it suits her retro, playful look. I reordered the dress in the correct size for my figure because I couldn't bear to part with it. It fits great. The fabric has a weight and thickness that lends it excellent drape. Moreover, it resembles a fifties day dress someone might have actually worn in the days when we wore dresses and gloves to go shopping. There is no suggestion of costume about it. I feel the dress is a fine expression of myself at work where I want to be fresh, pretty, professional and let my guests feel I care about my appearance as a mark of respect to them. Couldn't be more pleased. Fine value."
5.0,came in time and made my dinner party more exciting i would purchase this item again
5.0,Pretty. Manufacturing description was accurate
5.0,Worked great on my trip from the glare of the lights at night.
5.0,"Tightly knitted, and the extra fleece ear warmer is legit! Love it"
5.0,This is a really nice bathing suit. Well crafted and the fit is perfect.
5.0,"Perfect, just what I needed!  These keep me feeling confident in a skirt, that I can be active, walk in the wind, just no worries.  Good fabric."
5.0,"Everything is right with this top.  Quality feeling fabric, medium weight, I could wear it with just a bralette in the summer or over a tank top in Spring or Autumn with or without the buttons done up.  The color is as named, very much a Lilac shade.<br />I ordered a Large and that turned out to be perfect for the fit I wanted - not snug at all, just comfortable close-fitting.<br />I'm about 5'3"", 143lbs, 39"" around the fullest part of my bust, dress size 8, a Small to Medium in unisex shirts, a Medium to Large in women's shirts."
5.0,Love the color and fit of the dress. My least favorite thing about the dress is that it didn't have a zipper. I'm not a fan of putting a dress on over my head.
5.0,"I’m surprised how much I like this, actually. I think I’m going to order another color combination."
5.0,Got this as a BDay present for my mom and she loves it!

5.0,This dress it beautiful. Great price! Thank you
5.0,Awesome jewelry
5.0,if your a fan get one
5.0,"Love the feel of the &#34;rough&#34; leather, has many inside pockets and one outside just right for a cell phone.  Has a nice long tether for keys but the clasp is a little small so had to work around that.  It has a good zipper to close the whole purse when needed."
5.0,"I love these glasses! I ordered them in brown 2 years ago and just recently bought them I tortoise. I am petite and have a small head and face so a lot of sunglasses overwhelm my face. These glasses have a very tight fit, so unless you have a narrow face/small head, they will be too tight, They fit me perfectly and are very glamorous. Love them!"
5.0,"Love these little things I reordered it second time so I thought let get 3 more since I will be using it but wouldn’t let me get 3 more only 1 , so I cked later again price became higher from 5.or 6 dollars to $9 or so ."
5.0,"So beautiful,indifferent and ih so sexy"
5.0,"So far, i like the bracelet. I bought for its health benefits. Im thinking about getting one for my daughter since she gets frequent headaches. It's a little too early to tell whether or not it works since I've only worn it once--didnt get any headaches that day. The bracelet is good quality, magnetic, i really like it."
5.0,Cute dress that was purchased for my daughter to wear early in pregnancy. Dress fit as expected
5.0,Keep my hands warm in 40 degee weather on my motorcycle
5.0,I love these night gowns. They are very comfortable!
5.0,Bought these to replace broken clips on my horses TOUGH1 Turnout Blanket. They are slightly larger than the original clasps on the blanket but these are SO MUCH sturdier but just as easy to open. Glad they came in a big pack because i plan to use them if the clips on my Schneider blanket breaks too.
5.0,So adorable and flattering on any size!
5.0,I am 5’4. 137 lbs. ordered a medium. Beautiful. Worth every penny. Good material. Fast shipping. Got so many compliments. Not a bathing suit you will run into someone having it. Love it!!! Will buy a differe color this summer.
5.0,My doughter love it
5.0,"Muy bonito, gracias. Excelente servicio en tiempo y forma."
5.0,Awesome I am a Pretty Big Guy with a face to fit. These mask fit awesome and show an Great companion I admire.
5.0,I will definitely order more bands in other colors.  This band is so soft and comfortable.  I struggled a little bit “installing” but that was probably my own fault.
5.0,"The fabric is soft, they are large sizes, I loved it!"
5.0,"My daughter loves this nightgown. Good length, soft material."
5.0,Perfect to wear over glasses
5.0,Well made. Looks like real gold. Black faceted end caps are a nice touch.
5.0,This is very comfortable and very pretty. I will but this brand again. I am very pleased.
5.0,"This product has worked well for my needs. I ordered the Y style, and was pleased with how easy it was to set up and adjust for the first time. I recommend adjusting the fit as much as possible before putting pants on, since you'll have to mostly remove them in order to make any changes. I was able to use these easily with a pair of my more tightly fitting jeans with no issues. Set up was a matter of minutes for the first time before running out the door on a tight schedule."
5.0,Just like the original band
5.0,"I bought his for my mom, who rarely likes anything I gift her.  She immediately asked me to put it on her wrist and she loves it."
5.0,Super cute on. Love them.
5.0,I love these shorts and the big pockets for a cell phone.
5.0,Fits really great im 5'7 and wide hips but if your gifted at the top you may hear thread popping lol but it fits great.
5.0,Beautiful color and fit as expected! I ordered a small as I am 135 5'5 and wear a size 4 or 26 in jeans. Keep in mind I have basically no butt. They aren't too tight around your calves which mine are relatively large. I have washed them a few times and color does NOT fad and they don't shrink hardly at all!! Also I've ordered this in XS and they fit but are just uncomfortably tight for me at least if you like them extra tight XS might be more your style. I've bought two other pairs!
5.0,"These are capri's...I must not have read the fine print, LOL.  They fit nicely and and perfectly cool for St. Patty's Day."
5.0,Added to birthday gift bags. Kids loved them.
5.0,gorgeous and delicate what i expected.
5.0,I have tried so many evil eye bracelets and I send back.  I recvd this one today and it so just perfect!  Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous!!  I can’t find the words to say just how perfect it is.  You will not be sad u bought this. U have to see it in person!  This is a wear every day bracelet.  Even comes to you presented in a very professional bag and case.  I just love this!!!!!
5.0,This is a great product. Instant relief from plantar fasciitis. I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"I first saw this dress on Pinterest and it caught my eye. I ordered it two days ago and it arrived so quickly. I'm glad because I need this dress in my life. It looks beautiful and such nice quality. It has some stretch to it. Simple, yet elegant. Colors are so pretty. Now, the best part - the person who sold it to me included a note! Telling about themself and how important my satisfaction is to them. WOW! Bollme you have won me over. Thank you.<br />P.S. I haven't tried the dress on yet, but it will fit. Based on reviews I ordered up. It is a little see through and will need a little slip."
5.0,I was concerned that these masks would be very warm to wear but they breath very well. That being said I don't think that they would protect from viruses. But they are accepted as a mask when trying to enter a store. The colors are vibrant and they hold up well in the washer. I did not put them in the dryer so I don't know if they would shrink. Overall a good value for the cost. I would recommend and also purchase again.
5.0,"Good belt I bought it and have been wearing this for 10 years, now it’s starting to show wear on it, so again I am ordering a new one today !"
5.0,I broke my watch and straps loops and it was very uncomfortable to wear.  Found this and IT WORKS GREAT!
5.0,Got for my 7-year old. She loves then. Fits well.
5.0,"Great so far.  I've worn my Fitbit into the shower by accident and this band soaks up water and stays wet for a bit.  But otherwise, I like it.  The velcro has not come loose, which was my main concern."
5.0,"Love, love love this dress. Comfort is important for me and this dress fits the bill!"
5.0,My favorite tank! Will definitely order more. Pay attention to size though and order 2 sizes up!
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas,  was hesitant because of how cheap it was,  but extremely surprised when I received it..... Absolutely beautiful...... she's going to love it."
5.0,"So glad I decided to purchase this set! This product is amazing quality!! The fabric is compressive and holds you in, but super stretchy and soft allowing you to move comfortably. It fits like a high end, name brand designer set! I ordered a medium and usually wear medium sports bra and small pants. But both fit flawlessly. If you are between sizes, I’d suggest the bigger size, but no need to size up. Vibrant black. Can wear as casual wear too!"
5.0,"Bought these for me and my daughters. They are an 18g, most ears are pierced with a 22g. But they went into my girls ears easily. I love the screw on backs. I always buy them earring with screw backs because they tend to play with them sometimes and pull out regular earrings. They are simple and sweet. Love the variety of colors."
5.0,comfortable and great quality. you will definitely get waves with brushing and using these du rags. Very breathable and compressed.
5.0,I actually got these for my dogs for 4th of July and they are absolutely perfect! Highly recommend for showing off your patriotic spirit!
5.0,a gift my wife love!
5.0,"Husband very picky he just loves these gloves,texting feature works great."
5.0,"While price may seem high, it's well worth it. Best short sock I've owned and lasts a long time under multiple washings.  I'm a repeat purchaser of this product."

5.0,Bought them for myself as I’m a Mom who fits in kids shoes and they are comfy and love the colors!!
5.0,Great big beautiful sunglasses!!!! Love them!!!! Made well.
5.0,"I purchased the frames on Amazon through designer optics. Good reliable seller, fast shipping. The framers are stunning & classy. Well made for sure. Worth the money, plus this is way cheaper than they were 6mo ago at lens crafters. I got the lenses put in by my eye doctor."
5.0,Nice stufff
5.0,Great shades for the price it offers. Thank you!!
5.0,"I get compliments EVERYWHERE I go! I love them! They come with a hard case, soft velvet baggie, and a cleaning cloth. I am terrible at keeping glasses in one piece and these have held up great! Excellent buy."

5.0,"Nice fabric, bright color, beautiful for summer."
5.0,This half apron makes cleaning much easier. I love the convenience to have my cleaning supplies close by.
5.0,"Beautiful dress.  I'm wearing it for my daughter's wedding.  I love the way it looks and feels very comfortable.  I was afraid the arm holes might be so low as to show my bra, but they are not.  It covers nicely and fits well.  And it looks nice with a light cardigan over, should it cool off in the evening. I'm very happy with it.  :)"
5.0,was so happy I was able to find this particular cross.  I have been looking for one for awhile. Just needed one more.
5.0,"This jacket is super comfort and perfect to wear for working out or jogging. I also like how this jacket has zippered pockets, which is kind of hard to find in most jogging jackets today. I bought the small and fits perfectly."
5.0,great price  great delivery time
5.0,Not too many “mamaw” gifts out there. This one was perfect for my toddler son to give to his mamaw for her birthday. She loves it!
5.0,Great under shirt for dress shirts.
5.0,Love the size and sparkle
5.0,Great looking watch! My girlfriend in love with it! Fast shipping too!!
5.0,Exactly what we were looking for for a pair of earrings that came in cheap mailing boxes!  For a special gift it was worth the few extra dollars!
5.0,"This dress will be great for a work party or church function! I'm top heavy ( 34GG) and most professional dresses fit like club-wear (yikes) or like a flour sack. This dress is flattering without being either.<br /><br />I got an XXL and my 40-42 hips also fit perfect. The material is thicker, so it hides my cellulite and belly button w/o spanx. If you want snug, I'd recommend an XL."
5.0,"A really stylist anklet.  Very colorful, I like the fact that it is adjustable and can fit all sizes.  Seems well made and will go well with any summer outfit, also comes with a cute little bag for storage."
5.0,"Very light, good beach dress."
5.0,Nice fits and feels great
5.0,These are wonderfully luxurious feeling socks that are now my go-to on cool nights.
5.0,This dress went perfect with my knee high boots. Just the right amount of thigh showing to be conservative and sexy at the same time. Fit the is perfect and accented my curves just the way I like. Just remember to bend at the knees and not to bend over otherwise your world will be shown.
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my sister who sports more of the bohemian attire. It's in between a regular backpack n cross body. She went crazy over the bag, so it's definitely worth the purchase."
5.0,Best 10 doll hairs I’ve spent on random b.s.
5.0,This dress is very flattering! my only complaint is I wish they had more colors.
5.0,Bought these because if there was ever a time I couldn’t communicate with someone the bracelet would do it for me. They last a long time. I am still in the first set I bought but wanted to have some on hand in case any of those broke. They are very sturdy and comfortable to wear.
5.0,"The apron is very long I will say that, I bought this for a Halloween costume that I customized & it was perfect for the occasion but the quality is very good"
5.0,I bought this dress for a work formaI. The dress came fast and it looks like the picture. I used body tape in place of a bra. So many people couldn’t believe I got this dress off Amazon.
5.0,Cute comfy and warm. Love wearing this when I do my 5 mile walk!
5.0,"good solid ring,  This was a gift and the person is very happy with it."

5.0,Big and bold.  Perfect hangover shades! haha..
5.0,"I just received my Galaxy Gear S2 watch last week and I did not like the plain bands that came with it. When I found this I knew I wanted new bands.

5.0,My nephew loved it! He’s a Batman nut!
5.0,"Loved the width, was not too narrow as shoes usually come.  Loved everything about them."
5.0,"I received my order very fast and am very pleased with the quality of the earring rack.  It is very pretty and actually a lot bigger than I had thought it was going to be. It probably does hold 125 pairs of earrings, but as I do not have anywhere near that amount, I opted to spread my earrings out to one per space.  Now my earring pairs are displayed side by side and they are not pressed together in one space.  I only have about 25 pairs of earrings so this looks a lot better than if they were relegated to the one space.  If one has a lot of earrings they could do this the other way or just buy another rack.  It really is about personal preference. I would recommend this rack to anyone who wants a stylish way to display their earrings and to have easy access to selecting a pair to wear for the day.  Enjoy!"
5.0,"Very comfortable, I like the extension covering the palm whichever way you move it. Fit as expected."
5.0,"I got two of these, one in the royal blue and one in the light blue. The light blue is really more of a gray as pictured.  I like these very much. the under layer is not very thick but it's not sheer. They are comfortable to wear and very attractive, you can dress them up or down. They are sufficiently long, which I look for because I'm a true apple shape which means my stomach is bigger than my chest and I like to make sure my stomach is covered. Of course the downside for some people is that you do need to have a Razorback bra or use one of the little contraptions to pull your bra straps together in the back. They sell those on Amazon, as well. I know some places are calling this style a halter but a traditional halter top has no back. This one is just exposing the shoulders and high in the front in the back. Very cute with jehgins and boots."
5.0,These were exactly as advertised and just like I purchased at Macy's at a MUCH better price! Thank you!
5.0,"I was wondering how I would see with all these lights flashing so close to my eyes but the vision is pretty good after trying them with the lights on. My son however is more taking a likening to them. It came with batteries and I like that, they were pretty easy to install."
5.0,These were delivered so fast ! These are Beautiful if you are working on a budget. We bought them to give to the Grandmothers on my daughter’s wedding day . Perfect to let that special someone know that they are so dear to you 🌺
5.0,Very delicate looking but sturdy very beautiful! Just becareful cause the chain chain can easily get knots.
5.0,Picture does not do this justice.  Very beautiful piece.  My daughter wore it to middle school and had many friends asking her where she got it.
5.0,I ordered these for my four month old. It fits her head perfectly with a little room to grow. It doesn't leave a mark on her head after she has worn it. I love that the bow lays nicely against her head.
5.0,"One of the best ones I had! Looks very nice, not to big or heavy. Marks or dirt is not visible"
5.0,"When ordering clothing online, you never really know if the item is going to fit true to size or not.  Even if it says it fits true to size, you can't always rely on it lol.  I'm here to tell you, this product really IS true to size haha!!  Not only do they fit as expected, but they're also as comfy as all get out!  The material has a nice soft feel to it.  It doesn't stick to my bedding or try to bunch up when rolling over (I'm a tosser 'n turner lol).  The print on it is super cute, and it's put together well!  No loose threads or anything. I highly recommend this pj set!!"
5.0,"Love these socks!!  They are thin, super soft and keep my always cold feet warm.<br />I don't like thick socks and these are just what I wanted.  Theses are true dress socks. They machine wash well and I air dry them. They stay up and are not tight or itchy so all on my sensitive skin.  I would highly recommend them and will definitely buy them again.😊"
5.0,Nice color i love it

5.0,Very pleased with the quality and price.  Took them to Iceland and my feet stayed warm.
5.0,My husband had a work Christmas party. I received so many compliments. I'm very self conscious about my stomach due to my 3 children destroying it lol. This was the perfect dress to gather in the area and still make you feel sexy.
5.0,Perfect little nightgown and robe for actually anytime because you can put a heavier robe over it if you need to it's really cute silky soft flowy. I'm about a 38-40 bust and the extra large fits. The rest of it's not completely free but it's more open. I'm going to try to get the bisque one. Don't get me wrong the pink one that they sent me is adorable it's just I wanted bisque. This is the second time in a week that Amazon has messed up my nightgown orders.
5.0,Nose ring studs
5.0,"This ⌚ watch is amazing quality fir the price. Its heavy, shiny, just beautiful quality. Honestly nicest quality watch i have ever got in this price point. Beyond worth it. A must buy. Only bad side is its hard to resize yourself, but it comes with the tools to do it. But its only hard to resize cuz its has extra plastic pieces tgat some watches have inside the band."
5.0,"Although it fits as expected, if you goal is to ware it as a compressions shirt, I recommend getting a size smaller."
5.0,It fit perfectly and its perfect for anyone that's not comfortable wearing a two piece with it's high waist leaves very little to show and helps tummy support gives you a good shape.
5.0,I like this shirt. It’s more fitted than typical boutique-style clothing but not fitted enough to be unflattering. The material is thinish but doesn’t cling. Hits right below low-rise jeans and would be cute tucked into mid-rise. I’m usually a small and this fit perfectly
5.0,"ADORABLE, COMFIE AND MY FRIENDS LOVE THEM AS GIFTS"
5.0,5/5 -- As described and fast delivery
5.0,easy transaction. I am 5' tall. These are supposed to be ankle length but are perfect as regular pants. I am pleased
5.0,"product arrived in great condition, stands out with our granite  counter"
5.0,I wear these everyday to the gym and have had no problems. I got an extra large because I am a big girl (5'7&#34; 260lbs when I bought them now 220lbs) and they fit fine. I will be needed a small size soon. I got the 3 pack ankle length (2 gray 1 black) and the black pair feel like a completely different kind of material then the gray. Not bad just different.
5.0,"So I got the full length tights like three years ago from TJ Maxx. I love those tights more than all my Lulu's, Nike, and UnderArmour ones, especially when I factor in the value. My black full length tights just wore out on me last week, after three years!<br /><br />I was so surprised when I realized these are just a shorter version of those! I bought them, and they fit excellently! The thick waistband grips soooo well. They are not falling down when I work out. They stay up on my not-so-small waist effortlessly. No bunching. No see through when I bend over. Thick yet breathable material. Love love love, will buy again."
5.0,"My husband, 10 year old and I all tried this product. While it is lightweight, and easy to see out of. The on flaw is the lights are ran right by the eyes, on the inside, so when the lights are on and more importantly flashing, you get fully blinded. This product is not intended for those with any type of epilepsy. Other than the one flaw, it's really cool, and worth having. We did find that its easy to cover the light strings on the inside, making it enjoyable to wear by  everyone."
5.0,I used this product for an ugly sweater party and it was so cute! Perfect length and fit!
5.0,"I just love these black merino wool socks.  They fit as expected and keep my feet warm.  I don't like a very thick sock - just the right thickness.  I'm as happy I ordered these sock.  When I need to order more socks, I will order these socks again.  Well worth the money."
5.0,"I loved the miniature sizes, though different than most lapel pins.  I guess that what's make special. The multi coloring is also a plus for these pins  ."

5.0,"Nice quality pants.they are fitted-ish. Bought it for my 15 years old  & he love it.The pockets are nice and love the zipper on the bottom ,my son say that they are comfy to work out in. They are made of a stretchy fabric so they give if you have a little extra weight on you.  I’ll would buy it again."
5.0,The sweatshirt is soft and super stylish.  I ordered a small and is true to size.
5.0,It’s perfect! Really high quality for the price

5.0,"First of all, I love the materials and sustainability of these sunglasses.  They are very comfortable and nice and lightweight too.  These are definitely polarized as I tested them.  Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Wonderful top/ great pattern! Flattering to pear shaped women (like me!) and looks great with leggings or “yoga-style” pants without bulk.
5.0,I play golf and this heated vest works perfectly for me.  The vest is lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
5.0,I really love the material and feel of the leotard. After reading other reviews it was clear that this product runs small- My daughter is in a size 7/8 so I purchased the size up from that and it fits perfectly. She should be able to use it for the entire year. I would recommend.
5.0,"These pearls are beautiful. They are flawless and have a high luster.  I love them but, unfortunately, I feel that they are a little too small for me therefore, I will return them and wil hopefully purchase the larger size from La Regis because the quality of these pearls is so high."
5.0,Just love it had to go size up.
5.0,"Bought this as a &quot;Birthday White Elephant&quot; gift and it was a hit, everybody wanted it and it was actually decently warm, may purchase another for myself, snow season is coming up!"
5.0,"My daughter will be 2 next month and absolutely loves shades. These are a little big, but still perfect. Nothing a headband won’t hold in place."
5.0,This is a very nice product!
5.0,"This is a great little bag, I have taken it with me to multiple trips and even use it. The bag makes me limit the amount of stuff I carry with me but don’t be fooled it can still fit a lot of junk."

5.0,I love these cute compression stockings<br />Fitted  very well not to tight I wear a 7 1/2 and is 5' 1  and is a little cubbie lol<br />Does the job and helps my long 12 hours shifts.<br />Great price

5.0,Great Quality and got here fast
5.0,I was looking for a small bag to take to the gym that had a separate pocket for shoes and this does the trick. So many gym bags are huge and all I wanted was space for a change of clothes and my water bottle. The bag originally had a bit of a plasticy smell inside but I got rid of that using a charcoal odor absorber. Definitely worth the price and more.
5.0,I have had this watch winder for a month and it worked perfectly out of the box and is keeping my watch wound 24/7.  Appears to be a great product for the price.

5.0,"This item is exactly as described and it fits perfect!  I am 5 feet tall and weigh about 115lbs.  I did wear some dark hose under the legs as it was a bit thin for the weather.  Also, I recommend wearing a dark shirt otherwise the outline of the bra can be seen.  The costume is tight so unless you are comfortable with your body or you don't mind wearing an undergarment to smooth out some possible bumps, this is a great buy!"
5.0,They are very beautiful. I Would have bought more if they had had more in stock.

Everything was outside, and of course it rained some. The ponchos were small enough to keep in my backpack and pull out when we needed them. They are one size fits all adult. My daughter was able to use them just fine. I tied the sides up for her so she would not trip when she walked. The arms have a light elastic band which is great for keeping the poncho off your hands and helps to make it fit. The hood has a draw string so as to fit it around your face. We stayed nice and dry. They are thin, but you could use them more than once. We let them try and folded them back up for another day. I would definitely recommend these ponchos. I am keep the rest for that next Disney trip!<br /><br />I received this item at a free or reduced price in exchange for giving an honest review.

5.0,Soooooo cute! Love this romper. Wish there were more colors! My 4.5 year old is 32 lbs and 40 inches tall so she’s a skinny thing..I ordered the 3t/4t. It is definitely big on her but not HUGE. Lots of room to grow through the summer and she can maybe even wear it next summer too! Worth the money.
5.0,"This looks like a double strand but it's really a 12"" doubled over into a bracelet, versatile.  Also, the gems are way prettier than the pictures, very sparkly and not cheap looking.  Very nice."
5.0,"Really cute and durable. Some rough edges but it doesn’t bother me. The label says to keep out of humidity so I assume they fade or rust after a while, but I don’t know. I would buy again in the future."

5.0,"I ordered this for my grand daughter's birthday.  Somehow it got lost in the mail, but after contacting the company they sent a replacement within a few days.  I am very happy and satisfied with all they did to make my grand daughter happy.  I will definitely buy from them again."
5.0,Lovely hoodie. Got the sweatpants to go with it in both grey and blue. Very soft and cute. My only issue is carter clothes come up small and you have to buy a size bigger. I brought 6 months for my 2 month old nephew So my sister has clothes for when he gets bigger. However he will be fitting in this very soon. Same issue with any stuff I buy from carter so I always buy 1 or 2 size bigger. Otherwise Love this. My sister was very happy.
5.0,"In March I bought 2 of these bags to go to Alaska on an Expedition. The bags were perfect for what we were required to take (i.e. knee high boots, etc.) They were so good that someone stole the 2 bags in Chicago. We are yet to recover them. (one and a half months and still counting)"
5.0,I love the way this hat looks and I will order more.
5.0,So much easier to put in it and walk away. I like it
5.0,Love the fit. Material.
5.0,The dress is not as thick as I thought it would be but it is a nice cotton material and fits true to size.
5.0,I was so surprised when I received this bag.  I never ordered a bag online before so I was a bit apprehensive but boy was I pleased. I gave myself this bag as a Christmas gift and wore it to Christmas eve mass for the first time. I will never go to the store to buy another bag. Thank you Amazon for another great product.
5.0,"I bought the bag for my mom, she like it but wanted something smaller. I decided to keep it, is perfect for me everything fits and the extra pocket is great!"
5.0,Great quality necklace that hangs a few inches below the interclavicle. I took the pictures outside in the sun because inside pictures couldn't capture the brilliance. well-made and strong!
5.0,Feels good on
5.0,"Very nice suit!  Well made, holds you in, and I love it!"
5.0,"I love my SB Sox with light compression.  Most compression socks I try on won’t fit over my arch, much less my calf! I found them to be just the right amount of stretch, and the length is perfect for my long, long legs. I do find them to be warmer than most compression socks. Great for mid-winter, but I am wondering is they’ll stay in the drawer this summer. The other caveat is that the exterior fabric is slippery. I’m fond of wearing birkenstocks and my feet slip out of them while wearing these Sox. It’s rather like the nylon-y feeling of pantyhose while wearing sandals. With regular shoes I’m sure this is not an issue.<br /><br />These Sox deliver and for me, were true to size. I did measure my calves and ordered appropriately. So grateful they were both wide enough and long enough!"
5.0,"I love these, natural color matched my henna dye perfectly! Had to buy a second set but I alsobhave dreads."
5.0,"Are they subtle? Hell no. Are they comfortable? Hell yes! Fabric is soft, weight between tights and leggings. Great to wear to bed or fit jogging in warm weather."
5.0,"Surprisingly good quality for three dollars, and they look fab on your face...you should get them if you don't wanna spend big money..."
5.0,"I bought these shoes for my 15 year old daughter, based on both trend forecasts combined with what I've seen broadcast via social media platforms. THRILLED I read the reviews that were left, alongside other social media posts because when she opened them on her birthday, she nearly $híț herself.<br />Although there were struggles with figuring out how, exactly, one is able to heely around, said product is 100% aces. Couldn't recommend more. And yes, it's adorably holographic."
5.0,Rustic look I wanted.
5.0,looks good fits right
5.0,"Perfect jacket for workout or post workout, wear it all the time and it washes well with no fade! Zipper is great quality and I’m super happy with it!  Looks amazing on, very flattering"
5.0,"These arrived on time and are super cute! I love that they are oversized to provide more protection. These are the first pair of polarized glasses I have owned, so some things look a little different - sorry, I'm not sure how to describe it. They work really well. 5 stars!"
5.0,The patterns are cute thought I would use them as mask but too thin but great for head bands.
5.0,"Very cute small bag for beginner dancers!<br /><br />This bag was purchased for my 4 yr old. It holds her leotard, Tao shoes and ballet slippers, there's a little Room for maybe a change if clothes as well. She has to carry it to school on her own and tote it around, so it's just right for I'd say age 2-8, I would think after about 8 that girls may need a bigger bag for their things.<br /><br />Seems well made and my daughter has gotten a lot of compliments."
5.0,"It's hard to find a good grad gift for boys, but these were perfect!  Put them in a small cooler with tissue paper and bottled cokes. It was his favorite gift!"
5.0,"Excellent purchase.  Key ring is exactly what I needed.  The actual product is just ever so slightly smaller than the pictures, but it is perfect for my car key fob that has no other keys attached.  Plus it looks very sleek and high tech.  Oooh!  It’s Titanium.  Very cool!  Perfect!"
5.0,I LOVE IT AND EVERYONE ELSE DID TOO. . . . .  it want great with my grey top that wore with it and blue jean jacket
5.0,These glasses were bought for my daughters 2 and 6. We wanted something polarized for our fishing trip so they could see the fish like the big kids.  These glasses are very durable and have withstood my 2 year old testing with ease.  My 6 year old loves them because they are very fashionable. I would recommend these and would buy again.
5.0,"We love the Thermoball jackets! They aren't bulky and make buckling into a car seat easy and secure for little people while still providing the warmth we need in New England. They wash well and still look new at the end of the season, making them great hand-me-downs. As with all North Face, this runs a bit small; but well worth the price!"
5.0,Nice looking hoodie bought as a x mas exchange gift.
5.0,"My granddaughter, absolutely loves them. She wears them all the time. I would definitely recommend this product."
5.0,"I love this suit.  The material is nice, not flimsy.  The bra is full, also not flimsy.  I like the halter tie top because you can tie it to your liking.  The color is vibrant and very pretty.  Now about the sizing.  It's true, what the other reviewers are saying.  Order up from your size.  To give you an idea...I am 5'8&#34; tall, weigh 178 lbs. and have a 40C bustline.  I ordered the XXXL and it fits almost perfectly.  I say &#34;almost&#34; because I have a tiny bit of extra space in the bra area which is acceptable but maybe I can add a small bra uplift-pad.  I have never worn a XXXL in my life, but the suit sizing runs small.  The price is fantastic.  And there is a disposable panty liner in the suit, so I imagine that it is a returnable item as long as the liner is not removed.  I'm thinking of ordering another one in another color.  Very comfortable suit."
5.0,Comfortable and airy. Fits true to size.
5.0,"I am 5’5, 135lbs and pear shaped! I absolutely love the way this fits and looks! Will be purchasing in multiple colors!"
5.0,"I am attending a fun and fancy tea party later this month, and I have the perfect dress. I desperately needed the underskirt to top off the look. After reading the reviews, I decided to go with this underskirt in the Ivory XS. I typically wear a size 2 or a SMALL in general, so the chart led me to settle on an XS. In addition, I am 5'9&#34; and it falls just above my knees.<br /><br />I am glad that I follows this chart because the underskirt fits PERFECTLY. I unpackaged it, and threw it in the dryer to get the wrinkles out and fluff it up. This worked perfectly. It looks even better in person than in the photo.<br /><br />I do not find the fabric to be itchy at all, which was a concern of mine. If I am going to wear it for several hours, I definitely want to be comfortable. In addition, it is a true ivory, which is exactly what I needed. I have no complaints at all about this underskirt. It's my first one, and I love it. I plan on finding other reasons to wear it and outfits to wear it with. For the quality and the price, it's a steal.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I use reviews for every online purchase that I make, so I take reviewing products very seriously. I will always give my 100% honest opinion of a product. If I give something 5 stars, that means that I would highly recommend it! If I give something a low star rating, that means that I do not believe that it performs as promised and potential buyers should know!"
5.0,Love this bangle watch. So pretty and so inexpensive. I get a lot of compliments about it.
5.0,Love it! Super silky smooth silver. Looks and feels great on wrist.

5.0,Love this dress. Good material and well made. Holds up well in the wash.  Just wear a slip under it if you have light underwear.
5.0,"I love this product! My 11yr old got her first cycle this last year & these saved a lot of clothes & sheets on her bed! The whole idea of having leak-proof panties was new to me however so happy these fell into our lap when they did because now I have all her friends wearing them as well! The things were bought 10months ago, are worn even when not on her period & are still amazing! they are machine washed all the time & only hung dried maybe every 3 washes if that. These things were the best buy I have made in the ""period panty"" world. (Bought more than 10 different brands & types of period panty packs last year alone for daughter & her friends & my friends' girls) Hands down in my Top #3 picks of 2018-2019 shopping year! I'm a heavy online shopper by more than $16,000 a year. Let's just see what you think? I bought a x-small & then a small for my daughter size youth 14/16 for the x-smalls & now a size junior girls 3/5 in a small. Best of Luck!"

5.0,Such a unique style! Absolutely love these!
5.0,Very cute and well made. Extremely flattering.
5.0,I was skeptical given the low price and no reviews but thought I give these a shot. They fit as expected and are very comfy and the material is nice. The key pocket is larger than I thought it would be but not quite big enough for my phone. I’m happy with this purchase!
5.0,"UPDATE: customer service reached out and I provided a video of the glasses. They promptly shipped me a replacement pair and they were great as advertised. Adding 2 stars back for the great customer service!<br /><br />I love the style and fit of these sunglasses, but for the price I’m a little disappointed. When I took these out of the box and did the counter test I saw that these are slightly warped. At this price point I’m a little disappointed because this shouldn’t be an issue you have, I expected better"

5.0,"I really love this shirt, the fabric is a little more to the sheer side but it works for me. I love the back and the length!"
5.0,Love how I look in this. I bought a medium and when I initially tried this I couldn’t fasten it BUT 2 weeks later I had no issues.
5.0,"Arrived well packaged and fits very very tightly. It absolutely provides the support and pressure advertised. Fair warning, as a result of the high pressure, any crease in the stocking can dig in a little and it does take a little oomph to get the stocking on and off.<br />Overall I would purchase this one again."
5.0,Perfect for my up coming vacation and everyday use. I love all the pockets. The strap is comfortable when wearing cross body even though I carry a lot of things inside.
5.0,"this suit fits great. usually the bigger the size, the bigger the cup size but this fits great. I'm 5'5"" 175 lbs 38C."
5.0,Using these in my office for well woman exams. A bit pricey but very feminine which is what I wanted.
5.0,"I lost my first version of this scrub cap and replaced it with the same one in a new pattern. This cap is so comfy and I get compliments on the design all the time. I did attach a hair band to the back and use that to wrangle my bun inside the cap. Good quality, comfy and functional. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"I was initially a bit sceptical before I ordered this pair. Right now, I'm so glad that I did. They arrived intact. I've had them for just a couple of days, but I can already notice the difference. My eyes no longer feel strained and I don't have those crazy headaches anymore.<br />One pair stays in the house while the other stays in the car for when I go out.<br />The build is also very solid(surprisingly). They fit so well and they do the job."
5.0,"This purse is so chic! The tassel gives it drama. If you’re wearing something plain, carrying this purse with you would certainly punch things up."
5.0,"Fits properly, they are a little bit on the slim side but still comfortable nonetheless. As a tall person I will definitely buy more of these pants and I recommend them to other tall fellas"
5.0,"Love, love, love this bag. Just wish the handles were a couple of inches longer."
5.0,"I am a huge supernatural fan and I love this necklace. It's double-sided it does not look cheap and it's the same size as Dean's is. I saw that some people said it was smaller than in the show, that's not true rewatch it. I bought one for myself and one for a friend and I would definitely recommend this to anybody like supernatural, as a gift or for themselves. I have seen some cheap ones but This one looks like it cost more than what I paid for it."
5.0,I liked the material and color!

5.0,Perfect if you have nails
5.0,"I purchased the orange band as an alternate to the white band my Polar Ignite watch came with. I was surprised to find that the orange band was less ""sweaty"" than the original due to the larger cut outs on the band.<br /><br />The band fits well. It's easy to clean. Even when I cinch the band down, it's comfortable.<br /><br />I had low expectations with this. I purchased it in part because it was orange - one of my favorite colors. I'm no fashion maven - I'm wearing a Polar Ignite. Ha ha. I also wanted to have an option to change the band to complement what I wear.<br /><br />I've been using this replacement band for about 8 months every day, all day. I'm happy with this purchase. I had very low expectations and this exceeded my very limited expectations."
5.0,Bought as a gift<br />They loved it
5.0,"I love the retro look of this new WINKINE Large Canvas Laptop Backpack. This product is quality made, with  a long life of use in mind.  The Canvas is thick ,and I would call it water resistent ,to a degree. The straps are wide and comfortable for a day traveling, or on the trail. I like all of the secure pockets inside the pack,for my wallet,toiletry items and such. Outside pouches have real nice snap closures and magnetic closures, for security ,and quick access, of your important items like cameras ,phone  or other electronics.  Inside pouch, fits my very large laptop and other accessories . Nice leather adjustment straps, make for a secure load. This would be a great airline carry on bag ,and good for all travel on train, bus, or automobile. Carry handle is strong ,as well as all materials and threads, used to sew this great bag.I give this product a very high reccomendation for overall quality ,workmanship and durability,in the field."

5.0,Love all the colors to hold my keys
5.0,"I originally ordered a small because I'm about 5'2&#34; and 138 lbs and can fit a size 6 normally. The small was too tight, so I ordered a medium and it fit perfect for the most part.

I got a lot of compliments!"

5.0,"We have a destination wedding coming up and since then invitation says ""beach wear"" I figured linen is the best way to go. I got this for my husband but my mom actually ended up keeping it. It was a little tight for my husband that wears medium/large so go a size up."

I was getting desperate in my quest to find dressy heels for a wedding after the Naturalizer Taimi sandals were too tight. But I ordered these in my regular size (9.5 W) and they worked out great. They were a bit tight in the little toe area at first, but I inserted some Ball of Foot Cushions for High Heels and that was enough to keep my toes from getting crunched."
5.0,Super cute case!  I love it!
5.0,speed of delivery and performance of product
5.0,"Bought them for a trip to Tahoe. According to my kid, they are a great fit, they look nice, and  my 10 year old still fits him after a year so they are well made. Highly recommend"

5.0,"Love this belt. I work at an old 1880's historical building and have to wear period clothing, so I was looking for something that would look like a cummerbund. I have a 30&#34; waist and it fits nice. Yes, you do have to stretch it a little but isn't that why it's elastic? I needed a belt that would fit snugly to keep my full skirts up where they should be and to &#34;nip in&#34; my waistline. This was perfect."
5.0,This is a sweet price for such a comfy SET...
5.0,Vest get more comfortable  as you wear it. The consistency  of use is  important.  Over all this vest is more than expected ..
5.0,This onesie looks great! I ordered it for my little one because her Grandma LOVES the &#34;I Love you to the Moon and Back&#34; saying and I thought it would be awesome to send her over in. I'm really impressed with the quality of the print and the onesie itself. It was very dark black with crisp white letters. I ordered 0-9 months and it was every bit of a 9 month size so we will have some time to grow into it. I like it really well and it will look great in pictures because of the high contrast with the onesie and writing. I received this product in exchange for an honest review and I am very pleased with it.
5.0,"I gave it 5 stars because it is really good quality and looks amazing. A lot of time was put into this and also because the communication will the seller was timley and smooth. Had questions and also an issue with shipping and he was quick with his replies and helpful. Only issue i have is it seems like it fits my head perfectly but the eye socket/brow portion rest right on my eye brow and it's painful. Not sure how I'm going to fix that, maybe shave it down but I'm going to find a way because this helmet looks amazing."
5.0,Great bathing suit. I’m full in the chest so the cups are a little smaller than my boobs. There is great coverage on top so it doesn’t really make a big difference. I’m 8 months pregnant so I just sized up and it works great.

5.0,"Arrived a couple of days late, but the hat was perfect!!! NIKE is my sons favorite clothing brand!!<br />Can’t go wrong there!!!!<br />Fits my son perfectly!! He loves it!!!"
5.0,"These reading glasses are fantastic.  Lightweight,  flexible,  no nonsense,  and attractive.  No,  they aren't the height of fashion.  However,  they are the right magnification,  they don't scratch instantly when you drop them in your purse without thinking,  and the price is perfect for someone who loses reading glasses on a nearly constant basis."
5.0,"I bought the hat for two reasons; it's a parody of the got milk? advertising campaign, and in support of Black Sabbath's final tour.  They are heavy metal's greatest band.  Several people have commented to me on it while I've had it on in public.<br /><br />It is a well constructed and very comfortable hat to have on.  It will fit almost any head and the size adjustment sewn in to the rear of the hat is easy to use."
5.0,"I love this pattern too (just as much as I like the edge of glory yellow orange that I bought in the same order). I hope they make this style in more colors. I'd love to see a red/black combo or a purple/gold one. This style looks like it requires the wider band in order to see the design/pattern, so that would be fine with me. I like the wider bands.<br /><br />I think I have 20 of these bands now. Maybe more. Some people collect shoes, but I collect headbands. I think my 9 yr old self would love it."
5.0,Four piece great for the price...Some are kind of snug but fit like a choker should...really happy with them!
