rating,review
3.0,Loved the shirt but I returned it because the only reason for my purchase was for a navy top but when I received this one in the mail it was a royal blue. I plan on purchasing another in a different color.
3.0,Came broken but I was able to fix it.
3.0,not what i expected but ok
3.0,"Great value, perfect packaging, but the lenses have a yellow mirror coating—they're not actually yellow lenses. I was looking for some night-time driving glasses, but ended up with sunglasses. I decided to keep them because they're still a good quality pair of sunglasses, but just wanted to be clear—if you're looking for yellow lenses these aren't the right set of shades."
3.0,Husband bought this for me because I love body jewelry.its gorgeous and a little on the heavy side  . A couple hours wearing out n about a link broke loose causing it to break. Now I can def fix it but it shouldn't have happened so quickly. Not sure if I will order again.
3.0,"Beautiful garment. I wear a size 16 dress, 40D Bra, so I ordered this shawl in a 2XL. Still would not close and was tight on upper arms.<br />I made it work for the special event"
3.0,"I should have order bigger size , it’s too tight for my arm and I am small guy"
3.0,"I've purchased several pairs of these. I love the fit, and the price! Only downside is that I've had 6 pair break in the exact same spot. But, I'll keep buying them!"
3.0,The dress is pretty but the Ivory color is very see through. You need to wear a slip underneath it. I ended up returning the dress because I couldn't find a slip to wear underneath.
3.0,"Small wasn't skin tight for it to be compression wear. I am 5' 1&#34; 118 lbs, athletic built."
3.0,The size was more for a child than an adult. It was tight around the neck even at the loosest setting.  Love the glasses though.
3.0,Received yesterday. Wore for 8 hours then the screw popped out holding the buckle. Was able to screw back in so will have to wait to see if it holds or the screw s stripped..
3.0,"While I liked the shoes, and they would have been great for my special occasion, tragically the heel of the right strap was so loose in the form that my heel was slipping around after I had tightened the strap as far as I could possibly tighten it."
3.0,I will be returning this because it’s too small. Much more like a long tee shirt for me. Not appropriate for wearing as a dress. I feel as though sizing up one size would fit me better.
3.0,Diameter too small
3.0,Like look but will tarnish after a period of time
3.0,"It's very soft but THIN. If you're looking for a good quality wig, don't get it. :/ At least not the White/Silver one. I was extremely dissatisfied."
3.0,The threading on the pockets came undone in a day. Get a few sizes up. Which might defeat the whole purpose of them. These are cool but not the best material. The top part is awesome tho. I really love the top part.
3.0,"Hat is shaped weird. Same price as buying from the Harley dealer, but shaped weird. Not too Satisfied."
3.0,Not as excited about this in person. The little shoulder button and loops on this jacket stick up. Not sure how to flatten them down. The collar is much larger and stiffer than I had envisioned and it was so stiff it didnt bend easily making me look like count dracula. Buttons seem sewn on ok. It was in new condition. Packaging was good. I will keep it as its purpose is a raincoat and it was a cheap coat not an expensive trench. But the collar and the shoulders tabs look cheap to me. I paid $29.99 so it looks like I paid $29.99...that's ok just realize it looks better in the photo. So Im taking a couple stars off here because it didnt look quite as pictured.
3.0,"If I put this in the first hole in my ear it won't fit over the top to hold it in place. Also if you hit it, it falls off the top of your ear and swings down. I have to fix it constantly. It looks cute when it stays on though."
3.0,It was to see through I had to use it as a slip for another dress
3.0,It's a hard call. Love the fabric but the color looks more like charcoal grey. It's really big. Larger than what I thought it would be....was going to return it but I decided to tuck the front of the top into my jeans and wear the back outside of my pants. So I put on a nice belt and some boots. Not to bad. You just have to know how to wear it! I see now why the model in the picture is holding it and posing the way she is. If she didn't do something it would probably just be hanging on her. Not what I expected but able to work it out a little.
3.0,"Muy lindo diseño , pero un género muy duro, las tallas no concuerdan m es tipo s, aún no la lavo así que no sé cómo quedará"
3.0,Not sure what they’re asking about sheerness and stretch for on rating. This skirt has neither- at all. It’s neither spectacular nor terrible. Wish the inside of the material wasn’t while because with the slit it just makes it look cheap. Which it kind of feels cheap. It is cheap. Bought because I had one similar that I loved. This one didn’t quite draw the same fondness from me. I think I still have it though so it was aight
3.0,"The band is well-made and close to Apple Band.  The connectors are plastic and not titanium but the G-Hook appears to be titanium.  The problem is that the band is very short compared to the Apple Alpine Loop (Large).  I couldn't put it on my wrist.  The description states that it will fit wrists up to 254 mm but not so.<br /> If your wrist is small, this band would be fine, but then the Ultra may be too big for your wrist!"
3.0,"Loved this dress, but after the first wash, it shrunk and was too short to wear to the office."
3.0,Material was very cheap feeling
3.0,Very staticky
3.0,The size fit perfectly the picture of the dress on the model is misleading. I thought I was getting the exact same dress as the one on the model but the one on the model looked like it was made with silk and was embroidered. the one I received was made with really cheep material and the design was printed.At least it was cheap though so what ever I guess.
3.0,Love the length of the duster but the material  I'm not that crazy about the material.
3.0,Metal clip on were somewhat uncomfortable to clip on and against your face.
3.0,"after using this item, the zipper portion makes this item seem more like a women's tiny purse, so a bit effeminate"
3.0,☹
3.0,The packaging was not the best. Missing storage bag for product.
3.0,"Too tight, I have big legs and it's really uncomfortable to run with this socks, looks great but maybe for woman with skinny legs."
3.0,These would fit my kid. Way too small.
3.0,"This dress is shorter than expected for my 8 yr old. I was also surprised to see that it's not very thick. I have purchased this brand before and always been happy with it, this is a let down. I wouldn't want my 8 yr old not wearing this with something underneath. I sized up and and it fits a good 4 inches above the knees"
3.0,The quality not the best and pants run large
3.0,"it’s very costume like, had red “s”s on it on the sleeve and front to indicate the size and buttons did not fit through their holes ( videos on pantafizz on tiktok)"
3.0,Massive stitching defect. Cannot believe this passed QA and shipped. Disappointed...
3.0,After I got them and  put them on I wished that they were a little tighter on my hands.  I'll keep using them though.
3.0,I disliked that it doesn’t have a strap to make it a crossbody bag.
3.0,"Cute pants, the XL size is too tight. Gave them to my teenaged daughter"
3.0,I like these sunglasses. However after a while the sleeve that cover arms start to slip off and stick to the ear. It’s a little annoying but otherwise functional sunglasses.
3.0,Very much see thru. And the girl in the pic here must be 8 feet tall because it came to my daughter's knees.
3.0,"The band and tool feel solid and strong. Looks good. Replacing the band was more difficult than I anticipated.<br /><br />My only problem was on the first day I wore the watch, one of the links separated from the clasp causing the watch to fly off my wrist. The watch face is now chipped from this fall. The tension rod was not fully secured in the clasp's holes when manufactured. I found the small metal spring-rod on the ground and reattached the links to the clasp. Haven't had a problem since."
3.0,this is not what I thought I ordered. Ok for elementary age children but not for teenagers or adults. ok
3.0,The flap over your behind is too short and my behind was out during my entire maid of honor speech and I had to constant check myself. Very embarrassing.
3.0,Looks great but the material makes it too heavy for a saree.. It almost gives a feel of a lehanga.
3.0,I ordered this dress for a wedding. It was beautiful but too small. I ordered a size up and it still too small!
3.0,"Overall quality seems decent, but I have two complaints. First the bag basically measures the same as measurements provided in the photo. However the picture of the women holding it is deceiving-that bag looks much bigger on her than reality (or she's a tiny woman). This bag is really a purse -wouldn't work as a tote for anything besides a tablet or very small laptop. Second, the color in the photo is a little off. The bottom looks taupe/grey but it is a chocolate brown. This wasn't the bag I wanted, but if it meets your needs, it seems like a good purchase"
3.0,Cute but dont stay on well
3.0,Not a bad top except the lace at the bottom looks a little cheap to me. But it is great with leggings.
3.0,This was for grandbaby it was to big but she will grow in it .. it was cute
3.0,Item smaller than expected
3.0,This hoodie is fine.  It is just a normal hoodie.  It is not of any exceptional quality.
3.0,"Wallet material is very stiff and hard to insert cards.  Zipper positioning is wearing out materials in the corners too easily, making the wallet looks rather worn out for the inside very easily (outside is OK).  The inside is large enough for me slip in my Galaxy S4 with space to spare."
3.0,3 stars because it’s super long and had to get it tailored. But if you’re 6ft plus it’s perfect.
3.0,They tarnished
3.0,"It's &#34;sturdy&#34; plastic, but seems brittle. Mine has not broke, but it seems if I dropped it, it would probably shatter. Looks from in the light, and even better in a darker room. You could easily paint or decorate it to make it more elaborate. Probably the best you can get for this price."
3.0,These don’t fit an average size female face. They are also flimsy.
3.0,"These are just ok.  Fit as expected, styling is pretty cute.  The seams on the straps are a bit rough, especially on sensitive skin (have not worn them for extended time, but worries of being rubbed raw/chafing).  Not much support, especially for a sports bra.  Would **not** recommend for actual athletic/working out activities. For the price, keeping to throw on before quick trips the to store and the like."
3.0,"It is pretty much as advertised.  Smooth fabric, lightweight and comfortable, no lines showing through the shirt at all.  But the padding is bigger than expected and it created a fake look, if that makes sense.  I'm fairly small-chested, so with the pads in it was really obvious  it's not my natural shape.  I did want to look fuller, but this shape just looked silly on me.  Felt very self-conscious and removed the pads at the first opportunity.  Without the pads, it's just a kind of a soft sports bra, not really as much support or shaping as I hoped for.<br /><br />In fairness though, at this price it could probably be considered a great deal.  For just $10, it is indeed a soft, lightweight bra that is completely smooth under clothing.  I don't think I've ever had no bra lines under a t-shirt before.  I'm glad I tried this one instead of a more expensive version of what looks like the same thing."
3.0,Good quality- I don't use the lanyard so I don't have any problems of it breaking like others
3.0,"These are ok although I preferred another style (no longer available) from the same company. These slap the floor a bit more than I like and are not quite as comfy as the ones I had before, which were made of a squishier material. If they had cost less I would have given them a higher rating."
3.0,Its a hat like any other
3.0,"I think it’s a very pretty dress. But, it’s more like a coverup bc it’s very sheer. When the dress arrived,  one of the back straps not attached on one side. I had to sew it on before I could try it on. The fit is a little on the big side. I could have easily worn a large. I ordered an XL bc reviews said it was tight in the chest. I’m a 38DD+, and thought the large might be to tight. All of this being said, I think it’ll make a really pretty coverup, or lounge around the house dress."
3.0,"They are little, but still cute. I wish they was a little bit bigger."
3.0,I found this bracelet ok but it kind of feels like its going to not last a long time it kind of looks worn out.
3.0,the dress looks beautiful. i had to return it because when i received the dress the stitching was broke on the side.
3.0,Very stylish and really cool product. Kinda loose or big on me. But overall it's ok.
3.0,"Ok, few things, I bought two different sizes, but they won't let me review separately. So I'll start with the medium turquoise ones I ordered for me, a woman. These masks are nice and lightweight, however they do not conform to your face well, even with the nose wire. The ear loops are very stretchy though, so this is a nice comfortable mask. The medium seems to fit me well besides the shape of the mask not really hugging your face, and I have a smaller face size.<br /><br />I bought large white masks to fit my fiance and they are literally the same size as the mediums. Such a scam. Why advertise different sizes if you do not make these in different sizes? Buyer beware, all masks are the same size and they do not fit adult males.<br /><br />That said, as a woman with a smaller face, I like this mask and will wear it."
3.0,This hat didn’t fit me well. Could just be my head.
3.0,I thought it was cute and sturdy but on big queens I’m just doesn’t work was sad i had to return.
3.0,"It's a surgical mask.  I question the quality.  I'm sure it suits the purpose, but definitely not as good as surgical masks purchased prior to COVID-19"
3.0,This mask is for a kid or a person with a very small face. It was too small. Had to return.
3.0,"This one is too tight (I ordered the size 95), especially sleeves which block my arms' blood circulation.  I ordered the same kind in the past and the size was 90!  I like my old ones-- they are comfortable and sleeves fit good but you have to test it for an hour at home, regardless its tag claims &#34;95&#34;.  Don't rely on size tag, it can be mislabeled."
3.0,Definitely order size up if u want it to look like pic.  The pattern looks a lil diff in pic (cheetah) but cute and very comfortable.
3.0,The color is nice. It would be nice if fabric was pre washed. It shrunk so much not sure I can wear it now. Usually wear M-L wishing I got an XL. Fabric is a tad stiff.
3.0,The pocket on the shirt ends up in a very weird spot along with the elbow patches. They end up more on the backside of your forearms. The arms are very tight on this shirt as well. The color is true.
3.0,Appears the launder tags were off...As material really shrinks so much can't use ...... Tried to stretch but couldn't
3.0,"You are playing a lottery with this purchase:(. There are varying degrees of fit in the reviews so you are either getting a perfect fit, too small or too large. I got the blue XXlg and it was too short on the sleeve & body length but fit otherwise. Maybe if people posted the color & size they bought it might be what you get by color and or size. Some of the reviews hadn't been posted when I bought this shirt. There is no broadcloth in this shirt it is a clingy polyester shirt at least I found that in my shirt."
3.0,"Purchased to help with postpartum abdominal separation- it was so, so comfortable on the first day. Very breathable, nice and tight and supportive. But I am short, and the boning hurt either my hip bones, the top of my rib cage, or both, depending on how I wore it and how long I had it on. It's most comfortable with over a tank and tucked into my jeans. Definitely worth the low price, and gives you a great silhouette, but not good for long periods of wear."
3.0,"The stone is beautiful, just a little small.  It will look better when I get it on a new chain."
3.0,"Larger than I anticipated, but still a nice fascinator. Classy and well constructed."
3.0,"I was really hoping to like this.  The sleeves have a lot of room and the body seems small.  The bust seemed tighter than most shirts, and the length isn’t flattering for my hips. I typically wear a 10, and ordered a medium.  I’m not sure a large would solve the problem bc the sleeves would be even bigger.  Def not a good fit for me, the material is light and seems nicer. I also only tried it on with yoga pants, but I’m not sure changing would help."
3.0,This Puddle jumper is not the softer one.. my daughter doesn't care for it as she does the previous one that I bought.
3.0,The top was perfect but the bottom made me feel like I had on Granny panties...in Jamaica which was a No Go!!!
3.0,Beautiful but put it on only for pictures and right before the guard removal because it stretches out quickly. After only a few photos it would slip right off
3.0,"Cute, but definitely turn your finger green.  Good as props for photos, but not for daily wear."
3.0,Size up. they are on the tighter side
3.0,"As a somewhat knowledgeable watch collector (I own two Omegas and more higher end fashion watches like Bulova and Citizen than I can count) I must point out that the Kinyueds are not tourbillon movements. They are automatic movements with maybe a 12 hour reserve. Expect to set the watch a lot if you aren't constantly wearing it. teh day of month numbers run from 00 to 39 every month so you will be setting it on the first of every month to correct that even if you do wear it every day. But I haven't had any issdues with the movement thus far beyond it's low reserve time.<br /><br />In short, it looks pretty good and I won't care if it gets damaged because it cost a very small fraction of most of the watches in my collection."
3.0,"I know it's loose styled, but this blouse is more like xl than xs to me."
3.0,"While the tummy, hips and butt fit great, the formed bra cups wanted me to far bustier than I am and there was just no way I was going to fill those out. I couldn't even fake it and had to return it.<br />If you have an issues with full coverage bra cups gapping at the top, then you may have issue with this bathing suit, too.<br />*shrug* It made me sad. I tried it in several colors and sizes because it was super cute and a cut that I thought would flatter my body type (athletic with a couple of kids), but I don't have enough naturally occurring cleavage for this suit design."
3.0,"The fabric is beautiful, and I love everything about this shirt... except it's a bit too wide at the bottom.  I also find it a little short.  I'm 5.1 and ordered a size small.  It fits very well except it is not long enough."
3.0,"Cute dress it, has a twirl ti it. However, the fit is off."
3.0,Item is a little small but will still wear and the pockets are on the middle of my side not at my hips.
3.0,"I have never received the product. The company was very good about answering my questions and was prompt in response. They offered a refund, but I opted for them to send a new one. The other pair were very nice. Granddaughter loved them."
3.0,"irregular fitting XXL size, too short down my calves, came just below knees, elastic waist was to loose and keeps rolling down.  I'm 6' 5&#34;  w/ 38 inch waist. 250 lbs. other than that I'll still keep them."
3.0,"I ordered a large ( i weigh 130, 5'4) but it was still extremely tight but I still wore it on a cruise. It's cute and good quality."
3.0,VERY thin. All my underwear showed but because they were black it wasn’t a problem. Runs small.
3.0,I thought it was gunna oversized n longer
3.0,Way to hig for a tragus piercing
3.0,"Play around with the piece of fabric that drapes across your torso. It can be a little awkward but if you drape it right, the top will look super cute. Try not to use the draped fabric as an arm sling when you’re drunk though. Guys don’t find that sexy. In fact, they may realize you are cray and you know what they say, “don’t put your D in cray cray”."
3.0,I really liked this shirt but it runs incredibly small. I ordered a large and wound up having to give it to my coworker who usually wears a small - it fit her perfectly. I may try it again if xl or xxl is available.
3.0,"Fit good. I expected them to be a little thicker for the price, I ordered another lense from Seek and they are thicker. Hopefully the protective coating last."
3.0,"Sending it back, my usual size is medium or ladies 10 and this is too generous."
3.0,"I ordered the XL in 07Blaxk&Gold.<br />Sadly I had to get the straps shortened on the shoulder. It fit but the bust area and the arm holes are weird as they gap open and showed my bra. After taking about 1.5 “ off each strap, it fits as described. I’m a 40F bust/ size 14, so if I have to alter my size from the size chart, it seems like it’s not worth the money, ya know?<br />I like the colors & they are vibrant."
3.0,The shirt is much thinner than what is depicted and the size runs smaller than normal.
3.0,I know they are adjustable but still too small. I am a petite person. They are too small even for me.
3.0,Description says compression… Definitely no compression in this tank top and it’s a little short… But they are very comfortable
3.0,It’s super cute but it runs small and is rather short. I ended up returning it because of how short it was.
3.0,One of the slippers was delivered with a hole in it.<br />Attached pictures.<br />Thanks!
3.0,"quality is OK for this kind of price, just remember to order 2 size up"
3.0,"Edges are rough cut, material is lightweight but not transparent. Haven't worn it yet but looks nice."
3.0,"These weren't quite large enough, but I will keep them in glove box in case I forget to bring sunglasses."
3.0,Small no pockets in back
3.0,Looks good...Smaller than expected.
3.0,Slightly smaller than I thought.
3.0,Loved the color and the poka dots.  Just wish the material had more give.  Broad shoulders don't work well with non-giving material.  Shoulders were what too tight for size stated.
3.0,pro: looks cute in the perfect<br /><br />con: not oversized like the picture and I even went up a size. The image was crunch feelings and looked pretty terrible in person.
3.0,"I ordered a size 10 at first, totally my fault, I thought. Returned it, ordered a size 9.  Ring is still at least size 9.5. As a result, have to wear it on my middle finger.  I still love the design, but will have to get something else for my wedding ring."
3.0,"These are more novelty items than actual sunglasses.  I bought them to use on my bike, but they are heavy and they don’t work with a helmet that is worn properly.  They don’t work well under a hat.  I like the idea and I will continue to look for a means of using them.  I was able to use the UV light test and they are 100% UV protective, but they do not wrap all the way around to block side light entry."
3.0,It's not bad but it fits tight for me everywhere but the sleeve. I would order a size up if you have broad shoulders. Very soft material though.
3.0,Needed a dress asap prime  was my only option but for the price i could have bought lne from fashion nova. That wasnt So thin
3.0,"Did not like the material, was very shiney."
3.0,"Shortly after arrival, one of the shoulder strap seams started to come undone. I reached out to the manufacturer for warranty service, but absolutely no response. I emailed multiple times and called, and nothing.<br /><br />Still, a really great pack. I keep a 14 inch laptop in the laptop pocket along with a folder with a couple sheets of paper, and it works great"
3.0,not the best fit but I still like it.
3.0,"The quality of material is very good, but the sizes run extremely small. My husband usually wears a L or Xl, but it fits like a small or medium. We thought we were going to have to cut it off him"
3.0,These are pretty comfortable.  They’re a little long on me and bunch at the ankles a little (I’m 5’5”).  I got the white to go under a costume for a Halloween race and they are definitely see through. I’m keeping them because I’ll be wearing something over it but you definitely couldn’t wear just them. For 10 bucks I would be willing to try other colors.
3.0,"The color was a little off, but aside from that the material feels lovely and it fits like a dream: snug around my breasts and looser around my middle"
3.0,"Nice product, it's a little smaller than expected"
3.0,"pockets on pockets, fit is great stretchy elastic panels in waist gives me great comfort. im 5'10 200lb think &#34;husky&#34; and these feel great.<br /><br />update... second day wearing pants and the snap on the fly broke off.... probably will just sew a button on i guess."
3.0,Pink collar was unfortunately broken when it got to me. The snaps for the pink collar didn't match up one side was too big for the other side. Other ones worked just fine though!
3.0,Don't use for towing ripped easy
3.0,color of grey was odd. Green and brownish.
3.0,The material is see through and quality is not as expected. Wouldn’t wear it as an outdoor dress. More of a house coat or cover up...
3.0,The hat is okay. Kind of unremarkable but if your looking for a fit for a bit head its kind of shallow in depth. Hits way above my eyebrows where I like a deeper fit. Looks like a bottle cap on my head.
3.0,Cute not something I would wear more like something I would hang in my car
3.0,"The pants are kind of cute but not the best material, feels like your in a paper bag."
3.0,Nice dress but was too small.
3.0,"Lovely dress. Hugs EVERY curve, bump, and bruise. I'm 5'9 and it was dragging on the floor so it's pretty long. Kind of tight in the top as well. It's a GREAT beach dress."
3.0,The wind will come thru the sleeves and the bottom part of the jacket.
3.0,I got a lot of compliments but it was frustrating to get stuff out of bag
3.0,the fabric and fit -  thought is was going to be thicker - would like to return.
3.0,Good as a souvenir from New York. Has a good variety.
3.0,"Slightly disappointed in this shirt. I purchased a large (usually wear a medium) to have a looser fit. This fits like most mediums on me; so I guess size up twice. The color is a nice vibrant true red. Fabric does static cling really bad, adding to the tighter body fit issue."
3.0,Have another pair of these from another source. These were ok but the images of earth and moon were not sharp.
3.0,"Liked it but way to small. Wish they would make it large enough to hold a credit card, n some cash. This can only hold a few quarters..."
3.0,Cute but not quite like the photo.
3.0,Its a little bit big but it has been working as in making me sweat. I like it but want a smaller size
3.0,Nowhere near as warm<br />as I thought they would be.
3.0,Felt more like a regular sock….
3.0,Smaller than normal sizing. Size up. I returned.
3.0,"very thin, see through, too big for my 5 (almost 6) year old."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but sadly I  just I don't.  The fit is definitely tighter than expected.  The arm holes are so small, it would require a shirt or cami to be worn underneath, ruining the goal of a cool crisp summer dress.  The material is see through as well, again requiring a second layer.  I will be returning.  Maybe if yo order up a size, it would be a better outcome."
3.0,"Very short dress, but the manufacturer was very easy to deal with"
3.0,These are so cute and soft but they keep sliding down. I will keep them and wear them over jeans in the winter but no good on bare legs
3.0,hard to assemble. A little flimsy for the money. It's over priced
3.0,Little torn in the dress by the laces and it’s a bit to big.
3.0,These are okay. They look cheap and the chain could be shorter
3.0,"They do fit a small head/face - the eyeglasses are a bit heavy - but a good fit,"
3.0,"Pros: super soft, I could sleep in this softness<br /><br />Cons: band was too big, cups were too small. I ordered a xxl as I am between a 36 and 38 depending on brand. Cup size is DD and there was some side boob/cleavage.<br /><br />Overall i wish this worked for me because it’s super comfortable and I love the adjustable straps because I have traps and on adjustable bras dig so bad."
3.0,It is just... ok. Feels kind of cardboard with fabric. I don't know I expected better quality.
3.0,Made too big for the size I ordered
3.0,I thought it would have a way to adjust the strap other than that they will work. Quality not great.
3.0,"It runs somewhat small. The sleeves are more like cap sleeves and the fabric is thin and slightly see through. I have 4 of the long sleeve shirts and I rate those 5 stars. The fabric is soft, thicker and flows better. It is more of a jersey fabric vs the short sleeve version. I have the same size in both versions and the fabric of the long sleeve is more forgiving."
3.0,The wand looks like it is supposed to light up and has a place for batteries and a speaker. It doesn't do anything. It's a design that isn't utilized.
3.0,Shirt was a size too small. Even though I ordered my correct size. This is why I don’t order clothes online. But besides that love the team! Go Mavs!
3.0,The fabric is very soft but was too snug for my 10 year old nephew. Luckily it was perfect for his 2 year old brother.
3.0,"I’m 5’2” and ordered a small. The small was too big, the sizes are not accurate. I normally wear small and at times a medium, so definitely this small is not accurate. The material was very comfortable and I would have reorder it if they had it in an extra small. Therefore, I gave it a three star."
3.0,To small.. didn't fit true to size
3.0,"Odd fit.  Did the job of sun protection.  Uncomfortable, had to tug, smooth and fiddle with them constantly."
3.0,These were very inexpensive and I got what I paid for so no I do not recommend as they look cheap and are very uncomfortable. Sorry!
3.0,"I just ordered 3 colors,Blue,Red and Purple..<br />The blue and the Purple are ok..but the Red color I have 6 pieces that arrived stick to the back where the Pearl is supposed to be.<br />So I don't know what to do with those that I can't open. ..So ,my review for the quality is 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,also for beautiful...."
3.0,"Received the item today, very beautiful but it's broken. Very upset about it. Beautiful color and size though."
3.0,"It is not as pictured, but fortunately I read this on the reviews before, so I was expecting this. The tail & ears really look child sized. The ears and tail are half the length."
3.0,I didnt like the quality - bought it to work couple days and thread started coming out. 😟
3.0,"Luego de devolver este artículo junto con otro porque me quedo grande, lo cual entregué en la dirección que seleccione de acuerdo a la cercanía, me hicieron el crédito, hoy me vuelven a cargar el precio de estas alpargatas, cuando no las tengo en n mi poder y las devolví."
3.0,Scratch to easy and fog terribly even thou you get the extra pair.
3.0,"Fits fine, Looks better online than in person. Looks more like a poodle skirt on me and fluffs out on the sides more than I expected."
3.0,This dress is super cute but I will say if you have wide hips there will be a gap in the buttons right where your undies are....
3.0,Wasn’t what I wanted
3.0,I use my slippers every day<br />It been almost a year and I have to replace them already.<br />The arent good in cold basement  feet still got cold
3.0,lesser quality than pictures may have suggested
3.0,It is just kay.
3.0,They are what they say and my grandson loves them but we had to send themvback for another pair because one of the straps is comming unsewn. Hard for a kid to wait to get them back...
3.0,Noise
3.0,"I ordered this wallet one month ago. The wallet itself is perfect. Just what I was looking for. It holds all my cards, phone and even passport. That was my main concern and this wallet is perfect for it.<br />However, today while getting my shopping done the wristbands snapped. In which I was very disappointed. I hope the company will address this problem. The snap thing that attaches to the wallet looks like very cheap plastic."
3.0,"not even close to the shade of green pictured, more like a faded sage green. not what i wanted at all."
3.0,"Downgrading these to 3 stars. After a handful of wears (maybe 5 or 6) the tights have developed several little snags and holes. This is after NORMAL wear. I would have expected a little more life out of these given how thick they are and the material, but no luck.<br /><br />These tights are great. The gray color and the opacity is exactly what I was looking for. Normally i take extra care not to snag with my nails (which are fairly short) but i feel like these are thick enough that I dont really have to work about it. I am 5'2"" and normally wear a size 14/16 pants so I erred on the side of caution with the XXL and found them to be a little too big, but really great outside of that. Very happy with my purchase and will definitely consider this brand again with other colors."
3.0,I love the colors and would look perfect if the fabric if it was not so thin.
3.0,"Quality was good, but every time I inhaled the fabric when up my nose and Suffocated me"
3.0,They are super cute but the sizing is completely off. Some fit and others are way to large.
3.0,battery went dead pretty quickly
3.0,"It’s very pretty, but mine broke about 5 different times, it was easy to fix but I don’t recommend this product"
3.0,"When the glasses arrived, one of the lenses was popped out of the frame. It could be put back in, but had to be done carefully. The glasses themselves feel bigger on the face than others of similar type, but they are okay."
3.0,Runs very very small. I normally am medium but wanted loose fit so got large. Is very fitted. Fabric nicer than expected- soft.  Got in white which is just a bit see through.
3.0,I didn't receive this product I canceled my order.  It looks cute in the picture before noticing (the largest size) it would fit my 9 year old niece.
3.0,"It's a very cute swimsuit, but the torso definitely is shorter, making the top way too low to be worn practically. If I raise my hands, things that shouldn't be seen are seen. The cups do not hold; they just lay, so I'm returning it."
3.0,These socks are not easy on. For an older person there very difficult
3.0,I'm 5 foot 10 and needed them for a knee surgery so they are a little short for what I was looking for. But would be OK  under workout clothes. A little thin so I don't wear them out
3.0,"I want to see warranty card, but I can not find it."
3.0,Mask does not cover the whole mouth nose area well!
3.0,"I was very disappointed with this night gown. First of all, it is primarily polyester and it feels like polyester. Since it is a blend, I was hoping it would feel soft, but it really doesn't. It's not scratchy, but it's definitely not soft. It reminds me of 1970's polyester pants. Secondly, it has an odd and unflattering fit. I wear a size 16/18 in women's. I ordered this in the 2XL. The straps are adjustable which helped, but the bodice has stitching that goes under the breast. Well, I'm a DD cup and I didn't fit in them at all! I knew it wouldn't be supportive because it's a night gown, but the stitching lined up with the upper third of my breasts and it looked funny because the majority of my breasts were below that line. Adjusting the straps wasn't enough to fix that. Other than that the quality is decent, this just isn't for me."
3.0,The hat is adorable but the bow drove me nuts when it kept flopping around. I thought the sides of the bow were attached to hat as well but they weren't.  Had to hand sew the sides to hat...but love it though.
3.0,FIT IS GREAT BUT VERY THIN. THE GREY ONE ISNT AS THIN.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:abdd5b1148ca18992ca575da12b4b5ca]] It fit ok not to tight or to loose, the shorts underneath were a bit loose the shorts does have a pocket but if I put something in my pocket the shorts get stretched out a bit more. Wish the shorts underneath were tighter. Is great to go camping or go to a gym."
3.0,Can pinch a bit if used on the first row of hooks
3.0,Pants are loose after wearing twice. Material is not as durable as “typical” yoga pants.
3.0,"These gloves are like lightweight dishwashing gloves with claws glued on. What they're good for is planting in already well-worked, weed-free soil -- but when the soil is already loose, you don't really need the claws very badly, just gardening gloves.<br /><br />These do not work well for weeding around the edges of our gardens - flower and vegetable.  That's what we wanted them for. Alas, my husband broke off one claw the first time he used them The rest have stood up better, but he hasn't had any interest in using them since we finished testing them."
3.0,The Arms are Oddly short. But it's a cute sweater
3.0,Not what I was expecting. The two posts to put your gems on are super short and it’s VERY hard to insert this jewelry. I won’t buy these again.
3.0,"I would of loved it, if it wasn't so small. Nice material and you can tell it is well made. It isn't to thin either. I kept it tye dye with the kids."
3.0,"Ordered it in Medium Black. The shirt I received was similar but much shorter than shown & the seller size chart. It had a rounded half circle hem and just fell about 2"" below my waist at 5'4"", no where close to 28"" perhaps 25"" long. The chest was smaller than the seller size chart indicated - too snug on me.  Nice style but not what I ordered."
3.0,"The color was spot on but super clingy and exposed all my insecure body spots, way too long even in heels... not good for a momma who just had her third baby, and I'm only 5 foot 6, 160 pounds. Just a bad material in general...I'd feel the same about this dress if I were 135 pounds"
3.0,size not really correct
3.0,"I love the fit and look of this shirt! It feels great, looks great, and adds great sex appeal when worn! However, there are quite a few upside-down stars that make it feel as if i was advertising something to anyone who takes notice of it.<br />That's where the star rating dropped. The stars seem to only be upside-down, or right-side up and random throughout the design. But for me, it's disturbing when the upside-down stars are mentioned by others. So I give it a 3-star rating because of that. Otherwise, this would've been a 5-star for me."
3.0,Didn't fit on me wright too big
3.0,Meh...looks lighter in person but it's okay
3.0,These glasses are great but they don't block the sun well at all. Great fashion glasses  and great quality but not for blocking the sun.
3.0,"The headbands are really cute, they fit well, however they are hot pink not purple as discribed. The pink is fun but I needed purple for a fundraiser."
3.0,"Larger than expected, but cute."
3.0,"This shirt was so nice and I found out that it has pockets. However if you have a curvy figure, when you button this up it will make you look wider because of the pickets.  It this was a nice shirt"
3.0,"So others said this was a ribbed shirt it is not, made of nylon material if I had my rings on it would rip getting it on.  Super cute but not worth the money."
3.0,This was thick like I wanted it. The top fit great. The bottoms fit weird. The pockets were super low so the sat under my butt. Had the feel like I was sagging when i wasnt. Didnt fit how I thought it would.
3.0,I like the shirt but the stripes dont match up in the back. Looks a bit off.
3.0,Bigger than I expected but pretty
3.0,somewhat large but a beautiful dress overall.
3.0,"This mask is very well made. The thing that keeps me from assigning a higher rating is the graphics. The dog face is indistinct, not a sharp image. None the less, People recognize it as a pup face and comment that it is cute."
3.0,I am 5'1&#34; and weigh 138 bust is 36dd-38dd and I wear size 8-10. According to the chart I should've ordered a 2x or 3x. I ordered a 4x to be safe and it's pretty small. The sides are cut too high or the torso is just too short. I will have to wear a wrap with this. Overall still a nice suit I just don't know how anyone who is taller can wear this.
3.0,Wrong shirt for my granddaughter.  Shirt runs real big
3.0,"I ordered the rose gold 16g 8mm hoop for my rook, and it looks really cute! It’s easy to put in and take out, but I wish I would’ve ordered 6 or 7 mm.<br /><br />Update: my ear got infected from wearing it so I had to take it out. I have sensitive ears so I need surgical steel earrings, which these were claimed to be."
3.0,Very cute just wish the hoop was larger so it can fit on your wrist
3.0,Cute but doesnt adjust very well.
3.0,"comfortable, but squished my bottom a bit"
3.0,I get bangle watches as my wrists are large. Eventually the 'pins' on the hinge will work loose. I did wear it for quite awhile.
3.0,Runs small as expected. Be sure to up-size as most of the reviews suggested. Material is shiny like a swimsuit top.
3.0,"I love the color and style of this fedora.  It is also great how packable it is.  However, it takes some work to get it to the right shape after unpacking it.  Overall, I love this fedora and don't regret getting it."
3.0,Material weird
3.0,"These bras are ok as starters, but lose their shape very quickly. Mine lasted about a month."
3.0,Odd amount of fabric on the side of the breast and I am very large breasted.
3.0,Nice cute well put together for a fake opalite... Very good if you don't wanna spend40$  on a real opalite!!!
3.0,"Nice bag,  but I thought it was supposed to  come with the wallet.  Everywhere else this was sold the wallet came with it for the same price."
3.0,"It was a beautiful dress and it was very well made, but the dress is not true to size. I am a true size 16 and it was not even coming together in the back. I paid for shipping and the return process was very displeasing. I would have to pay more to return it. The address to return was different to the website and when I Googled it, it was listed as a spam address. I ended up having to keep the dress. They offered to give me $20 to keep the dress. I recommend you send them your measurements. Most people that took this route ended up with a dress that fit."
3.0,I purchased 5 if these bands and 3 have broke within a year.  It proclaims a lifetime warranty however the email DOESNT WORK so there's no way to get them replaced or to speak with anyone.  Customer service at it's worst.  I would change my review if I could get this resolved...I really like the bands.
3.0,"Cheaply made, but it was inexpensive, so I’d say a so-so product."
3.0,They are loose and don’t stay up as a face mask.  If you wet them they will keep you cooler so not a total loss.
3.0,Way tooo small ordered large which i usually wear. If you are 38b/c large is too small. Waste of money
3.0,Shirt fit like a 2xl to 3xl but the skirt runs very small barely fit my size 4 daughter. With all the accessories it was still a good buy
3.0,while I do love this dress - I actually own in 4 colors now - super flattering .. i’m typcially a 12 and l/xl and ended up with a large. it’s a great length and perfect to dress up or go casual. I will say the only reason for low stars was the fact that the green print is completelyyyyy different than pictured. I posted a side by side!  I’m going to keep tho bc it is a print and the others I have are plain
3.0,"The wool socks are pretty warm for winter outdoor activities, but it feels a bit stabby fabric-wise. It's not as thick which is nice and easy to fit in the shoes but also not as soft and fluffy. My feet are 6.5-7 and this fits nicely."
3.0,"I have a medium-sized head; Size 7 - 7 1/4 caps/hats.  Ear stings/bands uncomfortable, ESPECIALLY w/ hearing aids, glasses' neckbands.  If they shrink at all after first wash/dry, I'll Return them.  Cole needs to add little bit of string/band length, 'cause the masks are well/fairly-priced Top quality & protection, BUT..."
3.0,"I have four older pairs of FDJ Peggy in my wardrobe, but these are waaaay different.<br />They are jeggings, not jeans. Leggings in the bootcut style, with imitation pockets in the front, but proper back pockets. Altogether, thinner than jeans (could be good for the summer). Be warned."
3.0,"Cute and perfect size.<br />Tarnished quickly and eventually the entire “gold” surface completely rubbed off (started noticing after about 2 months).<br />This happens faster with frequent use, which is sad because it really is cute.<br />I don’t recommend as a gift because honestly it looks cheap when it fades."
3.0,it's not a bad hat it looks great got it for my grandoson and he likes it wears it alot only complaint is that its not a snapback it is in fact a strapback he doesnt mind the strap matches the snake skin on the hat
3.0,Battery was dead when I got it
3.0,"These sunglasses look exactly like Oakley gascans. I own a pair of these and a pair of real Oakley gascans. These are darker than my $120 gascans. Not sure if their polarized, but my eyes take a while to adjust after I take them off. Not sure if I like how dark they are. It gives me a headache after a long time with them on. I love that no one can see your eyes through it. If you like dark shades, these are for you."
3.0,The size was too small even when I ordered L :(
3.0,"Nice fabric, but I chose my normal size and it was way too big."
3.0,Sometimes gets undone
3.0,The masks were very pretty and the detail was nice. One of them had the nose glued on upside down while the other one had rhinestones hanging off it. I glued it back together and it looked ok but the nose was stuck on the other one and it looked weird. We ended up not using them.
3.0,"I loved the color of this shirt but I had to return it because it is completely SEE THROUGH! My white bra stood out loud and clear under the sheer mint shirt. I would not have felt comfortable wearing it out of the house. I guess if you wear a bikini top and put this over it on the beach it might work, or something to go walking or hiking in."
3.0,We ordered a men's small for my daughter who  is 12 yrs.  It was still too small.  Had to return.
3.0,"shorter than expected and the material was not as loose as shown; in fact, it was tight fitting. i weigh 125 lbs and am 5'8 and it hit mid thigh. I have purchased other mediums from this seller and medium or small usually work, Was not the case for this one."
3.0,Definitely on the small side
3.0,It’s ok mask .. but overpriced  .!! Looks like homemade
3.0,"I like the boots, but they seem to run small, so I will be returning them."
3.0,"Buy with caution.<br />I'll start with the pros: These shoes are CUTE. Super cute and I'm sad they have to go back. The style is unique, and that's exactly what I was going for. They look EXACTLY as the stock photo. It also fits true to size.<br /><br />Cons: The manufacturing is not consistent. The right sandals to loop was extremely large. Large enough that my finger also fit in the loop with my big toe. This caused my foot to slide around on the sole, and the loop just looked silly in general.<br /><br />Again, I think these are hit or miss, so if you buy them, I wish you luck! They're certainly a great shoe of you can manage to get a consistent pair. I'd buy only with Prime & free returns...<br /><br />I've added two photos, one of the right shoe, the other of the left. You can tell which one is which :-("
3.0,"The design itself was fine, but I found the sizing to be big. I am a solid medium, but the mediums were a little saggy and the padding forced my legs apart. I did like the high waist, but ultimately returned them. Also, these are definitely shorter than most bike shorts. Think more like booty shorts than the typical bike shorts that are more Bermuda length."
3.0,"I'm 5'3 , length is above knee , usually have issues with arms so ordered XL and fit perfectly"
3.0,This product was way to small. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"Fabric feels great on my face, but very silky feeling and hard to keep over my nose."
3.0,"I ordered this 3 1/2 months ago and was very satisfied with it.  But, yesterday, one of the 6 hooks broke and is not fixable.  So, I would not buy this again."
3.0,"These tights are, frankly, misrepresented. While they are quite decent athletic tights, they are not proper compression tights. Compression gear (tights, socks, etc.) are specifically designed to hold your muscles firmly during workouts and to stimulate blood flow for active recovery afterwards. If you've worn proper compression tights, from 2XU for example, you'll know how they should feel. A thick, very tight spandex-type fabric that can be quite a struggle to pull on--that's how tight they should be. They are a little awkward, and a little ridiculous, but they get the job done.<br /><br />These Goodsport tights, by contrast, offered me none of that support. They have none of the tightness expect from proper compression tights. They fit well, they look good (I really do like the design), and they are moisture-wicking. But they are NOT compression tights in the sense of firmly supporting your muscles during workout and recovery. They are basic form-fitting, cool looking, workout tights and should be purchased for that reason. If you are looking for the benefits of proper compression tights, I think you will be disappointed, and I think Goodsport is not being completely honest in their description of this product, but are rather marketing it with a popular athletic buzzword. (As if to prove my point, the large, folded paper tag attached to the tights, where a company would normally list the various features of the item being sold, is completely blank other than the Goodsport logo. Talk about a missed opportunity, but it's a telling indicator.)<br /><br />So, just be aware. Take out the word &#34;compression&#34; and these are a decent athletic pant/tight."
3.0,Ehhh lost power for 5 days and these were ok but my hands were still cold. Also run slightly small
3.0,They were too big for five and six year old children. Cute glasses but was disappointed that it didn’t fit the faces of my kindergarten students.
3.0,"Ok for the price, not that comfortable need to break in."
3.0,"The watch itself is very beautiful and elegant. Unfortunately, pretty much like the first review, the watch died in a week and needed a new battery, hence the less 2 stars. I do not know if this is an old inventory by the seller as this watch is now rarely sold, probably an old design.<br /><br />Had the battery replaced and wife still loved it."
3.0,Not tshirt soft. It's like a more formal fabric that you wear on blazers.
3.0,It’s soft but after one wash it shrunk
3.0,"Fabric is ok. Won’t wrinkle easily. Colors are true and vibrant. Length is great for shorter people, hits mid-thigh. However, it’s not very flattering if you’re curvy in your lower half... it makes you look larger than you are 👎"
3.0,"Buckle great, leather was soft but not cut cleanly. Neutral review."
3.0,"It looks cute, but the size is a bit larger. Dress is loose in the waist. Sleeves are a bit too long, but I'm short so I guess that's ok"
3.0,Wish I would have bought a larger size
3.0,"Nice flag, but it's only one-sided."
3.0,I have a mixed review.  I love the hat.  It's adjustable and fits my kiddo just fine.  The hair on the other hand is not placed well.  It's off centered and doesn't come up close enough to my daughters face and looks weird.  If I were to do it again I would order the hat without the wig and buy a wig.  As for right now I think I'm going to have to buy a wig anyway.  The hat itself is nice and has lots of detail.  It come's folded so I have a blanket stuffed in it to get the creases out and I'm going to add some hat pins and small details to finish it off.
3.0,"Not my style so I returned, but overall I thought this was well made with good quality fabric."
3.0,I WISH THE STRAP WAS A LITTLE MORE FEMININE.  WAY TOO BIG
3.0,"I loved them, but they have holes after less than 3 months."
3.0,Too fluffy
3.0,But the yellow one is way brighter than the photo. I am not able to wear it - it’s a screaming yellow instead of the gentle light yellow pictured.
3.0,It’s not the same product on tiktok video
3.0,"Got a small, which I usually wear and could barely get it above my knees.  Bummer.  Would size up."
3.0,"I had a hard time to decide to buy this product but because of the GREAT PRICE i made my decision. I did check my size & i was 100% sure the size im going to use before buying this product but right now im kinda regret it. I tried few times to get hang off it & get use to know how to use it properly but in few times it lose the grip (sticky part) so now im thinking to use it under my sports bra & see what happen. But the quality is GREAT, PRICE IS GREAT & it delivered SO FAST."
3.0,Cute but made wonky - get what you pay for
3.0,Very cute and works ok for strictly a safety device to hold on to child but will hold almost nothing!!  Maybe 1 diaper and a small thing of wipes!
3.0,"Disappointing, some were broken upon receiving, the broken pieces weren't even in the bag so they were packaged like that. Not overly thick and with some pressure, they bend."
3.0,Feels a little cheap. I've seen higher quality watches for the same price. Took almost a month to come in the mail. Standard shipping.
3.0,"Good lenses, but mirror coating had com off already"
3.0,Cute but order a size up
3.0,I did not like the way it fit
3.0,"At 5'5&#34; and 150lbs I thought the larger of the two available sizes would be best,  but they're a little loose and not supportive. So I wish there were more size options. I also find that the gradient isn't flattering and makes my hips look wider than they are. But they're opaque and very comfortable, so I'll be keeping them."
3.0,If only the elastic waistband were stretchy instead of constricting the pants would have been great.  The drawstring is useless due to a tight elastic.
3.0,This is a very simple card keeper.  Being made of felt not sure how it would fit in a pocket but to carry in a purse it's very handy.
3.0,It's to big for Galaxy 7s plus.
3.0,"The pendant seems nice enough, but the packaging was terrible.  For the price it should have been better.<br /><br />I checked the pendant before gifting it to my wife, only to find the chain in knots.  I spent over an hour trying to fix it with my large fingers without success.  My wife spent another 25 minutes and finally got it fixed.<br /><br />She seems to like the piece, so I've got that going for me, which is nice."
3.0,It's very nice.  I will look like a million bucks when I wear it.
3.0,One butterfly was off
3.0,Great for u neko kittens. My wife is a Little and a kitten so her kitten gear is very important to her. The ball on the collar popped off day one. The collar is pretty much deal. Other wise the bottoms and tops are good quality. The ears stay on the bottoms and no issues with the top. The bottoms are a bit tight if your not tiny. My little girl is pretty small and they are snug. My girl has 36 c chest and her tits fit well in the top to make it snug but very sexy and comfy. It took about 3 weeks to arrive with Amazon prime.
3.0,"Received these in the Pink/Navy color as a gift. Unfortunately, in reality these look much different than in the photo. There's really no pink in them at all. It's just two shades of blue and a reflective metallic color that looks silver in some light and gold in others. But definitely not pink. They are well made and look nice if you are just looking for a multi-blue cuff link, but I'll be returning them since they aren't as attractive to me without the pink."
3.0,Nice watch for the money. But cheaply built. Looks nice to. Plastic bezel and back cover are plastic
3.0,"Love the suit, just a bit larger than expected...."
3.0,"Very cute, but the charms fall off easily"
3.0,"They are too big and ugly. They look like pjs , they are comfortable."
3.0,Seems small for the size I ordered.
3.0,I got these in a timely manner but once you use them a few times they begin to stick less and less.
3.0,Beautiful dress but too small and too short
3.0,A little over priced considering how small the necklace actually is
3.0,"Fit and wear is comfortable, however the material used for the band connectors is questionable. These watch bands use plastic for the band connectors to the watch. Not sure how those will hold up over time as metal would have been a more desirable material for this part of the watch band."
3.0,I normally wear a size medium and this was too big for me. There was a lot of loose threads on the dress as well. I loved the design but I was in a rush to get something for an event that weekend. I didn't really have time to shop around.
3.0,I bought the XS and it was too big for my size 2 daughter.  The material and straps are exactly like a nightie and not like a dress you wear into public IMO.  We returned it since it was too big but i would not want to wear this out.
3.0,Hard to mount and adjust. Equally hard to put on your wrist.
3.0,"very small, one of the earring has a very loose conection"
3.0,"this is a great purse for the price, very roomy. However, it's like a black hole what goes in is very hard to find later, but if you tend to carry things like camera, wallet, tri-pod {a small one}, pens, note book, and all the stuff your husband cant fit into his pockets, because apparently he's &#34;to manly to carry a purse&#34; it is a good suitca.....err purse.  One thing I don't like is, I've had it for a couple of months, and the color is starting to rub off.  Not very durable at all, but it is cute."
3.0,Excellent product fast service
3.0,Me gusta la moda. Pero no la tela
3.0,Well the slippers don't seem to be made very well I am already noticing that the stitching of the.back to the front panels are.coming undone and the the soles are.seperating form the upper.material
3.0,The quality is not great.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Bought the Black Grey Space Dye Pants. I briefly skimmed the reviews to read if anyone had complained about these pants being too sheer while working out. One of the biggest issues I have with Yoga Pants is that once you bend over, the entire room can see the color, cut, print, and shape of whatever underwear you might be wearing at that moment. I didn't come across any reviews that had mentioned that (granted, I only skimmed through - should have put more research into it), so I went ahead and purchased these pants since they were a great price.<br />Well, they are super comfortable, but DEFINITELY sheer-ish. If I wear black boy short cut underwear underneath, they're fine. But anything else, I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing these while working out."
3.0,I have an average head size and the sides do not go all the way to my ears. They netting (back) is really scratchy. It does not form to the top of my head in the front.... Overall I got what I paid for.
3.0,It is easy to install & remove and durable.  The band is a bit thick in depth for me.
3.0,Tiny pearl missing before I even opened the package. Cute enough to keep. Wish the earrings had been a dollar instead of $5.99.
3.0,"With the authentic Apple strap, they have a good way of attaching. This strap decided to change that. You have to loop it in, then out, then back under. Kind of cumbersome. Attaching it to the actual watch isn't great either as there part that slides into the watch is not completely solid and is soft rubber like the rest of the strap. The design and color overall is nicely done and doesn't look cheap. If they would have kept the Apple watch way of strapping on the watch and made the part that connects to the watch more stiff, this would have been 5 stars."
3.0,Got for my kid for Christmas did not even make it out of the box. The band broke it is not fixable. Still like the watch face as of right now. Gonna try to find a new band but it would be nice to pay for something and you at least get to wear it. Price still not to bad. And kiddo still likes it.<br /><br />****Update company reach out to me they have resent the watch. Costomer support has been great I did not even ask for a new watch or refund.  I will update when I receive watch.
3.0,its not as sturdy as I  would have liked
3.0,"These head bands are not of the best quality,but they are worth the price for the amount of bands you are getting and they hold up pretty average."
3.0,"The hat and gloves fit nicely, the scarf is soft. But the inside layer had what looked like burn holes along the seams of 4 fingers. I repaired them and now they are like new, but they shouldn't of come like that."
3.0,"It's a little large in the top, the piping runs in an odd place for me,  and the cups are clunky, but it'll do for the purpose I bought it for."
3.0,"I didn’t care for the ruching of the back. Great product, just not for me."
3.0,To small for its size..
3.0,Very thin. Over priced.
3.0,They're nice but have a very strong plastic smell to them which is very off putting.
3.0,These earrings are cute & arrive with an extra set of sterling silver backs which is wonderful. But they are tiny. Actually saying they are tiny is an understatement. But they are an anniversary present & my husband likes to buy tiny earrings for me. So I will keep them. The turquoise & silver is very pretty. And the backs & posts are of a high quality.
3.0,"Comes over the knee, but an uncomfortable toe seam."
3.0,"It is cute but a little larger than expected. With that said, it just did not look right on me. It is also long on a short woman. I am 5'2"
3.0,Sleeves to long and no wrist elastic.
3.0,My son was so happy to get these shoes but then the left shoe started acting weird with one light turning a different color.  Now the right side won't even work. Ive tried to charge it several time and I was not successful.  Another thing is that show color has quickly come off of the toe of the shoe.  It might be because of the way my son sits on his legs while playing but this shouldn't happen so quickly after purchase.<br /><br />Other than that my son loves them even though only one lights up.
3.0,"These were okay and they worked for the one night I needed them for, but I have relatively small arms and these were so tight on me it was hard to get them up my arm. I would be cautious if your forearm is any bigger then mine, you might not be able to get them on."
3.0,Tassels aren't as long as I thought
3.0,This looked exactly like pic only the flaw was that the dye ran SO BAD!! My skin was stained a few days after wearing and there was a STRONG chemical odor.
3.0,Cute for kids. They did feel some what flimsy. But what does a kid care.
3.0,You could tell they are cheap but I guess for the price paid it is good. I would probably pay more for better quality though.
3.0,too big. Didn't like. Gave to a friend....to expensive to return. Nice quality though
3.0,"The top is flat but its thick so it sticks outside of the nose and is actually quite noticeable. Like others said, it is also rough and scratches the nose, but a quick buff will work it out"
3.0,I bought it for a trip but it wrinkles easily.  Seems flimsy too.  Not for me.
3.0,"It is as described but it’s quite expensive for a cheap piece of plastic. I think for the price, the phrase should be on both sides."
3.0,i wear a 34 waist and ordered a medium.  Still way too big.
3.0,I ordered for my students to use during reading time and some of the lights didn't work or when we tried to turn on some broke.
3.0,The dress/tunic was cute but way to small. I ordered a size up but I think I should have ordered many sizes up.
3.0,"I bought it in a large because I usually wear a medium, and wanted to wear this over a thicker shirt. It is soft and comfortable but makes me look like a cumulus cloud. I looked very wide in it, and I'm not a wide person. I'll wear it again for comfort when it's chilly out. If you're looking for something that stay closed in the front, this is not the vest to buy."
3.0,"The print looked fake and not exactly like a sunflower; however, smooth return since not as expected."
3.0,"Love the look of these socks however they seem to fit a bit ""big"" which is annoying."
3.0,Decent quality for $4. Very lightweight so your ears won't sag.
3.0,ok for the money
3.0,"Smaller than what I ordered but they go under clothes, so Ill make it work"
3.0,"Little flimsy, but does the job."
3.0,"fitting is good but leg opening is very slim, more like skinny jean Not regular straight leg."
3.0,"Ordered the small. It’s massive, I’m swimming in it. 33-23-34"
3.0,These are adorable but they don't stay together and their always falling off.
3.0,"I hesitated ordering jeans online, because I like to try them on before buying. I was pleasantly surprised that these fit great except for the length. I'm 5' 5.25"" tall (The average American woman is 5' 4.5""), so a regular length should have fit. Unfortunately these are 2"" too long.  (Question: if an average sized woman has to wear petite sizes, what should a petite woman wear?) Granted, if I had read the total description, I would have seen that a regular length was now much longer, but since I was familiar with this brand, I didn't expect the manufacturer to increase the length. C'mon, manufacturers, the average woman is NOT going to be wearing 2"" heels with her jeans."
3.0,"My grand daughter is 10 mo old, (aprox size 3). She is /has been walking... I was looking for something light, but non slip. To help keep her feet warm, socks cleaner on my wood floors- I liked these-  the only issue is she would/could kick them off. I found if I folded her socks over the top it helped keep them on."
3.0,You must order two sizes up to achieve the front length being waistline level. Color was also lighter than picture. Still cute though!
3.0,"Even at a little north of $20, I was disappointed with what I received. The dress I received was a bright fluorescent pink, and I felt it differed considerably from the peachy pink pictured. The fabric of my dress also had much less printing than the one pictured -- maybe I got a bad cut of fabric? I don't know but the pretty floral pattern is what drew me to the dress and what arrived was a couple blotches of flowers. Lastly, it is just thin polyester material, not the crepe-y look it has in the photos, I honestly don't know how they made it look like that but that's not what I received. Otherwise size, cut and style was perfect. I'm a 12/14 and ordered an XL. All in all, I was disappointed and it went back :("
3.0,Very pretty. Way too tight. Would be great for someone with narrow shoulders.
3.0,i thought they were bigger.  do not look like crystal.  seem like plastic. why do i have a required number of words?
3.0,"dress fit perfectly fine the only sad thing about it is, that i received it with a big tear on the back of the dress."
3.0,I have to say I'm a little disappointed with these reviews and they were misleading. Many people said they also got a tongue bar - which I did not receive. That was one of the reasons I bought this though. I was wanting to have them all match. But that's okay.<br />The quality of these seem average. I've only worn them a day or two so far. However they are smaller than expected. Both the balls on the end and the barbells. These are best suited for girls with C cup or smaller breasts or if you have tiny nipples. Not sure how long I will end up using them because of this reason.
3.0,"It's cute and my daughter loves it, but she will on be able to wear it for a few months. I got a 5-6 and it's fits, just wish it was a little bigger! Also doesn't seem to be as bright as in the picture, colors are a little dull!"
3.0,I ordered a grey robe. What arrived was a black robe with a grey hood and belt. Looks nothing like the picture. It's warm enough and though it will fill your lint trap with fuzz on the first wash cycle it stays soft enough. Just isn't technically what I ordered.
3.0,"Although the outfit was nice, and stretchy it was also very see through. I could not wear this out. I could if I tweaked it a little, but the purpose was to wear it as is, with no cover ups.Would have been excellent in another color. :)"
3.0,"Overall a great looking belt. One minor issue, the ratchet slips while moving and requires you to re tighten it over and over."
3.0,This is a really cute very soft pajama set however it runs really big and does not fit like how the model is wearing it the shorts are not fitted and are extremely baggy in the legs
3.0,Clolers very nice but it was broken.
3.0,Love it. He's comfortable in it but seems small
3.0,Soles leave scuff marks everywhere!!!
3.0,"I REALLY wanted to love these. The backing is secured with what looks like hot glue, and as a result, a handful of them arrived with the backing broken off. My daughter loves them, so I requested a replacement set, but I doubt they'll be any better. They're adorable, but I don't think they'll last very long. Shame.<br /><br />Edit: Replacement set arrived in same condition. Many broken charms. AVOID!!"
3.0,I'm only giving this three stars because the torso was a lot shorter than what I was expecting. I am 5'9&#34; and 130lbs. My other rompers are a medium so I got a medium in this. The crotch of the romper was NOT comfortable. It was about 28&#34; from the shoulder to the crotch. Other than that..the fabric was soft and it was super cute
3.0,"just changes colour to fast, its ok<br />but it change colour the first day I used it"
3.0,A good buy for the price
3.0,The sleeve is a litlle long.
3.0,Great quality but not a great fit for smaller breasted women. My nipples almost fall out from the spacing between the pads.
3.0,"I really enjoyed how this hoop looked, I ordered both sizes. The 8mm was too small and irritated my nose. While the 12mm looked ridiculous. Although I enjoyed the style, I had to get a real gold one as this metal made my skin swell."
3.0,It’s fine but it sits on your lip weird and the hair ALWAYS gets in my mouth the entire time I’m wearing it. Good for videos and photos though ;)<br />~LazuliRobot
3.0,The fabric flower was glued on off-center. The crooked flower pin was on my Mom for her funeral. There was no time to re-order. &lt;insert sad frowny face here>
3.0,Feels super comfortable but a little snug
3.0,The shirt was cute and well made but the size is more for juniors or petites.
3.0,Not a fan. I ordered a medium (my normal size) and it was way baggy. But the fabric stretched out a lot. Would recommend ordering down.
3.0,The pearl is oddly large.
3.0,I am not sure what is the intention behind this dress. It is an utter tailoring mess that ironing won't fix. It is a waste of very pretty rayon fabric.<br />I got this dress in XS. It is a totall misfitting mess. The bodice is too short while the rest of the dress is too huge even for a loose fit. The fabric pattern is mismatched. Yet another Chinese manufacturing insult. Why would anyone with half a brain cut half of the pattern in the front of the bodice?!
3.0,Seems to be very cheap-I can't find the label that states the fabric so I washed and dried and it's ok but it is very thin fabric and it's purple! Like I said it's small. I've been getting XL in everything and this is one of the only too small of anything I've gotten in XL. Didn't see the price but I hope it's very cheap because that's what it feels and looks like.
3.0,"Works well, but not user friendly. Had to really read directions several times because the picture for directions were different than the face of the watch. Watch is great. I bought it for my 11 year old son. He loves it but says &#34;its hard to setup&#34;."
3.0,"The bag is a LOT bigger than I expected. It's a bit too big to be a messenger bag in my opinion.<br /><br />I should've actually looked at the dimensions myself. The image with the magazine doesn't really help to show the size. If it was an image with a person actually wearing the bag I would have gotten a better idea.<br /><br />I love the style of it, which is why I bought it. I bought it intending for it to be a gift, but if she feels the bag is too big, I will be returning it. If it was smaller, it would be perfect."
3.0,"The wrinkles do not fall out by just hanging it up, I had to use my steamer to get them out and I can't tell if the seams on the outside are wrong. The outside seams look to me as though they should be in the inside but then some clothes are that way on purpose If I had looked at this in a store I very likely would not have purchased it.  It is fine to wear around the house."
3.0,One of the earrings came broken with no backing but i fixed it with glue. They felt light weight and really put my whole look together.
3.0,"It's a pretty enough shirt in the picture, but it looks like a tent and isn't very flattering when worn. The shirring part ends at a weird spot on my bust and then the rest just hangs like a tent. It could do with a tough more thoughtful shaping, and still bean empire waist shirt."
3.0,Cute however to big for my 3 year old. Perhaps in a year or two they will fit. He is an average size 3 year old
3.0,Was a gift for a family member and she absolutely loved it.
3.0,Design takes up most of the shirt. Low quality materials but a fun shirt
3.0,The band itself is awesome.  The pins they send with it are TERRIBLE.  They do not even fit into my Versa 2.  I had to take old pins from a broken band to make this new band work.  Love the color - but defective on fitting.
3.0,broke super easy and lost it. It's pretty but kinda bulky.
3.0,It didn't quite help the area that I needed it for. Not enough compression for midcalf
3.0,"Super cute suite, it was way to big for me at the top and there is no way to adjust that. Not able to wear."
3.0,Too heavy not worth the price.
3.0,"Nice item, Ok quality"
3.0,The shoes are awesome but the sizes are off. I asked for a 3.5 and they sent a 4.5 luckily because the sizing is so weird they were just like a little big and we decided to keep them.
3.0,It's way too big on the straps and the size it self... I went with a size 8 and it's way too big I would recommend getting 1-2 size smaller then your usual size. Other then that the material itself it's bad!
3.0,Necklace is too long. Even on the shortest of the adjustable links it hung down mid boob which is too long for a large necklace like this (at least for me) one of the flower links was misplaced when it arrived
3.0,Really cute shoes but runs at least a half size small and narrow at the toe. Has nice padding on the inside though
3.0,"So this is a beautiful dress that fits really nice UNTIL you wash it. Though I used cold water and dried it in warm air mode, it is now useless for me. I don’t get why they don’t wash the fabric before putting together clothes.  And I court 4 more that didn’t arrive yet so I guess will wash by hand and let it dry on it’s own."
3.0,"Love the look and fit of the product, but after one or two wearings the drawstring seam in front has come apart and the vimmia decal is separating from the item.<br />I'm exchanging for another pair, but not sure how good their quality is."
3.0,I thought these were adorable but my 3 year old won't wear them...he says they are too tight..
3.0,They have a terrible odor to them!<br />2 of the plastic button snaps don't work properly. 1 won't snap & the other is hard to snap & to undo.<br />They are a VERY light material. Like a flowy headscarf.<br />You defiantly want to add a filter.
3.0,"The legs, around the ankles, are a bit strange. Not a fan. Also this got great reviews for seeming soft... but didn't seem very soft to me. I did like the style, but ultimately not super impressed. Returning."
3.0,Quality is not as high as I'd like but neither was the price!  I cannot zip them with thick socks on without feeling like I'll break the zipper.
3.0,"Great fabric, quick dry."
3.0,So I love how it looks. But after the first week the plate came off ok for the nail. I'm not sure if this was an anomaly or what but it sucks.
3.0,"Small. To the point the “flaps” of the jacket didn’t fold over and lay flat. Also, I’m 5’2 with a short torso, and it the large barely came to my waist."
3.0,"It was pretty small and I feel like if there was some color, it would look better. It was easy to get onto my backpack but it seems a lil’ flimsy where it hangs down."
3.0,"My head is 55cm (22 5/8), size 6 7/8. The beanie is too big for me, fits very loosely on my head and moves around. I think the quality if okay, although it's hard to assess because of the fit."
3.0,They run about 2 sizes too small.
3.0,Interesting design.  Unique look.
3.0,Not as nice as looks in picture. Too short also.
3.0,"It was too tight in the arms, the lower rim was too short, the bottoms was too tight in the waist line and upper thighs. I will order a bigger size next time-"
3.0,This is a striking shirt but it's so hard to tell if the dark color is black or brown. I wore it with black and it looked brown. I wore it with brown and it looked black.
3.0,"This towel is the thinnest thing ever. Think cheap motel pool towel thin. I’m a size 18 and I got the XXL because reviewers made it seem huge. Uhhhh no. If you’re a 20+ this probably won’t work for you.<br /><br />I will look into returning and putting that towards a real towel.<br /><br />Oh but wait, there’s more…it has a pocket…"
3.0,Todo muy bien pero los pelos se desprenden muchísimo y se salió la mandíbula de arriba en la primera puesta
3.0,This was a little too short so I did send back. Good quality and cute but just too short for me.
3.0,"They came very fast but when I received my item I was under the impression they were like the picture with dark lenses, the one I ordered came with clear lenses. I contacted the company and they immediately responded and were more then willing to replace the ones I had gotten. Unfortunately they were out of the ones I ordered with dark lenses but they were willing let me browse their store and pick another!  Great business!"
3.0,I have not be able to use it. But it loook like on the picture
3.0,"I ordered the 'fits size 8-11' in hopes that they would fit my size 10 foot...sadly, they fit small and the individual toe-sleeves don't quite fit my toes.  Using them for barre class, so hopefully they'll stay on. Otherwise, they are nice and soft and I like the cute design on the bottom."
3.0,Not very comfortable as my other Lauren Lorraine shoes are. Very unique style shoe but a bit fragile with the sewn on stones that come loose from the casing.
3.0,The glasses were rly cute but yea i expected more heart shaped in then it being round. But they're very cute for the price.
3.0,"I was wearing this watch during a normal day of mine, so I could 'put it through its paces' so to speak, and found out that this watch IS water-resistant, and has a VERY low profile, however, it is THE most 'basic' watch I have seen in a long time! I don't know what kind of battery it has, as I have'nt opened it to find out, (fearing I might damage/destroy it) plus, I think you need a special tool to do it. As for the rest of the watch, like I said, it is VERY low profile, (meaning EXTREMELY thin) and is also very comfortable to wear, (you almost can't tell you have it on, and I even forgot I was wearing it on a few occasions!) being that it's extremely light, but (as with everything) it has its weaknesses, as well. Something that surprised me when I got it, was that the 'band' of the watch is one-piece of soft silicone rubber, (there are no 'joints', with screws you can undo to replace the band if it breaks.) therefore if you break the band, you have no choice but to toss the watch, but being that it's so low-priced, i'm guessing the manufacturers intended for that. Also, (like many other watches out now, minus the real expensive ones,) you can't wind it, it's just powered by a battery (again, not a big problem, since the battery is probably rather inexpensive) There are no numbers on the watch face, it does not have a backlight, the marks where the numbers would be, do not glow, no part of the watch hands glow, there is no time and date at the 3 o'clock position, just the words &#34;SKMEI watch&#34; (that's how it's spelled). There is also something I have never seen before. In the places on the band where you put the 'catch' when you wear it, there are what looks like pieces of 'flash' (overflowed parts of silicone from being made in an injection molder - the band) however, I thought once I wore it the one on the hole I used would go away, but it just went back into position. I don't mind, I've gotten to like those hole fillers. Overall, this is a good watch, if you're just looking for a basic and usable one. Don't know how long the battery will last though.<br />*I received this product at no cost for a fair and unbiased review* and I hope my review was informative enough for you. If there's something I forgot, please leave a comment, and I will give you an answer to the best of my ability."
3.0,Not bad. Wish the poncho was packaged in something smaller.
3.0,Nice jersey but appliques are just ironed on. And jersey material is really thin. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Pretty colors but very thin material. Definitely not serious protection. I guess it's a halfway measure. I often use stretchy masks like these but these are the thinnest by far. Also not sure how they will hold up. And the cut/shape isn't really anatomical. But again, the colors are nice."
3.0,"Harness is made from very nice leather, however it was so tough and thick that it lacked the flexibility to be comfortable with any weight on it (I purchased it to make the Captain America magnet shield harness, which turned out perfectly). I also felt the chrome buckles weren’t as tough or nice as they could have been, and they don’t match the other metal on the harness. Overall, it’s a decent harness that is just a little overpriced."
3.0,"I like the side deep pockets but the back pocket is not deep enough since my wallet fell out when I was exercising in the gym,"
3.0,The pearls are beautiful! BUT the clasp on the pearls will not stay closed! Trying to decide weather to send them back or have a new clasp put on by someone local.
3.0,Decent quality.  Socks were very long and actually go over the knee.
3.0,"I have purchased this same shoe several time and never had a problem with the fit. I did purchase these shoes several months ago but didn’t need to wear them until today, but unfortunately they are too narrow, I would appreciate a credit so I can purchase a different style."
3.0,"I thought these are very cute, however, they’re huge. I’m usually a medium but these are gigantic."
3.0,One size and thy don't look like the picture
3.0,Recycled wiimote straps with way too much excess glue to install properly with out modifications ordered two sets with both sets having the same issue had to sand down glue spots to get both sets to fit in properly. For the price should fit perfectly.
3.0,"Nice and long but once they pass the knees onto the thighs they get kinda tight. I'm slim also, so if you are on the thick side these socks would be tight, especially from the knees up."
3.0,Fit as expected. They were pretty tough but they seemed to falling apart now. Bummed!<br />My daughter isnt tough on shoes either.
3.0,"Package of 5 and in 2 of them, the nose bridge wire was off-center enough to make the masks unusable.  Designed with an extra piece over the chin, helps them fit really well though.  Earloop snuggers sometimes slipped and had to put knots in them to hold."
3.0,I ordered an XL and it fits like a Medium so I gave it to my 10 year old daughter... she like it so it wasn't a total waste of money
3.0,Not as big as I thought it was and does not go well with jean outfits.
3.0,Color is shiny. Thought was a matte gray but it’s not.
3.0,"I ordered kid size since it was supposed to be for a 10 year old but I was sent toddler size.<br />The product seems ok, but I am unable to use it amd do not see a return option on my amazon account for it."
3.0,Too small for a x large.
3.0,Bought them expecting to be used for ranch work (based on their advertisement) and cutting/stacking wood. It's thin leather and already chewed up from friction of stacking wood. definitely not made for ranch work for fencing or hard labor. This would be more suited for equipment operator or something along those lines because of not being too thick and allow your fingers to maneuver small objects better and having some tactile feedback.
3.0,"I love this shirt! But being a little chesty, it was a tad snug. I even ordered a size up. Would recommend going even one more size up if you’re chesty!"
3.0,Very cute pin for the bird lovers in your life!
3.0,"These are just so-so.... I probably wouldn't buy them again. The quality feels like sunglasses you'd be at the country fair for $7-10. The one upside (or downside?) is the lenses are SUPER dark. I have 4-5 pairs of sunglasses and these are by far the darkest lenses I have. I live in Hawaii and unless I'm in an extremely bright setting, the glasses are too dark for me to wear.<br /><br />Summary ---<br />Materials: 4 out of 10<br />Looks: 6 out of 10<br />Lenses: 10 out of 10 (when it's really bright); 1 out of 10 (when it's not so bright)"
3.0,I bought this for my Grand daughter in a size 5T and a 2T was delivered to her. They're a busy family and don't want to take the time to return it so they're going to donate it to charity. I'll get her a replacement elsewhere.
3.0,Beatiful dress but runs smaller in size
3.0,"Its a good quality item, looks greand and everything BUT i had to return it cuz it didn't fit me :/"
3.0,"Purchased the white set of socks - super cute, VERY LARGE, & definitely NOT WHITE. They are more of an off-white. I’m going to keep these because my 2 year old will eventually grow into them & we can match other non-white outfits."
3.0,"They saying on this card was beautiful...however the card itself was what I expected..the hand written penmanship was..not the best.  They leaf pendant was quite large, but the chain was then.  Don't get me wrong..my friend loved it!!"
3.0,The buckle has a larger profile than the webbing. This limits the pants with which it can be worn.
3.0,Heavier fabric than expected. Too heavy or warmer weather ... but very well made. Nice color. A little smaller than other XXLs.
3.0,"It is nice to have wireless audio in your beanie, but it is not as comfortable as I had thought, they might start to hurt after using them for a little while. The beanie itself is good quality though."
3.0,"The cap is nice, but it fits kind of loose."
3.0,Not really happy
3.0,"Perfect but it's too large, I'm putting the sticky things in it to make it fit. Love it. I dance Billy Jean and the hat is perfect!!"
3.0,"Love this blazer, but the interior button popped off immediately upon receiving the product. This will make for a nice, occasional blazer, but it will not last long."
3.0,Too thin!!! Wasn't a good quality!! But served it's purpose
3.0,"I like the skeleton mechanism, but the overall watch it's self is a bit small for my wrist, But I'll get use to it......"
3.0,"If you wear a size medium then order large. Thing is super tight, and I’m a skinny guy and it’s still tight on me."
3.0,"This dress fit well and was very flattering. I liked the design and the lace was pretty, though I don’t feel like it looked in person like it did in the picture. The fabric is an okay material, though the lace on the sleeves is not the most comfortable, as it is a bit stiff. Overall, I would say this is an okay dress."
3.0,Not what I expected...they work ok but bulky
3.0,Unless you have a small bust this dress will make you look very lopsided.
3.0,Nice hat. Well made. Kid size. And i got the larger option.
3.0,"Cute, but it’s so think that you should sell them as pajamas. It’s just like that. Comfortable for bed and super short. I got a L I am<br />5’2” 150 and it’s short, thin. Perfect for sleepy time."
3.0,"I really liked the look of this key ring, to the extent that I could overlook the fact that the back reads, 'Superman VS Batman' (got to give the Dark Knight his top-billing due, right? ;-0 ).  However I gave it only three stars because the paint is wearing off after less than two weeks of ownership.  Comparing the two rings in the attached photo, the one on the right, with the 'classic' Batman logo, is unscathed after more than three years.  I only keep a leather wallet and, occasionally, coins in the pocket with the key ring, so I don't think it's being subjected to abnormal circumstances.  My guess is that there was either insufficient or no clear-coating of the finished product with the Batman v Superman version.  I hope they might address this because I do like the design, and would repurchase a more resilient version."
3.0,The materials is nice but the sizing runs small and the opening for your head is a very tight squeeze. We had to cut the back and add a zipper just so we could get it on and off.
3.0,This shirt is made of good quality material and has good workmanship.  However it runs small in size.
3.0,"Material was not good quality.  I have worn tbis shirt once, not flattering."
3.0,Ear piece kept breaking.
3.0,The material was different than what I expected and the color faded after the first wash...
3.0,This almost made the cut for my friends wedding but the front was cut asymmetrical and I gad to return it
3.0,The quality on this chain is great but it was to samll
3.0,pretty and have not hurt my lobes.
3.0,"I love the way it looks, but it's not as durable as I would like. (sat down in the pool and now looks like I sat on velcro then ripped it off)"
3.0,Resortado en la cintura de baja calidad
3.0,"I love the necklace and the concept but I think the one we received didn’t have the right clasp and wasn’t adjustable.  It got tangled up. The godmother I gave it to love it, but ended up taking it off due the the clasp and adjusting issue, then ended up throwing it away because she couldn’t fix it."
3.0,"This dress arrived in very nice packaging, and quickly. However I ordered the dress in red and it is two different colors. Its not awful,  over all I am impressed with the dress, and its very figure flattering. To deal with the two tone shades I bought a belt to wear with it."
3.0,"This is an adorable, dainty and simple necklace I’m now wearing with t-shirts or a blouse. I even wear it to work our. Nice and understated.  BE ADVISED:  do not get this wet!  I accidentally wore it in the shower one time and it turned immediately.  I guess for that price you can't expect much more.  But overall very cute."
3.0,"I liked the style, but I wish I had read the material content. It's 85% polyester and 15% cotton, and I'm not a fan of polyester.  If there was more cotton in it, it would have been much softer and more comfortable. It's a typical hoodie from China."
3.0,"Wanted to love this, it’s pretty, comfortable, and seems a nice quality. However, the cut around the pockets is wrong and the pockets stick out. The pockets hit me a hip level, making my hips look twice the size they are. Had to return."
3.0,"So cute, but small in weird places. And big in others."
3.0,"somewhat pricey but does give you hands free when you wear it, of course it doesn't go with everything"
3.0,It is too short but I kept it for a swimsuit coverup.
3.0,"Material is very thin, comes very big"
3.0,"It was beautiful dress and had nice material. However I didnt like how it looked on my body, so I returned it."
3.0,I was somewhat disappointed that the pattern was screen printed rather than dyed into the cloth.  The ink used stank until I laundered all three bandanas.  I suggest adding a note about the screen printed pattern to the description.
3.0,"The color is nice, the material is ok & the fit is just all wrong. The top runs small, the pants huge, BUT short! I even ordered a size up(medium) I’m 5’9 & 130lbs. The pants are adjustable with the tie but the pants look like I’m waiting for a flood. If the pants were longer I could wear this with using the tie. But it’s a no go for me"
3.0,"Runs rather large. I normally wear a small, I probably need an XS or XXS if it was an option. Looks exactly as described though."
3.0,Too small. But cute shirt
3.0,Nice design but the metal has started to fade and become dull. Didn't last 6 months.
3.0,"It's pretty, but the brown rocks look like bugs. Kinda creepy"
3.0,Good pin. Looks pretty cool. Seems to be well made. Not a bad price.
3.0,Too baggy looking on me
3.0,Just didnt look good and had lines in it around the breast area.
3.0,"I bought a large, top fit well I'm 36D, the bottoms fit snug the shorts looked weird so I wore my own with it."
3.0,"thought it would be a beanie hat, it's a larger regular hat, not a beanie as advertised"
3.0,I wanted to love it bc of the color and style but the top part barely covered my breasts (34D). My breasts were showing too much side boob and cleavage and any movement and my nipples would show.
3.0,"Kind of thin so you could see my bra thru.  Other than that I liked it, but I sent it back because of the see thru."
3.0,Very cute but extremely tiny. They seem to be for a baby’s ears.
3.0,"It's okay, i use it for a key chain instead of a necklace. Just because it's big and I'm not a fan of how it hangs."
3.0,"This bra was great until one day it began to scratch my back up really badly. I don't know what happened, but very beautiful and supportive!!"
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes too big after reading reviews & boob area was still too small. Everything else fit great!
3.0,I like it a lot but the small parts that the straps attach to broke so easily. I just attached them to the zippers now.
3.0,"The quality is very good! But the size it’s too small! I’m usually medium but I went up and ordered a large, won’t still not fit me. Order like 2 sizes more, other than that it looks great"
3.0,This really is only for large faces. My daughter plays the tuba and you can’t read it because of how oversized it is.
3.0,"I purchased this product for my fiance for Valentine's day.  When I gave it to him he was thrilled with the style and loved the length of both items.  Not to long ago on both the necklace and bracelet the links have broken off which he was able to fix, but dont know how much longer it will last.  Just an fyi he doesn't have a job that requires manual labor."
3.0,"Didn't like the fabric, felt a little cheap."
3.0,"I love this dress and wore it for Halloween. I'm about a size 10-14 depending on the brand. I did notice that it was snug in my chest area and almost see through because it was stretched. I'm a 38D and bought a ""L""; it fit perfectly everywhere except my chest and my bra was visible because of the stretching and I had to wear a sweater over the top."
3.0,"Good fit, but the dots leave impressions I can feel during my shift which hurt sometimes."
3.0,"I'm 5'7, a 38 DDD, and about 200lbs. I bought 2 with high-hopes, but  after trying them on I knew I was going  to return them. I'm usually a size 16 in everything, and I knew they ran small, so I ordered a 3x. The length barely reached my ankles and seamed both too tight and too loose. These would definitely look nice on someone smaller."
3.0,I liked the style but its somewhat big for my 2 years kid and he is not keeping it. Quality is OK
3.0,Nice material but waist band is really small for size
3.0,2nd time having to return due to damage
3.0,"Way too big. Ordered the smallest size for my soon to be born son. Got it today, it fits my 2 year old. Did receive it sooner than predicted."
3.0,Works well but a bit floppy in the back. I guess it's needed to accommodate all hair lengths.
3.0,"El artículo especifica que no se enrolla. Y desafortunadamente, si se enrolla."
3.0,"It may be the larger sizes, but the top is too thick and did not flatter a cleavage situation if you catch my drift."
3.0,Is nice but I haven’t had a chance to wear it’s too cold.
3.0,"touch screen does not work at all , coworker also bought these gloves and same issue.  they are warm.  i wouldn't consider them work gloves cause they thick and soft."
3.0,Great lights alot in box not working though. For the money I spent more than happy
3.0,Really nice top for the office
3.0,Size was ok and fit was really good however zipper came broken.
3.0,Quality a little less than expected.  Useable nonetheless.  Prompt delivery.
3.0,"I bought this to wear throughout my pregnancy. The tunic would have been perfect if the front middle was not so short. It flares out too much with my growing belly. Unfortunately, I had to return it."
3.0,This is a cute shirt but i wish the sizes were acually what they are labeled as!
3.0,A lil to small
3.0,"OK for what I am wearing it for (under shirts and sweaters like an undershirt). It is not at all stretchy so even though I bought an XL it was tight (I'm a size 12). Again, no problem because I bought them to wear under clothes. The material is a bit cheap and thin. I wouldn't wear it alone for sure. The underarm holes were a bit tight, but I pulled on them to make them more comfortable and later in the day, it no longer bothered me. I'll keep these (bought two), but would not buy again."
3.0,Very delicate but too small
3.0,"if you want a basic glitter band, this is it!<br />NOTHING SPECIAL about it, and it is so flat and cheep it came in a reg envelope...<br /><br />buy if you want a one time use, glitter band,<br />:)"
3.0,"The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />I'm not lacking anything to fill it, so try to find bras without the extra padding.  I guess that's part of the 'support'.  I also think they add that to keep us from embarrassing ourselves in cool weather.  Problem is, the padding is not secured in any way.  It's like a hollow pocket with a layer of foam in there.  Once it got folded over, I can't seem to unfold it.  Can't wear it like that.<br /><br />The sizing is the real issue.  I'm not a fan of pull-over bras.  The fabric is stretchy, but without a way to adjust sizing, there's no way to adjust the way it fits.  I chose the size the chart told me to, but it's too large.  I could cinch up the straps, but it's already designed to bring the girls up and together.  I don't need a chin rest!<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a quality product if you like the style.  Getting the right size is going to be the tricky part."
3.0,Too small for size indicated online.
3.0,"Purchased this bag in fall of 2017, carried a fat laptop and textbooks for college around pretty good, shoulders hurt and you cannot really fit all that much in the bag.  Not as many pockets as i would've liked, The bottom of the bag has begun to tare open and will probably  not make it to 2020. The fabric might look good but is mostly blastic based and the base begins to crack sooner than expected. The charging port doesn't work anymore and when it did it was very slow and kinda useless. Looks cool doesn't last."
3.0,I recently purchased this shirt. The quality of the fabric is great! Its has a thick material that feels like the brand names would have but it doesnt get hot. I purchased the size based off the measurements and it was somewhat too big. It fit properly everywhere but the chest and right under the chest area (upper abs) I am not small in the chest either. (38DD) but there was still a lot of fabric. I would wear it to a casual event but nothing fancy. I recieved this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.
3.0,It's hard to get in correctly
3.0,Fabric is a little thin. Lighter colors need a slip underneath is a must....
3.0,I haven’t even tried these on yet so I’ll update later on the size and how they feel but I will say the pattern on these are so uneven. I’m not very happy how they don’t line up. I’ll show pictures in my update but it’s very noticeable and almost looks like a huge line going up the seam in the butt area. I guess I’ll see what they look like on and how they feel. Just wish it was even.
3.0,"Cute suit, fun design!  I'm 5'7&#34; and this suit had to go back because it felt a bit short in the body.  Also, while the body felt like it was the right size around horizontally, the leg holes were very tight and the cut did not flatter my behind, cutting my cheeks into 4 lobes!  I even sized up in hopes of avoiding this (cheek and length problems).  I ended up with the Cocoship one-piece retro cut suit and that one is very cute and fits more to size."
3.0,"Asked for a refund. The pink ribbon is painted on the outside of the bead, just a little disappointing."
3.0,Weird fabric. Not as described. No stretch.  Crepe/satin feel.
3.0,"They're comfortable enough but I bought them for arch support and they don't offer much at all.  They also run very large.  I consistently where a women's US 9.5 and I bought the large which is supposed to be for a 9-10 and they're very big.  They also make your feet sweat if you wear them without socks.  If you're just looking for a warm pair of slippers, they're fine."
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and I felt they were a bit long tbh. But otherwise they're fine, came right on time and arrived in good condition."
3.0,"I ordered this based off the size chart. It is so short. I'd wear it with a swim suite but as a casual dress shirt, if you have junk in the trunk it will show it all."
3.0,The fabric looks like a prom dress and the lining is shorter than the outer dress fabric.  The sizing is BIG for a small.
3.0,It fits a little snug but it’s too late to send back.
3.0,I think its a nice pendant but the size was too big for my neck.  I did get a compliment on it.
3.0,Very very very thin material. I expect it to last one or two times. Will be buying a higher quality product.
3.0,"The neckline is very high, and the fit is not very flattering. It fits fine, but I'm not likely to wear it when I want to move freely, as I don't like the collar reaching my throat."
3.0,Definitely runs small for the size. I ordered xl (boys 18) and it's more like a size L (14-16). I like the design however and my son will wear the heck out of it in the short amount of time he had before he grows out of it.
3.0,They’re pretty and the size is perfect. They kind of twist around instead of hang front ways. They’re heavier than expected.
3.0,very nice looking but to heavy
3.0,It met my expectation for the price!
3.0,Great style and color. The dress is very heavy. The material is not lightweight and is very hot.
3.0,These don’t really raise my earrings as much as I had hoped. They also twist around so they’re upside down and stick down below my earlobe.
3.0,"Once on & stretched over foot/leg, images are not recognizable. Too much white thread showing. Perhaps dye should have gone through all the fabric."
3.0,They aren't Samsung and keep coming apart
3.0,Adorable but received it unravelling
3.0,Much smaller than the pair I had before
3.0,"The dress was as advertised. It is thin but not too thin, good for summer. Just runs a bit too small. The fabric is stretchy but not enough for me to keep it as it clings not in a flattering way."
3.0,Hangs on things and bends easily. Already lost it.
3.0,"The necklace was very lightweight and complemented my dress quite nicely. The only problem is that it is very poorly made. When the necklace arrived one of the red stones already fell out, so I had to glue it back in. I left it sitting in the box for a few days until the actual event, but when I picked it up to put on, 2 more red stones had fallen and I had to glue those in. After that I had no problems, but if purchased I would make sure to check each stone to make sure it isn't loose."
3.0,"This is a cute dress, the material is very nice for it to be such an affordable dress. I gave it only 3 stars as it fits a little big around the waste and it just looks like a regular dress, doesn't really have much of a 50's vibe to it at all. I'm a size 14-16US (size 14 on the bottom, 16 on the top as I'm top heavy and have some tummy action going on). But a 14 and a pair of Spanx to smooth me out would have worked perfectly. I'm hoping my accessories and shoes will help me achieve the vintage look I'm seeking. Overall it's a nice dress, nice material, with a great bit of stretch to it.. I imagine this dress travels well too and would definintely do in a pinch when a last minute LBD is needed."
3.0,"The material was nice and sturdy however, the tabs for the belt aren't done well and one of them only had 1 tab instead of 2. Hence the rating"
3.0,"Should have ordered next size up although it is to low cut for me. Did not return, will give to someone else."
3.0,Bought these for the wife as she wears visors a lot. Not expensive and for the money they work well. Would purchase again.
3.0,"Comfortable,  but they tend to fog up quite a bit ...."
3.0,"it is a good design, great length, fits true to size and the material isn’t itchy or scratchy at all.  makes me feel good when I wear it,,, i can’t find one negative about this feminine top"
3.0,"Way too short unless you’re very young, below thirty."
3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the first pair I wore, black, as I was able to wear them with a pair of ballerina flats for hours with no slipping and no showing.  It's so much more comfortable wearing shoes with socks than without, so I was pretty happy.  The pair I put on this morning, nude color, has done nothing but slip.  I wore them with the same shoe as the previous wearing, but I can't make if from my office to my workroom without having to stop and adjust, sometimes more than once on the same trip.  Maybe the different colors fit/stay-put differently?<br /><br />I'm going to have to do trial runs in my house before wearing these anywhere since I don't have time or patience to keep pulling on my socks all day."
3.0,"I really wanted these to work out as they are super cute but the print I ordered was no squat proof. If they had been thicker, I would definitely keep these. These are soft and colorful. Felt like American sizing - medium was like a medium and I probably should have ordered a small. This medium probably would have slid down during exercise.<br />Maybe a darker color would be squat proof but this bright print was not."
3.0,"The ring is very beautiful. Unfortunately, mine came warped and several of the prongs are sticking up making it very sharp. If you are looking for a great replica for display I would say go with this ring!"
3.0,"Some tighter in the thighs than others. Great if you are slim, waist fine but tight in thighs if bigger. (Slim son loves, dad got right size for waist but tight at thigh)"
3.0,Verrrrrry cozy and warm! But.... zipper always separates when I kneel down. Very annoying.
3.0,I purchased this as a gift and am glad I took it out of the bag beforehand. I ordered a medium and it was really small. I'm considering ordering another one two sizes up.
3.0,"Really cute suit.  I am 5'4&#34;, 145lbs, 34DD.  The medium fit perfect and it makes your butt look really cute with the little skirt skimming your bottom.  The chest area actually had even more room for a bigger bust.  The straps are adjustable.  Lots of coverage with this suit.  Maybe a bit too much for me, made me feel I had a full on dress so I am returning it."
3.0,Necklace looks the same as the photo but after awhile the chain gets dirty and breaks
3.0,"Really nice socks, but after one wash the color drastically faded to a sky-blue. Could have just been my pair, but still 3 stars."
3.0,"If you like Buff, do not expect these to be the same. Much thinner. Fit is not as good nor as nice in feel. If you want cheap. This is your deal."
3.0,"The material is beautiful, not see through. I am usually a size 12. I ordered an XL so it wouldnt fit too tight. The dress fit nice and lose but the holes for my arms were very big. I ended up having to sew the dress to fit me. Apart from the size the dress was perfect."
3.0,It's quite a bit larger than I expected.
3.0,"Very cute, but right away the beads start to spread out and after two wears, it's starting to unravel."
3.0,These lenses pop in the existing rubber frames.<br />Unfortunately they do not really lock in place and can come out with slight pressure on the lens.<br />I'm not sure why they don't lock as well as the originals.<br />I really like the lenses themselves and would have rated them higher if they stayed in place.
3.0,Cute skirt but did not fit at all
3.0,The release button is way to sensitive and the buckle gets undone all the time.
3.0,"Only reason I’m giving it a 3 is because it held up by the shoulders, considering the quality was sub par. The design is also nice, otherwise I would’ve given it less stars. The stitching on one side of the body was not on the side, it was almost in the middle of your belly. People kept trying to help me “straighten” my dress. Embarrrassing!"
3.0,I liked the variety of flashing light patterns. However the Blue lights went out after 1 hour of use. They came back on after the necklace was rested for a bit.
3.0,"Puma clothes and shoes typically run slightly smaller than other brands (mediums are more fitted, larges looser but not baggy). This thermal fits larger than Puma's typical medium size. Fits more like a large or between a large and x-large."
3.0,Cute but does not run true to size.
3.0,They come out of nose very easily. it was hard for me to tighten.
3.0,"Anyone who wears a coil keyring knows after time, they stretch out and have to be replaced. Since this was a multipack, I thought it would be worth a try and even if they didn't hold up, I'd have plenty of replacements.<br /><br />The material is flat, rather than rounded like the kind from the hardware store. The patterns are small and not noticeable, but it stretched out and stayed that way after the first wear. I am a teacher and we often 'model' (demonstrate) with gesturing. I find my keys fly off my wrist with dramatic arm sweeps and I often have to wear this up to my elbow to make sure it stays put.<br /><br />I am bothered by the 'seam' which is a little rough, and I find myself twisting it's position on my skin so it doesn't rub.<br /><br />For the price, they are worth, knowing that you'll be replacing them every couple of months."
3.0,"The bag itself is sturdy and high quality, but the straps are not long enough. Barely fits over my shoulder. I decided not to return it and will use it to carry light paperwork and folders occasionaly, for interviews, taxes, etc since it looks nice. But not practical for carrying my books due to the shorter straps."
3.0,Looks more orange than pink.
3.0,Super cute but this dress was WAY too big on me. I weigh about 120lbs & it could have fit someone weighing over 150lbs. I am sadly returning it.
3.0,Runs a bit small and not for those with large boobs.  The quality wasnt great either.
3.0,I bought extra large thinking it would fit but it was very tight so I give it to my daughter who wears a size 8. Also it doesn't look nothing like the picture and the material is not good quality either.
3.0,"nice enough, as is as described, shipped quickly"
3.0,"I liked the idea of receiving 48 pairs of earrings for such a low price. I figured I'd be getting a variety of inexpensive, cute earrings that would best be used for dress up or for a teenager. I was correct in that assumption. The earrings are pretty and there are a wide variety of styles to try on, but of course they won't be mistaken for anything ""real"" or expensive. I'm happy with that, this is what I was aiming for with the price.<br /><br />The problem with these earrings is that they say they are hypoallergenic but only the stud is made of stainless steel. For some that might be good enough, but having the rest of the earring not made of hypoallergenic metal means that something you're allergic to will be pressed against your skin all day. I wanted to give these earrings a shot, but it turns out that making the stud alone stainless steel is rather pointless. I started to have a reaction within a few hours.<br /><br />For someone without allergies, this could be a fun set to play with or a nice gift for a youngster, but if you have allergies, stay away!"
3.0,"I bought it for Halloween, which is about all it is good for.  The color of the straw is not uniform - there are some really dark portions.  It is tiny, it fits my head (barely!) and it just kind of perches on top of my husband's head.  Ok for a woman or a child, definitely would not fit anyone with a larger head.  I'm glad it was so cheap and that I am using it for Halloween only, otherwise I would be so disappointed."
3.0,Good fit. Surprisingly nice fabric
3.0,Con: these rings are barely embossed. You cannot see the word “Love” on the outside of the band. I attached a picture with the embossed side facing the camera.<br />Pro: These rings are sized very well. That is the ONLY reason they received a rating of three stars from me.
3.0,Only one pair came...
3.0,Kind of a poor quality of material...  The designs and print aren't nearly as cute as in person compared to the pictures.
3.0,Thin fabric but good fit
3.0,"The material is good and perfect for a sweater dress.  But if you got hips/curves, the zipper fits oddly......sticks out right between the thighs."
3.0,This dress is very okay. It is about as good as you would expect for such an inexpensive price. The fabric is not very breathable and I only got a couple of wears out of it before the colors ran and the fabric pilled. This dress was cute the first time I wore it but I would not recommend it for summer because my sweating ruined it
3.0,"Super cute design, but the material is not thick enough to hide underwear color. Maybe best worn without or with a skirt or dress"
3.0,Looked kinda cheap. Not for me.
3.0,"I thought these were dyed beads, but they are really only covered with resin. I am still going to use them, but I will need to be mindful of the color wearing off."
3.0,For the money you can't beat it. Just took a long time to get here.
3.0,"The overalls were very cute but the fit was a little small around the hips.  I ordered a large because previous reviews said they ran small, but I could have gotten an extra large.  But all in all, they were as expected and very good quality."
3.0,"Fits smaller than expected, I am so thankful that I ordered larger than what I needed."
3.0,Okay not nothing great
3.0,This shirt is a lot thinner than I was expecting. The shirt is see through and paper thin. There were a few strings hanging off the seams of the shirt.
3.0,"I have a larger chest so I ordered the XL, which according to the sizing chart said it would fit me. What showed up was far from XL. The cups were really small and offered no coverage for anything above *maybe* a D cup. Still, the material seemed nice so if you have a smaller chest then it might be for you."
3.0,Cute but bulky
3.0,Extremely thin fabric...not sure how long this would last.  After a few trips I will review it again
3.0,The bee necklace is adorable and well made but sadly it won't work for my needs. It's just too small width wise. I took a few pictures to try and show the problem. It will hold a ring but any movement and the ring will slip through the narrow bee wings and fall off. I'll be returning and trying something else. :(
3.0,The shirts run small so get the next size up. I had to send a 10 back to get a 12.
3.0,It's a great dress but I wish it wasn't see through. I don't feel comfortable wearing it
3.0,"Although its strong, and beautiful,  I wish the edges were rounded a smidge more around the length around your wrist. Its not that its really sharp (like at all) i just it was a little more rounded, sometimes it feels uncomfortable."
3.0,I liked the product for the price but ran extremely small.
3.0,"Gift for a friend & they said the bust is too big. Otherwise, the rest of it fits well & looks nice. Length is also pretty good"
3.0,Great material and comfy but didn’t seem true to size . A bit smaller than expected
3.0,Cute but ALOT smaller than it looks in the picture.
3.0,I like the rosary!! But the beads looked more like pearls!!! My friend said she loved it!! I just wish the beads were a little smaller!!!<br />Thanks Michael!!!
3.0,"It’s that soft, light, clingy knit fabric that highlights every bump and lump— and not in a good way. I also don’t think it would last for very many washes. Back it goes."
3.0,"The collar wouldn’t lie flat, unfortunately."
3.0,I use it as a shirt.
3.0,I gave these as a gift. They are super cute but a couple stitches were not straight and unfinished so I had to fix that. Material is ok but cheap.
3.0,"Very cute but the sewing/stitching was crooked everywhere and noticeable. Snagged strings were hanging in a few places. The green was pretty in person. If the stiching wasn't so obvious, I would've kept it for the price."
3.0,"This belt looks nice - and has a nice double keeper, but for the price it's nothing special.  It's not a great deal, but it's not a bad deal either. A true test of a belt is time.  I'll update this review after I've worn the belt for a while.  I got the black one and I wear it with a suit, 4-5 days a week.  It looks nice, but there are a lot of belts at or near this price point so you have a lot of other choices.  This is a dress belt with good styling, and the keeper looks better than depicted in the picture."
3.0,Fits alittle small
3.0,More like a rose than a wine
3.0,Needs it
3.0,They are quite nice just a bit smaller than expected.
3.0,I got this because it was on a lightning deal and i should have payed more attention to the reviews as the dress stitching is not so great and my dress arrived with what appears to be a deodorant stain on the front. Not really impressed and pretty disappointed
3.0,"I thought they’d be three-dimensional, but they’re flat."
3.0,"This is a gift for my granddaughter.  It looked okay on arrival, but I haven't given it to her yet,"
3.0,Love the glasses and the case it cane with but the lense keeps popping out.
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the product, I just have big feet and felt like I was walking around in clown shoes. Ended up return them.. :("
3.0,"Set is neat, but mine did come with a dent.  They all hold a lot.  I found I took too much with me and regretted bringing the largest only because I could have bought the medium and been fine"
3.0,"The concept of these shoes is cute BUT, the insole is already separating from the shoe and the lips on Snow White were misprinted on one shoe. Also, the strap is hard for a kid to fasten themselves. It’s a plastic button. Thankfully my daughter is 3 and didn’t mind. She loves the shoes and at the price, I’ll take a few imperfections."
3.0,Very reasonable for the money!
3.0,Well constructed but very lightweight.
3.0,Really cute but the hooks are on backwards. I should be able to fix but shouldn't have to.
3.0,These are super cute and the perfect length. But one of the plastic ones was defective and the sides of the bar are not smooth (see photos)
3.0,Grandson wanted it for Christmas
3.0,I will buy these again!!! Perfect is what I originally thought! After wearing for 2 hours the seam came out! I love them so I will repair myself since I know how to sew but very embarrassing!!!
3.0,"Gorgeous dress, better quality than I expected for a cheap wedding dress. Runs EXTREMELY tight, I would go up at least two sizes when ordering. I would have re-ordered to try again but I found another dress I fell in love with."
3.0,"Loved the style and look of the boots,  but they sent the wrong size."
3.0,"The plain rings turned green maybe a day after I started wearing them. I love the leaf ring, and i wear it everyday but it did turn my finger green but the rose gold colour it turns isn't a terrible look."
3.0,"Solar is likely long lasting and reliable but for nearly $90, this is a poor design.  The lum is poor, no screw down crown, no rotating bezel...its a C+ design and I returned it.  The worst thing is its very hard to read the time.  That said if they addressed those issues and gave it a better face, I would pay $100."
3.0,"These are comfortable. The support is not great but better than nothing. It’s too bad that you can’t throw them in the wash. After many days/weeks of wearing them, they begin to smell, as slippers do when you don’t wear socks with them. I’ve sprayed them and aired them out which only helped minimally and didn’t last.<br /><br />I recommend finding a pair that can go in the washing machine."
3.0,Heavy shirt. Large is too small for a muscular build. Consider ordering a size up.
3.0,"Looks ok (might return) but was covered in lint and two of the buttons were covered in something, so they aren't white anymore like in the picture."
3.0,"I'm usually a large, I ordered a small and this thing is wayyy oversized. I could see the potential but since there's no smaller size, I'll pass."
3.0,"The jacket and hat were great, we ordered a size larger in the jacket per other reviews and it fit perfectly. The gloves were very poorly made however, we ended up having to cut a few of them to make them even because they weren’t. Overall, the value was great for the price and we made the gloves work."
3.0,"Pants fit well, only reason for the 3 star rating is because they aren't the same pants as depicted."
3.0,Minnie mask broke during one wear
3.0,They don’t fit true to size. I should’ve sized up by a half. I’m upset that I didn’t and the style I selected are now out of stock. Oh well.<br /><br />Returning....
3.0,Just wasn’t an attractive fit on me. It might look more attractive on a taller/fuller figured person.
3.0,"They aren’t fluffy, that’s for sure lol. However despite them being plu leather I find them very comfy and love that they’re able to fit my own skinny wrist. Easy to put on and adjust. They’re also easy to unclip from, if the need arises."
3.0,I wanted these for T shirts but they fall right off. They’re just too small and quite heavy. So heavy I can’t imagine them working on a light scarf.
3.0,Kinda big on my husband hands But they’re good
3.0,It’s really cute but my baby must have really chunky legs because the bottoms didn’t fit and looked more like a swim diaper than swim trunks. Still cute though.
3.0,"It still works as a face mask, it's just thinner and lighter than I would prefer. This causes the pattern to be difficult to see and almost pointless."
3.0,Great product but not supportive of larger bust.
3.0,got this and only a month later had a few stones fall out of it.
3.0,At first They seem small but once you put them on your finger it works. I just wish they had these in silver too
3.0,"It’s cheap, you can tell by looking at it. The pattern seems pixelated but it’s too comfy to mind"
3.0,This is a beautiful dress but it was too small. I would suggest to order one or two size up.
3.0,Very nice but metal prices kept falling apart.. Good value though!
3.0,okay product
3.0,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. I am impressed with the quality , however won’t know until after the holidays if it fits my wife"
3.0,I don't like the little cheap zipper n size a lil off
3.0,"These was very cute for a Candy Land theme reading night at our school. However, they were extremely heavy. And on my way home from the first night wearing them one of them fell apart."
3.0,"Colors were nice but runs small,  tight around the belly, clings to belly. Buy a size up if you don’t want it tight around your mid section"
3.0,Very thin material. Not soft. Cheaply made. Wore it one time. Don’t like it
3.0,"Not as comfortable as I hoped they were. I still wear them but they are not my favorite. The waistband is a little snug and just not comfortable. The material seems nice and soft. They are a slimmer tighter fit, in the waist, hips and butt. I am a plus size curvy woman and usually can wear a size XXL with some extra room in the waist and these are not like that. I went by the size chart and and these were just a bit on the snug side (I have lost 18 lbs since getting these and I still don't really care for them). I would say the ""loose fit"" description is misleading and I would say loose fit legs. loose fit to me implies overall they fit loosely and that is not the case. I received them free for my review and I would not pay $26.98 for them. They are probably perfect for a less curvy person, but not for this curvy woman."
3.0,It’s not warm enough only cheap towel inside but quite long. Considering buy another brand to compare
3.0,"the lower isnt good,"
3.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, based on the other reviews. Unfortunately, even though I am 5'6&#34;, and weight 127lbs, the dress was a little too big for me, specially on the sleeves (see pics attached). Also, the other reviews were right, it's ok if you are going to wear it with a scarf, because the neckline shows the real quality of the dress (see pic). I ended up returning it."
3.0,"The top works, fits as expected. However, I don't like to wear it because it looks like medical &#34;scrubs.&#34;"
3.0,"So so.  They are narrow,  more like the size for a child.  The orange rubber ear grips slide off way too easily."
3.0,Purchased these hoping for good results but as this is the first time I purchased compression sock<br />I wasn't sure what I would get. I happy to say the fit and worked great!! I liked them so much<br />I bought them again.<br />UNFORTUNATELY the second order was not the same. The socks seemed to be a larger size.<br />They would not stay up and the compression was not as strong as the first ones. quality control<br />seems to be poor. won't be buying these again
3.0,I was really looking forward to this dress. The fit is great. I am typically a 14/16. I ordered an xxl. My rating is lowered due to the sheerness of the dress. I would highly recommend a black dress slip.
3.0,"Everything is good, but after using it for a few days the headset doesnt want to charge. Now its stuck at very low battery and after 5 minutes it dies."
3.0,"Beautiful dress and colors,  how sad that it was too small. I've ordered similar dresses in the same size,  but this was cut smaller.  I had to return it.<br />I do love wrap dresses and it's so nice with this because it looks like a wrap,  but it's not!  No flashing people!"
3.0,I noticed a small mark  on the heel
3.0,IF you want to look and see like Scott Summers(Cyclops) . It changes everything red.
3.0,"Love the socks, unfortunately one of them came with the seam unsewn. Very disappointed. Otherwise the socks are great."
3.0,It’s cute but it keeps unraveling
3.0,"It was a beautiful dress , but for me one was just too tight and the next size too big. The dress has these built in hip area along the outer edge of the dress and they didn't fall into the area of my hips.<br />I'm sure if they had the dress in petite I would have kept the dress."
3.0,Pretty dress but runs very very very small
3.0,Came with a little tear/hole at/near/on the waist band. I am not going through the hassle of sending it back as it does the job but one would expect it to be completely right when you receive it. Packaging was way too big for product/small package. It keeps me warm though.
3.0,It's not a bad dress but the skirt is not as loose as the image shows. I was hoping for a flowing kinda twirl around dress but it's not that so kinda bummed about that and all
3.0,Size is perfect. It’s more like satin pants not real Corduroy. Was disappointed about that.
3.0,"So glad I ordered a size up. I am 5'3"" and 140 lbs. The large fits great not too tight or baggy. Don't bend over though it comes just below the cheeks."
3.0,"The hole to attach to my daughter's guitar was way too small, as a result it didn't fit.  We have a leather punch so had to widen the hole for it to work.  That was a little disappointing but we were able to make it work."
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the fabric is a little chintzy. It works for what I need it for."
3.0,I have to find out yet until i wash it if will stretch after the laundry.
3.0,"Good price, but the padding is in sections, and the sections didn’t position padding where I needed it. I removed some sections of the padding and sewed it where I needed it. A lot of work, but now these work well for me. Too bad it’s not just one big padded section!"
3.0,Elegant design that goes with dresses and leggings. Material is durable but stitches are a bit showy. It lives up to its description. It is comfortable for prolonged use  and the straps have breathable design.The outer sole a good grip and gives enough friction while walking on the polished surface.The strap material gathers dirt much quicker and little difficult to clean.
3.0,Did not fit right so boohoohoo and I hater sending thing back cause things dont come with return stickies
3.0,"It looks cheap, also it is bigger than it seems like on the photo"
3.0,"I have been buying these type of &#34;princess&#34; socks for my daughter for awhile. The is the first time that we got this pack and we prbley won't again while all the other one all lasted a long time. The Fiona, and two Asian ladies are lower quaily than the others. The girl in yellow had a hole before the end of the first day.<br />I will continue to get these:<br /> https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01658QK40/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />They are still going strong after a year and an trip to Disney World."
3.0,The robe is adorable and a nice quality. The only thing that threw me off was that it smelled like basement/mildew. I planned on washing it anyway but still off putting.
3.0,"I took a chance on this fitting me but it didn’t flatter me at all, but I knew it would be a long shot.  I like the color and the features of the laces on the sleeves.  If it were longer I might have worn it.  Life got too busy and I didn’t get it returned.  It might be something I would still wear to dress as a pirate for giving out candy to strangers but I got it to wear as a pirate playing in a school musical pit and it would have been too ill fitting to be professional."
3.0,"The shirt was beautiful but too snug around and under the bust line, was way too tight around the midriff. Had to return it."
3.0,They were hard to put on due to limited stretch but they got the job done!
3.0,"I think the clip part, is too big, which makes them look a little cheesy.  Overall, these are just OK."
3.0,"I actually really love the fit, but the material is as thin as a t shirt with no lining"
3.0,"Honestly this charm is much cuter than I expected. Its a very cute addition to my purse! I rated this 3/5 stars simply because after only a few months on my purse, 2 of the 3 leather 'flowers' fell out of the metal chain. I super glued them back in and they still look the same and haven't fallen out again since. I will say that when the flowers fell out, they stayed in one piece in the same shape so they were easy to glue back in. Overall, I think they are worth buying because they are very cute, just keep in mind you may have to do some repair work in the future."
3.0,Not bad. They run small. Go next size up.
3.0,"Overall I like the design. The lacking is in the crown detail, the Rebel Alliance's insignia was a good intention but I don't like that it is covered in plastic nor that the logo is red over black, that combination doesn't go with the rest of the color palette. Also, no lume? and the chrono subdials are not saying anything, although I understand and support the minimalism... its still a chrono and its a function. The rest is fine. The ENGRAVED CASEBACK is pretty cool! The bracelet is nice and the watch feels heavy and of good quality."
3.0,"I ordered Large, which normally is loose fit, but this shirt in Large is snug, so it's not as comfy and I get too warm with it clinging to skin."
3.0,pants way to long and very big in the waist
3.0,I agree with the other review.  The colors on the sun and moon are so pale and there is little contrast. So the details aren’t visible.also the sun is bigger than the picture appears. So it’s hard to see the blue around it.<br />Overall they are cute but they are far from perfect.
3.0,Big enough to clean all my watches!
3.0,This is a pocket book not a shoe. Not sure the questions when giving a review on this one. It fits my Iphone 5 with a waterproof case (looks like a lifeproof case) on it.  It fits other items as well. It's not too heavy when you use the soldier strap. The wristlet doesn't work for me.  It gets too heavy and awkward.
3.0,Super cute but it was just shorter than I realized
3.0,They run a little large for my size 6.
3.0,On behalf of the big n tall men I would not recommend unless your belly n chest is flat fyi 🤧
3.0,They are definitely cute! But I will say this the clip hurts your finger cause it is kind of hard to open! :o
3.0,Ordered a maroon to comply with school uniform colors however the jacket was more of a purple/plum in color
3.0,"Shirt is fine but the graphic print is ""low resolution"" in quality."
3.0,Falls apart at the seams at first wash.
3.0,"I didn’t like the fabric, so I returned them."
3.0,"Definitely snug, but I have big boobs"
3.0,Nice hat too small sent back for exchange
3.0,It is really thin/see through so you will need to wear a tank under it.  There are bare seams that you can't see in the Pic. Cute top! Want looking for something to layer though.
3.0,The rhinestone blue looked more grey then blue to me!
3.0,I found these shirts to be if high quality but very itchy.
3.0,A bit tight on s curvey calf!
3.0,Fit smaller than what the tag stated<br />Wore once and then my daughter said it was too tight (mostly length wise) for her
3.0,"Love the color (orange), it is as in the photo. I can live with the material (polyester like back in the day Poly with a sister named Ester), not see thru and NO stretch. Runs 2 sizes too small (I'm usually a med when I  want huggable fit and lg when I want space). I bought an XL due to reviews and it hugs my body but should have gotten an XXL cuz I didn't want it to hug too much, wanted a lil loose."
3.0,"Its fine, I knew it was an inexpensive watch, but I wear it daily!"
3.0,Nice shirt but the medium is too big
3.0,"Could have been a bit more full and flowing, but overall a nice skirt ."
3.0,"This shirt is so cute! Fabric is perfect and very comfortable. Color is exactly as pictured. However, the sizing is very off! I normally wear a medium but occasionally order larges. I ordered 2 of these in different colors. BOTH were large hoping it would big flowy like pictured. 1 of them fits perfectly as expected, but the other is about 2 inches shorter than the other and much less skinnier. Not what a normal large would be considered. Same shirt, same size, just different colors. Disappointed I will have to return the one too small!"
3.0,It is a very cute dress but it just wasn’t fitted the way it is shown. It was a lot looser than expected and the front hem dips way further down than the back. Since I am short it kind of falls to an unflattering length. I had to cut the tiny lining inside the dress out because it made it uncomfortable and the nylon was rather warm u Dee a summer dress.
3.0,"If it were not for the fact that there are no lace eyelets at the top; only hooks. And the tongue sliding down to the side of your foot when you walk but only on one of the boots, it would be 5 stars"
3.0,I have had this band for a month & a half  (delivered 5/2/21) & it now has white patches where the silver has come off. I didn’t wear it daily as I have a selection of bands that I rotate through but it was a go to because it was comfortable and the color was great with my aluminum case.
3.0,"Nice fabric, BUT not as long as pictured on model.  Short at Waist length."
3.0,"The back is noticeably  a different color than all the rest of the skeleton. Runs small, by 1 size .  Hoping to just paint over the back with white fabric paint."
3.0,"First of all clothing is always very hard to review ...  what one person likes and another person likes can be two completely different.  So, right up front this jacket didn't work for me personally.  Others might like it.  am 6' 2"" tall, 240+ pounds (with a belly), 66 years young.  Normally 2XL is the size I wear, however the 2XL that is made in China is often way too small, this is the case with this  shacket (Shirt Jacket).  It just didn't fit me at all.  Sleeves are too short and it is way too tight.  So, putting aside style for a minute, this shacket runs small for US sizing.<br /><br />Next,  as a Vine reviewer when it comes to clothing I always get my wife's input before writing a review ...  she has 3 ratings:  1) Likes it and approves okay to wear this in front of her, 2) It's okay (but not her first choice), and 3) Laughs at me out of control saing she hates it, return it.  On the wife scale we got a  (3) first because of the size being way too small, and second, she thought the design was very basic and lacking.<br /><br />Third, the material is cotton & linen ... I am sure this will shrink in the dryer ...<br /><br />On the more positive side:  The model in the picture is wearing this shacket the correct way.  We (wife & I) agreed that if I was in my forties again, and didn't have the belly, and if it fit, this would be an okay shacket to wear open (not buttoned) as a second layer.<br /><br />So, as stated before clothes are hard to review.  This shacket didn't work for me, but, might work okay for others.  Body type is key, and how you plan on wearing it is key."
3.0,Dress is cute but tight in bust and sleeves. Fabric was nice and dress would pack well.
3.0,It's actually much more white than beige.  It doesn't look as pretty in person as it does in the picture :(
3.0,"It's cute, but huge. No way it could fit a newborn."
3.0,"Gorgeous skirt but it didn't fit. Had to return it. It's a perfect skirt for someone with tiny waistline, since the size of hip doesn't matter."
3.0,I thought it was sweater material and it's not.
3.0,"the fabric is very nice and not irritating.  The zipper was a problem, but it has snaps and frankly it should just have had snaps. the snaps is why I am keeping it as that will do the job of keeping the cape closed.  If I di not have to cut the bottom of the zipper open I would have given it five stars.  The snaps have made it useful despite the zipper flaw."
3.0,"I ordered a size 5 for my 10 year old and they are more like 7s.  Unless you're buying these for a costume, they are completely impractical.  Just too much in the way of laces.  Young kids don't do the best job tying their shoes and these take a lot of time to cinch up."
3.0,"This dress fits as I would expect.  I usually wear a medium in boutique type dresses and it fit great!  The material is really cheap (not shocked because of the price point) and almost feels like a parachute material.  Colors are great, and I will be keeping tonwear with leggings and booties for fall."
3.0,This rfid wallet is fine.  I wish it had a snap to keep it closed
3.0,"Comfortable but the arch support could be pushed back one to one and half inch back. I recommend one step down size because the g-string could also be moved 1 inch back. Looks durable, not too soft or too hard for plantar fisciitis or other feet ailments.<br /><br />Arch support should be little bit higher too.<br /><br />Goods<br />-Durable feel<br />-Comfortable<br />-Textured inner sole gives massage feel when walking<br />-Good value<br /><br />Bads<br />-One size too long<br />-Not enough arch support<br />-G-string could be one inch back towards the heel direction?<br /><br />Overall, it's decent for the price"
3.0,I'm used to a thicker ankle sock.  These socks are okay so far but they are fairly thin and you have to really stretch them to reach your ankles.  I use them for tennis and prefer heavier socks.
3.0,"This product is great. It fits well (clingy fabric). However, even though it was packaged in a plastic bag, it R.E.A.K.E.D. of fish the second I got it. I have washed it twice, and I still smell fish when I wear it. Maybe after another wash or two it will be fine? Just terrible."
3.0,Smaller than what the picture shows
3.0,"The bottoms are fine, but the top definitely is too short and runs smaller than the size given, and I expected it to fit better since I sized up, but no luck."
3.0,They hurt my feet and ankles I gave them to my shop foreman. They look real nice and fair price but not for me.
3.0,"I really love the style of this dress. It's very flattering on and even though it's vintage style the zipper down the front gives it a more modern feel.<br /><br />That being said, that material on the bottom of this dress is terrible and definitely has that cheap feel. It's fine for the price but I wouldn't purchase this if you're looking for a high quality product. As a result, the bottom was very wrinkly when it came in the mail also."
3.0,"I like them. Thought they would be a little smaller, but oh well."
3.0,The product looks as it is advertised. However it runs slightly small. You make considering one size up.
3.0,Straps too long
3.0,"Way too tight in the front, almost unbearable."
3.0,Costume watch
3.0,It's a big body hat
3.0,The sleeves are very tight other wise the blouse fit perfectly I will have to have the sleeves removed in order to wear it my arms are not heavy
3.0,"Fuller skirt than expected. Too long for someone 5' 2&#34; shortening is a project because of material.<br /> Zipper hard to zip when gets to waistband, on or off. With some work it will suffice as costume."
3.0,"Wish there was an Xsmall option, worked out great as an ugly Christmas dress, but the small was still a bit too big!"
3.0,Too small.  Not a stretchy material
3.0,I like them because the length is what I was looking for and have a hard time finding at this price point. Ships from China so if you are in a hurry these take time to arrive. Not the highest manufacturing quality.
3.0,These are a bit &#34;plastic-y&#34;  I doubt if they will last long.  They do fit over my glasses - but the one thing I find problematic with any of these type - becasue they are sitting on top of another pair of glasses - the sun does shine down from the top and into my eyes.  If I'm just sitting still someplace - or in the car - they are fine.  But wearing them in the yard to do gardening (which is what I really needed them for) - I just can't wear them because I feel blinded by the sun coming down from the top .
3.0,Comfortable gloves. Good quality. But no way they are -20. At 40° my fingers get cold.
3.0,"These are well crafted briefs. However, for my waist size I have an athletic rear, which causes pressure in other areas that make them uncomfortable for me."
3.0,"Would not even go around my head, super tight, no stretch."
3.0,"The skirt fits me well and is super cute! It was true to size, actually may have been a bit bigger than I expected. However, the bottom is not hemmed and the material is very thin. I don't think this will be a big deal for me though - I like it!"
3.0,They are just ok. A little too large.
3.0,This dress didn't fit. My girl has a bigger top.<br />So we could not get it zippered up<br />There is no stretch forgiveness<br />And the color is not vibrant Yell it is more dull pale. Which really prompted the return<br />It is heavy and really long
3.0,just ok for the price.  String is too weak so I had to change it.  Pendent itself is good
3.0,"I thought these might have a little more zip and bling, but you can't really tell there is a star hanging."
3.0,Was not red
3.0,"To small, item was not used. I had to give them to a smaller child. Total waist of money."
3.0,LOVE MY WALLET!  I call it my adult-ing wallet since it is a proper wallet. :)  I love the color and I love that it is my new favorite super heroine.  It has nice bright color and is shimmery which is also nice.  I wish Spider-gwen was more distinguashable from the background but that is only cause like a true hipster I want to show off how in the know I am about the marvel universe with all my accessories ;)<br /><br />I was worried that this wouldn't be able to actually hold credit cards cash and a little change and still be able to close as I have had that problem with similar style wallets I am glad to say it can hold enough cash for a nice night out and all my credit cards for day to day business.  It has been a great addition.  I just wish  I had a purse to match now!<br /><br />----UPDATE-----<br />The design began to crack and rub off a bit and began to appear more silvery.  I ended up replacing it with a different spider-gwen wallet that I have had for a two years now.
3.0,i do love these hoodies but they are a bit small..bought them for my bf and i and they fit the same on both of us even though they’re different sizes. both larges
3.0,"Cheap quality, belt began to unravel after the first use. Seller asks you to contact them if you’re unhappy with their product. I emailed them on August 25,2021 and I have yet to hear back from them!<br /><br />Update: seller contacted me and offered a full refund, I’m giving them 3 stars now"
3.0,Not as it is in the advertisement
3.0,"These earrings are cute for fun and young occasions. They dangle nicely. The metal is strong, however they are made with blue and small, white plastic beads, not with 'crystal' as the description says. As such, they have a cheaper look to them and were not the quality I expected. I returned them."
3.0,"The sizing runs a little on the small size, but the length is very long, which makes the scrunching on the bottom even more bulky. They did not look good on me as a result."
3.0,"The shsprr fits as expected, but it rolls ip st the bottom. The rods stuck in my back"
3.0,"It probably is real but I know the one I had years ago would scare horses, dogs or most any animal with common sense. The one I had was fresh and had to be rubbed with oil, a little bit once a month or so. I tried this on my dog and he paid no attention to it at all."
3.0,To small  they have been returned
3.0,Pretty lightweight & tie was very flimsy.
3.0,"I wore this maybe 5 times, and the back of it broke off, I am not so happy with it, but what do you expect for a cheap price, the jewelry itself was beautiful, but it broke when I wore it only a few times after getting it and I did not really wear it very long each time."
3.0,"Beautiful bag, great quality leather.  Not the most functional.  Much too deep so everything just drops to the bottom.  Zipper opening is not that long so you can't get a good look inside if you need something quickly - spend a lot of time fumbling around for needed items.  Probably a good bag if all you carry is a wallet, keys and cell phone as there are pockets for cells and a key keeper."
3.0,"They look good & fit ok, BUT they are too thin (vertically).  I can see daylight above & below the glasses.  Also, I can see the reflection of my own eye.  They also don't transition quickly at all.  They do, but it's slow.  The polarization works well though.  I won't be wearing them anymore."
3.0,I should have gotten a bigger size.
3.0,"The pants look of good quality they just run very small, i ordered a size bigger than what my husband wears and they where still to small"
3.0,the access to cards is a bit cumbersome - I use the clip for the cc I use most vs cash.
3.0,not very good quality. it looks cheap.
3.0,I'm 5'10 and 165 lbs. I bought a large. It was loose on me but way too short. It was like a large tshirt. I had to wear a skirt underneath. I'm thinking of taking it in to a tailor to have it cinch it so it has a tighter fit as well.
3.0,This outfit is so cute! I wish that u could pick what size top an bottom you need. The top was HUGE! I got a large because I knew that my butt would be to big for a medium bottom. On a more positive not all thought the top is big it didn’t fall down.
3.0,"The bracelet arrived in good time.  However, upon arrival, the bracelet I received looked entirely different from the picture.  It was tarnished to the point of being black overall, showing nothing of the pattern. As I removed the tarnish, the pattern became visible and is the same as presented except the bracelet appears the same color overall, not highlighting the distinctive pattern."
3.0,"The wig cap was immensely showing. and the bangs were only like a part of the front, not even the full thing. Also, if you part it to the side it was supposed to go there were little chunks of hairs that were third of the size of the bags sticking out."
3.0,"Why is the design only on one side of the mug?? And on the opposite side I drink from, so I can't see it as I sip my coffee. Life is good for a lefty! Haha The yellow color is pretty. Nice wide mouth, good size for tea or coffee."
3.0,"They are fine, but I can’t get them to stay on my ankle. They keep coming untied. Would like to know what to do differently to keep them on."
3.0,This would have been a really good watch but the owner's manual is not good at all. The watch is complicated to operate and its all because the instructions are not clear. Also the watch takes two batteries. I don't like to good bad ratings but I decided to give it three stars. I am learning to operate this watch on my own because the instructions are absolutely no help at all.
3.0,These shoes feel nice but they are half-to-one size too large.
3.0,The dial is very small and hard to read
3.0,Dress isn’t fitted all the way down. Wider at bottom due to fit. I’d recommend ordering a couple sizes down if you want a fitted look all the way down. Unfortunately my return window was close bout time I found this out.
3.0,They’re so much thinner than I expected and it’s a screw back with a long post. This makes them spin constantly on my ears. I wish the design itself was a bit thicker. If you can get past how thin they are then these are perfect for you.
3.0,One of the bracelets is plasic. The rest feel “real” I like the other ones that are not plastic.
3.0,"Thinner than expected and is slightly too long for the average wrist, however I do like the feel of the fabric on my skin and am pleased I am no longer contacting metal. It has a warm feel but is still comfortable. The sraps are weak and i assume would break under any significant wear. I would say this watch is suitable for a desk worker."
3.0,"The quality of the main portions(vest and pants) seem to be fairly well made and fit pretty well. The accessory portions are minimally adjustable and don’t fit properly on compared to the rest of the costume. The quiver if you do plan on putting arrows inside of it could use some rigidity to maintain the shape and the straps are also non adjusting pvc pipe would do the trick if you need it too. The mask would do in a pinch but looks sloppily made if anyone gets close enough for a good look. Overall not bad for the money if you are a new Cosplayer and can make the adjustments for a better fit, feel and look. I’ll be modifying it for my purposes."
3.0,"I love this necklace.  It adds that pop of color often needed in my black-gray-white wardrobe.  However be advised that the red color does come off on the skin and will transfer to clothing.  I may try a coating of clear sealer rather than<br />consign this piece to the ""dress-up"" bucket."
3.0,Looked and worked great but broke after 6 months.
3.0,"It's a fine milanses loop band, but doesn't include the pins, so I reused my old ones."
3.0,"Cute but they run small, I usually wear a large but I got an xl to be safe & they are still a bit small"
3.0,The only issue is that there is no way to keep the top part from falling off of the ear. No sort of cuff to hold it in place
3.0,Definitely runs small. My son is 6 years old weighs about 44 pounds and it was snug. Unable to return in time or there were no other size alternatives. A bit disappointed but still wore snug to school for Dr. Seuss pj day.
3.0,"These have weight problems, even with special backing. They either need to be for a double pierce, or have the one point moved to help with the weight distribution."
3.0,"Product is as described, but is very bulky.  I would prefer a stretch material."
3.0,bottoms a bit small
3.0,Good really small beautiful piece I sold it to someone they loved it
3.0,I bought these to help reduce glare from oncoming headlights...pretty good sun glasses but not all that great for night time driving.
3.0,"I am fairly small and always wear  a size small shirt. I do not have a large head. I could not slip the shirt over my head; I had to move the buttons.  I had to resew all buttons, because they were sewn on too tightly."
3.0,"This product I ordered was 42C in gray. I received a 42D in white and the design doesn't even look like this picture. The label attached to the bra from the manufacturer says 42D white, but over the top of that was a sticker from either the seller or Amazon that said 42C gray. It's so obvious it's laughable. Sorry, I forgot to take a picture to post. The fit was a bit large of course but the fabric wasn't scratchy and it had decent support. I'll save for days when I feel bloated."
3.0,I ordered large & the cup size was A/B cup.
3.0,It's very light.
3.0,"This dress has no lining so it is completely see through.  It doesn’t fit well.  Tight in some spots, loose in others."
3.0,"I got this faux velvet dress for my daughter.  She is 9 and wears a 10/12, she is tall.  I bought this in 9/10 and it seems to run a bit big.  I got the yellow, which as you can see in the pics it is a golden yellow.  Since the fabric has a shine to it the yellow color does flex and inside is just a flat color.  The wrists have a slight flare.  The arms are too short on her, comes a few inches above wrist.  There is a plastic button to close the neck, for the price should have been a nicer button. When she pulls the sleeves up the elastic around the wrist is exposed and is scratchy.  For the price that should have been finished.  It is kind of a heavy fabric, so there is weight to it.  She didnt have a complaint about that. Very elegant looking dress despite some flaws."
3.0,I sized up in this dress and it fit well. Cute for the price for a formal event.
3.0,Belt is little small & too short
3.0,Kinda flimsy and too big for my arm.
3.0,Polishing cloths are hard to use on jewelry that is detailed.  This one works as well as any I have used.
3.0,"These do not reach my 5'10&#34; wife's thighs, they stop at the kneecap. Quality was okay, but obviously not high-end. She ended up giving them to our young daughter who is ecstatic about socks that are longer than her legs/arms"
3.0,"i think the top was a good fit and color, I returned it because it was too short for me."
3.0,Cute but scratch easy
3.0,"It's fine, but I hoped it would be a bit heavier.  This is a very fine (thin) chain."
3.0,"The dragon us way to big for my ears.  The seller shipped this item right on time.  Just didn't fit :(  I didn't  wanna chance bending it, and it breaking..."
3.0,see no difference.  and no explanation what is the small glass without the handle is for?
3.0,"It's a cute piece but the quality isn't that great, it runs a little big. If you have small breast this isn't for you. Breast area runs big. The snap between the breast that holds the piece together is very flimsy. It may last for one use but I don't thing it will hold up to a wash in the machine."
3.0,Cubic Zirconia is much smaller than I thought.  It may have been my fault do not remember if size was stated in listing but it's very small....  Other than that charm is nice
3.0,We ordered per the size chart and the shirt had to be altered.  Other than that it was as expected.
3.0,"It got lint all over my baby load of laundry. It does feel like an absorbent towel though and it is large. I like it because it's a cute panda hood, but I don't know if it was worth all of this lint..."
3.0,product may or may not work..too soon to tell. a bit tight on my wrist..should have gotten larger size..nice look to it..
3.0,"Like the glasses but now there’s some scratches on it. Plus, my eyes hurt if I wear it for a long time compared to when I don’t wear anything at all, isn’t it weird?"
3.0,Smaller than I expected and not that impressive. Price is right I guess
3.0,It was really thin and really short. May wear for a beach cover up.
3.0,"Color (pink) is lovely. Unfortunately the top is very tight, ignore the size chart. Bottom fits as described. Returning it."
3.0,The straps need to be longer. But the material is soft and it seems to be well-made.
3.0,This dress is nice. However the sizing is a tad bit off. If I had gone up one size on the recommended fit it would have been great. Had to give it away.  The material is not jeans or jeans like.  It is a soft shiny fabric that will work to dress up your look at nights.
3.0,It was nice but too tight for my husband. Had to return it.
3.0,size is smaller than indicated
3.0,"These are rather firm in arch support. Not cushy or comfy for house shoes, but do support well. The interior material seems to wear quickly, and outside seams an odd material. Kind of a woven wool feel."
3.0,"My wife loved this watch from first view so I purchased it for Mothers Day as a gift.  She loves Ginger Snaps and this was another method of using and displaying her Ginger Snaps so she was very happy to receive it.  It is pretty, but the clasp hook is on the wrong end of the bracelet for a right handed person to clip.  She spent minutes the first morning trying to understand the correct method for attaching the bracelet when I finally stepped in and clipped it with difficulty.  The clasp spring is strong enough to cause pressure discomfort if you don't get it attached quickly.  She accidentally allowed the watch crystal to impact something, possibly while she was washing her hands, and the crystal cracked and allowed moisture inside the watch face.  All is not lost, because I intend to move the clasp to the other side and solder the connections when complete.  This might help her get some additional use out of it.  Day 4 of use edit: The watch did not come with any instructions or text on the back of the watch so we don't know for certain if it has a battery or if it must be wound.  The watch stopped running and turning the stem while pushed into the watch does not appear to wind the watch. At this point, we are dead in the water."
3.0,I bought these to match a cross necklace... It matches but are very small.
3.0,Nice necklace have not worn it yet but hope to real soon
3.0,"Wanted a big mushy bag, but mis-judged the measurements supplied.  Cute bag but too small for me."
3.0,"Cute hat, but it didn’t end up fitting- even though I got the largest size, they should have more sizes"
3.0,Nice boot. They ran about a half a size smaller. They were somewhat comfortable .
3.0,Black leather looks cheap but i have worn it a couple of times nonetheless.  Would not recommend.
3.0,"Teeny tiny, barely there"
3.0,this shirt is way too big order 2 sizes smaller. it's also very long
3.0,"This isn't a bad bra, but be warned, the edges curl up slightly upon just the first wear. So I can only imagine that will get worse over time. Also, it's not shown clearly, but this bra doesn't just feature a mesh detail in the center, the whole bra has mesh covering it. Also, the center doesn't press firmly to my sternum, and I doubt it would no matter what size I ordered, as the wire just doesn't feel sturdy enough to stand up to big boobs.<br /><br />The good? It fits and is comfortable. It'll be a good comfy bra, but it doesn't look how I expected, nor does it feel like $57 worth of bra. I've gotten sturdier feeling bras with better material and details for cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad bra, I won't be returning it, but I won't be purchasing again either."
3.0,Incredibly cute!  The band is a little short for the intended recipient; however my granddaughter loves it!
3.0,They like to led like they belong need to a child so did work well for an adult
3.0,A little bulky- bigger than I expected
3.0,I like the pattern. It is not a thick and a bit too stretchy. Its cute maybe for a one time use. I bought this for my wedding anniversary. Cute pattern at least.  A bit shorter then I would like.
3.0,Just did'nt look that great on.
3.0,"The fabric is good: lightweight , beautiful, and breathable. But the mask gets even more stretchy while worn and does  not stay on. Bummer."
3.0,"The shirt is cute, but not what I was expecting. It isn’t a cotton “t-shirt” type material. It is a weird stretchy material. The “bleach” spots are only in the front of the shirt. Also, they aren’t really bleach spots they are like printed on the shirt. I returned it."
3.0,Concept is great but they are hard to figure out. And somehow I have alarms going off all the time and can't figure out how to turn them off.
3.0,I went with the size recommendations and should have ordered down a size.  Fine for yoga but not as much support as I would like for higher impact classes.
3.0,This did not fit the fossil watch it was described as a substitute for. Quality was good. Real leather.
3.0,"I was excited to find another source for screw-back clip-ons since I don't have pierced ears.  I think these are for people with long earlobes because the ""U"" is a full 1/4 inch longer than other brands.  Just be aware that people will definitely know it's a clip-on.  Also the snowflakes are pretty, but not a shiny silver as pictured."
3.0,Shoe looks good. Fits good. Did not last a week. There’s a big hole in the top now. Material is awful.
3.0,"Should have read through the QA because the buttons on this don't actually button.  They are just for decoration.<br /><br />Other than that, looks ok.  It just should have been more obvious in the description.  The buttons were easy enough to remove with a little seam ripper and it actually looks nicer without them.<br /><br />The dress came inside out, which was just weird.  Maybe it was a returned item??  I wash everything from China anyway, but I've never had clothes come inside out before.  I have low expectations for cheap clothing from Amazon or it would have gotten a lower rating."
3.0,The material is like a tent material or like a cheap tablecloth. Cute print but terrible material
3.0,I'm a 34c in bra and  30&#34; under the bust with 28&#34; waist and 38&#34; hip. Got this set in a size small. Top fit perfectly. Bottoms way too small.
3.0,"My wife loved it but she broke it beating me up, was a beautiful bracelet"
3.0,Way too big for my kid who wears 4T
3.0,enormous will never wear these leggings. I'm probably a size 4 the quality seems fine.
3.0,I've had 6 pairs of these socks. Each individual sock from each pair (12 in total) developed holes in the balls of the feet in under 12 months.  I did wear them more or less every day rotating between the pairs and that is why they wore out evenly.  These were worn with a rotation of 3 different pairs of shoes so I don't see how the holes can be attributed to anything other than product deficiency.<br /><br />On a positive note they were very comfortable and held their color and felt nice and thick until the very end.
3.0,For a L is still pretty small if you're looking for loose fit. Also neckline is high and short. Not long near hips. More near waist.
3.0,"Does the job, especially if you need it for one night only. But the button doesn’t work to turn on and off. So if you take the tab out, keep it to put it back in! Overall worked just fine, no way to pin it on (I’m a performer using it for a costume) definitely a get what you pay for type scenario. Mostly just bummed I couldn’t turn it off and on as needed."
3.0,It was larger than I originally expected but it has an  attachment that i frequently use
3.0,"This belt is super thick nylon. I'd trust it with my life if it were a seatbelt. I would hang from it off of a cliff. It's built well and extremely sturdy. Time will tell if it frays or otherwise wears, but so far it looks very well built. The buckle is strong and sturdy (and took a minute to figure out). Looks very nice for the price.<br />That said, the teeth in the buckle need to be sharper or the nylon less tightly woven so that they grip more, because as I move around during the day, I find that the teeth slip and my belt comes looser than I'd like. That said, I like a tight fitting belt to gird up my loins. Not too pleased with the slippage, but it's holding up well after about a month of daily use."
3.0,"I recently started ordering size 11(s) in running shoes, so I ordered these in 11 as well.<br />The length of the shoe is ok, but it is very narrow for such a chunky shoe.  Have had a hard time breaking them in."
3.0,"So, I actually really love this romper. After I ordered it I was really worried it would be too small after reading more reviews, but it fit perfect!! For reference: I'm 5'6&#34;, size 18, about 215lbs, 38C, apple shape and I ordered a &#34;US 10/Asian XL&#34;. The top opening was juuuuuust big enough for me to slip it on (but I'm not really very hippy, so I imagine it might be a tight squeeze for those who are hippier), and once it was up over my shoulders it was like it was made for me- except when I turned to look at the back, I saw that the butt area was totally sticking out, lol!! It looked like I had a giant poopy in my pants, lol! And I'm not talking about the sides- I knew those were going to stick out- I'm talking about the back/butt area- it reeeally was horrible, lol. It was really sad because I liked that the fabric felt cool, even if it isn't necessarily soft or stretchy. It was really wrinkled, and I have no idea if it would smooth out once ironed. But I liked the way it felt and fit, except for the back, so it's getting returned. I did order a backup from a different company- &#34;Love In Women's Solid Color Ladies Spaghetti Strap Loose Fit Harem Jumper&#34; to help those of you looking around for this style. The Love In one fits awesome, is soft and stretchy, and no poopy butt, lol!! ;)"
3.0,The material is thin. Dress runs a few sizes small. The color was perfect. The bow added a bit of flare and spunk to the dress.
3.0,"The fit is great but the material is weak. I have worn it twice and already have picks of fabric all over the dress. It's infuriating. It's as if anything touches the fabric, it automatically gets a pick in it. I don't see this dress lasting long which is sad because it's really pretty, just not great quality."
3.0,"it is see through but I figured I could wear a slip if I like it enough. The design is very boxy, the shoulder straps are very wide, and its a bit short, so I felt it was not flattering on me. I'm sending it back."
3.0,Not great for cold weather but good for warm weather
3.0,"Fuzz bells in the first week, otherwise warm and does the job I bought it for."
3.0,"They're cheap-feeling glasses, but for the price, what can you expect? Be careful as the shaded part scratches off easily"
3.0,Folds up so it can be crammed into luggage. Zipper is backwards. Cheap Chinese jacket.
3.0,"The quality of these lounge pants is very good, very soft, very good colors and super inseam length. The waist tie is wide so it will be difficult to lose it inside the pants - this is a plus. In my opinion, they do not quite fit to size, based on other lounge pants that I have from other manufacturers of 2XL. You may want to order the next size larger than your regular size."
3.0,"Get a smaller size, it was far to big for me"
3.0,Good product but oversized for my taste.
3.0,"Pros: nice material, good length (3-4&#34; above ankle just like in the picture, I'm 5'2 Asian), cute design, plenty flare to move around or run unlike other tight skirts.<br />Cons: One of the buttons came off on the first day, and it was a snap-type one that cannot be sown back on. Amazon exchanged it, but the new one had too small button holes and threads coming out here and there. It was disappointing because all the other features listed in pros are really good."
3.0,A little thinner than I expected but functional. Not sure how long they will last.
3.0,they are soft comfy however my husband cant wear them because they are to small for him he is a 3xl and I wear his shirts they are comfy and lose on me however when I wear these I put it on its loose on top and really tight on bottom at the waist. I am giving 3 stars because the size isn't the correct size it states order what you normally wear well he is a 3xl and these are clearly more of a large they looked like a 3xl until you go to put it on and it isn't going on.
3.0,"Very pretty, pants fit just right, the top is too small"
3.0,"They run on the larger size, but workable. I got the dark green and they got fuzz balls all over, but the mint green ones my daughter bought, did not. I'll probably buy another pair or 2, in different colors. If someone is looking for lightweight tho, these would not qualify as they are quite thick and warm. Great for winter! Overall, pretty good 👍"
3.0,The quality of the shaper tanks are nice but once they were washed and dried they shrunk up very badly and were way too short. Perhaps if you air dry them or dry them on delicate heat setting you may have a different outcome. I really liked the material and how they initially fit so I gave this 3 stars. If you can figure out how to get them not to shrink they would be a 5 star product.
3.0,It fits in a way that is not reflected by the pictures.
3.0,"Love the fabric and embroidery. Once it was washed it became too short, I'm 5'7&#34;. I even hung it out to dry. Otherwise I love it."
3.0,"Cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. It is noticeably a tardis. If that's what you're going for, it works out."
3.0,"That is really well made, soft, and warm. There is a lot empty space in the top part of the hat, which can make your child’s head look huge."
3.0,Thick fabric. Dies the job by not blowing around in the wind. Will require some ironing after it is washed.
3.0,"the clasp is not hinged, so you have to actually bend the ring each time you put it on.  I don't foresee this lasting very long before it kinks and breaks."
3.0,The bands shorter than I expected
3.0,Good looking ring but you get what you pay for. This ring is very thin and bends easily. My wife has bent it twice in the week she’s been wearing it.
3.0,"pretty little bag, but could just as easily use a plastic bag."
3.0,Fits well but a bit itchy at the collar because the inside material isn’t as soft.
3.0,"Very comfortable! Basically it’s good for show, non medical use little to no virus protection!! Fast shipping, beautiful pattern on scarf!!"
3.0,These are not like the picture. Picture is washed out and foggy. Came in cute plastic box though...
3.0,"These were SOOOO close... But unfortunately the waist started to fall down during my run and by the end, my underwear was in full sight... they were comfortable, the material seemed sturdy, colors were rich (didn't turn white when stretched out) and breathed well...I just don't like them coming down that far... If you have an ""average"" butt or more...these probably aren't going to work for you."
3.0,"Everything on the dress fits well except at the hips. It looks as if there's supposed to be pockets, or they made the dress for hippy women, which I am not."
3.0,Cute but had more gold in them than I would have wanted
3.0,The design of this clip was pretty however it does not lay flat on the hair side as it does in the picture.  The ends actually kicks up and it not flat
3.0,"It’s ok, the print looks cheap. I got the dark green one. It fits weird if you have big boobs."
3.0,NO COMMENTS.
3.0,"These ear cuffs are difficult to adjust and fall of easily, while the design is very appealing and the color palette is pretty, the overall function levels more to desire lost almost one side of every pair by now."
3.0,"Quality good for price..good looking.  Fit is off a bit, loose..trying to find insert to help with that."
3.0,Really good for light-duty work I personally unload tractor trailer and in less than one day I burnt a hole in the fingertips I was going to ask for my money back cuz they are some really nice feeling gloves and not really made for the type of work I'm doing mechanic work Maybe
3.0,Somewhat thicker material then I expected for a beach hat which is what I was looking for
3.0,Although more beautiful in person they did not fit my piercing as expected and within a month the plated metal was so discolored it was a major concern so I am unable to use them.
3.0,"Somw came and were stretchy, wouldnt fit over my foot - had to give them to my 10 year old.<br />The rest fit and stretched perfectly."
3.0,The top ball is very small
3.0,look pretty cheesy
3.0,"The shirt was fine but the shorts were huge, could fit an adult male not a kid. My stepson loves the shirt though so that made it worth it."
3.0,It is a little cheap looking.  You get what you pay for...
3.0,"Unfortunately, this was not what I expected. I ended up returning it because it was too small. I ordered a M - I'm 5,4, 135 lbs. You have to put it on by pulling it over your head, and I could barely get it over my torso (and I'm not large chested). Getting it off was even more entertaining. The skirt is longer than expected, too."
3.0,Great shirt for the price. Good value.
3.0,"I only wear 3 out of the 8 necklaces, because some of them are too itchy for me to wear, but I also have sensitive skin. They're worth it for the price you pay. I can't complain. Plus, I get compliments every time I wear them."
3.0,Pretty shirt but clingy. I'm a size 12 and had to exchange the L for an XL. Even then it was clingy. The material is thin so it's definitely for layering. Wish it had been sturdier/less clingy.
3.0,"This mask is gorgeous, and a wonderful political statement.  I get compliments every where I go with it.  BUT it is large, with nothing to keep it close to your face at the nose.  So I fog up easily (glasses) and I have to constantly pull it down as it creeps up my face.  I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I can't."
3.0,"This is the third time I’ve bought the same purse because I love its size and design, not too big, not too small, and buttery soft. I can even fit my 9.7” iPad into it, but...<br />Unfortunately, the fabric lining is extremely thin and of poor quality. I use it for maybe a month or two and then the lining breaks. If you don’t overstuff it, it’s a terrific purse for the value!"
3.0,The material they make this out of feels a bit rough. I bought this as a xtra sleeve/layer of protection for my glasses that I keep in a aluminum case. My only worry is that the material reminds me of the green brillow pads and it could scuff up the lens.
3.0,The “HoHoHo” is backwards.
3.0,"Super cute but I was hoping it would be super soft and fluffy.. it’s ok, kind of flat and rough.. but I like it still.. probably wouldn’t order this jacket again though"
3.0,"Nice color way, build quality is excellent but it’s just a little too big for a front pocket wallet IMO"
3.0,I ordered Green but received Black
3.0,The rainbow design came stuck together. Pulling it apart caused some imperfections.
3.0,A bit large. Makes my feet black. Lightweight. Cheaply made.
3.0,"The first day i got it, one of the zippers broke off.  It's super pretty, but the sewing is poorly done; lots of loose threads near the zipper.  Not a ton of room if you need to use it to store your devices to travel.  My tablet, phone, and chargers make the middle a tight squeeze.  Spend an extra $20 on something a little roomier and higher quality."
3.0,Runs short and is not true to size. You should definitely buy 2 sizes up if possible. Other than that the material felt nice and it looked really stylish.......might just keep it as a goal to work towards lol
3.0,"I was hoping for the usual sweat shirt cotton type material, it's more solid/sheer? still pretty but not that flattering on me."
3.0,I loved the set so much that I wanted to buy more but after few washes they stitches around my thighs ripped😭😭
3.0,"The material was very rigid and had no give/stretch whatsoever, wasn't all that comfortable."
3.0,Love the look of it but Product not true to size. Wish I could exchange.
3.0,"The product is nice and meets my expectations as to quality. I was disappointed when my order arrived and the stones had all fallen off of one of the necklaces. I had to glue them back on myself. It's a small thing, but I paid for a product that should have been ready to wear."
3.0,Nice colors and comfortable. Not all of them appear to be of the same quality.
3.0,Cute and comfortable.  Fit is just right.  I’m 5’5 and 136lbs and got the medium.  Only 3 starts because I got it in pink and it’s near see through. Will only be able to wear this at home unfortunately.<br /><br />Update: I did decide to wear it out on vacation and it was so short (basically underwear) and as I mentioned thin I ended up feeling super uncomfortable so I bought a sweatshirt to put around my waist to cover up. Should have taken my own advice and just kept it to wear in the house.
3.0,a little bulkier than I expected but does the job! Now I can take a spin class without worrying about being sore
3.0,The dress is very nice and flattering just a little big need to order small next time I ordered medium
3.0,I was expecting a visibly red bead. These are actually more the color of a very dark garnet.
3.0,"Darn.  I wanted to like this dress.  It has potential, but fell short for me.  The top portion, well it’s smoking hot.  It is cut on a curve into the waistband, so it looks a little odd to me.  The skirt had all kinds of no going on for me.  First, the pockets.  Man, why?  I purchased another dress with pockets and you don’t even notice they are there.  With this dress, they definitely stick out.  I don’t need any extra poof added to my hips, thank you.  I was also hoping there would be a little more flare for the plaid skirt.  As I said, it has the potential to be really cute.  I wouldn’t mind trying another pattern to see if the pockets are just as bad with another fabric, because darn, it was close. And the way the lines fell, not even centered correctly, it just looked weird.  Accentuated areas I would rather not draw attention to.  Maybe this just applies to the plaid dress, as I said the top was nice."
3.0,"Great for the price, they are a little cheap looking, but for the price its to be expected. I got two different colors and they are different sizes. I haven't worn the black one yet because it's too big, I was just going to poke another hole so I can wear it."
3.0,Look thicker than it is. The cost not suitable for the winter
3.0,"I like the look and variety, but this product did not last long at all."
3.0,Would have loved it if it didn’t arrive with a tear on the side of dress.
3.0,"The bad was small, didn't fit with cased iPad"
3.0,"Th se pants fit as expected. The fabric is a little on the thin side which didn't help hide my cellulite, which is a bummer cause they would've been great workout pants."
3.0,The pattern was more for a lady to wear. I purchased for a man.
3.0,Runs small. Returned.
3.0,Shirt fit like a unisex top. It was fitted but smaller than a t shirt. The collar and length of the top were a little awkward.
3.0,u get what u pay for i guess. I will wear sparingnly as indont thing it will stand d test of time as well. The matte finish is not perfect.
3.0,"These would have worked just fine for my purposes, if they'd arrived on time. They're a bit tight, and distort my face uncomfortably, but I suspect they'd stretch out after a while."
3.0,Came fast but very cheap. Some of them came already broken . But for the most part there cute for a night out and you want to give your look a pop of gold .
3.0,Cute dress but the breast part is too loose. It didn't cover my breast. Would not recommend this unless you have a D cup.
3.0,Shows a keychain in the pics and didn’t come with one other wise the hat was ok
3.0,"A little snug in the upper arms. I am 5'4&#34;, 205 pounds and the XX-Large fits fine other than it's a little more snug than I like in the upper arms. It's very  pretty but feels a little too 'dressy' for the office. I wear it there anyway to help keep the chill off. Doesn't work with anything that has sleeves though."
3.0,"Based off the picture I was assuming it will be good material for a cheap price. But I was wrong, pretty much you’ll pay for what you get. Shirt is cute but the material is really thin and see through."
3.0,"The fit is nice, the material if soft, but the spacing of the mesh can be itchy; especially if you shave."
3.0,I didn't think it would be that sheer
3.0,"If it was a little larger in the bust I would love it, To bad it is one-size or I would return it for a larger size."
3.0,This jewelry holder is nice but it is too big to work with a small clasps on a bracelet.  It works ok on the larger clasps.
3.0,You cant beat two sunglasses for the price.. there are two different designs so make sure u are picking right design.. in pictures its not very clear.. one set has more rectangular lens and other has square.. fog issues are there.. overall good for occasional use
3.0,was not a good fit for me. Felt like I was leaning forward.
3.0,Design on material is nice but Material is cheap
3.0,Took a while to arrive.  Not packaged as advertised &#34;Stompeez&#34;.... was in a plastic baggie which looked too &#34;cheap&#34; to wrap up as a gift.  Looked too much like a regift for me to give wrapped in birthday wrapping.  Gave to the child just as a little something extra.... did not fill my desire for something that looked like a nicely presented birthday gift!  Also bought 2 other pairs of Stompeez from another seller... they arrived boxed in the profession Stompeez package as seen on TV (which is what you are led to believe you are getting).  I was &#34;OK&#34; with the product (sizing runs a little small though.... but thats ok)...  but not the packaging at all :(
3.0,"Would love to have been able to keep, but way too small."
3.0,not durable
3.0,"Looks decent, but does not fit my 6' adult male head. I will have to adjust to make it work. They could have made it better if the straps were longer or if they were just attached closer to the edge of the back of the mask."
3.0,"These are light weight amd do their job, but I expected better value/quality from this brand.  I got these for my son. My daughter and I both have sunglasses from this brand on other styles and we love them.  They feel and look expensive.  These, however, feel like Walmart sunglasses.  The brand is good but this particular style is lacking."
3.0,Size is smaller than compared to other shoes for 12 months baby. Looks cheap too
3.0,"It was cheap and it arrived quickly, easy to get on and off."
3.0,This dress is super comfy but hasn’t held up well. After wearing it 4-5 times it has pills and little fuzzies on it.
3.0,They were a bit difficult to install onto my watch
3.0,Won’t stay hooked which is surprising
3.0,"The straps felt like they were cutting into my skin, and the cleavage area wasn't as I requested. THE DRESS WAS BEAUTIFUL  THOUGH."
3.0,"Really cute, but they break easily"
3.0,Cute shirt but the back looks different from the picture and the bow isn't the same color :-)
3.0,"Rather disappointed with this hat. there is a &#34;skirt&#34; around the base of the &#34;hair&#34; that has no hair on it.  This section is about 2&#34;, and is visible when worn. The beard doesn't stay up, and buttons that hold it on are too big, making it hard to separate beard from the hat. I was able to create a new set of button holes by wiggling my finger into the knitted yarn, and so was able to fix the problems with the beard to a small degree. Having said all that, My son loves it, and enjoys wearing it around... Lots of laughs."
3.0,"I love the fit of this dress, my only complaint is that the skirt was sewn on backwards so that the seams go right down the middle on the front of the dress. Luckily the dress can we worn in reverse as well, but I preferred the lower cut neckline to be the front side."
3.0,"The construction is good with a nice length of cord to tie once you get it on, if you can get it on. My testicles are large in size so they would not fit, and the suit length not long enough to fit my manhood inside either. I was able to find someone locally that modified this with extra fabric making the opening wider while adding 5 more inches to the suits length. Now it does fit perfectly!!!"
3.0,I love the fit they're the perfect length. However the pink one lost it's seam the 1st time I washed it. Not returning because I like the white one and it's probably easier to sew it myself
3.0,Sweater was very soft and comfortable but did not look like picture.  Mine was pink with white stripes instead of mostly white with pink the pink stripes like I wanted.
3.0,Hard to get on.  I still like them but may try the next size.  Someone told me to try baby powder inside and I will try that.
3.0,"These earrings look like the picture but I did expect them to have a bit of sparkle.  Mostly they just look like clear glass to me, which they aren't of course.  They are light weight and comfortable to wear, just nothing special to look at.  They were inexpensive so I won't be returning them, but wouldn't order again."
3.0,Difficult to see. Not what i expected....
3.0,"This sweater is not like what is pictured.  It's a very thick, heavyweight sweater that does not flow like the model shows.  But, it's winter and it's a thick, heavy sweater which is always needed.  Unfortunately, this was small on me and I ordered my normal size.  It's made of 100% acrylic, and I don't know what that is, but it's very itchy for me and not cozy.  And weirdly, the size tag was sewn on the outside of my sweater on one of the shoulder areas.  I'm sure it can be cut off but it's also in a seam and I would worry about that causing issues.  I'd recommend ordering a size up and planning on wearing a shirt underneath with this sweater."
3.0,Loved both of my dresses but they got “pulley’s” after i washed it
3.0,"I returned product. Very uncomfortable. I do prefer smaller items, I purchased this as a protective case for hunting but it was too bulky to be able to wear coat and gloves."
3.0,Paint quality is a bit poor .Clear coating should have been applied to protect the paint from easily being peeled off.
3.0,The thongs were too long.  I had to shortened them on my sewing machine.
3.0,"This hat isn't washable, so unfortunately it's a limited time use thing. It looks nice while it lasts!"
3.0,"This coat is for woman with a thin built.the chest is to tight ,the waste is to tight and the arms.but the coat is very nice,to bad it did not fit.and the color red is very nice.boy do I want a red coat.LOL"
3.0,"This sweater dress went down way farther than in the picture. It was almost touching my knees. I'm 5'2 and 103 lbs. It doesn't fit well if you're a small person even if you order the smallest size. Wonderful material, incredibly soft, and just a touch see through, but if you're small it's really not going to work."
3.0,"i want to love this hat but it came folded over many times and i am not sure if the folds will ever straighten it. It states it foldable BUT, you don't want to walk around with the folds still in there after weeks of wearing. If i cannot get them out i might have to send back. I am getting pretty disappointed with some of the merchandise I've been getting from Amazon.<br />On a good note, the color is nice and it fits perfectly. i have short hair and it fits well. i would say it will fit a small/med head"
3.0,"One of the earrings lost its  some of it stones with in 24 hours,  I'm disappointed That I have to limit how i wear them"
3.0,Really useless as you can’t see through the bag to see what is inside.
3.0,"It was loose on me. Either the material is not elastic enough, or should come in different sizes. I like the quality of the material though. Very soft and keeps you cool."
3.0,Disappointed that the newborn I got these for can't wear them until next year. If her mom remembers she has them. Oh well
3.0,"Stones were beautiful.  The mounting was silver and looked nice on the ears.  Made  nice presentation.  But the clasp were so small it was very difficult to hold them to secure them to the earrings,  I lost one of the earrings the first time  I wore them.  Sent them back looking for better mounting."
3.0,loved the double shirt idea but it is a little thick and ran somewhat small
3.0,"Cute, but the slide up my foot."
3.0,"Really pretty plugs, but be warned the sizing is different. Ordered the half inch and they were too small, ordered the next size up and they were too big. Just kept the smaller ones and holes shrunk to fit."
3.0,"I got a size small, it was too small (I wear a size 2-6) I ended up giving it to my 15 year old daughter...she's a size 0!"
3.0,"Super thin and kind of scratchy.<br />Neck is too wide.<br />Armpits are big.<br />Cheap materials, but looks cute.<br />Overall wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,I'm happy with but i ecpected a little bit more quallity. The watch has a great look but you get what you pay. For now I'm satisfied with.
3.0,I love these peepers - have ordered them previously. I ordered a 2.25 strength this time (order clearly says 2.25) and I was sent a 2.50. Am keeping them because I do not feel like going through the trouble of returning them and will save them until my eyes get worse.
3.0,"It’s comfy, but a bit baggy (the medium was a bit too snug though). The biggest issue is that I ordered dark green, and it’s a decidedly bluish teal. It’s not at all green. Very disappointed with that because I really wanted a green dress for Christmas events."
3.0,"Too small for my five year old. Nice and soft fabric, but can’t use them."
3.0,"i'm really sad that mine doesn't look like the photo, it's not cut from the same piece of cloth so the flowers don't look the same and the colors are inconsistent. i guess for the price i can always just order a couple more to see if i get one with placement i like. also it will probably fall apart in the wash but would be a darling outfit for a one-time sort of thing. maybe easter."
3.0,"Well made. Good quality. But it smells awful! I hope I can get the smell out before it's worn. Got it hanging outside right now. If that doesn't work, I'll try fabric sheets in a cool dryer."
3.0,A little larger than I thought it would be.  Very bright and colorful.
3.0,"Pretty dress, but fits tight in the chest area. I bought at 2x and the top pressed against my breast something terrible. Couldn't wear it. Body Stats: 215, 5' 8&#34;, 40DD"
3.0,"I bought this to sttetch a new pair of boots. Have used it 3 times on the same boots, so it's definitely not a good product. I brought a different one in the past and once was enough."
3.0,"I love these boots, but unfortunately, they were too small.  I have several pairs of Naot Matai Koru shoes, and, based on the similar style, I assumed the Chi Koru boots would fit similar to the Matai shoes.  So I ordered my usual size 38.  Unfortunately, the boots were much tighter: difficult to put on, and once they were on, they were painfully tight on my feet.  The overall length (heel to toe) was the same as the Matai shoes, but the boots felt too narrow, and the toe-box was not high enough.  Unfortunately I had to return them.  The size 38 was so tight, I'm not sure whether to try a size 39 or 40 because, even if they fit the width and height of my feet, I'm afraid they would be too long."
3.0,"This is not the dress pictured, rather a cheaper “copy” of it. The fabric is sheerer, and no adjustable straps as pictured.<br />I’d  contacted seller prior to ordering, for size recommendation. I am appx 5’8” 142lbs 35-27-37. I normally wear M. Seller advised XL, which was a correct recommendation. The dress is a sheer, chiffon fabric, as opposed to the thicker non-see thru fabric advertised. . It is lined, but lining is too short for dress.  I may extend the lining, wear a laced bottom 1/2 slip, or white yoga shorts underneath. I like the sleeves and embroidery, but the missing adjustable strap they show, would have been helpful. The Grecian tasseled belt is a nice touch, however, it is not the thick white rope belt shown, but a skinny cheaper rope tassel belt. Even still, once ironed, looking forward to wearing in summer with sandals, both high heeled and flats. I feel like I need a crown of flowers to wear with it...I just might! If they’d honestly displayed “this” dress instead of a different, higher quality  one, in ad, I would have given 4-5 stars."
3.0,"Lenses popped out, popped them back in;  Not sure they will still work. We will see and I will update he review. It occurred after three uses.<br />Ok...I bought two pair, one each for both my kiddos...the strap just broke after using for the second vacation."
3.0,It is cute but very thin and little. Would not buy it again
3.0,Loved it while it lasted.  It slipped from my hands and shattered on the bathroom floor.  So sad....
3.0,The length is ok but the width is too big
3.0,Really short - but nice fabric.
3.0,Thought it would be a hat to be worn in colder temp
3.0,Love it but it pokes me in the belly.
3.0,Engraving is waaayyyy too tiny!
3.0,"Looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size, but the material feels cheap. It’s cute and everything, but if you want something that looks and feels more authentic- you’ll be disappointed."
3.0,"I thought the charm with the initial was going to be much larger than it actually is, but because the two were bought for an 7&8 yr old I decided to keep them. I do love the chain and would have loved if it came in a gift box instead of jewelry bag."
3.0,Cute dress but it’s longer than expected
3.0,"The dial color is not as displayed, pure white, in the posted image. The actual dial color is off dirty white. Also, the cover glass is not flat but has rounded edge. The watch outlook is dull."
3.0,I hoped these would be super cool but just average and the quality does not feel superior to any $20 sunglasses you can get elsewhere. Returned
3.0,"I have not worn the hat and am sending it  back.  I was hoping the brim would be wide enough to block the sun, but it is not.  That said, the fleece lining and ear warmers would make this a good hat to keep your head warm."
3.0,Very big on my 8 and a half month old
3.0,Smaller than I thought it would be and uncomfortable.
3.0,I gave four stars because the color is a bit off. My daughter loves purple but dislikes pink. And these are definitely more pink(I bought the alexa color).  I also thought they would be a little padded because of the picture and hoped the straps were adjustable but they are not.  Other than that they are fine for the price. Although they maybe run slightly large but not enough to matter much.<br /><br />**Edited to add: Changed rating to 3 stars. After washing these a few times they completly unravel. The unraveling wraps around her washed clothing and I have to spend 10 mins unraveling every time I wash them. The pink lace also dyed my daughters skin pink so we tossed that one. Now I'm back on Amazon looking to pay a bit more for something that doesn't destroy our clothing in the wash and is a little more sturdy. Not sure they are worth it.
3.0,The fit was good I just wasn’t a fan of the material. It looked cheap to me...maybe if it didn’t have the collar line.
3.0,It stinks! it has that awful plastic smell.. even after washing it three times the smell is still noticeable.
3.0,"Unfortunately within the first wear, it easily got snags and pulls on barely anything it touched. After a couple wears, there were not just snags and pulls on the fabric but also holes.<br />I loved how thin it is and the feel of the fabric is soft and silky. Unfortunately those are also it's downfalls."
3.0,The center piece came out .I no longer wear it.
3.0,I like everything about these except for the fact that they don't pad the front. Which is the point of wearing them.
3.0,"I'm not sure why the chest part of the dress is so poorly constructed. If you have a small chest, it may be too loose on you at the top. The back is gorgeous though. The dress with drag on the floor if you're 5'3 under. Otherwise, it may be flood on you if you're 5'7 and over...especially with heels."
3.0,Fabric is good. The buttons looked cheap but you can just replace them. I returned it though just because of the fit doesn’t flatter my body shape. I would recommend it.
3.0,"I purchased 4-5T for my 4 year old, it looks like it's gonna be really soon she will grow out of it.  Its really cute, I just wished it was a bit bigger so that she could wear it longer."
3.0,just oversized
3.0,"I love this little thing, but the quality leave a little something to be desired. Fabric came apart at the seam. Would give 5 stars but it wears quickly with wear"
3.0,"It was almost exactly what I was looking for to go underneath my traditional kimono: BUT: going by my bust size, as I generally have to do, I ended up with an XXL. So big. So very big. There was no white collar on the garment. This meant trying to find a white under kimono collar. If that makes sense to you....Overall,  the cotton was very stiff. Once I tried it on under various kimono options, I wish it would have been returnable. That said, FINDING REAL JAPANESE ATTIRE IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. THIS COMPANY DID A GOOD JOB EXPLAINING THE COMPLICATED LAYERS"
3.0,"This is a nice enough necklace and earring set but there are a couple of very weird items.  First, it is essentially reversed, both as to the earrings and necklace.  The patterning is on the back side:  what shows is blank shiny gold.  So the picture really isn't accurate.  Secondly, the necklace is rather obnoxiously jingly."
3.0,ring is to big look's smaller but for price i will keep
3.0,These convertible mittens / gloves would be great if there were a way to cover up the thumb.
3.0,Beautiful fabric. This skirt is very high waisted. Based on your shape you definitely want to go up in size. I had to return it and order a bigger size.
3.0,"I’d sized up when ordering these because I wanted a looser fit, but I’m not sure if these would have been wearable if I’d gone by the manufacturer’s size chart. They are very fitted through the hips and legs; I knew these would be tapered, but I wasn’t expecting them to fit like a second skin from waist to just above my ankles, where these hit. (I’m 5’6”, 178 lbs, and ordered an XXL for reference.) I wouldn’t want to wear these pants in a public place without a tunic-length top over them. There isn’t a crotch gusset, which combined with the slim fit through the legs makes these not the easiest to do some movements in. The fabric is nice and the workmanship seems good, but these might not be a good fit for other chubby/pear shaped folks."
3.0,"Ummm, looks kinda plastic/shiny, but it will work."
3.0,"Got the “blue” thinking is gonna be as pretty as the picture but is nothing like it, is a very dull green and gray mix. The material is not nice either, overall not happy."
3.0,No es como yo esperaba ya que me vino muy ancho
3.0,I got these as a gift because I had these on my wish list because they were a really pretty color and design.  But I didn't realize how HUGE they!  They are 5.5&#34; by 2.25 inches!  The color and design really are very nice but the size reminds me of a Halloween accessory for a Gypsy outfit.  The size might be good for a necklace so maybe I might try to turn them into a necklace.....
3.0,"Im going to have to shorten the chain and make it a choker, that's the only way it looks right"
3.0,The inside is very soft. I ordered a 3x after reading reviews and could have probably gone one size larger. I am 5’10” and they look like 7/8 length in me. What is the point of fleece lining if your ankles are bare?
3.0,"I bought a size up, I can see my boyfriend look at me when I wear it like I'm wearing a moo-moo. It ended up in the good-will pile"
3.0,This Dress needs a slip under it because the material is not heavy enough.
3.0,"Looks , fits good<br />No instructions Doesn’t say if it’s waterproof?<br />Pity!"
3.0,"I bought this to wear on Halloween at the hospital, I'm a nurse.  It was kind of cute, how it was sent, though there was a crease that I couldn't even iron out , so it looked more box shaped, than curved and that was a little disappointing.  Everyone liked it though.  The material it is made out of seems quite durable--that's probably why I couldn't iron out the crease and it makes it hard to do up the buttons that makes the nursing hat shape."
3.0,"I use this band for an every day use and it is great. If I get it wet from washing dishes, it dries rather quick. Only downside is, dirty or little dust gets stuck on it."
3.0,"I was happy when this came in the mail especially since it came in time for our camping trip.  First day though the zipper messed up, but I was able to fix it.  And every once in a while it comes off the track.  It's not for everyday use so that doesn't bother me so much."
3.0,"I really like the look of this.  I read the reviews so I ordered up 2 sizes and it fits well.  I agree with the other reviewers that the arms fit snuggly.  Unfortunately, the material is very scratchy.  This means wearing for shorter periods - like to church."
3.0,The fabric on these was very cheap in look and feel. They also looked much more casual than the picture. I had to return them. The return process was easy.
3.0,"Product was great at first but broke after about a month of having it. Very cute, but doesn’t last long"
3.0,These shoelaces are nice looking and good for short walks.  I took them on vacation and they come untied after a few miles.  I had to retie them 2-3 times per day.
3.0,Umbrella is nice the fabric but the green discolored after the summer in the sun.  It’s now almost brown.  I live in Ohio so it’s not as if it was a lot of UV like DeathbValley.
3.0,The earrings on.line look better th an in person.  They don't sh.i.n.e that way
3.0,"I like this ok. The grey color isn't really grey, more purple brownish. The zipper to close it is a little weird. Way bigger than I thought it would be."
3.0,"Nice watch Band. Was a little disappointed that there was no way to adjust the tightness.<br />After a couple days of wearing, it did loosen up.<br />Overall Happy"
3.0,Looking at the packaging you wouldn't know what brand of boots you just received. The boots are comfy but the calf part is huge for me. If you have skinny or normal calves I wouldn't recommend these but for fuller to large calves these should be good. They are a nice color and comfort feel to them.
3.0,"If you have a wide foot, order a size up. I would return mine but I was going on a trip and it was to late."
3.0,"Way too small, but pretty.  Too bad they didn't have a size 8."
3.0,A little small and light weight.
3.0,"I am 5’2” 102 lbs. and ordered a small.  The small was very tight so I returned it and ordered a medium and that fit much better.  I only gave it 3 stars because the material is mediocre at the at the most, but hey it was cheap and I love the colors.  This will be the kind of dress I put on in a rush."
3.0,"I am a girl with some extra &#34;love&#34; on my side's that I was hoping this dress wouldn't show, but it does. So I will still have to wear a gut sucker to make the dress look better on my body. Very nice material, light and flowey. Other issue is the plunging neckline, oooh boy does that neckline plunge but with a little extra help, I can make this work."
3.0,sent it back. material was different.
3.0,"It's okay, but the dye in the material tends to run a lot, even after several washes.  Not recommended to wear to sleep on colored sheets."
3.0,"These pajamas are quite comfortable and breathable, though a tad larger than expected.  More importantly, the item arrived with holes in the pockets and the stitching there is weak.  The rest of the stitching seems fine.  I stitched the pockets up so it's not a huge deal, but it's not a good first impression."
3.0,"I loved them and they fit ! I'm a big girl !  I I was happy ! For 4 hours of use ...but guess what? I'm so disappointed that after wearing them a couple times they are strings that are all over them  newer them wore ( 3times) total of 12 hours at the most, making them only something you'd put on to wash all the clothes you would were in every other place but laundry day or on the couch with a cold Cheap ! Sorry. Now $s in the trash with the pants."
3.0,Good for kid/early teens.ONLY.
3.0,The ends were just two small.I was disappointed.
3.0,"Nice, comfortable socks.  I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and these fit fine.  They are a little thinner than I prefer, but that's not a &#34;deal breaker&#34;.  I don't wear nylons any more, so, besides wearing them with jeans, I'd have no problem wearing them as &#34;dress&#34; socks (with slacks). I would have given this product 4 stars, but one sock came with a hole & small run in the area above the ankle (not in the foot).  The pair is still wearable, but...eh.  I don't know if I'd purchase again."
3.0,"I can see why this shirt has great reviews - it's very cute - just wasn't for me! the know was a little too far towards the middle, so it looked more like a maternity top."
3.0,"Okay. A thin knit, and runs a bit small. Cute enough."
3.0,Bought for my daughters birthday. Outfit is adorable. She loved it. After a couple of washes it fell apart. Cute while it lasted.
3.0,"Returned this dress. Actually really liked the top part but the skirt part made me look frumpy. If it was a little more firm fitting, it would’ve worked."
3.0,It was very stiff and scratchy.
3.0,For some reason your logos and stitching needs much improvement. One day I’ll buy something from you guys and give you five star review
3.0,"The zippered large section does not have any divisions inside. I would prefer to separate my credit cards from my bills. The outside magnetic latch pocket has a strong magnet so it stays shut. To keep the items separate I now use the outside pocket to carry my credit cards and the large zippered pocket for bills, receipts, etc... The leather is very pliable and easy to mold. I do not use the attachable strap. I have not tried using the belt straps as I'd rather put it in my pocket."
3.0,"Thought I’d found the holy grail for picky child with wide feet who prefers shoes without laces, but unfortunately the Velcro is a bit short, so these are gonna need me to figure something out for my son to be able to wear them. They look amazing though and great price."
3.0,The quality of the tank top is great but runs very very small (tight) and the length is not ideal; it is much shorter than the image displays and the material is a very thick spandx type. This a nice tank top to dress up with or use as a staple with anything. Love that you don't have to wear a bar and worry about any movement or be afraid to bend over. It is very tight - I am typically an x-small but returned for a large.
3.0,Returned . Was tragic on me<br /><br />My torso was Too short<br /><br />Better for thinner taller girls<br />I am 5’2 & 115
3.0,"Pretty style but color was a light yellow, not how it looks online."
3.0,"The looks are great, it feeld great.... but it is super hard to place on the watch itself... when you try to pull done the little bar to place on the hole it wont go done on it....there is no lever like othes  where you just pull it down and that helps to place it right... I almost hit my nail placing it..."
3.0,returning it due to the hem
3.0,Quality is cheaper than I prefer and they stretched out too much after just a couple days.
3.0,Not sure if they work but not sure if they don't but will say its a comfortable very long sock
3.0,"They were pretty earring but very fragile.  Both boats were broken upon arrival.  Returned them for acrefund, which was processed immediately."
3.0,The inner tie was almost completely torn off.
3.0,"Does the job, but unless you like them wide in depth, it is near impossible to attach to a tie without power forcing it."
3.0,"I am assuming from the other reviews here that this is supposed to be some covert Satanic symbol...but what it is actually is a copy of the symbol belonging to the band Blue Oyster Cult, one of the originators of heavy metal.  The symbol is derived from the hook and cross, symbol of Kronos (Greek titan, father of Zeus), Saturn, and the alchemical representation of lead (a ""heavy metal"").  The symbol as represented in this pendant--with the dot at the cross center--is BOC's trademark exactly.  I find it amusing that people that belong to a demographic that I'm guessing wasn't even born yet during the 1970's are running around with a trademark from a sci-fi/fantasy metal band while thinking that they are making a hushed anti-Christian statement.  Don't believe it? Search BOC on the web and read about the derivation of the symbol..."
3.0,"Quality is good, product fits smaller than expected."
3.0,"I bought 2 of these dresses in different colors (Navy, Gold). I love the dresses, they are gorgeous! However, I gave it only three stars because the gold dress had 4 tiny snags in the satin right on the chest which stood out like a sore thumb. I returned it and reordered it. Praying the next one isn't damaged since I ordered it for the Marine Corps Ball which is on November 5th 2016. I originally bought this dress in Navy blue size 2X based on the reviews. I normally wear an XL. It was too tight in the shoulders and chest so I returned it for the 3XL. The bigger size in Navy is beautiful. It fits well in the shoulder and chest area but is a little big in the hip but It is an easy fix by taking in the darts. I will update the review when the new gold dress comes in."
3.0,Button holes and other stitching was coming apart.
3.0,Like the chain and the fact that it comes with two pieces of pendants. But the violin piece is not as cute as shown in picture.
3.0,"I returned this item because it was too big and loose. (32DD) For a sports bra, the fabric was not ideal for sweat or stretch- it is mostly a pretty aesthetic. It was somehow simultaneously too big but failed to stretch while I was pulling it over my head.<br /><br />Looked cute though!"
3.0,"The length and flow is great,thought fabric may have been abit thicker,but it will be great in warmer weather,or layers under for added warmth,for winter,fall."
3.0,"returning, not going to work for me<br />waistline uncomfortable and too bulky...."
3.0,"Earings look very nice, but some of the golden earings are golden plastic, not metal and the caps are plastic too wich give them a cheaper appearance."
3.0,"Didn't like as much as the image, knew it would be heavy but was heavier than I expected. That  said, the colors are very nice and it looks sturdy."
3.0,Nice looking ring.  Expected the ring to be a little heavier. Probably could have used a half size smaller.
3.0,pretty but small
3.0,"I was SO excited to get these. I have several other pairs of Colorfulkoala leggings and joggers. I ordered these in large and they barely went on. I do like the material so I’m gonna send them back for XL. But dang, I’m sad these didn’t work I wanted to wear them now."
3.0,"I really liked the design on this sweatshirt, but it is super small. I ordered a large (I'm 5'5) and it barely covered my midsection, and definitely was stretched to the max on my chest. Returned and not bothering with the XL since the L was so small, it probably still won't fit."
3.0,"Hopefully Marathon is monitoring these reviews - I just received two of these straps - one was supposed to be 22mm X 11” and the other 20mm X 11”. I expected the length to be the same (11”)  for both, with only the width being different. As you can see from the photo, the 20mm is 9-3/4 in., not including buckle, and the 22mm is 10-3/4 in. Not including buckle. So neither matches the spec of 11in. that I thought I was ordering. As it turns out, the 9-3/4in. length of the 20mm strap is PERFECT for me, so that one is no problem. But the 22mm strap is too long.  It would also be perfect if it were the same length as the 20mm. So my question is, why the variance, and how can I get the length I need (the 20mm strap length of ~9-3/4 in., excluding buckle, on the 22mm strap). Other than this issue, I’d give these straps a “5+”, and I’m keeping both for now, so I’m hoping Marathon will be able to correct the problem."
3.0,This is a nice coat. The hood could be larger for a 3x coat. The side pockets need to be deeper. Also the zippers should go the other way top to bottom on the side pockets.  That is some of the flaws with this coat.
3.0,"These are cute and for the price you can't really go wrong. They are a little big/stretched easily but I'm going to try shrinking them in the dryer. They are cute enough that I would wear them as a shoe out in public, no where fancy but just around town for sure."
3.0,Great dress and material for the price! Just runs a little small!
3.0,"Soft as can be but colar is oddly wide. Almost like one thats been stretched out. Color of green is what I expected. Size seems true. Kinda been wearing more as a quick run around shirt. Not to impressed, but soft so I'll keep it."
3.0,they work well for sun glare but fit awkwardly.
3.0,"This is very very thin material and actually kinda itchy. I've washed it twice to try and soften it and it has helped. Definitely not a sweatshirt to keep you warm, more for looks than warmth. Cute design though!"
3.0,"I was supposed to receive navy blue constellation decorated leggings, but instead I got light grey. I still they're they're cute, but the images should be honest."
3.0,The shirt and vest were poorly sewn and buttons came off
3.0,Get what you pay for. White is see through
3.0,Clasp could be better but I got a couple of these for a 5yr and 4yr. So you do the math.
3.0,"It’s a great item to have in a Jewish household. I got it, because being that corona prevents us from going to Shul, I wanted to get the Shul experience at home. But I’m giving 3 stars, because the cover is terrible quality. It’s too tight, it’s hard to take off/put on, and it’s very cheap material."
3.0,"The product looks like the picture.  The chain is adjustable by about 1 inch and actually a nice style, but a little delicate.  The elements of the charm just don't have the quality I hoped for.  You could take the charm off and use the chain with other charms for versatility.  For under $2 it is ok.  A young girl might like it.  Groupon has these from time to time with actual Austrian crystals for about $13, and that is probably a better choice if you want a higher quality look."
3.0,Descent small chain.
3.0,The sizes is too small
3.0,The size is hugh in a child
3.0,It's ok. A little small but not ridiculously small like some I have taken chances on. The colors seem brighter in person. Material is decent.
3.0,"I recently went through shoulder reconstruction surgery, and needed to have some button-down shirts, one size bigger than normal, to make it easier for me to get on and off, until I can get my range of motion back. Both this, and another shirt I purchased, from this manufacturer, ran smaller than sized. In fact, I have shirts my normal size, that fit better than these do, supposedly a size larger! Both shirts ended up returned, for being too small."
3.0,"I like the different sizes, colors, the overall concept. Unfortunately,  2 zippers broke the 1st time using them. I don't want to return the set because I actually like it. Hoping the rest don't break during my next trip."
3.0,I am a large and this fit more like a medium. The material doesn’t do any favors either as it’s very clingy so every bump in my torso was accentuated. I returned it.
3.0,I have purchased these buckles before and the ones I got are not the adult size buckle but the child size.  This is ok for what I need them for but misleading on the website
3.0,Returned it.. Very Small
3.0,"Loved it, but it fell off and lost it."
3.0,"Cute top, quality is cheap so you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"The design and construction were of good quality, but the frames were pretty small. Also, frames are not maroon, but a fire engine red.  Postage of return fell to the customer and that will cost more than the glasses themselves so I guess someone in my family is getting a new pair of shades."
3.0,I like the way these fit but just recently was told that you can see my butt through these. I literally had a second person tell me. I had no idea.
3.0,"Love it, but the ring and hook closure broke after a few days, I just attached my key ring to the actual lanyard. Love the design tho."
3.0,"They are so so so tight on the waist. I weigh about 110 and I ordered a small. My hips are about 35 inches and it was a struggle to get on. On the other hand, they were durable. I wouldn’t buy again though"
3.0,"These were nice but they wouldn't stay in my ears well. Not sure if it's just me, but other than that they were decent quality for what I paid. They bend easily and will break after a while, but they're just earrings."
3.0,"Material is soft and color as expected, looking forward to wear in my summer Europe trip"
3.0,They look like good quality but I ordered them larger than I needed and they were too small :(
3.0,Somewhat thick.
3.0,"some of the glasses are not useable, the lenses are not uniform in magnification."
3.0,I ordered a medium and it's okay but it could be a tad larger. The color is nice but not as dark as the picture (burgundy)
3.0,"I really love this coat. But it is not true to size. I'm hoping they have a larger size.<br />The packaging was nice but it causes so much wrinkles in the material and I've had it hanging for 7 days already and I can't use it. And where I live it's snowing already and I have a beautiful coat I can't use. 🥺<br /><br />Ok I took the coat to a dry cleaner yesterday just to steam it, but they apologized and said they did their best but could not get most of them out. Do now I'm really sad and hope the seller contacts me. I did send them aessshe but nothing yet."
3.0,"These are beautiful.. No doubt.. All but one small stone at the top of a rose gold was loose, however I found it in the bag and I'm able to repair it..<br />It came in a small case that was cracked.. No big deal, a beautiful velvet bag.. I'm giving this 3 stars only because the details says 32 but I only received 25.. Very disappointing.. The only reason I bought this versus the others is because of the amount..<br />7 makes a big difference..<br />Otherwise, they are very beautiful.. Just wish they were honest about the count (or I'm not sure if it was an error with me in particular)"
3.0,I've purchasing a few dress from this brand there not true in sizing
3.0,"It’s warm, but like 35F and up. Anything below it you have to bundle tf up!"
3.0,Cute but I had to return...Runs small.
3.0,"The lenses fitment are 95% and not bad at all. No complaints there. I do get a slight reflection off the inside of the lenses in certain conditions. Its not bad, but I was mistaking it for a small particle of lint on the lenses at first. The reflection is not in the line of sight."
3.0,Look great but no stretch. Look great when standing up but can't sit down and breathe at the same time.
3.0,I like it very much but it was too large for me.
3.0,"Good quality, Comfortable and stylish. Not bleach proof. My biggest complaint is the pockets with the orange stripe is about 1.5 inches wide. It catches hair and is impossible to clean it out."
3.0,I love the material but the style is a little to busy for my liking.
3.0,odd shape
3.0,"Slightly wider than 20mm so didn't fit my watch case.  Good quality, nevertheless.  Sad I had to return it."
3.0,Material is thin. fits thight
3.0,"Nice skirt, the material is a little thinner than I like, but it hangs well.  It does wrinkle when washed.  I needed a navy skirt and it is fine, but I don't love it."
3.0,Disliked the style.  Too old.
3.0,"The color and flamingo pattern are cute, vibrant and fun to wear. The fabric is soft, stretchy and cozy. I am 5 2 117# and size small fit perfect.<br />The issue for me was the fabric has pilled dramatically. I washed in cold water and hung dry and it has just not held up well"
3.0,Nice  head  piece
3.0,Cute but size seemed way too small so I returned and then size up still seemed too tight. Looks great but wont fit for long with a growing kid.
3.0,is okay is a t-shirt
3.0,Wanted cotton lining
3.0,I expected the necklace to be a little bigger. But my friend still liked it
3.0,"Really nice shirt when it first arrived. However, does not maintain its shape very well after washing (colors DO hold up well, though). Very lightweight material. Overall construction is rather well done."
3.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my aunt who loves to read. Although I think she will like the scarf, I was a little disappointed with the quality. I wish the fabric as more natural and less polyester-ish."
3.0,"Very nice, except the colour is a tad more yellow than the picture. If you are looking specifically for something white, don't buy."
3.0,"I've purchased from this company previously and product comes from China.  I specifically re-ordered from them because the ones I purchased previously were mainly cotton.  However, while the new ones I purchased are labeled and advertised as 92% cotton the material is not that and feels like nylon or some  other material other than cotton.  The ones I bought in the past I love because they are long enough, thick enough and COTTON.  I will keep them but not what I wanted.  They need to sell what they advertise."
3.0,Maybe it's just me but I could not get this to work. Doesn't seem worth it to send back. I ordered a different type.
3.0,Bangle is nice although its diameter is quite enormous. Not sure what to do with item now. Unfortunately purchased another for a gift hopefully it is fits better as a gift.
3.0,"This fits well, is made well, and has a good liner.<br />It is not the pink shown in the picture, but mauve. Or a washed out lavender.<br />I like the fit, not the color., and am currently trying to dye it.<br />The satin parts are not taking the dye well, so I will soak it for a long time."
3.0,"I love the cap,but the stitching is a bit bad"
3.0,Definitely not meant for anyone other than a stick
3.0,I wanted to love this but after wearing just a couple of hours I could feel the skin on my neck becoming irritated. When I looked sure enough there was a pink line where the necklace had touched the skin. Never had this happen before.
3.0,This necklace is cute. Nothing fancy but for the price it’s good. Unfortunately I received the name “Makayla” instead of “Hailey” so it can’t be used and I don’t know any Makaylas but if I did I’d gift it. I’m sure whoever wore it would enjoy it.
3.0,Has a costume light weight feel and touch to it yet it’s very strong & sturdy…
3.0,"It was good, but the sticky didn’t last very long and fell off throughout the time I wore it."
3.0,Cute. Will look great once I'm done at the gym...
3.0,"My mom likes them, but within a week the backing on the dangle fell off. Luckily we found it and glued it back on. Not great quality, but okay for occasional wear."
3.0,"I really liked this bikini and I really wanted it to fit. I bought an XL hoping at least the top would fit (not too concerned with the bottoms, as I wasn't planning on wearing them). The cups were still way too small. The straps didn't adjust tight enough for my liking, either. Had to send it back :(<br /><br />Overall, a very nice bikini. I just wish I would have been able to fit it!"
3.0,To be honest it alright. Just a bit disappointed that every time. I'm running the socks rolls over and it gets hard to run afterwards. So far it seems ok.
3.0,"There was some sort of black coating on this that has flaked and chipped off quite a bit. The stones, now that the coating is coming off, are pretty. Not sure why the black coating was put on. It hasn't completely come off yet so it looks like a hot mess."
3.0,The frame is a little big bigger. Prefer a smaller one. Using it for work only.
3.0,"Pay attention, these are screw on earrings.  Also they do not dangle as low as I imagined.  I like swarski and they were packaged nicely with good branding.  I do not need clip on earrings but it will cost me more to ship back so I am going to attempt to cut them nd put them on an earring (fish hook).  Still unhappy with the length but the swarski crystals look nice and what else can I do if ive already wasted the shipping money."
3.0,"Once you have this wrapped around, it will fold and slide when you sit down. Can't wear it"
3.0,"The ring is comfortable to wear, but I just really didn't like the color. It is VERY pink, with gold undertones, and would look great on someone with a cool skin tone. I have a wam skin tone, so I returned this and got the true gold color instead."
3.0,The description said sweatshirt. Very thin and not warm for winter.<br />Very beautiful otherwise and arrived earlier than expected.
3.0,"Style is nice, a little chunky but the chain continues to come apart. The links separate easily and is also difficult to put on."
3.0,I like this sweater it's a great fit.
3.0,The watch it self is very well made and has a nice weight to it. However the band in the photos is red with an alligator type pattern and mine is pink with a very different pattern
3.0,Using for a Halloween costume. Arms are a bit tight. I ordered a size Large when I normally wear a medium.
3.0,They look like boxing shorts. Cute but they angle of the cut is a bit triangular so it took some getting used to.
3.0,The box was torn and broken but the gloves inside are ok. Average disposal latex gloves. Don’t expect too much.
3.0,"I wear 10.5 mens USA (Wide and regular), and all my shoes fit just fine.  I like how they keep separation between my shoes and clothing in my luggage.  The issue that I have with them is that zippers are weak.  On 2 units, I have over-zipped or unzipped so that entire pull piece comes off track.  I was able to get them back on, but luckily I was at home and not in a hotel.  To fix this, I put safety pins on both ends of the zippers to stop the zipper carriage from pulling way too far out.  If they had better zippers put on these, they would've received 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After writing my review, I was contacted by the manufacturer.  They offered to send me a new set of bags, but I told them that the zipper was what had the issue, and if they send me a new set, I would have the same issue.  They offered to send me a refund, but I refused since I am still using the product with a little modification.  Adding safety pins at both ends of the zipper make it so that the zipper pull does not come off track.  I recommended that they fix the issue with the zipper by either using a better zipper to adding additional stitching at the ends to keep the zipper pull on track.  If the manufacturer follows through with this, they would have a 5-start product!"
3.0,Pendant is pretty. Chain is thin and broke.
3.0,Love it BUT bought it in May and by August the metal attachment of the zipper pull broke off.
3.0,Not of good quality. Not as expected. Gave it away.
3.0,Was stuff and ran a little small in the top area not a very good material
3.0,My fault.  This was much smaller than expected and the inscription was not readable (at least to a person over 21.
3.0,"Nice looking glasses, light weight. Good protection, clear vision. Lens has accumulated a few scratches just by cleaning the lens. Hardware a little flimsy. Screws became lose within a few day but was able to retighten with lens screwdriver."
3.0,The color yellow is not the color I see on the screen more of a brighter yellow than a golden yellow.
3.0,"It slightly see-through, so I would take into account the necessity of needing to wear something underneath it when choosing size."
3.0,"It was way too big, had to belt it and my usual size is 14.  Could have fit someone who wears a size 18 so."
3.0,Runs small in bust
3.0,"I love the designs of these rings! However, the threading of the screws is not as secure as they could be- I lost the top ball of the shiny &#34;disco-ball&#34; one... bummer. I'm now using the Large diamond one- I have no complaints! It's amazing hot comfortable the diamond is in comparison to other simple rings I have used in the past."
3.0,Dress is beautiful and very comfortable. Color was blue and not aqua.
3.0,ehh<br />hard to put on for a sandle.<br />not bad
3.0,"If I had paid full price for these shoes, I would have returned them. The materials are cheaper than expected given the price. The bottom is a similar material to flip-flops. On the plus side, they’re lightweight and on-trend. They look cute, but run narrow! If you have wide feet, these are not the shoes for you!"
3.0,"It’s cute but it’s more of a kids size, a little small for an adult"
3.0,"this dress is really cute but the fit is bizarre. The top part of the dress feels like it was made for a giant and I had to sew and change the dress just to get it to fit on the top at all and I wear a 34 C and bought a small. However, the bottom fits perfectly, so that is really confusing because I am 5'1."
3.0,"WARNING:  This product contains chemicals kn own to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.  This warning was attached to the identification tag."
3.0,"Price for this was really good. The material is good heavy weight as is the stitching. However, the fake wear on two pockets is so bad that they cannot hold anything, and I will iron patches in to make them usable. Six of the buttons are set crooked and loose so I had to use a press to properly set them, and the buttonholes are either loose or too tight. The two breast pockets are fine. No fan of hoodies but it's well made and removable. Overall, I'm still pleased with the purchase."
3.0,I love most everything about this purse but the strap is too short for my liking.  I expected it to be adjustable but it's not.
3.0,"It wasn’t the best. The nasa logo feels like a sticker and feels cheap and tacky. Also don’t trust the duration of when your order is going to get here. Mine said June 29th but it surprisingly arrived 1 month earlier and I ordered the white sleeved one. I have to agree, the sizing was horrible. I like big sweaters and ordered a size up. XL. It still felt uncomfortable and was outlining my body a bit. Overall it’s ok I liked the look of it but it wasn’t what I was expecting ."
3.0,The necklace is pretty but more appropriate for a child.
3.0,Expected it to be a little closer to the &#34;Grimm&#34; keys but can't complain.
3.0,"I really wish this had worked out because it's very cute! The dress fits well everywhere except the arms, which were snug/almost tight. The material is very soft, but it is also very, very thin. I would not have been comfortable wearing this outside the house, since I could see both the color and the lines of my underthings through the dress. Maybe if I had multiple layers, but then that defeats the purpose of a lightweight summer dress."
3.0,"Great idea, but they don't hold up well. My son wore them 2 times and already has a big hole in the bottom of one foot."
3.0,"I like the crystal but didn't realize how large they would be.  The silver looks cheaper, but I do like the lever back style. I bought 2 pair, one as a gift."
3.0,not very stylish but fine
3.0,"I love the woven wedge on these sandals and was really thinking I would fall in love with them. I got a size 7, and they are too big, about a size too big. The straps are also big, the ankle strap and the toe strap. The toe strap didn't even touch my foot it was so loose. I do have narrow, thin feet, so I would recommend these shoes to someone with more wide of a foot."
3.0,These are just ok. They are more delicate than I expected and seem just a little on the cheap side. Priced a little high for the quality in my opinion. I'm debating about keeping them.
3.0,"This tie looks amazing but the product quality leaves something to be desired. The loop on the back to hold the skinny end of the tie came detached from the tie the very first time I wore it. Fortunately, this was only worn once for a Halloween costume so it really didn't matter. But heads up for anyone looking to wear one of these more than once."
3.0,"Smaller than expected fits toddler size not 5yr-10yrs old..,,but still cute hat."
3.0,Love the material but the cardigan runs a size small.
3.0,"Fit nicely in waist, but the legs were narrow. I have thick legs so if you too have bigger legs you may want to pass on these. Also the length hit about 4in below my knee I am 5ft 6. Material was very comfortable and stretchy. I bought white so the snuggness around the knees was unflattering."
3.0,"While the hat was as described, the material it was made from looked dingy and quite cheap. Would have expected a better quality of material used to make this cute hat"
3.0,Liked everything about this dress except the weird third layer of fabric in the bodice area. You could clearly see the fabric line and it was not attractive.
3.0,get a size smaller. it runs big.  but it is a nice dress.  made well.
3.0,"The mask is on the bigger side, fits but obviously intended for a large person (I am 5'7"" 150lbs). It looks just a tad too large for my face, and has an intense plastic smell. Not very comforable to wear, rigid hard plastic."
3.0,It fits just right in the bra area.. doesnt flatter the midsection much...Unless I find the right shapewear I may not wear this dress...
3.0,got them I like them a little different for me .. I normally wear a 61/2 or a 7 but i got the 61/2  .. it fits perfect on my feet.. second think we worry about sagging boots  around the ankle .. well u will slightly may be with some skinny pants or leggings it will be fine.. I think it was worth the price I have I like the  grips on the shoe good for snow if ur out and about. and its comfortable.<br />so buy a pair and walk in fashion 😘
3.0,"I was expecting this to be bigger, but still cute and soft"
3.0,they were nice but sent back cause they were too large
3.0,"I like the concept but execution of the product is off. I bought small and you can fit two of me in small. If the sizing was right, it would have been a cute product and I would love it. Someone commented it’s flat filling, it’s right, this isn’t a puffy vest. It would do the job for fall/spring weather."
3.0,"I received 3 pair of orange...I was hoping for at least one other color.. Fits good, nice and warm. Brings back childhood memories."
3.0,Battery did not work. Compass too small.
3.0,"Cheap, see-through fabric. Not to be worn alone, needs some tyor of cover up."
3.0,"there no insole just the fake fur, not that comfortable the first day I wore them. the leather is liquid leather spray on material. I work with leather and furs. waterproofing just don't let water go over the shoelace water will make it in the shoe. warmness not bad for the first day."
3.0,In the picture it clearly shows a sweatshirt type of top. This is just a fitted long sleeve womans top... Super duper small!!!! I usually wear an XL so I ordered the 3X since anything from asian countries run small. Uhh the 3X fits like a small. I'm pretty sure if I ordered the small it would fit my 4yr old.<br />The print on it is vivid and pretty just like the picture. It's a shame the sizing sucks.
3.0,This is cute but I ordered an xl and though it closes its snug and not comfortable... should of ordered 2 sizes up ugh
3.0,"It runs small, but it’s cute."
3.0,Not waterproof  hard to put on and off
3.0,Really cute top. Runs smaller then I thought it would. Guess it's time to loose some weight. The blue color is beautiful!
3.0,Uncomfortable on wrist. Band is stiff and looks like artificial alligator.
3.0,This was as beautiful as expected but the watch mechanism does not work at times
3.0,Not at all happy with these they tar off of my suitcase I ended up with the cables that connect them and no no tags
3.0,"True to color and big enough to cover my long hair while in a bun. I usually wear a n95 and surgical mask, face shield, and gowns with this and the lighter colors show where I sweat on my forehead lol. Also you should probably hand wash these. I threw them into a mesh bag and washed them on gentle cycle and dried them on low heat and some of the buttons fell off. I’ll have to sew them back and reinforce the others that managed to stay on. Good enough for the price, and I feel more comfortable wearing these hats because they’re thicker than those disposable blue or white bouffants"
3.0,This bracelet is really cool...however...the clasps that hold the fabric came loose...not made well.
3.0,returned was very small.
3.0,"Looked great just what i wanted, but top and arch strap not any good at all to short. I have a high instep and the straps came up almost  2 inches short to close"
3.0,"smaller than I thought, but it is cute"
3.0,The under boob line is a little high for me personally and I wish it was a little shorter.
3.0,Nice wallet but it's on the large size
3.0,"Nice fabric pattern, decent style but not dripping well. the bottom design is a little weird. Make it more look like a maternity dress."
3.0,Don't buy it fades on everything.  Terrible needs taken off amazon.
3.0,not bad looking. the pleats are sewn with white thread instead of black so the stitches can be seen. makes it look worn out a little.
3.0,Would have been nice except picture didn't really  show how thin this size is. It was too thin for me.
3.0,"I really like this product, it covers my breasts just enough lmfao if you know what I mean. The material is amazing, can't wait to wear this all summer."
3.0,"Color was much lighter than what is pictured and size was smaller than expected, but not too small."
3.0,The skirt fits fine around the waist however I am 5'3 so the skirt is too long for me! I had to get a larger size because I am 6 months pregnant!
3.0,Wanted to love this and it's very comfortable but it basically looks like a black sack
3.0,These look like flannel.  I was disappointed to find that they were thin fabric instead.  I was able to return all three that I had purchased.  Otherwise they are just the look I wanted.  I did not try them on the girls.
3.0,Ordered size 8-9 for my 6 yo and is a bit too small but she loved it so I guess will be a one summer swimsuit
3.0,This was my favorite maxi dress... but after a few times of wearing it the stitching  came undone.. I might buy it again some day.
3.0,"I tried these glasses and had to do a double take when I looked at myself in the mirror.  The lens has little curvature, making these glasses look like novelty fashion.  I liked the lens color but decided to return the glasses as I couldn't shake a sense of the over-the-top novelty look and feel."
3.0,"I really like this bohemia style sundress although I wear it with pants.  I did have to buy it 2 sizes larger because the reviews said it fits small.  I really like the round neck.  The material is very very thin which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars, plus the fact you have to buy  it 2 sizes larger."
3.0,"I got a small and I'm a size 8, 5'2 and 125 lbs and the dress was large. Also the color was much darker then the picture. I took the dress in a inch and it's fine."
3.0,The ear pieces stretch out almost immediately and fall off my face. They fit me good for about an hour.
3.0,Fell apart after 2 months.
3.0,"This was a tough one for me. I ordered the Missufe Women's Wrap V Neck Long Sleeve Ruched Fitted T Shirt Top wanting to love it... and I sat on reviewing it for a while, because I don't.<br /><br />This is a really thin shirt, thinner than I expected for sure. It feels like it might degrade significantly when I wash it, and I got it to wear for a particular occasion so I haven't washed it yet (I'll wait until after then, just in case). The more I thought about it the more I realize... a shirt shouldn't be a one-time-wear.<br /><br />Other feedback: I ordered a small (I go between a small and medium top) because I wanted a form-fitting shirt, and I ordered the right size for this. Happily it fits well. The sleeves are on the longer side."
3.0,The pants fit decent however it just didn’t look right on me. Short girls with thicker thighs beware. The pants look a bit funky on.
3.0,not comfortable for indoor swimming
3.0,Very pretty. How ever the stones are very loose in the setting of the ear rings. I am too scared to wee war them all the time.
3.0,"asian sizes. if you are normally a small, order the medium. the company has a no return policy so be aware."
3.0,"It's got a straight bottom, tight fitted, plus DRY CLEAN ONLY. not like the flow in the photo. Beautiful color. Difficult 3rd party to deal with. Still have it! They wanted me to pay 1/3 oc cost to return this shirt.dont recommend. Not complaining, just real deal!"
3.0,Cute but not comfortable.  Straps very weak.  Bunches when adjusted
3.0,bought  two pairs of these and one of them has wide legs and the other fits perfectly.  I kept them both cause they are fine both ways BUT I was expecting the snugger fit.
3.0,Not only large but very long!
3.0,I liked the color but it was smaller than I expected. I may have to return.
3.0,The gloves had a sickening smell.
3.0,"Try to get 2 sizes bigger. I am a 2x, bought a 3x but it fits like a XL. If it fits snug on you, make sure you're wearing a thick undershirt cause your nipples will show. It's pretty okay overall."
3.0,This is a good dress to wear to a nice conservative funeral. I would say if you are a true size 6 you can wear a medium..possibly even an 8. Size 10 would definitely need to get a large. I am 5'3 155lb & purchased a large thinking it would run small & is actually a little big. Quality of dress is average. You will need a slip. Overall a good buy but i think it is a little overpriced after receiving it. I was caught off guard because the picture leaves you with high expectations. I added a belt with mine & it made a difference with the look.
3.0,Nice material but I didn’t like the way it looked on me.
3.0,"it alright, wish i didnt buy it but since i did ill wear it once or twice"
3.0,Not sure if I received wrong item or not but what I received is not what is described in listing. Item I received is a standard length post with no ball on end. Description claims to be a shorter post with the affixed ball on end to hender it to not pull out so easily.
3.0,"Sometimes, for bosomy women anyway, it's nice to wear a sports bra if you can get away with it. They often pinch and bind less often than the uncomfortable underwire bras. I say ""if you can get away with it"" because a lot of sports bras have straps that run close to your neck and they're often visible depending on what you're wearing. This one looks like the straps run closer to the shoulders than the neck, which is why I requested it. This review is for: YEEPSYS Women Padded Sports Bra Fitness Workout Running Shirts Yoga Tank Top.<br /><br />The straps on this DO actually run closer to the shoulder than the neck. Unfortunately, I can't wear this sports bra because it's a tad too small. I usually wear an extra large and that's what this is, but I'm bulging out at the arm holes in the front and it's very uncomfortable to breathe.<br /><br />It does seem to be well made and it held together while I angrily tried to get it off. It does have a nice band around the bottom to prevent it from rolling up, which is a nice touch. The fabric is soft and it would look nice on, if it fit properly.<br /><br />Definitely check the size chart before ordering, as a Vine member sometimes our choices are limited as far as size and colors are concerned. Based on my experience I would order one size up."
3.0,I bought the size I normally buy but it was way to big. It did look nice and seemed to be very comfortable. It was more boxy than I like so I didn't reorder
3.0,"I am 5'6"" and the waist hits me at my lower rib cage, I will have to take off the skirt and add a contrast band to make it hit at the waist, the empire cut is very flattering.  The plaid is matched VERY awkwardly so you will have to wear a belt with it.  That said the fit is good and the fabric light without being see though.  The zipper is very well sewn in but also quite cheep so don't order something that will fit you tightly.  I have washed but not retested the fit as yet but it came though the wash well (no dryer)."
3.0,"It is completely see through, so make sure wear something similar, like a shorts/pants body suit/spandex under it."
3.0,"It's nice! I really like this dress, the fabric is more like a very thin Tshirt type. The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because the size, it runs larger under the armpits. I'm a small sometimes medium size. I ordered the small size and still big."
3.0,I EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY TO ME THESE FRAMES THEY LOOK DECENT BUT THE UV TINT OF THESE FRAMES LOOK VERY CHEAP
3.0,"Great looking keyring, not a great design. Cannot be kepy in pants pockets or purse, the screw will back out or break."
3.0,It was a lot more plain than picture shows.
3.0,had holes in it
3.0,the metal is flexible and if you're not careful you'll bend in out of shape
3.0,Nice jeans. The pic is misleading. They are Grey. Not Dark blue or Blavk with patches.
3.0,Its pretty but super small. I should have read the description better. Had I have paid attention probably wouldn't have purchased. Not the sellers fault. Very quick delivery
3.0,"This watch worked how i expected. Good value for the money. Been wearing since i bought it, even take showers wearing. So far no problem. I specially  like how it is not bulky for long sleeve dress shirts."
3.0,"It’s just perfect. Fits my phone, cash, coupons and all. Only thing is I used it for only a month and the strap broke. I guess I should have expected for the price."
3.0,"Material is absolutely amazing. And the design of the shirt is fire. But way too short. If you are on the shorter side, go for it, but if not… probably pass."
3.0,Cute top. Very thin fabric and runs super small especially in the bust because no give to the fabric. I returned.
3.0,"I was expecting a little bit higher quality. I bought these for a gift, so I'm not sure about the longevity of the product."
3.0,3 of these hanging in closet  since last year. Not  thrilled
3.0,Low quality and very small.
3.0,Sadly I returned because it bunched around the waist area making my stomach look bigger.  beautiful dress though
3.0,It's nice easy to install doesn't look like the picture but still stylish and durable 😇
3.0,A little small but cute. I'll make it work.
3.0,I would’ve given it five stars if the product came in a better shape but my son still loved it we were able to fix it. it’s a pretty neat glove
3.0,Material itself is comfortable against the face however despite the mechanics of the mask it is not a breathable mask which ends up making it an awesome accessory to my shifter in my car.
3.0,"I bought 2XL because it is Chinese and fits well. I am 5"" and 160 pounds.  What I don't like is that it is very long, like a minidress and the fabric is so thin that I will need a top under it because I don't like to show the bra.  Nice lace details."
3.0,Although I love the look of the bracelet it does not lay right on my wrist and definitely OVER priced.
3.0,A little bit big but it works. I just wasn't expecting it to fit like a dress on me.
3.0,"The one good thing that came as expected was the size at least! I ordered a Small, (I’m 5’4” 135lbs) and it fit like the comfy oversized shindig everyone said it would..<br />but i feel the print and fabric is waayyy more low quality than I expected, or was pictured. The fabric is almost plastic-y? I bought it for a fun summer dress, but to be honest it’s too cheap looking, I’m looking into returning it back to seller. /:"
3.0,I was smaller than anticipated and I had to take out some of the stuffing so it can work more efficiently for me
3.0,It's a great little hand bag for short trips not to big love the sides.
3.0,"i didn't expect a lot when i purchased these goggles ... but the picture suggested a thick, black frame surrounding the yellow lenses.  i assumed they would be sturdy.<br /><br />unfortunately, the frame surrounding the lenses is very thin plastic, which can be broken very easily.  the goggles probably won't fit every head type, either, even when using the strap in the back to adjust.  i have a medium sized cranium and no matter how much i adjusted the strap, the goggles would not sit against the sides of my face and left gaps, which was annoying.<br /><br />i wouldn't suggest these for biking or riding.  in my opinion, they are suitable as an addition to a costume and nothing more."
3.0,Super huge on the face and no nose grips. Heavier than most glasses
3.0,"They are cool socks, but they are on the small side for most men. Mine barely fit and I have size 11.5 shoe. But they are fun to have."
3.0,"The description says ""with grippers"", but there are none - so just fuzzy socks."
3.0,"Love the design and comfort, but too tight on my kids' heads (6 and 8 years old). Would be perfect when larger or adult sizes are available. I would use them personally."
3.0,bigger than i thought.
3.0,Sze chart was not accurate of not clear.  Product was great but it will be two years before this can fit as anything but a sleep shirt
3.0,I have one of their watches and love it.  I bought a second similar watch and it just stopped working
3.0,REALLY BIG! Looks a bit cheesy and fake to me.
3.0,"This is not a one size fits all hat, its is not just a little long but very big unless you have a lot of hair or a huge head . . ."
3.0,Nice size ; but don’t last very long with moderate use of wallet .
3.0,"While the jacket itself is very well made the print on the back is a little blurry. The patches were not thought about when being sewn on , as they are upside down and there is a patch on the hood about where your forehead is which is a bit weird. You can easily take off the patches though, I would suggest adding your own patches and pins to this jacket and making it your own."
3.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; about 145lbs with B cups and hourglass measurements (38-29-38), this is too snug for my liking across the bust. I wish sizes were an option. Also, the material isn't very thick. I'm just getting into the printed skater dress craze and ordered a capped sleeve medium dress from CowCow- the material is thicker and feels softer and it fits me better. I love this print but sadly I probably won't wear the dress much as it is too tight under the arms and flattens my chest. I also wish the shipping was faster- don't expect to get this within a week."
3.0,There ok nothing special about these masks
3.0,Cute but not very flattering or supportive for 36C - I ended up returning
3.0,The balls are very difficult to screw back on. I also was expecting silver and received a multicolored. Otherwise an ok product.
3.0,"Everything was fine but not good or great everything was just a little off the elastic was a little to tight the top just a little to sheer<br /><br />The big issue was the robe.  I ordered an XL, which I usually wear however the robe was so small it couldn't even close. I would not recommend this product if you do size up."
3.0,Fit was not great.  I gifted it to someone bigger than me.  It made me look pregnant.
3.0,They are a comfortable fit but broke only after a couple months of wearin them. I decided to get another pair and they broke in less time.
3.0,"This is a great little dress for the price, but it definitely runs a little small.  I usually wear an 8/10, so relying on the reviews, I followed their advice and ordered down one size.  I think I will have to return it..."
3.0,Comfortable. Runs slightly large. I would definitely buy it again.
3.0,One of the softest squishies! My son loves it but his head is already separating from his body and we just got it today. Very disappointed
3.0,The boots are not are shown in the picture. The zipper and buckles are gold. I bought these for my son's wife for Christmas as she picked them out thinking that they where silver as shown. So may be returning after the holiday. I would just keep but not my size...
3.0,Warm and soft. Washed well.  Chord  came apart before wearing. Had to find replacement.
3.0,the chain is really short and the necklace does not necessarily glow bright like in the pictures. Also the necklace breaks easy.
3.0,I dont love the heavy material but it works for what I need and looks cute
3.0,I want to give it a 5 star rating because y husband LOVED these until the zippers broke after a couple wears :(<br />They were a gift so now the return window is over. Maybe we can get a new pair?
3.0,"Runs really small.  Forget washing it.  Even though I didn't dry it, it still shrank.  If you order this, make sure you order up a size or two. I love the color but the size is just not right."
3.0,Pretty but it kind of was cheaper end quality
3.0,"Works fine, simple item to hold my pedants but realize couldve gotten it cheaper"
3.0,Purchased two pair (4) from a local jewelry store and lost 2 of the backs. I wear two pair of diamond earrings daily and the mini heart attack I had twice when these fell off is the reason for my bad review. One pair I own were my late mother’s earrings and the smaller pair I purchased myself. I actually lost one of the new diamond earrings for about 24 hours until I found it on the bathroom floor. It must have fallen out when I was towel drying my hair. The two remaining backs I still have slide without squeezing them. I paid more than the listed price on Amazon. Just beware that these aren’t the end-all-be-all of earring backs.
3.0,"I thing this swimsuit is great quality, but I ordered a large and it is just too big for me! I wear a 9/10 in pants and a 36B in bra sizes! Just make sure you get what size is right for you. I thought I would get a large instead of medium because you never know with amazon but wish I would have gotten a medium!"
3.0,They hang a little bit longer than I expected
3.0,"Terrific length - great for ease of movement in yoga and other fitness classes. However, the torso area was more fitted than other Gaiam tops which I own. Not comfortable for that reason and returned this item."
3.0,"My daughter loved these suits, but we had to return them due to one having a large hole. The seam was not sewn."
3.0,It was very cute. The hat and scarf were great hence the 4-5 stars. I give the gloves 2 stars because they had a hole in the crotch between the fingers and thumbs and the bend of the fingers. I LOVE the color and am going to try and fix them.
3.0,"These skirts seem to be well made, but they hit at an awkward place on the leg ... they’re just a bit too long. This makes them unflattering.  Perhaps they would be wonderful on an5’ 11” frame... that is not me."
3.0,"I'm giving it 3 stars for the fact that I have ordered this twice. My first order was the pink one (shown in the images) and i LOVE it. it's super comfortable, super warm, it's oversized, it's cute. SO i decided to order one in gray. and I got an oversized DEEP v-neck sweater with stars on it. clearly they are not the same sweater. I didn't show the deep v-neck in the photos because well... that would require exposing my chest. it's very unfortunate as i was really excited for the grey one. i don't know if there was a packaging mix up or if they're just advertising the grey one as something else but it's not what I ordered. i would give it 5 stars had the grey sweater been what i ordered. the sweaters in general are both very soft and i do love that. but i wish i got what i thought i had ordered."
3.0,Too small and fabric slick and shiny which I was not expecting.<br />It is cute.
3.0,"First time I wore them they looked alright, but after drying them they shrank bad."
3.0,Too large. Returned shirt dies not run small.
3.0,Short on the length. I ordered large and all larger are usually a relaxed fit on me but this is skin tight and if I move my arms at all the bottom rides up instantly. Might work for some people but I would not recommend based on those things.
3.0,Anything below 50 degrees and your fingers will be cold. Decent for the price.
3.0,"measurements in size chart do not correspond with product measurements.  beautiful pajama set, however.  Deciding whether to return or gift to someone."
3.0,"Ok. Smaller than expected. I didn't know PU came in varying degrees of quality. From a distance, looks nice. This one's cheap, tho I have gotten compliments."
3.0,Very pretty however the catch pops open.
3.0,"Initial charm still glowing, but chain turned cruddy color of grey after a while. Necklace can not be worn everyday."
3.0,The waist of the pants is too big and not fit enough to disappoint me
3.0,"The skirt is a bit shorter than expected, but the size was perfect. However the cloth quality was very poor"
3.0,It was not exactly what I was expecting but it will work.
3.0,"This is very nice and worked for the one wedding I wanted it for, but it feels very cheap. It almost feels like plastic, not sure if it is. I don't expect for it to last very long."
3.0,"Nice product, but the sizes are a little off. The shoes I got where at least 3 sizes bigger than I ordered. But it was a nice product, if you could find the correct size."
3.0,"Material is nice , it’s nice pattern but didn’t flatter by body shape."
3.0,It's cheap looking and it's huge. I would have had to fill it with paper or something to get it to sit up on my head where it belonged. I ended up not wearing it. I think there are better options out there for the same price.
3.0,"Good quality, I especially like the grippy stuff that goes all around the edge. BUT, these look terrible with round toed flats, which is what I primarily wear. They are boxy and it just doesn't look right. I do like the bag that came with them, though.. so I won't be returning. Also wish there was an option to just get black ones rather than having to get two of each color."
3.0,"I had trouble with the tulle as it continuously scrunched up and stuck to each other. The black velvety flowers also left black fuzz all over the skirt. And in case you are like me and only wear skirts/dresses that are a knee length or longer, this skirts inner layer left my knee in full display (and a few inches more). I am 5'4."
3.0,"These socks say are machine wash but the instruction say do not dry.  There is nothing in the product description that warns you about this. That really isn't a reasonable product for a toddler.  So I decided to do a test run with our least favorite one.  It shrunk.  A lot.  About a whole size the first time dried on low to still slightly damp.  It still fits the kiddo, but just instead of being the sock she is supposed to be going into.  Will air dry the rest as they are super cute, but will not buy anymore as I don't really have time to air dry all my kids socks."
3.0,"I'm going to keep these pants because they are incredibly comfortable and I love the dark olive color, but I just noticed there's a streak down the leg where the dye pooled. For the price, I should not have received an ""irregular"" product."
3.0,I like the product and I was pleasantly surprised by the fabric however I would recommend washing before first wear as the color did rub off on other things.
3.0,"Beautiful material, stretchy so a bit big"
3.0,Not what i thought it would be.<br />Made with cheap plastic
3.0,"I tried this with my son in law who is a runner.  He wore this to practice for his  marathon but after a few times of wearing and washing it, this started loose threads on the heel part. There was nothing on his shoes that caused any snags but it did.  The material is exactly the same as a previous one I ordered but this one seemed to be less durable. The socks fit snugly  and he said that the first time he wore it it helped his legs feel relaxed and comfortable in spite of the rigorous use. So this one must be a dud, a lemon product compared to the other one that I already have.<br /><br />I should have taken a picture but I did not so my apologies as it is not readily available due to social distancing.  Will once he comes visit and will post it as an update."
3.0,No one e enough but a bit larger than expected.
3.0,I’m a curvy girl and this dress is not for me. The material does not give at all!<br />When I put it on my daughter laughed and said I look like a girl from Little House on the Prairie!<br />I think you need to be tall and thin and small chested for this to work!
3.0,Love the product but returned it because it was too low cut for my liking.
3.0,"I like the colors on the dress, however the size was not accurate. I ordered an extra large and I could barely even get the zipper to go up a little.. The cut of the dress on me was off it felt mechanical it didn't flow. If you want to look like the advertised picture I would suggest to purchase the skirt you wear under to give that precise shape. Also, the material to me was not very pleasant. I dont think it was completely worth the price."
3.0,"I like this style, but this specific one didn’t feel as stretchy as the others, it rode down a lot and I had to keep pulling them up. They are alrighttttt but not my fave… waiting for other pair to come in to compare… may have to return due to comfort…"
3.0,You can see all the goodies while wearing the white version.
3.0,"The size 8-9 does NOT fit a size 9 foot. I wanted so badly to keep these - they are really cute and seemed comfortable, but my heel hangs off the back of the slipper. I even compared the sole of this slipper to my other slippers and it is clearly smaller. It doesn't look like these are sold in any size bigger than would fit a size 8."
3.0,The picture looks like oversized sunglasses
3.0,I looked really stupid wearing it over my head and it’s overall pretty kid sized. I just use it as a blanket now.
3.0,On the small side.  More of a boys than a man's watch.
3.0,"Cool jacket was what I was expecting, seems decently well made. Does fit somewhat smaller than expected, would probably buy 1 size larger next time."
3.0,"I am not a huge fan of this shirt. I ordered up a size figuring it would be big enough to wear with leggings, but it does fit a little tighter around the hips/belly. I normally wear between a large and xl and I ordered a 2xl and it fits for me like an xl would normally fit.<br />The other thing I am not crazy about is the change in the shirt colors. The two parts are sown together and leaves a ""cuff"" on the inside and it really bothers me in the sleeve area. It is an ok shirt and I might wear it more if I loose weight. I also felt that the strings were a little longer than I would like. I don't want to tie them and it feels a little too long for them when you don't need the extra length and they get in the way when you are wearing it.<br />It is very soft material so that is why I gave it a few 3 stars."
3.0,"Me and my boyfriend just started wearing them, no issues yet"
3.0,"The pictures are a little prettier than what we ended up receiving, but for the low price the product is good."
3.0,The chain is easily broken but super easy to put back together the purse itself has open sides wish I would have known before but over-all it was a good purchase.
3.0,"I wear a size large, I ordered an Xtra large,  they were still to small, runs very small"
3.0,It's great I love it but after the second day of wearing it the &#34;steel&#34; coating rubbed off and showed the copper under plate it's worth the $2 but my finger is green from the copper. Maybe list this as a Halloween accessory.
3.0,It was 8 inches plus had the links removed and the clasp kept opening due to its weight. After  going to the jeweler i am wearing it  Not happy about the purchase .
3.0,This is a very beautiful pendant however the clasp is too delicate and feels as if it will break if I open it again.
3.0,"The cuffs are very small when trying to take the hoodie off. It is off coloured where the cat prints are, It didn't match the picture but it fits very well and I am in love with that hoodie. I recommend anyone who is just trying to relax in a hoodie that is is definitely for you!<br />Enjoy!"
3.0,Problem with length
3.0,"These are very soft and somewhat comfortable. But they are not work out pants as advertise. They feel like leggings. Not that slippery elastic fabric. They were a little thin as well, i didn’t feel like they kept everything tight like my gym shark pants. I got a small based on size and they were just slightly loose. An smaller size may have helped suck everything in a little better. But they still felt thinner than i would prefer with working out."
3.0,I’m 42DD I wear a size 20/2X in bottoms. I purchased this set in a 5X. The top is small and the bottoms are huge. Clearly they run small. On me about three sizes smaller. It’s like a silky material. Over all for the cost.. meh. I’m disappointed
3.0,Sad to say I received my bracelet and it was a 7.0 in which I normally buy and it looked like a babies size. The purple is beautiful the bracelet is pretty stiff not flexible. You would need to get 2 sizes bigger to be able to put charms on it. I also think in time it may loosen up some. Hope this helps. The return  was simple and quick.
3.0,The stone looks lighter color than pictured but beautiful set of earrings
3.0,"This is a quality shoe made with good materials and stitching, whats lacking is the good insole fit like Merrell shoes I've purchased in the past."
3.0,"Within two days, the color starting wearing off.<br />Which is a bummer, I absolutely LOVE the look of this watch ban. It has a nice shine to it."
3.0,"Cheap, doesn't look that great. Idk what I was expecting"
3.0,"The picture made it seem like it was way better quality then it really was. I get that it’s on the cheaper side, but the picture made it seem of high quality. It’s still cute and I’ll definitely be wearing it, but just kind of disappointed because it’s not as shiny or even that you can tell that it’s a fake diamond in the middle. It’s an okay product"
3.0,Every part of the dress was good quality except the purple sheer part the whole bottom came unraveled within a couple hours of wearing.
3.0,"Only one of the lights works, but the gloves fit as expected."
3.0,"the materials look good but, the area where the embroidery and supernet matrial are sticked is not even pinked.  I will have to pink it and zigzag.<br /><br />having purchased multiple items from this brand, this is my first disappointment."
3.0,"Disappointed because it did not come with a gift bag. The plastic bag it came in also looked sketchy, like it had seen some stuff which makes me suspicious as to whether or not it's new. I ordered a few other bracelets (all are Christmas gifts) and was expecting this one to come with a jewelry bag like the others. Besides that, it is a beautiful bracelet."
3.0,Do not expect a high quality product. There is no hem on the sleeves or the bottom of the shirt. Cheaply made!
3.0,"I'll give it 3 stars because it is so well made, however it was not true to size. I ended up giving it to someone literally half my physical size. I realize they should be very snug fitting, but this was also too short across my back, it was almost 7 inches too short!! And I couldn't even &#34;force&#34; it over my arms. Embarrassingly I had to have someone help me remove it. Because my arms were stuck up over my head!! Disappointing."
3.0,Material is really soft but thin. I bought the XL and it fits like a medium.
3.0,Was okay but not lots of tummy pudge support . Not in love with this product .
3.0,"I wish I had looked closer at the set before I ordered this for my then 6-month-old. The shirt is cute, it fit well enough but it's definitely a 6-month size and he outgrew it by 9 months. However the shorts ... I don't know what on earth they were thinking with a ""distressed"" look on the upper thighs that presented threads within reach of a baby. Yeah, food all over it, pulling the strings on it, it just became a mess really really quickly.<br /><br />Again, cool shirt, fit pretty exactly ... didn't really care for the shorts."
3.0,"its not as expected ,"
3.0,"I really like this dress but the size Medium is too small for me and they don't have Large anymore....but I returned it back immediately. I really like Amazon for that, is easy for me to return something I don't like to them."
3.0,Compré una xl y el tamaño real es como xxl+
3.0,SO disappointed on this product. For the price it did not last.
3.0,Good. Very fast shipping
3.0,Belt loop on bottom of jacket is torn!
3.0,"In the description this Poncho Cape described as Light Weight, I would not stated that, more like a thin material almost see through.<br />The style is odd, one side the fringes outside, while the other side the fringes inside the layer. As if this particular item did not pass QC.<br />Shown in pic 1 and 2."
3.0,I thought this was a dress. It was a skirt. When washed the bow fell off.
3.0,Very low qualiry. Never buying again .
3.0,Fits well but has a weird distortion.
3.0,Very cute but one of the heads wouldn’t come off so I can’t put them in. ):
3.0,Great style just have to buy 2-3 sizes bigger fit really small
3.0,"Like one of the other reviewers, mine smelled a little musty but there was no visible mold. I wiped it down with saddle soap and the smell went away. On the plus side, the jacket fits perfectly. I am 5’7” and weigh 120 lbs, I ordered a small. The leather is soft and the jacket seems to be well made."
3.0,It wasn't what I expected saw YouTube videos and I washed my white vans and they still look dirty. Disappointed
3.0,The visors are not as I expected. They are too small to give much coverage from the sun.
3.0,What the headline says. Turned my finger green.
3.0,Pretty top but definitely runs small.
3.0,"It is a really pretty ring and a great price! Unfortunately after three times wearing it, it turned my finger green."
3.0,"Clip ons were fine, but were way too big.  I had purchased a different brand in the same size and they fit fine."
3.0,Top and bottom are different colors.
3.0,No side pockets unfortunately!
3.0,Cute but no support.
3.0,"I only give this 3 stars because of ME and my BODY SHAPE and how these do not work for me. If someone with LESS of an issue with body size and breast weight *yes I said it*, would probably NOT have this problem. The weight pulls these sports bras down in front and is unable to support me. I don’t feel this is necessarily the problem of the bra. This is not a support bra. I am NEW to the breast weight issue having gained 50 lbs recently (due to spine problems via unable to exercise, burn calories anymore)...so I m not sure how to shop for appropriate support bras (obviously) so DON’T disparage these bras....it is just for ME...it is not working."
3.0,"The cord was very nice but the net to install the stone was very small. I barely could put a stone in it. Other than that, it's very nice."
3.0,"I have been using a similarly priced bottom from Target that is a lot better quality. These are lined but not that stretchy. The legs are high cut, as shown in the picture.I could hear a thread snap around the legs the first time I put them on. I don't think they will last long."
3.0,"needed them for volley ball, color is weird, didn't match at all, can't wear for games"
3.0,The glasses were not wide enough to enclose my prescription glasses. There is a guy over 1 inch space between the sunglasses and my prescription glasses. The arms of the glasses do not fit  properly over my prescription glasses arms.  They are very satisfactory to wear alone.  The specifications in the ad did not coordinate in reality  with the prescription glasses.
3.0,Fffgg
3.0,Now i understand why she didnt have to top buttoned up. Couldnt get it to button over my boobs. Bottom half fit great.
3.0,Product was exactly as specified but runs very large.
3.0,I love the design but I found wearing it for an extended time makes it feels heavy.
3.0,Waffle fabric is warm.  Sleeves are a little too long.  Make sure you tie any loose threads.
3.0,Iloved
3.0,Ran Small! Up size 2 sizes
3.0,They run small and are thinner material.
3.0,This product fit fine.
3.0,"I bought the white dress that is pictured without the lace bits on it. The material is nice and flowy, a little see through but I expected that. The design of the dress is like the picture except for in the pictures there is a tie on her waist and I did not receive one with mine. The dress is lovely, but unfortunately shapeless without something to cinch the waist in and upon further inspection there are even loops where the sash would go. It is great if you want to skulk around the house like the ghost of a dead Victorian girl. The elastic on the arm is a little tight and will definitely leave marks after long wear."
3.0,"I gave it a 3-star because I had to return mine.  I'm a size 8 and that's what I ordered.  Lengthwise the fit is perfect, however, it seems like it would be better for a person with wide foot because the front is more of a wide fit. Otherwise, I would recommend this shoe as the heel is a comfortable height and doesn't look cheap."
3.0,Ordered my usual size a medium but looks and fits like a large
3.0,"For my late 70&#34;s wife , it is too difficult to put on with the individual toes.  Otherwise, OK"
3.0,Nice Shirt but it fits &#34;small&#34;. I bought it for myself but had to give it away; seller should state smaller fit.
3.0,Materials and quality are fine. But I paid for a long sleeve tshirt and got a short sleeve one.
3.0,it broke with in 2weeks very cheep metal do not buy its crap
3.0,no tag or label. gave as a gift and looked cheap although it was twenty bucks. She loves it though
3.0,Sunglasses are okay for the cost. They are a bit small.
3.0,somewhat cheesy.
3.0,"The “waist” on this is in a very strange place. It fell about 6 inches below my bust. I’m 5’5”, 180 lbs. and very busty (40 D). Bought a 1X, my usual size, and it did fit perfectly. But all you could see was chest. Might work for some people, but made me very self conscious. Might look good on someone fairly tall, thin and with a straighter shape. I loved the fabric, very silky with a nice drape to it. The lower part of the dress looked great. Sorry I had to send it back, but it happens."
3.0,"I love my always joggers without the fleece, so I thought these would be perfect for the colder weather. They’re the same size (small), but they’re huge! I still wear them bc they’re really comfy, but I don’t wear them out of the house. It’s a shame bc I like that about my other ones. But they’re great for lounging! Not super thick tho so I’m not sure how much warmer they’ll be. Wish they made them in xsmall."
3.0,I don’t like the dress. Chest too small. Length too long.
3.0,These pj’s are soft and keeps me warm. The color is great and I feel comfy in them. The problem is that the leg came unraveled the first time I washed them. I’ve now had to sew up both legs and the arm sleeves. I love the look and feel but don’t like the poor way they are sewn.
3.0,Not as described. My size was off
3.0,The material reminds me of something you buy at Walmart. Not soft. I ordered a small. I'm 5'7 140lbs and it was right on my hips.
3.0,I wanted to love it so much! It was more like a shirt because it didn't even cover my bottom. I'm 5ft 1 so short dresses usually fit me perfectly.
3.0,The products were not the same as the pictures. But I still liked it. Came just in time for my kids Christmas concert!
3.0,It does fit as expected but I do not recommend for large busted women. The part where the fabric patterns change sit in an awkward position that isn't very flattering.
3.0,"This band is good quality, however it pulls the hair on my wrist whenever it’s moved in the slightest bit. The clasp is also kinda hard to get on and off. There are better ones out there."
3.0,"It's a pretty shirt but too short.  Since it's tank top style and a crop top, I feel like I look like i'm trying to wear my little sister's shirt."
3.0,"The shirts are very thin, don’t expect Nike or Adidas quality. They get the job done and they are breathable but definitely feel very cheap. Almost have a halloween costume thinness to them."
3.0,Smaller than I thought plus real long. I'm so short 😔
3.0,"I was shocked when I tried to put these socks on.  They were way too small for a mans feet.  Passed them to my wife to see if she could wear them,."
3.0,I give 3 stars because the pants look like the image however when you get them its not jeans. The material is like jeggins a woman would wear but with a masculine look.  They also run really big so a size down its ok for these.
3.0,"Very much too small. These are not cut for anyone who is plus size, and has a large behind. If you don't have a large behind, they'll probably fit. They did my daughter. However, If you do, don't get these. I have it three stars, because they do for my daughter."
3.0,The quality looked a little better online
3.0,It was alot small than I thought it would be. I guess I didn't pay close attention to the measurements. It cleans my silver jewelry nicely.
3.0,Cute romper but unfortunately had to return because it was too big. I ordered a size small and I'm 5'1 118lbs!
3.0,It's cute but I ordered bisque and what came (just like another poster said) was the pink one.  It's not worth returning but I really would have preferred the color that I ordered.  This is VERY pink.
3.0,"The pad is designed to be only as big as a small bike seat ...the padding looked bigger in the picture to me.  If your intended purpose it to wear while biking and you had a narrow seat, this would work.<br />I received this at a discount to leave my honest review."
3.0,"The feel is soft and nice, but they run large and they are not very warm."
3.0,"I loved the colors and fabric on this dress, but it was way too small on me."
3.0,Material is ok but the length was not what I expected. Large size from other manufacturers is always OK but thus one was not
3.0,Was either this or green one wires cut into sides
3.0,Narrow. Bought the same size and brand in a t-strap that fit perfectly.
3.0,Item arrive with brown spots on ot could not be washed out. But has a great stretch
3.0,I got “red” but it’s not a true bandana red. It’s a mix of red and rust so in my opinion it has too much an orange hue. Also the shade it provides is very minimal as the brim is too short. The hat itself fits but is very snug. Just a half inch more diameter would make it look and feel better. I’m trying to block the sun I don’t really want my head to sweat more because it’s so small. I’ll probably give to my teenage daughter.
3.0,It’s cute and soft on the inside but it’s a bit small. I have to constantly readjust it and pull it down
3.0,"Not very comfortable, but they do protect your eyes really well."
3.0,"I love the quality and price, but it's way too small. I wear a medium, 157lb, 5,7&#34; and ordered and XL it was snug. I ended up returning and buying an 3X so it has more breathing room. Wondering is this a jr size?"
3.0,Ex lg fits like a medium
3.0,Wish it had more pink color 😞
3.0,Cute but gets tangled constantly and seems to be tarnishing quickly.
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs of these shorts (size 38), 2 belted and one drawstring styled. One pair of the belted shorts ripped at the belt loop upon making an adjustment (small tear). The drawstring shorts had the same fit but the drawstrings tightened (tied) up fit a little looser than I would have liked. Overall not a bad pick for the price that was paid."
3.0,"It seems that all the shirts on here run too small so I ordered a bigger size and it fit too big, maybe its just me :/ but overall the quality is good."
3.0,"Amazing dress, looked really nice it's just wrinkly and hard to get the wrinkles out."
3.0,Love the dress-but took about 2 months to get to me
3.0,"Ordered this for my Fiance, he loved the shirt. Giving it a 3 star because the image shows the &#34;green bay green&#34; the product received was a dark forest green. I placed one of my green bay shirts next to it for the color comparison.<br /><br />Ordered 3XXL and it fits my fiance well, I love that it has a little extra length."
3.0,They were ok... not great. They scratched very very easy.
3.0,This is cute. Too long but I cut It a little. My only dislike is the back is weird. I have a butt but with this I look totally different. Flat I would say! Fabric is thin also. I'm 5' 4  140 lbs. and got a medium.
3.0,"There's strings of glue left everywhere, it's seems pretty flimsy...the right side of mask part under the eyes has NO GLUE!...I can fix that, so it's okay.  I use it to go to the gym, since COVID19 is an aerosol contaminate (airborne) and can enter thru eyes. Yes, I had an n95 mask molded to my face then, while molded, adhered to mask, so when I put on the agent76 the n95 covers my face also.<br />BTW: Mask looks good...they should think about putting on clear goggles, and allowing the customer to add their own tint film."
3.0,"Beautiful material and nice color . Unfortunately these are short shorts . Not suitable for an older woman , over 65"
3.0,"I love the pink velvet fabric. Very cute little bag I love it ! I gave it 3 stars because mine was sent slightly damaged, but not bad for the price."
3.0,"There is no flow to the skirt. It appears a little flowy in the images online, but it almost hangs like a pencil skirt. They didn’t use enough fabric to allow this to be very pretty, but the yoke is nice."
3.0,Nice frame😎
3.0,way to big.. material is good
3.0,The neck is too short. Bearly reaches the jaw line. Should atleast reach the shirt line to look better.  The eye holes are at the nostrils. You cant see anything at all. Has a strong odor.
3.0,Cute and comfortable boot. However the metal bats had chips of black scratched off. Boots need better packaging.
3.0,"This shirt fits very well but know that it is mesh! Not see through but I wasn't aware of that when I ordered. It took almost a month to come in, it arrived days after Christmas when it was supposed to come days before.. the logos are correct and vibrant otherwise."
3.0,It wasn't what I expected at all. I thought it would be best quality.
3.0,"Compared to the other jewelry I've received by this brand, this ring looks cheap even if the design is adorable. It looks like one of the rings you'd see in a metaphysical shop on a display for about ten bucks, so keeping that in mind, it is better off as a prop or costume jewelry. However, if you really want a nice ethnic ring, I would suggest splurging on a piece of sterling silver/lapis for it has a similar color."
3.0,"I really dislike the material these are made out of and the colors are a lot more muted than they appear on the picture. They are okay, but I wouldn't but them again."
3.0,"Millions of Indigenous North Americans were slaughtered after 1492. The Federal government, armed with colonial dogma, did it’s best to kill us, and when that didn’t work, they tried to assimilate us by destroying our cultures and forbidding our ceremonies and languages. Native ways were outlawed. Our children were stolen for the purposes of indoctrination. Native people were beaten, arrested, and killed for holding onto their traditions. Newsflash: our sacred objects don’t exist merely to help you gain Instagram followers."
3.0,"It's a very nice top. quality isn't too bad, but it's very small. I'm pretty small and the arms were really tight. I just felt suffocated in it. I ended up giving it away."
3.0,The 40mm band barely fits my wrist and the 42mm band is too wide to fit my watch. You need to make a 42mm band the same width as the 42mm band. I have a medical condition in my arms that make them stay swallon and it’s very hard to find a watch band that is long enough and comfortable.
3.0,Hopefully the print won't come off in the laundry.
3.0,It's exactly as pictured but very cheap feeling. Not worth more than $12.
3.0,Too big for my nostril... sticks out too far personally
3.0,I could have used a large. The small is not my size but somehow I was not able to get a large sent.  I will give them to a smaller friend for a review. The fabric is a little rough but it may soften after washing. They do look well made and are not see thru.
3.0,"The flowers break off easily, but if you take careful and good care of them they will look amazing."
3.0,"Very cute. Good quality but the size is way off. I ordered the 6-12 month size for my 6 month old. This is my 2.5 year old (32 lbs, 37 inches) wearing what arrived. It was way too large for the baby and just a bit small for the toddler.  I'd suggest ordering the next size down, at least. Or choose a different suit."
3.0,i love the appearance of the watch.  it is too large and much too heavy to wear on a small frame as i have.  the watch looks just great.
3.0,Good product but too small even for my petite wife
3.0,"I like the fit and texture of these pants, but I was disappointed when I noticed vthat they arrived with a small hole in the hem that now I must sow."
3.0,"I absolutely love this outfit! however, the material is flimsy and I ripped a button off really easy! Luckily when I sewed the button back on you could not tell! I bought a large as a 5'1 person and it fit perfectly. I maybe could have gone down to a medium"
3.0,It's cute and I'm defiantly going to enjoy it. Just wish I knew they were connected like they are instead of three different necklaces .
3.0,"Bought the 12/14 size. My daughter is 5ft 92lbs. The pants fit great, the top not so much. The top is very large.  Material is silky, little cheap feeling but seems ok."
3.0,"Runs SUPER small.  I'm 5'9, 175 and the large was way too small.  I wore red knee  length leggins that I purchased from here underneath."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it was larger than I expected. The material is not cotton, its weird stretchy...after one wash it lost its entire fit and i didnt like it anymore."
3.0,"I had a Titleist MLB logo which I bought around 5 years ago that I wore to death. It was a nice soft cloth material, which was great but absorbed a lot of sweat on the links and eventually just wore out. I ordered this expecting an exact replacement, but it looks like they've changed the material to a cheaper shiny synthetic. Maybe it lasts longer, but it feels like a cheap souvenir hat as opposed to a quality made product. Buyer beware!"
3.0,"when i try to unhook them so i can wear them it feels like they're going to break, very very flimsy.<br />but, they are very cute on a positive note!"
3.0,Very cool dress but sizes run a bit large.
3.0,"This was tighter than I expected for an XL (my regular size is a L/XL in most clothes) and while it could have worked, the low back ends up being unflattering. I have a low-back dress I was hoping this would work for, but with the slip being so tight (even for shapewear!) it didn't really work."
3.0,It’s ok...
3.0,"Love the pattern in the material and the colors. However, it runs very small and I'm unable to wear it."
3.0,"it OK was ripped from the seams but i only need t for one occasion and cant wait to reorder so it will do, the sewing is flimsy"
3.0,"Although the picture doesn't show, this top will expose your front mid section...  If you don't like that, don't bother.  Material doesn't look so great.  It's just an okay top."
3.0,Smaller than expected but then should have expected that for the price
3.0,Good jacket but fit somewhat small. Had no time to exchange it due to travel.
3.0,It was a soft
3.0,The material looks better in the photo than in reality
3.0,Material is a bit stiff.  Canvas like.
3.0,"It's a nice bra except if it had a little padding, that would be nice"
3.0,I am slightly disappointed with this dress.  I love a good turtleneck dress and this looks adorable in the picture.  It does not look like that in person.  It generally looks like a giant bag dress.  It is shorter than I expected and the sleeves come just slightly short.  The rest of the fit is good so if I ordered larger I don't think that would have helped.  I'm not a huge fan of the fabric and it just kind of falls and is boxy.  The photo shows a little bit more shape to it but that it not at all the case.  Definitely not what I was expecting.
3.0,heavier that expected so they hang in a odd angle.
3.0,"Starting with the positive, the color is beautiful ( I got real my favorite color) and the material is soft.<br /><br />Why I'm sending it back?? I'm 5'8 and 230lbs most of my weight is in my hips and tummy.. and this dress... even with my industrial  strength  spanx has a horribly  place waist band. If it hit on the hips I could love this dress but its mid belly like Whinnie the Pooh. So it must go back."
3.0,"i got the Large size and they are still pretty snug. I am around a 10/12 in pants. Also, one pair had a hole in the seam. The fabric is really soft but the leg kept riding up which is aggravating. Probably wouldn't be an issue if these weren't too small for me."
3.0,"Rough and hollow on the back side. Maybe paint the back to look better. Will not be ordering more of these charms, disappointing."
3.0,This necklace is plastic. Its great if you need something quick but up close you cant even see the words clearly.
3.0,The bras are purchased are indeed my correct size.. but these bras are suffocating against your skin. I wish there was a way to loosen the straps.
3.0,"These shirts are very cute and my 7 yr old son loves them, however they run really small even with me ordering a size up.  They just barely fit. Definitely do not put them in the dryer."
3.0,"The skirt was good quality and was as I expected it to be. It was just too small.. or more, I am too big in the middle. The material is thick and durable. It did have a little more body to it than I wanted. I wanted a more straight skirt, this was more circle to me than A line. Nice item, just wasn't for me."
3.0,"Love the colors, I have purchased xl in this style before and they fit perfectly. This one however is tighter then the others. It is also shorter, I prefer to have longer dresses that touch the ground when I am wearing them. this one sits at my ankles. I am 5'6"" and weigh over 200 lb I will wear this as a nightgown not a summer dress Slightly disappointed as the others I have are longer and fit better."
3.0,"Quality of the sweater is fantastic! The sizing is off though. I know it's supposed to be overly big but I usually wear a large, I gave this to my mother in law who wears a 2x and it was large on her. Oh well... she loves her new sweater!"
3.0,"I am giving this dress a 3 out of 5 stars because the front buttons were off-center on the one that I received.  I'm sure this is a factory/manufacturer error and not true for each of their dresses.  That being said, it is EXTREMELY comfortable and I have worn it twice (despite the awkward button placement).  People do not seem to notice that button misplacement and I have received many compliments on it.  Most importantly, it has pockets.  I would be open to ordering the same dress in other colors, but it I received another one with crooked buttons I would return it."
3.0,Very pretty but not comfortable on me.  I plan to give it away since I've never worn it.
3.0,Very nice little dream catcher! I have mine hanging on a lampshade and am in love!
3.0,so kay.
3.0,Very cute design but definitely sized for a small face.
3.0,The straps were held with a plastic piece and it kept coming undone. It was also too short for my leg length.
3.0,Doesn't stay on my ear the way it's supposed to...
3.0,I bought this for my wife for a birthday present and they are much smaller than average size you buy. If you wear a large then buy an XL because these wont fit.<br />They will ride up really bad also so that is annoying for the wearer.
3.0,Did not like material and look of dress in person.  Returned.
3.0,Bought it as a gift.  They're smaller than I thought they'd be so it's not worn as much as the studs I got him.
3.0,It did reduce some of the glare but I could not get adjusted to everything being yellow.  I found that to be distracting somehow.
3.0,Huge on my face and did not like the look  otherwise great quality for the price... I do like Vuarnet!
3.0,"I ended up returning this product.  Overall, the cuff links are very sharp and appear to be decent quality for the price.  However, upon further inspection, I found nearly an entire white stripe had been missing color and was down to the bare metal."
3.0,It did not turn out to be what I was looking for but will use it some times!  Only use when walking a lot.
3.0,Its not the best and it is fine for a child. I bought it for my seven year old and he didn't mind them. The main criticism of the product is that they do not stay put in the mouth and creates a lot of drool.
3.0,XXL size a bit too sloppy
3.0,it's okay. the quality isn't fantastic but it's not terrible and there are no pearls on the end of the string it's a black bead type thing.
3.0,These look to be comparable to other KN95 masks out there. The ear loops are short so they are uncomfortable. I was able to stretch the elastic by carefully applying heat while pulling. For the price it’s fine
3.0,"Quality is decent for the price. Even the buckle seems like good quality. But seriously, look at that buckle the wrong way once you've got it fitted and the belt unbuckles, particularly when sitting or bending. It's not often enough that I've stopped wearing it... but it's often enough that it's DEFINITELY annoying."
3.0,Cute shirt but the sleeves seems awkwardly short for the body. I have a petite 4 year old and these sleeves are really short. I'm going to wash and then hang dry hoping they can be stretched out to normal length.
3.0,This dress was pretty but very small. I am a size 6 (138lb 5’5”). I ordered  a large but it was still too tight for my liking.
3.0,The romper was made of VERY thin material.<br /><br />The tank was cute...the colors were bright....just needed to be a bit bigger
3.0,quality could be better but they are pretty
3.0,"The fit was smaller than expected, so if you want a lose fit you ha e to go 1 size up. But the fabric feels durable, worth the $."
3.0,"I purchased these as a funny Christmas gift for my husband. Normally, he wears around a medium in boxer-briefs. I ordered the largest size available (large) based on my experience with clothing from China. They didn't fit. He can get them on, but I would guess the Large fits more like a small. I'd also like to point out how long shipping takes for those looking to purchase! I purchased these on November 30th, 2016, and they finally arrived January 7th. The material is really soft and my husband said we would wear them on the regular if they actually fit him! I wish there were bigger sizes available and will purchase in the future if there ever is."
3.0,"It came quick!  It was a little wide and short in fit compared to Other youth shirts.  It was for a school function, so it was purchased as a quick last minute need. So I didn’t expect the quality to be outstanding. However, it fades after the first wash and air dry."
3.0,"I really love Umgee products, and the dress I received is cute. It also fits as expected (I usually wear a size 8 or 10, ordered a Medium). That said, the one on the order page looks different than the one I received. And in particular, the dress featured on the Amazon page has pockets - the dress I received did not. Also, the embroidery design on the dress I received is differentin pattern and shape than the one pictured on the Amazon order page (see photos: the 1st photo is the dress I received, and the 2nd is the image from the Amazon page). I am deciding at this time whether to send the dress back and order again to see if I can get the correct one."
3.0,"Mine arrived with a flat pom-pom. Rounded on the front side, but totally flat on the back side. The Pom-Pom was very hard and impossible to fluff up.  As soon as I touched the hat, I noticed the incredible soft feel of it, but I couldn't deal with the flat pom-pom."
3.0,The arm holes were small and too snug. There looks to be black thread in the picture but there is not. It is all purple only.
3.0,i really like this blouse but im giving 3 stars because i cant wear it. I usually order medium but when it came it a little loose to me. The cloth is really nice though. Good for summer outfit
3.0,Cheap Material  and way over priced . Be aware that these don’t come in pairs.
3.0,"I have not worn them because they are too big for my taste. other than the size, the earrings are very nice."
3.0,exactly what I wanted. The button comes loose though.
3.0,I even ordered larger and it was still to form fitting. It’s super cute but definitely runs SMALL.  I’ll give it a 3 because of fit.
3.0,i have it on for a couple of days and it's start to turn.  Bad quality of material.
3.0,"After reading size chart & reviews I choose to order a large. I’m a 12/14, 5’7 the length was perfect but they run probably 2 sizes smaller. If they had a xl or xxl I would actually order some again but they don’t & im returning them tomorrow. The material was great, length was great, the size was terrible."
3.0,"I went a size larger than I normally wear based on what I read, but ended up returning it for an XL. Its really cute! I love the color's, but definetly run's small."
3.0,"I wish I'd read the reviews before ordering this coat! I had taken the advertisement as truth. This Alboria women's Thickened Parka Coat with hood description is a pipe dream unfortunately. First, it's bold heading states ""Parka"". Hmmm....this coats padding is very thin to ever deserve a parka description as us Americans know a parka to be. Land's End make parka's and this coat isn't even close to the padding and warmth known as a parka. I live in Wyoming and the weather here is extremely harsh year round. The winter's are brutal and I need a coat that can stand up to the high wind storms and the frequent snowstorms. We live high on a hill and the winds come through here like a freight train. This coat would be great for milder winter's or in the spring and fall which are extremely short due to global warming. Second, it's too tight across my shoulders and bum. I definitely went by their size chart and I can only assume it's the actual measurements without extra room for thick winter sweaters. If you're going to make a coat with thin padding, then you need to build in some room for bulky warm clothing underneath. I really like the coat but it needs to be tweaked a bit to demand the price tag. And take Parka off your listing as that's truly false advertising."
3.0,"Ring wasnt what I expected. The picture makes it appear to be more of a fire opal type stone. Still a pretty ring, just different than I expected"
3.0,This was really ill fitting and cheap/thin. Also the seams were already coming apart when i got it. The length was also weird.
3.0,Pretty good 3/4 length leggings for running or working out either by themselves or under shorts. I just don’t like that the waist a bit too big on me while the rest of the leg fit as expected like a normal workout legging so it made it fit weird overall.
3.0,"This sweater is comfortable, but the color wasn't even close to what it showed. I bought the color 'coffee,' a medium brown color. What came was light grey and the accent color was kind of an unappealing mustard yellow color. Returning is too much of a pain & it is comfortable, so I will probably just wear it when I get cool in the house. Very disappointed with the color, as I really liked the brown they posted."
3.0,"Beautiful but cross is very sharp, cannot be worn against skin"
3.0,No es el mismo vestido que vi
3.0,THE WALLET IS NOT SOFT AND THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PUT MONEY INTO THE COMPARTMENTS.
3.0,"They were pretty but much larger and heavier that I expected, had to return them."
3.0,Not much to say- not a full turtle neck more like a mock neck with a frill but comfy as soft enough
3.0,The colors are not exactly what it looks like online.
3.0,I'm a bigger girl and these were too large. They just slide off. They are very comfortable though and very soft. I may order again in a smaller size.
3.0,"although they looked great, they were WAY too big in length. But again, very pretty!"
3.0,"Fits as expected. Well made but the top, front part is &#34;foamy/spongy&#34;, but it was less than $6.00 so I guess I got what I paid for."
3.0,Sizes too small!
3.0,this product fit tooooo tights - I got the right size but not a good fit.
3.0,Great item just a lil disappointed because the color is not as expected its navy blue not purple blue as they described
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:3468f84dd409bb4be80f5db65b261616]] Buena imagen,buen tamaño,solo que una mitad es más oscura que la otra ya puesta es demasiado obvio"
3.0,"They are cute, but look a little cheap in person"
3.0,Love the color . A little small but still gorg
3.0,"It's actually a lovely French clutch.  Good quality leather, great color (red), perfect size and very well crafted.  The only problem is that when you fill all the credit card slots it won't stay closed!  This has been mentioned for over 1.5 years on this Amazon thread and they still haven't changed the design.  All they need to do is lengthen the closure tab by .5 inches and it would be solved.  Obviously they're not reading these comments.  It's a shame b/c it's difficult to find a nice French clutch with a kiss closure for coins.  My current Monsac has seen better days, but it's so awesome I haven't found anything better to replace it.  I've looked everywhere and this is the only one that came close.  I hated to return this one.  I actually left the cards in there for a day or three hoping the closure tab would stretch, as leather often does.  But it didn't.  Bummer.  :(("
3.0,Like that covers face but the elastic in the back is uncomfortable.
3.0,"I liked the idea of this belt, but it's actually a lot shinier and gaudier than it looked in the listing. I can't really see myself ever wearing it."
3.0,"I really liked the style and fit of the dress, but the quality was on the cheap side. One strap totally broke off the first time I wore it. Verdict: cute, but for a one time wear. Probably works best for costume wear rather than a formal event, as you can tell the low quality if you look closely. I ordered a small and it fit well."
3.0,Cute dress but the top back lace is extremely loose
3.0,"Cute shorts, worked for what I needed it for."
3.0,"I like the size of the bag, it is super light and easy to use.  I have two beefs about this bag.  1)  I wish<br />it had a strap or some sort that folded across the items so when you folded the bag your items<br />stay in place.  Much like if you were putting your items over a hanger.  2) It needs a hook of some sort to<br />hang up the hanger.  It is kind of odd that it does not have this feature.  When I folded the bag and was<br />ready to travel I had this feeling that my items would sag within the bag without this.  I don't think they<br />did but a hanger would add some confidence in using this bag."
3.0,"Well the quality is great and I really like it! But I ordered it specifically because it was a cheeseburger, not pizza... don't get me wrong, I love pizza and I don't plan on returning it. None the less it's not what I ordered. Oh well"
3.0,Easily programmed to my Chamberlain but won’t program to my older Liftmaster.
3.0,"It fit kind of small, but fit as expected in the shoulders.  I liked it a lot actually...the hood is a good size, shoulder fit was great, but it was short.  The waist was kind of high.  Had it been lower I would've kept it and given 5 stars."
3.0,I ordered size Youth Medium blue/black for my 10 year old son.  They were HUGE on him.  I decided to go to a local sporting store to try next size down.  Turns out the size Youth Medium sold here is actually an ADULT med.  I may keep it anyway since it fits me well and seems like it will do the job.
3.0,"When brand new these no show socks are great.  However, after first washing, I find them hard to keep on.  I like the idea of no show socks with sneakers, but there may be a better product out there."
3.0,"This choker was MUCH too large for my neck, and I'm a standard sized person (typically I wear a size Medium in a ladies' shirt).  The item does have an adjustable sizing strap like most choker collars, but the size range would fit from a large man to a giant man.  Nowhere in the range of a normal choker necklace.  At it's tightest notch, the choker is 16"" circumference, while my neck 14"" circumference.  For a different necklace style that extra 2"" would be no big deal, but this is suppose to lay flat against the neck.  I've not had this problem with other styles of cheap chokers purchased online or in costume stores."
3.0,The material is very comfortable. Wouldn’t wear in high humidity.
3.0,"This strap fits the bill, but is a little rough on your skin if you wear a sleeveless shirt."
3.0,"Okay, okay. I should have known by the brand name that they would be a hint too much like yoga pants for me, but I really was attracted by the fact that they were pull-on, cropped length and not voluminous. Sadly, I just felt like I was wearing stylish yoga pants and couldn’t see myself wearing them to work or dinner or whatever. They went back. But if you’re looking for stylish yoga pants with a belt loop, these are for you!!"
3.0,"Mehh.... it is fine but the elastic and things made it so it would ride up and not always stay where it's meant to. Fine for one night, probably won't use again."
3.0,Everything was just as pictured I was pleased with it  I should have gotten a larger size
3.0,The grips on the bottom offer little skid prevention.
3.0,"Order a size up! I am a US size 0 and this small is tight fitting. It is as pictured, cute costume but wish I would have ordered a medium. The material is very thin. Of you are wearing for Halloween definitely order a size up so you can wear leggings underneath. I ordered to dress as ""bad guy"" for kids bday party and feel it is inappropriately too tight and do not know If I can comfortably run in it. It did come on time."
3.0,They are very sheer. Can be worn for a pantyhose look
3.0,I'm not sure how to describe the fit of these... they're really snug around the bust but they flare out around the tummy like a pleated skirt. they however absorb sweat without changing colour or feeling super soaked so thats a plus. i still wear them because I'm not gonna let y money go to waste but if you do decide to buy these it's at your own risk.
3.0,"The original lens in my Ray Bans got pretty scratched up, so I needed some new one.<br /><br />I guess I must have an older pair or something (about 4 years), because it was moderately difficult to find replacement lenses. Delighted to find these ones.<br />Purchase was easy, they arrived in a nice little box, and fitting them to the glasses only took a little effort to fit into the frames. A bit more force needed than I really felt comfortable with.<br /><br />On the negative side, the quality of the replacement lens doesn't feel as good as the original. Polarization is strong, but the clarity in brighter light doesn't feel as good. possible of course that I ordered slightly different quality than the original.<br /><br />Overall - delighted to get a replacement set of lenses, but they don't feel quite as good as the originals."
3.0,Runs small. Order 1 size up
3.0,"These jeans are so cute, but the sizing is really awkward. The large was too small, x-large too big."
3.0,It is very nice but a ittle bigger than I wanted. Am keeping it because it is useful but would have preferred a smaller version
3.0,Smaller than I expected...it's like a lunch box....probably will return ..unless I give it away
3.0,It’s an ok item. The gem fell out right out of the package. Hot glued the bow in the middle to save the head band.  To realize the headband is not the same color as the bow on the shirt. You get what you pay for honestly. The tutu is really thin and the shirt is big. Needed this outfit for my daughters 1st birthday photoshoot.
3.0,lenses are too dark.
3.0,"It feels very nice and fits well, gave it 3 stars because the material is very flimsy"
3.0,"shirt is nice and soft,print  looks great doesn't feel<br />sticky or grainy<br />ran a little small but I still love it"
3.0,the grey is not as dark as pictured.
3.0,This dress would have been adorable but it appears to have already been worn.
3.0,I thought the ‘high low’ in the description was referring to the front and back of this cardigan - not the pocket placement. There is about a 3 inch difference from one side of the cardigan to the other :(
3.0,I was expecting the earrings to be a little bit larger maybe the next size up
3.0,"This shirt is cute. It is made out of a very thin material (but in Florida that's perfect). PROBLEM: I'm 5'3"" and this shirt is so long (not just in the back with the high/low style but in the front also). It looked like I was wearing a dress!!! Petite sizes are NOT offered in women's sizes, so you have no choice. The actual size of the shirt was good. Returns are NOT free with this company. I'm really disappointed. Due to being charged for return shipping, I will not purchase from this company again."
3.0,I should have ordered a smaller size because it is too big for my purse.
3.0,Dislike the fact it doesn't hold a lot of bills. Maybe 11-15 comfortably.
3.0,The fabric was not what I expected. The support didn't impress me but I am an underwire girl and I was trying to find a bra without that i might like
3.0,Pretty comparable to a croc.  Durable. Fit well.
3.0,La tela es buena es de buen material simplemente lo devolví por que llego un poco grande
3.0,"Good quality, but way too big. Ordered large and got 5x."
3.0,"The shirt appears to be a printed Tshirt, but is actually a nice tshirt with a vinyl eagle applied. The shirt itself is soft, and great quality. The eagle appliqué, however, looks cheap and will probably not hold up well. Wash instructions say “professional dry clean”."
3.0,The shape is good but the material is too thin. It is better to wear one more inside for secure.
3.0,"It’s ok , runs true to size . Looks like the picture ."
3.0,"I ordered the largest size available and the pants are tight in the waist and end about 6 inches above my ankles.<br />However, they are very well made, stylish and cute. Just doesn't fit my 5'8&#34;, 160 pound body."
3.0,Really pretty but after a few hours.... Green green green finger.
3.0,It’s cute but the legs are too wide for me
3.0,Ordered a small but still was a lil large in size maybe I should have ordered a xs
3.0,"The top itself seems well made, but it runs large and you have to have super long arms or it'll just hang on you, like when you were a child and put in your mom's clothes.<br />Sent back!"
3.0,"The men's ring is really pretty, but the women's ring isn't very pink at all. I was really hoping it would have a little more color. They are pretty much as shown in the picture, so I guess it's my own fault. The rings are good quality and you are getting what you see."
3.0,"I really like these earrings, but the clips are so tight they really dig into my skin. After an hour they hurt really bad. But other than that I don't have any issues with them."
3.0,Belt lasted 18 months and then braids started coming apart. Wore this belt on average 3 days per week. Disappointed as it did not hold up well. The leather straps used for the braids are too thin and not very durable.
3.0,"There are places on the ring where it feels rough, and could snag on clothing.  The ""Lantern"" symbol in the front is elongated, so does not appear as a tru Lantern ring.  I am keeping as a Novelty peice that I ordered for the 80th anniversary."
3.0,"I loved these for about one week of wearing, but after that amount of time, they seem to break. Two so far have broken where they attach to the Fitbit."
3.0,Color fades quickly but cute.
3.0,"Had to return. Despite measurements listed, it's way too small. Asian sizing, go figure. Otherwise, it's beautiful, but not worth $40. Just wish they would make it in US/AU sizes."
3.0,It's lighter quality. Narrower than expected. Runs a bit small. I am a size 11 but the 12 also fits tight.
3.0,"It works, takes a long time to heat up. It’s hot or miss whether I feel the heat on my shoulders, but low back and abdomen seem to be consistent."
3.0,"I bought an xlarge and should have ordered a large.  Didn’t return it because it is a baggy, slouchy shirt anyway and I really would only wear it around the house.  For reference, I am 5’8”, 190 lbs, I wouldn’t order another one."
3.0,"This is a cute idea, but the earrings are too large."
3.0,"This is a good dress for getting chores around the house. It is longer than I had expected, and has an awkwardly placed seam around the upper calf/shin. It is not LINED, so it is see-through. Feels cheaply made, kind of like wearing a curtain or table cloth. HOWEVER, the smocking is on the tighter side so it at least gives some shape and form. I say go for it if you need a cheap house dress."
3.0,"They are soft, but they are huge and are also very slippery. I suppose they are supposed to be large so that they can capture your body heat."
3.0,Three star be because for the price the skirt material could have been of better quality. A very nice pattern and the lace though synthetic is of good quality. Wish the skirt quality was better than the heavy synthetic and that it draped well.. qite heavy and stiff and was a pain to take out the wrinkles
3.0,Definitely a raincoat. It's nothing fashionable though.<br />It's very roomy.<br />The length is nice and long. Throw some rainboots on and you'll stay as dry as the desert 🏜<br /><br />I know that to some people... raincoats are not meant to be fashionable or designer.<br /><br />But that's what I was aiming for in this case.<br />It does it's job but it has nothing else to rave about.<br /><br />It came packaged pretty good in a small bag. And after I used it I was able to fold it up and put it in another bag that was a little bigger and had a zip-lock (after it had dried off completely).
3.0,"This swimsuit doesn’t have any breast support or band so if your breasts aren’t perky on their own, it’ll make it flat. The leg is also high cut."
3.0,So tiny and small
3.0,"This purse was way too small for what I needed. I’m used to carrying a small crossbody, but this was more like a child’s purse. I ended up handing it off to my daughter. It is very well constructed, but just too small."
3.0,Beautiful good pant
3.0,"They look great, but mine broke the first day i wore it. Not recommended to wear with much physical activity."
3.0,"Gloves certainly kept my hands warm. My only problem was that on first use, one of the straps to tighten the gloves tore. Other than that, they’re pretty solid gloves"
3.0,Great buy. Sizing a little smaller than other colours. Thick luxurious material.
3.0,"I'm a female with what I would consider average-sized wrists and these bands have to be pulled as tight as they can go to get my Coros Pace watch secure on my wrist. I really want to like these, but the size just isn't quite right. For reference, I got the black/reflective black set."
3.0,"The fit was not the best for me -- I ordered a large (12-14), but the armholes were way too big and it was also too big in the chest area.  But it was certainly pretty."
3.0,"It was okay long enough to take maternity pictures in! The material is horrible! It’s so stiff, has no stretch! I felt like I would have been better off using my pillow case"
3.0,You get what you pay for. Honestly the small hole forming on the side proves that it is not authentic.
3.0,"Beautiful vibrant print. However the fabric is so thin that even with a bra, it’s too revealing to wear in public. Had to move it to the pajama drawer. Very disappointed."
3.0,"They're good quality - I just, apparently, don't know my size. LOL"
3.0,"Color is as pictured. Hat is large, but too thick and stiff to slouch like it does on the model. I've tried. Gave it to my boyfriend"
3.0,looks better in the pics
3.0,"GREAT HAT JUST NOT FOR MY BIG HEAD, NEW ERAS FIT BETTER, THESE WERE MADE FOR OSTRICH!"
3.0,"The leggings were 80% squat proof. The fabric material is nice and soft but I have a bit of a belly and when I squat, the part of the pants that is supposed to hug it all tight and together, does not hold up. Which is ultimately the reason why I will be returning the product."
3.0,"I purchased these pants for my gladiator sized husband. 6’4, 300lbs. He usually wears shirts sizes 3XLT for length and pant sizes 44x32, 3xl shorts and sweats. He needed some hiking pants so I ordered the 5xl. Oh no.. these are extremely small. For reference a pair of shorts that fit him, laying flat measures 24in across. These pants measure 16 across the waist. Outer seam is 42in. Inseam is 31….. I am 5’0” 160lb woman, hips 44 and these pants were only about 1 size too big, and slightly too long. If your petite, or thin, these would be great for you. If your looking for true big and tall sizes look elsewhere."
3.0,The clasp is no good. Broken already. Piece is beautiful yes but can’t wear it.
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected...perhaps I did not do the measurements correctly.  Amazon, please suggest that sellers include pics with rulers/measurements included...buyers will be able to better predict/see what is actually being measured (e.g., diameter from the inside of the hoops vs. the diameter from the outside), as well as the width of the hoops.  They were smaller and thinner than what I wanted; but the quality appears to be good."
3.0,"We couldn't use this product, the frame lens screws were frozen in place. Someone should check to make sure all parts of the frames are functional before they send them out to a customer"
3.0,"I am 5’10 and weigh around 140lbs. I got a size medium. The torso part is too short on me, it stops right above the “belt line”. When pulled over the hood is very rectangular and boxy, and I don’t know if my head is too big or if I just have a lot of hair, but it’s very tight. Will be returning. I recommend a size up."
3.0,"Size much smaller than anticipated, tighter on the shoulders, nice colors through especially the white and black"
3.0,"They are a little longer then they should be, but maybe I have small ears!? Over all I liked them and will buy them again. Sucks with wear a mask rn and don’t wear a hat otherwise they just come off the top of your ear."
3.0,"Cute, but one wouldn’t open."
3.0,"Love the look, however there are really hard to close, and not sure the close right so I'm a little afraid I may loss one, so I don't wear the too much"
3.0,"I was happy to see these as they were less expensive than another brand I purchased on Amazon.  They appeared to be nearly identical in appearance except these had made in china wording printed inside.  No big deal - this didn't effect the appearance at all.  However, when I tried them on the fit was nearly as good as the pricier brand.  I got the uni-boob look with less support than the other brand.  They may work fine for smaller cup sizes, but I was not a fan."
3.0,I looks to be an old watch necklace. I have seen on other sites and found one in my mother's jewelry box. I would not call it a Harry Potter time turner at all though. It is a cool vintage watch necklace regardless.
3.0,"So, I ended up getting an XL since it read that it fits small. The bottoms fit fine (I have naturally thicker thighs and a matching booty), but the XL top was too big (I'm a 36C). I tried the top with and without the padding and it just fits a little too loose. The pattern is alright. Not as cute as the picture but still kinda cute. I bought the bikini to mix and match with my other suits anyway so I'm not too worried about it. I tried wearing the top to the beach, though, and had to keep checking that I wasn't falling out."
3.0,Wish it had more support.  I wear it on days when I'm relaxing at home.  It is comfortable.
3.0,The blouse front was unbelievably loose. I had to take it in quite a bit. It ended up working for my daughters Halloween costume.
3.0,"Not like the photos. The front hem is short and straight across, the back has a short tail. It's VERY fitted. I'm 5'7 and 165lbs- not a small girl but pretty average. I ordered a large because I wanted that looser, more relaxed fit.  With size large the buttons barely close around my boobs (small c cup)!!! It's also fitted around the waist. The shirt itself isn't terrible, but it's not at all what is advertised."
3.0,"This is the third fossil watch I've given a go within the past few years.  They've all had issues and I returned all but this one.  Because I can't!  The time every week or so just delays 20 min for no reason.  I only realize it every other week or so when I get in my truck to go somewhere and look at the time on my truck radio and yell 'damn, I'm late!'  It looks cool for sure but the band is very soft leather and the notch I use is becoming a large ellipse (as opposed to the nice round hole punched in the leather) quickly.  Fossil watches used to be great in the 90s.  Now they seem to look cool and offer great style sensibility but offer crap functionality in my experience.  Hope other people have better luck!"
3.0,"look ok...a little smaller than i hoped they would be, have to see what my wife thinks after christmas"
3.0,"Its a nice, bright orange color. Easy to see. But the vest itself is too big. The adjustments don't help much. Have to wear a belt over this."
3.0,I ordered an extra size up and it's still too small. These seem like Asian sizing. I gave mine to a tinier friend.
3.0,I still like them for a theme party celebrating travel to Hawaii. They're just fun jewelry.
3.0,"Not great, but not bad. They look better online than they do in person, but I would not say they are junk."
3.0,Some of them are to heavy.
3.0,"I've been looking for wide belts to go with Summer Maxi Skirts that I also wear as dresses - something to add the finishing touch. This looked cute and simple enough that it would match multiple items. On the plus side, this seems like a very sturdy belt. The thickness of it alone is not at all flimsy and it could definitely pass for real leather if someone wasn't inspecting it closely. The color is nice and warm, as well. However, it was a little TOO stiff and there really wasn't much give. Which may be exactly what someone else is looking for, but not so myself. Also, it was slightly wider than what I was expecting, but that is purely a matter of preference, not anything against the belt itself.<br /><br />I am 5'5, 150lbs and my waist is where I carry all my weight. Usually, my pant size varies between 30/31 or size 10. I ordered the Medium and it fit right at the second notch. I could probably tighten it and fit at the third, but then it would just be cutting into my belly tub. In summary, Decent Price, Nice Color, Sturdy construction. Cons, Super stiff and wider than what I was expecting. Not a bad purchase, just not for me."
3.0,The little zipper in the front pocket has come off.
3.0,"Good product, I am 5 11 average build and it's large on me. Found no defects. Tools wear holes in pockets way too fast and my gray reflective material is not the same as picture. Will not count as PPE so if you need that buy something else."
3.0,I got this shirt in a large I typically wear 12/14. 38DDD chest for reference. This fit ok but I just didn’t like the buttons going up the arms on each side.
3.0,The bottoms fit great and love the way the connect on the sides. Feel good. The top however was a little smaller than I would have liked.  Ordered an XL for 40D (maybe a borderline DD) and feel these are C cup material at best.
3.0,Too tight... it'll work for my event though.
3.0,Fits a bit awkwardly
3.0,"I bought as a gift for my sister who is a tennis player. I liked the inscription but it’s written so small you can hardly see it.  As a stocking stuffer, it will be OK."
3.0,"The fabric is soft, stretchy, and see through! I am going to wear a black slip underneath to prevent showing my underwear. I will probably wash it by hand and let it air dry. I am 5’3, 180 lbs and purchased an XL, and it runs a bit small."
3.0,Looks nicer in picture than in person
3.0,"Tops big, shorts run small. Spaghetti strap sewed on wrong on the top-twisted."
3.0,"I bought a small as that's what my 6yr old wears,  He won't be able to wear these pants for a year, maybe 2.  They are at least 6&#34; too long."
3.0,Color green or what I expected.  Too large
3.0,"Purchased this handbag in February and today 4th July one of the straps busted, such disappointment I really liked the handbag."
3.0,"I'm just shy of 5'7&#34;, and these aren't quite long enough. Other than that, I like them. Modernmiss, please look at inseam length on your pants and offer choices! I would need about 32&#34; inseam for correct length, and I'm pretty average . FYI, THE LENGTH MEASUREMENT PROVIDED IS FROM TOP OF WAISTBAND TO ANKLE."
3.0,Nice material a little short!
3.0,The knit is pinker than it looks in the photos and the knit is a little frayed. It looks like someone took a brush to it
3.0,Much thinner than I expected. Fits correctly but I expected it to be more...flowy.
3.0,"Was looking for leggings for my 9 yo daughter. These are NOT girls leggings. They ended up fitting me. I am 5'4&#34;, 135# and they fit me quit well. But my daughter is disappointed that they do not fit her."
3.0,"This is a nice wallet but do not be fooled but the ""small"" description.  I bought this a month ago and it is a normal full sized wallet.  Definitely not going in the front pocket."
3.0,"A little stiff, it has a little bit of dry glue in the lock.. but is nice"
3.0,El lazo llegó todo sucio m.
3.0,The band definitely looks more pink in the picture.  When I opened it I was disappointed as it look black and plain gold!  I liked that it came with the tools to adjust the band myself!
3.0,"Have not worn. But I am quite sure it will provide sufficient coverage for those days that require this coverage. The reason I gave it 3 stars , is it is not silk, rather a heavier type of material."
3.0,"I ordered these because I was having a really hard time finding this color sock in the stores. They fit well and were a good weight, but I had to return them because they were very scratchy, thus very uncomfortable. This is why I docked them two stars, and it's why I can't recommend them."
3.0,"Loved the high waisted bottoms, they are very flattering to my apple body.  The top fit, but was not supportive enough for DD breasts.  I had to donate the top to Goodwill unfortunately."
3.0,"It is not bad, as on 35$... But does not protect from beam lights on 100%. Maybe 70%... That's  why 3 stars..."
3.0,Not true to size. Size up!
3.0,"the selling pictures show disney characters but when item came in, there were no disney charaters at all.  there were also no variety of characters for both boys and girls only boy's characters.  the item was cheaply put together that some of the glue holding the characters onto the bracelets gave way and the characters fell off.  overall, it's usable and puts a smile on the kids but only after gluing the characters back on.<br />-1 star for no variety of characters for both boys and girls<br />-1 star for quality of products"
3.0,"it does not fit as snug as i hoped it would but i still think it is pretty, and i am enjoying wearing it"
3.0,"Fit okay, I thought they were gonna be short shorts (like i wanted) not the case. Be aware there is no button in the front so make sure to wear something under if your not using them for (sexy santa time."
3.0,Good product. Hoping it was thicker but not bad.
3.0,I LOVE the locket and I loved the chain when I got it as well. I haven't had any problems with the locket although I have only wore it once since the chain kept breaking.
3.0,Doesn't look like the pic on Amazon. Also very thin material. Loose in odd places.
3.0,I don't like the way it looks on me
3.0,"It's fine but the least used of my cheap watches.  The light as shipped only lights 1 corner of the screen, providing little benefit, and the screen itself is otherwise pale.<br /><br />Seems durable enough so far, haven't tested water resistance, but other than being a particularly small watch (something I value in this market of chunky watches) it doesn't offer anything better than competition unless you really like the look.<br /><br />I got on sale for $4. It gives me $4 worth of watch."
3.0,"Somehow the photo makes the earrings appear thicker, wider than they actually are, a disappointment."
3.0,"Fits great, but not supportive enough. I have a large chest and the girls aren't getting enough love with these bras. Plus one of there sports bras doesn't fit the same as the others."
3.0,"Not mid rise shorts, more like high-wasted if you dont want the crotch to drag to the ground which is a same because they were very cute."
3.0,"The costume is nice,  but it came with a small rip at the back.  Since I ordered so close to the event, returning was not an option."
3.0,"It was too small for my head. And for a thin piece of fabric, I thought it was  overpriced."
3.0,I expected a higher quality flip flop with better support for this price
3.0,"Very long, a little too long for me"
3.0,"The shoe was cute, too narrow at the top"
3.0,"16 of the charms I received had backs that were loose or off center. A few of them were dirty. Some were thinner made than others. If all of the hocus pocus charms had been in good condition I would've just kept them. I returned for a refund, no problem. I might try re-ordering but not anytime soon since they wouldn't arrive before Halloween."
3.0,The leather looks and feels like it’s well made except for the fact that it requires quite a bit of an effort when trying to put in or pull out credit cards from this wallet. The cards fit a little too snugly.
3.0,They do look just as advertised and look pretty cool on HOWEVER i don't see these lasting. They are flimsy..i was afraid opening the legs that they wouldbreak off. Don't just throw these in a bag or misplace them bc 1 and done. Still look cool though.
3.0,"Goggles are OK, ear plugs don't seem to work too well."
3.0,"The quality of this dress is good; you could definitely wear it to work or out for a business happy hour.  The sizing is very small.  I am 5'10&#34;, 160 and usually wear a ten.  The large on my was WAY too small.  I think I would have needed an XXL to have it fit.  The length, however, was perfect.  Hit right above the knee."
3.0,"Comfy, has the pocket for you to reach in and adjust the pads after washing which is convenient. Does NOT keep things still"
3.0,Like tge dress. 3 stars for damage on sleeve.
3.0,"Pretty but thought they would be bigger, went ahead and returned them. Months later I look at my account and find I never received a refund. So no earrings and no money back."
3.0,The material used to make these glasses are very stiff - making the fit uncomfortable for the most part. Not that glasses are a movable object - but there should be some playability in the frame to make adjustments - these do not have that ability.
3.0,Mouth don't move as stated
3.0,"Beautiful and I love it except it's to big for what I had in mind, but I will use it for another purpose."
3.0,"The magnetic one is pretty large... And it really starts to hurt very badly after only a few minutes. I can't wear it for very long unfortunately. I really like the little one, tho. Looks cute and no one can tell it's fake!"
3.0,Cute but small...Im sad I need a 3xl for fullness.
3.0,"The knot was sewn with the seam facing out, so it looks not quite right. The rest of the shirt is fine."
3.0,"Large carry-on bag! The carry-on is listed as 21 inches and other review feedback doesn't mention the actual size. The carry-on is over 23.5 inches including the wheels. This exceeds the limit of 22 inches for the two main airlines I use, Delta and United. I returned my order.<br /><br />The luggage set is very good for the price, all three bags have nice features including a shoe pocket and a built-in ziplock for liquids."
3.0,"It doesn't look like the same one the model is wearing. Smaller and not as full. It did shed, but not too badly. No smell that some people complained about."
3.0,Looked exactly as pictured. Mask had a very strong chemical like smell that would not go away
3.0,"Wanted to like it, but it was too small and to cheeky for this girls tukas."
3.0,It was nicely made. Top material to heavy for summer. I wear a size 10 and ordered the large. The dress was somewhat small for me.
3.0,"Beautiful,  and fully lined.  But even with the lining you can see everything through this snug fitting dress.  This was a gift,  I'm slightly larger than the recipient and she kept it so I guess it's ok.  But if it was for me I'd have returned and tried a larger size to see if it made a difference."
3.0,"Great toddler socks for new walkers, but the designs are pretty ridiculous. It would be much better to have solid white, black, or gray."
3.0,"I like the longer length. I like the soft berry color, and the price. However, the cut is strange. I got an XL and the bust area is shaped for a large busted person and does not fall straight from the shoulder. You can see it if you magnify the bust area in the photo, though it may be more pronounced in the larger size. If you are not large busted there is a lot of extra area there. I had to take it in with a curved tuck along the stitch like. It works but its not great."
3.0,It's ok. Nothing special.
3.0,loose treads throughout shirts
3.0,"The color, shape, and design look great but the quality of the fabric is poor."
3.0,"They work fine.  A bit difficult to put on, but got easier when I used a rounded tool to help push them in."
3.0,Too much gaping for my liking.
3.0,It’s cute but the fit is ok. A little tight in the waist and the drawstrings don’t really work
3.0,"The fit was right, the length is right, (I'm 5'7&#34;) and the weight is okay.  I like the dress, but was disappointed in the way I looked in it."
3.0,Cheap cord glad I had a better one!cute cat medallion
3.0,Meh. It's ok. A bit tight on my 36DD boobs.
3.0,The crotch was too high up
3.0,Some of them were broken on arrival. So<br />E broke when making jewelry
3.0,Smaller than expected; material see-through
3.0,It was cute but too small. I ordered a medium which is what I usually where.
3.0,"It's  okay as a basic layering cami with a reversible neckline. I like that part, otherwise it offers no support. If you are expecting a shelf bra or a light support shape wear garment, this isn't it. At least not the one I received. The fabric is soft and stretchy. Not see through unless really stretched, but the medium did not stretch out much on me. I have a slender build. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting based upon the product description so I am a little bummed about that. Plan on wearing it tucked into to something because it rolls up pretty bad."
3.0,"The cut of this dress is super cute, and it has POCKETS! The skirt is full and cuts a great silhouette. However, I returned because the fabric itself is not forgiving - it's not a lined dress. I would definitely recommend sizing up. (Maybe twice if you want a looser, less clingy fit on top.)"
3.0,"Meh, love love loved it at first but had it for like 2, maybe 3 months and it's already fading really bad. Hopefully the replacement I ordered holds longer. Loved everything about it except for that honestly."
3.0,I am 5’7” and the skirt was not a full maxi skirt on me
3.0,"Afraid to wear this in the water because I'm afraid that it will become see through, and the bottoms are very thick around the hips. Don't want to know what the tan lines would look like from this."
3.0,Order a size up. I wanted to keep this but I won't be able to wear it. Returned.
3.0,Leigh’s weight however ran a little small.
3.0,Runs good sized on the top. Can't be too chesty or you will fall out. Overall: I like it !
3.0,Very pretty. A bit to high for my 7 year old.  She would walk funny in them!
3.0,clings to the belly
3.0,"Very flimsy construction, very lightweight.  I guess you get what you pay for, but wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,okay quality but huge for a small face
3.0,"Playing wore off fast and copper under it tends to turn most people green, myself included.<br />Other than that “love it”"
3.0,"So there is a hilarious episode of the Golden Girls where Sophia curses an old rival and says: ""May your socks always slouch into your shoes!"" And these sadly do just that for me when I wear them. They are toasty absolutely, but the slipping down into my shoes is terrible! I do not get it. I gave a pair to a friend to try and she had no issues at all with them slipping, so maybe I just need a different size or something?<br /><br />So let's discuss how they are as slippers instead because they get used as such to avoid the sock slouching down issue. They work well as around the house slipper socks actually. I think they are very warm but I just do not like how they actually felt on my feet. I gave three stars for warmth and durability but for me, I am really picky about my socks and these were not favorites. I would not order them again."
3.0,"Really cute top, but runs small.  I'm keeping it for #weightloss goals,  I really wanted to wear it with shorts on vacation next week,  but that's not happening."
3.0,"I feel that these yoga pants run a bit small. I am a pretty curvy girl and thought by buying a XXL they would be a little lose fitting. They are definitely tight and support all areas. I did read they were see thru, but wanted to give them a fair chance.  I have to wear black spandex shorts under the yoga pants."
3.0,I bought this mask because I read a review that stated if you take out the lining you can't tell that it is out and you can breathe easily while wearing it. A big plus for a person who has asthma and cannot wear a mask but sadly due to politics some people forget that there are those who truly can not wear a mask. When the item arrived I removed the lining and I was able to wear the mask without it being noticeable (even if you are really close up) that there are holes throughout the mask. My only negative is that it is quite big and gives that duck beak vibe because of the seam. I also don't really love that it rubs the back of my ear while wearing it because it causes my ear to get sore as I have to wear it for 12 hours at a time.
3.0,Cut very small for a petite woman.
3.0,i wish they'd made this in navy color
3.0,This is not a bag for men. This is a small leather bag that a female would carry.
3.0,"This were very tiny, I really couldn't use them and just gave them out in party bags."
3.0,I wish that the bra was a little more supporting me but overall a very good swimsuit.
3.0,"I ordered these because it said pockets. They have NO pockets. I'm too lazy to send them back but I will start verifying before I order again.<br /><br />&#34;92% Cotton and 8% Spandex<br />• Made from 92% cotton and 8% spandex<br />• With a flap over pocket on right side for holding smartphone<br />• Soft,comfortable material,machine washable<br />• Mid rise waist, block color mixed design<br />• It is perfect for normal road running. And also for Yoga, fitness, exercise or workouts&#34;"
3.0,This bra is really pretty. Fit fine first day. When I slept in it though it dug into my back really bad..
3.0,"These are my favorite hats!  The hat was bigger than I expected.  Nothing like the news boy hat's I've bought previously while shopping in store.  If in person,  I wouldn't have bought these hats.  I also wasn't happy with the gray color. It looks blue gray than gray."
3.0,I get it hung up on stuff ~ but it is what it is ~ I’ll like it much more when gets worn look ~
3.0,Keeping it as I am loosing weight.
3.0,"Not as much room in this as I'd hoped but it's alright,"
3.0,This is cute but please be aware it is small
3.0,"I was looking for yoga pants that I could wear at work because I like to do standing exercises/stretches at my desk.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 150lbs.  While I am mostly pear shaped, I do have a little extra belly weight. I wear a size 12 pant, which is usually a Large but I erred on the side of caution and ordered the XL, 31&#34; inseam.<br /><br />I like the pants, but don't love them and I soooo wanted to love them.  The material is fantastic quality, very comfortable. They also look like dress pants and so far all my coworkers have been surprised when I tell them I am wearing yoga pants.  The reason I don't love them is that they come in very noticeably at the top of the waist, leaving me with a mini muffintop.  This might not be a problem for women who don't have extra weight around their midsection, but it is for me.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this pair because I usually wear a sweater at work, which will hide the muffintop. I just wish the waist either came up a little higher or had a different, more forgiving waistband.<br /><br />Update 1:  I took a star off because I've only been wearing them for half a day and already the tight waistband is a nuisance. These pants really are only geared towards women with a certain shape.<br /><br />Update 2: By the end of my workday, I couldn't take it anymore. I noticed there's a hidden draw-string inside the waist, so I took scissors and very slowly and very carefully started to cut the top elastic band that was cutting into my belly, trusting that if it got too loose, I could use the drawstring. Halfway through cutting the elastic, the waistline expanded just enough that it was comfortable.  I swear, it's like a whole new pair of pants. The mini-muffintop is gone! I feel no discomfort! and now that I know about this little trick, I'm very tempted to buy another pair.  Yay!"
3.0,Crop top raises above belly. Not flattering at all if you’re round in the mid section.
3.0,I didn’t read the size but they come really small
3.0,"I absolutely love the style of these gloves, but will wind up giving them away as Christmas gifts as they are far too small for my typically small, and very average American sized forearm."
3.0,The Kunias where very small but the rest was fine honestly worth it
3.0,The hook broke on the strap in less than six months. But I love Myra bags!
3.0,"Great idea, just didn't work out!  It didn't last very long for me.  The battery is already dead.  I assume the light stayed on all the time."
3.0,"The stone looks beautiful pink on the picture, but in the reality is mainly white than pink ."
3.0,Well right by the shoulders it's kinda small
3.0,"I ordered the large, but it fit more like a petite medium. I gave it to my mom since it fit her perfectly. She seems to like it."
3.0,"Cute sweatshirt, I like the style, but the orange is a lot brighter than it appears in the photo."
3.0,"The seems are not exactly done well, but they are cute and warm."
3.0,"Was good quality for the price but extremely small. I ordered the largest size and it still wouldn't fit over my shoulders. I did, however, give to a friend and she liked it a lot."
3.0,wrong item received but the seller refunded me so i'm okay with the service... also i like these frames because i thought that the arms popped off and on easily.. these are knock offs so theyre screwed on /:
3.0,Cute.. wish it would have fit
3.0,"They sent me the wrong color, which was a bummer.  The fabric is stiff and cheap feeling.  The outside is corduroy, but the inside felt weird.  I'm 5'6"" 230 lbs and the XXL fit loose, but wasn't overly baggy.  I ordered the XL and it was too tight in the arms."
3.0,"The reflection in these are not as you'd expect, and make the sunglasses look cheap. They seem pretty fragile too. You get what you pay for."
3.0,The skirt is cute and comfortable but it is NOT navy blue as shown. It is purple.
3.0,Most accurate metal crown you can find as close to a replica. Invest in superglue. I have glued back on so many of the smaller stones that they no longer shine. Wish they stayed on. If they did I would have bought a second.
3.0,Cute shirt but a ladies small looks like a child's small :-(
3.0,"I ordered 3 kinds of these but only got 2...I can't really tell what is missing, but I have to find the right holders for these now. The first tie I ordered mermaid scale disks, they were in a setting and went right on a pair of earrings. I loved them so much I got carried away buying more, but I should have planned better. The low stars is more my fault than theirs, they are really fun but use sparingly for the best effect."
3.0,"Very sheer and boxier than I expected.  I am 5'9&#34; and 130 lbs and it feels very square, not long like a tunic top. It definitely doesn't go down over my butt like the image."
3.0,Go a size up if your man like his boxers loose. They are really cute but fitted.
3.0,"Muy abrigador, excelente para frío de 0 grados en adelante, mejor pedir una talla más grande, ejemplo (mi hija tiene 1 año, pedí de 2 años y le quedo perfecto), al ser el abrigo muy acolchado, es incómodo, para cargarla, ponerla en el coche, incluso para que juegue... a la próxima no compraré impermeable, muy poco práctico y gordo..."
3.0,The turtle charm itself was very cute. However I've had it in for a month now and the turtle charm has fall off twice. I tried to close the hole up again where tbe turtle charm sits but it fell out again and this time idk where the turtle is. But it is very cute and fits perfectly.
3.0,had to wear a bigger top because this top was to small
3.0,"I got the largest size available. My hands are not usually XL (smaller) but these are tight and hard to get on and off. They’re also not very warm. However, if all you need is some basic gloves that allow touch-screen usage, this should suffice. The whole finger-tip for index and thumb are capacitative material; very easy to use and reliable touchscreen usage."
3.0,Wait sunglasses a regular basis works well if you gradebook and did you clear vision and I would recommend you bye
3.0,"I've noticed that clothes from Asia/China run much smaller than clothes from other places, Keep that in mind when ordering,"
3.0,nice look. wish it was a little longer
3.0,"The design is cute and well executed, but it is too thin and not well fitted so I don't use it if i think I could be exposed to airborne droplets.<br />Also i am somewhat reluctant to washh it as the initial hot water turned black so i think it would fade."
3.0,"Pendant came quickly and safely.  Liked the pendant, but small for my taste.  I like large pendants, but it is well made."
3.0,I thought it was soft but put it on and it came down to my lips. I have a small head but that was a little to big for me. I sent back because it was a little to much $ to keep something to big.
3.0,"Colors look great, however the strap is very stiff and feels abrasive"
3.0,"This is the best G shock that Casio came out with.  It comes with several different colors for the display and case & band.  For this yellow one (personally I like yellow color), it is too ""mustard"" yellow and it seems like it gets dirty super fast.  I rather stick to black or navy case/band G-shock."
3.0,"Material is a bit thin and cheap. It also had loose strings I had to cut off. This item also runs a bit large, which is odd, because most Allegra K items are a bit small. I keep thinking I will wear it but have not yet and I have had for about a year."
3.0,They are ok but need to be larger
3.0,The fit is good but these leggings are shiny. The fabric is very high gloss and thick. I would have preferred a thinner more matte finish..
3.0,Had to return because the zippers broke before I even got to wear them.
3.0,"Good for a low-effort costume, but I wouldn't wear this as an actual hoodie. The fabric is quite thin and probably wouldn't keep you very warm in weather colder than 60 degrees. It does fit pretty well on me though, so that's nice."
3.0,"Great suit, just way too small."
3.0,Very comfortable but the seems started unraveling in the buttocks and crotch after the very fist use
3.0,"Returned it, sizes run smaller than size chart.  It wasn't a pure white color it was egg shell in color.  Very see through material even with the lining material. You would have to wear a black slip.  Thank goodness I ordered 2 dresses the white and the burgundy in medium. The burgundy fits a perfect medium, don't know why the white ran smaller."
3.0,"I really love the print and the colors, but the skirt is a simple cotton skirt and is not worth nearly $70."
3.0,My husband said it looks too baggy and hides my figure. I like the material and design. It's well made. I'll just wear it with a short jacket for less baggy look
3.0,Did not like fit...returned.
3.0,Too thin. Not feel protected.
3.0,"So I love how this sweater fits and feels. It's lightweight but not sheer, the sleeves are perfect length, the fabric is soft.. And at first glance it looked wonderful. I tried it on, pulled it straight down and fell in love. Started to pack up the shipping package and put it in the trash and glanced in the mirror again. With me moving around, the shirt moved just enough that the stripe was now across the bottom of my bust instead of accentuating the thinner area of my natural waistline.<br />If I decided to wear this and have it look right, I would have to spend my whole day tugging and pulling it back into place. So I returned it.<br />I'm sure that it looks amazing on smaller women, but that stripe just made me look larger than I am. If this shirt were available as a solid (or even a heather), I'd buy it in a heartbeat.<br />For reference, I always wear a pattiboutik large, and this large fit perfectly. I'm 5'5, 39-29-39, 150lbs."
3.0,I was hoping for a little on the business casual side. It's way more casual than business.
3.0,looks cute but kinda hurts
3.0,"I always love the way these look, but the paint chips off so quickly and they don't last that long."
3.0,Very pretty but some of the chips came off when I opened it. But for the price point it is a very nice necklace and it came surprisingly quick considering where it was shipping from.
3.0,"So this review has two parts: One for the glove itself, the other for the touch screen functionality.<br /><br />The glove itself is very nice. It fits perfectly (definitely use their size chart and measure your hand before purchasing), is a really nice and soft leather, and the interior is knit and cozy. The stitching is perfect and there are no loose threads. I haven't owned them long enough to comment on the durability and how well they hold up to constant use, but they appear to use similar materials to other gloves in this price range. All-in-all, it's a nice stylish glove that I will use consistently when it gets cold.<br /><br />Now for the touch screen aspect of the glove. If you're going to call yourself a Touch Screen Winter Texting Leather Glove in your description, you better damn well fit that description. I would highly recommend they remove the &#34;Touch Screen Texting&#34; words out of the main description and just use that very loosely in the fine print as an &#34;added bonus&#34;. If you're planning on buying these gloves to be able to control your smart phone, I would highly advise that you reconsider. It works ok if you're just pressing icons and trying to do simple tasks (I recommend a lighter flat touch, since it does not always respond to your taps). But if you want to use these gloves to text, all I have to say to that is HAHAHAHAHAHA. There is absolutely no way you could ever text with these gloves. First off, they're gloves and they don't hug your hands like a rubber glove. There's going to be some loose material in the tips of the fingers on the edges. That creates an issue of &#34;fat fingers&#34; when trying to text, so whatever letter you're trying to press - it isn't going to be accurate. Secondly, the touch screen feature on these gloves already isn't very consistent (sometimes it will work, and other times it won't - that's why I only recommend them for simple phone tasks). You're going to waste a lot of time and go crazy if you try to use these gloves to text. It would just be much quicker and easier to take off the glove and use your bare hands.<br /><br />If I were just reviewing the gloves themselves, I would give this between four and five stars. If I'm reviewing the touch screen feature, I would give it two stars (since it kind of works). Based on averages, this is why my overall review is three stars. Now if they took off the &#34;Touch Screen Texting&#34; from the headline description, I would upgrade my review and give it four stars firmly. But as it stands, I have to judge these gloves based on how they are being sold, and since they are marketed as Touch Screen compatible, so be it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Very pretty but the pin to keep the door closed kept coming out. Had to make a new one for it and it didn't look great. Ended up throwing it away.
3.0,Well made however not flattering. All the layers/ruffles added more girth making me look bigger.
3.0,"This is a cute shirt, however the straps around the top of the sleeves do not lay nicely and the fabric feels cheap and piles very easily. It looks better in the pictures than in person. I would not purchase again."
3.0,"I am only 5'4 and this shirt falls right at the top of my hips. I have to make sure my undershirt is long enough for layering just to feel comfortable wearing it at all. As for the neck, it's not off the shoulder its just too large to use a hanger. I'd love it if the length was right..."
3.0,"I bought this bracelet as a potential gift for a high school graduates.  There are things I like about it...and one thing that I did not realize.  I like the stamping and the &#34;look&#34; of the bracelet.  I like that it is adjustable - and the lobster-claw fasteners are durable.  What surprised me - and I did not realize this from looking at the photo - is that the stamped piece is attached to the chain with lobster-claw fasteners.  For me, this cheapens the overall look of the bracelet.  Apparently, the company offers other designs that can be interchanged, and this enables such flexibility.<br /><br />I am wondering how durable this bracelet will be...are the fasteners going to &#34;catch&#34; on clothing?  Are they going to hold the stamped plate securely?  I guess the only way to determine this for sure is to wear the bracelet and see what happens.  I do not think I will be buying more of these to give to graduates."
3.0,The material was thin. But I use as a slip under a dress or skirt. It's ok.
3.0,Not for girls with big boobs
3.0,It seems well made and has a lot of pockets but does not fit as much as I was expecting it to hold.
3.0,I didn’t care for flannel on inside lining<br />Which wasn’t described in add
3.0,These are true to size and super cute but if your kiddos ankles have any chub at all these will be tight are the ankles so be aware. My daughter's ankles are not huge but she isn't bone skinny either and she said these are too tight on her ankles.
3.0,Order a size or two larger than what you wear
3.0,"The fabric is soft!  The collar bunches around the back of my neck.  Wish it had inner tie to hold the robe together.  The hem reaches the top of my knee - 5' 7 1/2"".  Not a robe that I would take with me for a trip; much to plain!!<br />Expected more for the price; this is like a thrift store robe that would cost around $12.00 to $15.00!  Just arrived today; deciding on return options!"
3.0,Would have preferred smaller
3.0,"I bought it for may 36"" table but it was way too big.  It draped over it like a giant shower cap.  However, since the material was so nice, my wife took apart the elastic band edge and cut it down by 6"" all around and reattached the elastic band.  Now it fits nice and snug like it should.  It will only properly fit a 48"" table out of the box as delivered."
3.0,"Compré la talla mediana y me queda un poco grande. Aunque el vestido no cumplió mis expectativas, la tienda es muy atenta y muy amable.  Me enviaron el cinturón del vestido y han estado al pendiente de todo."
3.0,"It would have been helpful to explain how difficult these are to pull on with arthritic hands, I would have selected something else.<br /><br />Revised review 6/26/2019 Since I am 5 feet tall, I cut off two inches, and was able to pull them up as needed with less effort,"
3.0,Me quedo muy grande
3.0,"I have purchased these types of hoods along with the pants from/by Russel before.  As one other has noted, the cloth is not nearly thick as the cloth used in previous issues.  They still are good for cold weather and not so cold weather as an additional layer;  I purchased 4 without the pants.  The sizing is OK, but remember this after all a sweatshirt now being used as a regular item of clothing.  Of course, I don't know at this point how the long the things will last.  Identical reviews have been posted for all purchases."
3.0,"Fun, cute but plastic"
3.0,"Too big. Had to return them. They looked like the pictures though, which is nice to know. But they were just too big for my face."
3.0,"Belt received is different than the one pictured. Mine has a black edging and is slimmer in width. It works, but I would have preferred the belt as shown in this listing. :("
3.0,Material was very thin but pretty.  It ran big. I had ordered a medium. Had to return.  Sleeves were very baggy.
3.0,"I will admit, I was aware this was coming with tassels but they were not attractive at all and were all matted together.  In the end I cut them off and use this for a swim suit cover up."
3.0,"Bought a large for more drape. Very nice but it looked as if it had been worn, and was wrinkled and stained. I returned."
3.0,"I wanted to buy this and test it before buying my kids one.  Instead I am just giving it to my son bc this does not comfortably fit my neck and is very snug.  There is elastic on both ends which is fine when pulling up & covering the face. What I don’t like is there is a gap where my shirt ends and this starts which defeats the purpose of covering the neck when not being used.<br /><br />Again, this seems to fit my 11yr old fine, but I would not suggest for a ( larger) adult."
3.0,Smeh. It's basically just an awkwardly cut tshirt. Going to Goodwill.
3.0,The dress is very comfortable and cool which are important factors when living in Florida. I will say it is almost too thin as you can see through the material.
3.0,Cute! But didn’t love the quality.
3.0,It is slightly heavy that my glasses tend to slide down. Slightly lighter tint would have been better.
3.0,"it fits, but I wish it was deeper in the waste to the legs"
3.0,It came very fast and looks beautiful but the clasp is not very dependable.
3.0,"The posts are bigger than normal, unlike wire posts.  They were uncomfortable for my ear holes so I don't wear them."
3.0,Too small from nose to chin - even the provided filter doesn't fit correctly
3.0,Doesn't stay hooked/closed. Pops open.
3.0,"Got size 5. Strangely, the pants seem like they are size 6 or 7 and the shirt seems like size 4, very narrow in the head opening and arm sleeves. I don’t understand. That said, the colors and graphics and fabric are high quality. Just wish the set fits better"
3.0,Spot on color
3.0,So pretty. But it's from China so it's very petite and sheer.
3.0,"Sweater runs really big. I’m 5’5” 125 pounds and I ordered a small I was swimming in it. Really cute sweater, wish they offered an extra small!"
3.0,Works well to add some length to shirts that need it.
3.0,runs too small<br />doesnt have much stretch<br />buckle is a tacky gold
3.0,"Legs are nice fitting, great support.  As others have mentioned the waste is too loose.  I don't think my legs would fit in a medium so I had to go large but the waist slips down.  They are OK and I will use them, but not my favorites"
3.0,These are a loose fit. Comfortable.
3.0,"This is okay, but I did not like the fabric. To me, it is like pajama material, and that is not something I want to wear outside.  But it did fit well, although the sleeves were a tad long, but still okay."
3.0,"I ordered the set of 3, only 2 of the 3 watches worked so I was disappointed in that."
3.0,This swimsuit was ok. It fit great-- I ordered an XL and I would usually wear a M or L in a similar suit. I ended up returning it because I thought the print looked cheap and loud in person.
3.0,"I had foot problems for about a year now,fallen arch, plantar fascists.... Soar Feet...  since wearing these they actually feel a bunch better, I can't go barefoot anymore, feet start to hurt again. They are very comfy, the only problem is they have that toxic,new PVC smell that wont go away. I keep em outside while not wearing them and can't keep em in the bedroom at night, they stink up the room. My feet finally are feeling better,not healed, so I put up with the stinky twins. It's been over a month now and still hoping the toxic avenger will depart."
3.0,"Great looking shoes, but they seemed to run small. The Velcro strap could barely stick, so it wouldn’t be sticking at all by the time my son ran around in them. I don’t consider my son to have large or wide feet, so I would say these are sock-less shoes or for very narrow feet only."
3.0,This blouse is nice but runs on the small side.
3.0,Not sure if I like it it's cute but fits kind of funny can't really oh my finger on what's wrong
3.0,The material of this product is not a soft as projected it to be. Great for working out. Great fit
3.0,"These earrings are nice and stay in well, but a total rip off. The back of the card says $5.99 and I'm paying $15?!"
3.0,"Arrived on time, product is decent enough. Not moisture wicking, but that's a good thing unless you prefer to stink up the entire neighborhood.<br />But the shipper chose a transparent plastic packaging!!! C'mon man! That's like asking for theft - and mine was indeed nicked. I posted a threatening note iin the lobby demanding its return, and luckily it was. Use a brown paper package for heavens sake!"
3.0,"Awesome product! Looks just like the real thing. Only issue is that with my jacket one, the buttons don’t line up along the zipper. Super annoying, but other than that the jacket’s great"
3.0,"nice easy to wash and dry material for traveling.  could work nicely for the right body shape.<br />unfortunately the area from the thigh to calf was too big for me.<br />am petite on the short side.  wish had more pockets and at least one loop too, and with backing to protect eg keys.<br />hope manufacturers make for women's shapes, more shorts, capris and pants with functional pockets."
3.0,Not for me. But nice quality
3.0,It was too long and baggy for my liking. Definitely runs big. I was also expecting t-shirt material and feel but it is heavier than that. I ended up returning it.
3.0,I purchased two for me and my daughter to go to Disney and I had to return both .The colors of the graphics was very nice but the shirt did not fit to size I would recommend you go up a size when buying this item.
3.0,"This costume is actually super cute, nicely made, and I didn’t realize it came with a wig.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the torso is ABSURDLY short. I say this as someone with a very short torso!<br /><br />Considered keeping this but it would be pulling “down there” way too much - incredibly uncomfortable for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />Other notes-<br />-It has a pocket for your phone (bonus point for that!)<br />-The color is not white but silver (like the picture)"
3.0,Fits smaller than others
3.0,"well, the inner cloth has torn. It did not come out that good."
3.0,"The fabric was great, nice and thick. This runs very small. Keep this in mind when ordering."
3.0,No way to really stretch this to accommodate a larger head. Too small!
3.0,"I had to return this product because the fit was really strange. I felt like the sides of my breasts, which are relatively small, were hanging out of the bra."
3.0,"I bought 2 large size shirts, one black, the other brown; the black fit nicely, the brown shirt was 2” smaller in width. Returned the brown, this the 3 star rating."
3.0,Very cute but it fell apart after a few days of wear.
3.0,The neck is too wide for me. everything else is fine.
3.0,The top<br />Was perfect but the bottom was way too small in the back but I have to say that it was shown in the picture how it would fit so I guess it was my fault.
3.0,"The rise is too high for me, the tight part of the waist goes up past my lower stomach which means it tight in all the wrong places giving me a belly pooch. The legs fit fine but not compression at all. They’re comfortable for around the house and maybe for a walk but wouldn’t wear them to the gym or yoga. Disappointed! (I bought a small, 5 5 and 160)"
3.0,I love them so much !! So cute.. the cuff could b deeper to stay on better though
3.0,It was a lot thinner than expected but so far so good. I would have liked the chain to be bit thicker but its pretty and simple.
3.0,It was made of very thin material. I thought it was expensive for the quality.
3.0,beautiful product not to happy with durability of the finish
3.0,"These are very attractive, stylish, well-made gloves. Contrary to the name, &#34;Warm Winter Gloves&#34;, truth be told they are not that effective at keeping your hands warm once the temperature falls below 40 degrees. I'm typically a warm-handed person too, so if that sounds like you, these are good gloves at at a terrific price if you are going to be outside in moderately cold temperatures for say 15 minutes or so. I &#34;road tested&#34; the gloves for ten days walking my dogs, early morning, 25 - 30 degree temperatures with a bit of wind chill. My hands after 45 minutes were not by any means frozen, but after 15 - 20  minutes I could certainly feel the cold. It's too bad such nice leather could not have a better, warmer interior material -- that would have made for a much better glove."
3.0,Little big and long
3.0,"So while this does look pretty great, especially for the price; be prepared to either live with a not quite fitting item or get ready to do some modifications (do not attempt unless you know how to modify latex or have cosplay creation experience). I wish it was a bit smaller and more form fitting but for less than $40 I guess it isn’t bad. I actually debated returning it due to poor fit but I’m going to attempt to modify it. Fingers crossed"
3.0,"I really like the design and fit of this dress, but the quality misses the mark a bit. I'm 5'9&#34; 165lb and got a large and it's definitely too big, so I'd order an M next time. The fabric is a bit scratchy for spandex somehow, though it seems to have improved with multiple washes. The real big downside is that I got the red and black/white striped dress, and the red dye ran and stained the white stripes when I washed this. I always wash it on cold but the damage is done. I think I'd try a different color scheme that doesn't have any white in it next time because the dress itself is very cute and flattering."
3.0,"The dress is cute, but actually fits me like a top. I wish I had ordered a size larger. Unfortunately, the seam tore at the pocket by the second wear. I don't think this was due to the sizing."
3.0,It tarnished very quickly
3.0,pants faded to look like a faded navy blue after one wash
3.0,"The top fits fine, pretty much what I’d hoped for. It’s the print that is disappointing. What is called “Rose” in the picture is actually orange and there is no blue horizontal stripe, it also is orange."
3.0,"These feel great as far as material goes but run very small. Got my normal size and couldn't get them past the hips.<br /><br />They also say do not put in dryer. Found that odd for plaid, but okay."
3.0,Good quality but VERY small.
3.0,"I like the style of the boot, however they are to small. I wish the company made the boot in half sizes."
3.0,"I ordered an Extra Small, even though I’d normally consider myself a Small.  It was HUUUUGE.  I would estimate this XS to be closer to a standard Large.  It was great quality, soft, and comfy though.  So if you’re normally a Large or larger, I’d recommend getting it, but several sizes smaller."
3.0,I loved it at first then it broke
3.0,Price was good but did not meet the name brand product
3.0,"They run small, They are a little tight but I am in the process of losing weight.  Can't wait to wear them."
3.0,"The boots are soft but not waterproof.  The glue came off,  my 2 yrs old daughter hardly go out and wore it no more than 10 times."
3.0,im surprised at the amount I spent and it just feels like it's made of a plastic bag.
3.0,"My daughter loved the fit, the soft fabric, and the pockets.  However, the ruffled hem was coming off the dress before we even washed it!  While I'm able to fix it, it's very disappointing!"
3.0,"OKAY SO: I bought this for the gold ring, which came broken, but the other two fit just fine so &#34;it's okay.&#34; (3 stars, but more like 2).<br /><br />They are a bit hard to open and close so if your nose is sensitive OR you have just recently gotten your septum pierced I DO NOT advise you to purchase ANY clickers online. Instead I suggest going into a body jewelry shop where you can witness an actual person open and close the clicker, as these types of rings can be very difficult to put in and remove.<br />These were alright, at best. I got the 8mm because I like the closer fit to my nose (which does factor in how easy these are to put in and remove.) The silver is cute and the black stands out a bit more. I would have loved to have all 3, since the gold compliments my other jewelry better, but hey, beggars cant be choosers (especially online.)"
3.0,"As a nurse aide at the hospital, I wear this 40 hours a week.  So far it's lasted 4 weeks with lots of hand washing.  I suspect the band is the weak link, but what do you expect for $11 on Amazon.  I'll try to follow up if and when it fails."
3.0,Bottoms came off of them one month in... They were cute. Now just trash...
3.0,Very small and tight and thin.  Nice colors.
3.0,I bought this for my wife and when she tried it on it was nothing like the pictures it shows it looked more like a big silky shirt maybe I recommend ordering in smaller size then you are
3.0,Sized a little smaller and doesn't support well
3.0,"I give this a 3 star as its really cute, but too small for my head; however I can still make it fit somewhat. It does keep falling off and also having trouble keeping the top standing up. It keeps falling. If anything, still a nice decorative piece."
3.0,"My 36” shorts/jean shorts and pants slide on and off. My other dress pants are 36”, no issues. These are so beautiful, but way too small. Size chart the seller provides says 36” is 36”. Sadly, I can’t even swap out for a 38”. For that size only comes in a 32”L, i need a 34”L."
3.0,"Nice, but a little larger than I expected."
3.0,"I like, but is to big"
3.0,The wife unit didn't like how it fit so she gave it to our 18 year old daughter. She likes it. I personally enjoyed the look on my wife. Tight and sexy. But she says I'm a pig.
3.0,Sizes where funky. And was not a crop top on my 5’2 frame. Looked ridiculous and i had to roll the jacket up under my sports bra and the pants needed rolled 3x
3.0,"Used this for glasses while working. At first it worked very well, but only lasted a couple of hours. After a few days it seemed to last longer. It is very easy to use, just spray some on. Over all I'd say it worked pretty well."
3.0,"The zippers are not sewn on well, and piping on the lining gets caught in the zippers.  The strap is a little thin. The leather is a patent leather, so it is shiny.  Usable, but not great."
3.0,"Again, prefer a snap button closure"
3.0,I wear this a lot and it hasn't faded yet however it was a little bit small
3.0,"The fabric was very thin and despite what the description and tag said, there was no cotton in the fabric. It felt like cheap, thin polyester. That was the reason for not giving five stars— the fabric was too thin and inexpensive feeling. It did iron up nicely though."
3.0,Please do not order a larger size as this runs a little on the large size.  I normally wear a medium to large and ordered an xlarge and it is very big.  I would send back and order medium as I think it would fit perfectly.
3.0,Very snug!!!!
3.0,The necklace was ok. I purchased it for my daughter. If it had been somewhat larger I think she would have liked it. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be.
3.0,"These are beautiful but they are too heavy for the backs of the earrings, so if you can get past that you may go on to live your witch fantasy."
3.0,"Great looking shorts but was to short for me to wear, gonna try to sell them"
3.0,"The detail on it is great, its just super-thin and has no real weight to it. Other than that, I like it"
3.0,Nice pearl but it wasn’t mounted well
3.0,Super cute but the ruffle doesn’t ruffle for real which is irky cause it makes it look weird to me. But I love the colors and the fit. Idk if I should have gotten a bigger size for the ruffling but if I had it would have been to big 😓
3.0,I thought I could wear all three pairs at the same time since I wear three sets of earrings. They are way too big to do that.
3.0,"My daughter said that she didn't like this one so much due to the fit. I ordered her size, but it was difficult to remove after a couple of uses.  Good material though."
3.0,I usually wear a medium but took a large based on other reviews and it was waaaayyyyy too big!
3.0,"Leaves little residue, leather lint when you wear it."
3.0,"Looks okay, but EXTREMELY tiny for the cost!  My wife likes it, but I would have expected something with a bit thicker gold ring.  I wouldnt buy it again."
3.0,I ordered a size small and this t shirt is still really big. It’s a stretchy material so it doesn’t shrink either. I definitely love how it looks and it’s super comfy but it’s definitely much bigger than I like to wear my t shirts.
3.0,Its a bit shorter than expected. Nice for relaxing around the house. Has pockets.
3.0,The dress was perfect length for being 5'4 and very pretty with the nice deep pockets but I am returning because the strap was frayed and I wasn't crazy about the shiny material.  I thought it was going to be more cotton and casual
3.0,"Material is off, belt to small... but pretty."
3.0,It is pretty ok I find that I need a bit more support... Also I have thighs so it cuts into them in a not so flattering way . I gave it to a friend and she is in love
3.0,I've purchased these type of shirts on here before but these were fitting me 2 sizes too small. Disappointed 😞 because they are so cute
3.0,According to the measurements the first time I ordered this swimsuit I was a medium. It came very very small. I ordered a large the second time and I could wear it but it was still smaller than I needed it to be.
3.0,"I really like the style of these pants. However the fabric was just a little TOO stretchy. I felt like I'd be fidgeting with it all during a workout. Also, the fabric is so thin it shows lumps and bumps i didn't know i had. I prefer a thicker fabric with a little more compression to &#34;hold&#34; everything in place lol ."
3.0,Came pre opened for me. Still in good condition though
3.0,"Too tight around the thighs, if you are bigger than a size 10 I would look for something else.  Not very soft fabric either, quite itchy."
3.0,It was way to small for a x. Very disssppointed.
3.0,Good quality and nice colors but feel very tight around calves and I don't  have heavy legs.
3.0,Not bad but you get what you pay for. Movement is sloppy does not align with time indacators. The inner ring movement looks cheap. That being said it looks nice.
3.0,Cute but way too big.  Should’ve paid attention to the dimensions
3.0,Very small glasses
3.0,This is a comfy big top but I  should've ordered a small. It runs really big. I'm 5' 135#
3.0,I loved the look but they were very uncomfortable after a few days as the wood was not smooth at all
3.0,"Cute dress, fits well but it had a huge hole in the pocket."
3.0,I was disappointed that the hoop that holds it on the chain broke shortly after I received it. Also the compass won't lay flat while I'm wearing it with the compass side up
3.0,I found the styling and fit of this dress to be okay but I did not like the material it was made from - it felt too clingy.
3.0,"The Grid-it is an excellent idea for organizing what you would usually throw into a pocket of your bag or backpack.  I've found it doesn't always fit the things I need to take, Phones and charger cables take up much of the space, and the pocket on the back side isn't made to allow for much expansion."
3.0,They were to small to fit us comfortably<br />Nice quality but squished our face. Had to return
3.0,Looks great but the inside comes apart easily. My daughter refuses to wear after only 2 uses because the lining inside is peeling off and it feels uncomfortable. Too bad because they really are cute dupes.
3.0,"It looked nice but the padded was not thick enough. After my ride, I did not feel any different with or without padded. I still felt burn."
3.0,Doesn't fit at all if you have boons this is not for you.  The pants fit fine but the top is a no go I might be able to fit 1 booby in I it but that's it.
3.0,"Too expensive, price may be lower now than when I purchased. Not as wide as the original band, seems kind of &#34;undersized&#34; for the watch. The band is very comfortable and the watch fits perfectly in the frame. Removing to watch for charching is exactly the same as the original frame. No quality problems."
3.0,Got the wrong size! Now it’s just sitting in my closet waiting for my waist to shrink a thousand sizes.
3.0,"It was too big for my infant baby. I got the smallest size and it was still too big. The fit seemed kinda wrong, where it had too much room on top, the circumference was ok though"
3.0,It worked from 3 pm to 1030 pm but after that it completely busted
3.0,"It fits tight on my head but the material holds up well during the winter, and keeps your head warm. Good choice if you have a smaller head."
3.0,I'm a size small in bottoms and these were too tight. Have to return for bigger size. Order a size up. The previous reviews I read had mixed information on sizing. If you have a butt then order a size up. Period. Other then that they are cute and good quality.
3.0,"I like the design, pretty.  Lightweight. But it sheds.  All over everything you wear."
3.0,Real nice but both eyes fell off not much later.
3.0,"color variety was good. easy to use. only negative comment would be that the length of the lanyards are too short. I almost thought I purchased a kids size.  At the current length, there is no use for the plastic length adjuster."
3.0,These shoes run small. I bought a white pair and a black pair and they both are smaller than expected. Not too small just smaller than expected. They also flake very easily. One wear and the toes were flaking off the plastic top coat.
3.0,Awkwardly shaped. Isn't very flattering.
3.0,"They aren't very consistent in sizing, some fit great some are too small."
3.0,Cute skirt. Very hard to iron & keep pressed.
3.0,Perfect at first but they stretched out throughout the day making them slip off of the heel. They also started to rip after only a few washes.
3.0,I like the color and material but this tank was way too short for me! I'm 3 months postpartum and this is just not working for me. This will be an at home workout top only.
3.0,The shoes are beautiful but they came used. The bottoms had some wear on them and they weren’t new in the box. Problem is you can’t find these anymore so I guess it is what it is. Just wish they didn’t advertise them as new.
3.0,The writing is very bleary.  Can't make out what it says.
3.0,They look good but the glass falls out and I just got them I was cleaning them and they both fell off
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but colors bled during wash, despite following washing directions. So it is a wear once then off to the Goodwill dress."
3.0,"I really liked how long the scarf was; although I am petite, I'm sure it'd be a great size for anyone regardless of size.  Not too thick, either.  It's very lightweight, and even the weave of the threads is pretty visible (so it's quite thin).  Be careful on which color you order.  I got a grey scarf, but it looks like a strange light blue!!  I'd have bought a black scarf instead if I knew the colors would be so misleading."
3.0,Really like the looks of it but it was slightly too small even for my very thin wrist
3.0,No habla espa&ntilde;ol
3.0,"Love the look, but fits a little tight in the arm"
3.0,"Nice shirt, however runs big. I ordered a size up (medium) and it's a little big on me. I should have stayed true to my size."
3.0,"I ordered up due to the reviews, but should have stayed with my normal size. I’m 5’1” and 140lbs and ordered a size 8. The 6 would have fit way better and 4 may have been too small due to my derrière."
3.0,"I'm returning this item. I have curvy wallflower jeans in size 3 that fit, but I couldn't pull these over my thighs. Would be ok for girls who don't have athletic legs."
3.0,Love it .fit just as expected.
3.0,Lots of compliments. 👌👌
3.0,"I really like the color and style of this bag,  but it came with a big dent in the corner that I can’t seem to smooth out. Honestly, I want to keep it, but I’m not sure I can justify the price for something that looks damaged. I like that it’s not real leather, but it looks like it didn’t hold up well to something heavy being placed on top of it before shipping."
3.0,"The material is fine for spring, nice and light.  The belt is too short in length to fit the &#34;somewhat&#34; larger than expected size (based on some of the reviews).  If someone were large enough to fit the robe well, the belt could not be tied around the person.  But for the price the robe suffices."
3.0,"I wore the copper magnetic bracelet for a week, and I did not notice any decrease in my knee pain.  I’m not sure how long I am supposed to wear it to get any effect.  So far, the efficacy has been 0%.  The bracelet is copper (I checked underneath the leather wrapping the bracelet).  Actually, I am not sure if the leather is real or not.  There are two round magnets at the ends of the bracelet.  The bracelet looks very nice and is adjustable by bending the bracelet.  I try to make sure the magnet is touching my skin.  I guess I’ll just keep wearing it and see what develops.  If anything, it’s a nice looking bracelet."
3.0,"Great bag, but zipper broke on first trip."
3.0,The apron look very pretty in the picture. I was surprised that it wasn't cloth it's kinda plastic I work with chocolate and I am going use it and see if it passes the test.
3.0,"It said this was waterproof but I discovered it's not.  I was ticked when it got. a little. wet and it went through all the layers to where my computer was being kept.  Luckily I noticed the water quickly.  I love everything else about it.  Lightweight, sturdy, charging port and a few different organizing pockets, but not waterproof."
3.0,The rinestones in these started falling out after 2 days. They were cute while they lasted.
3.0,Much smaller than suggested or described.
3.0,"I would give a higher rating because I love the necklace. It shipped quickly and is high quiality. However, instead of using the pi symbol, they just used II. I don’t understand why you would use II when you clearly show you have a pi symbol?"
3.0,"I work in the southern California desert and I was hoping this would be awesome.  Turned out to make the fit of my vest carrier too bulky without offering a huge change in temp. Just made me feel bigger than I already am and was not very comfy. It does let the air flow better but not enough to outweigh the bulky feeling. Nice idea though. Wish it was lighter and softer.  It may work for a thinner person. Im 511 240, hope this helps."
3.0,"People that I spoke to had a hard time hearing me, but I loved the durability and look of the case."
3.0,"These are ""just okay"" slippers.  The grippers are a nice touch.  They're too thin and the elastic banding across the top of the feet tends to feel tight after a while."
3.0,The plastic piece broke and got lost in the laundry. Wouldn't recommend these.
3.0,"I like the ralph lauren sweaters, but they run very small, I usually wear a medium and in this brand I buy a L or XL. This one is XL is very soft and warm and fits like a relaxed cut because is XL. The only problem is that ends up being very boy but still does a good job to dress up or down."
3.0,A really pretty dress except for the fact it’s made from horrible cheap awful material. The material is a throwback to the 70s! The material is so thick its uncomfortable & unwearable in hot weather.
3.0,Love the look of the bag but it’s missing a piece of leather that hold the placement of the strap when you adjust the size.
3.0,"I was looking for a compact wallet.  This would be perfect if the center zippered part were a little larger.  Not many dollars will fit into it.  That being said, the outer card holders are very handy and this is perfect for just slipping into a purse or pocket."
3.0,I haven't been able to wear the dress as the arms and chest are way too small. I am in the process of losing some weight though and I am hoping to get into the dress before warm weather is gone.
3.0,"Nice slip except for the fact that it is difficult to keep it from showing at the top.  I don't wear low cut tops or dresses, but unless i wear a crew cut t shirt the top of slip shows.  I have even folded it over  and stitched it down and it still shows.  Have never had this problem with other full  slips."
3.0,My children love this helmet - they play with it all the time
3.0,cute seem well made but they are tiny.  nickle sized
3.0,The emblems on the socks are cheap and poorly made. After the first wash they began to fray. For the price they are ok.
3.0,"Were smaller than I expected, definitely smaller than the listed Size"
3.0,Pants are not what I expected. They are above the ankle with a tight fit every where but the waist. Seams kind of thin to me as well. Don’t think I could wear these out to the store.
3.0,Fit was very large order smaller size.
3.0,These shoes were not the same length. I was wondering why one shoe fit tighter than the other. Then I looked in the mirror. One was higher than the other. Luckily I was wearing jeans with them and they still looked good. That's the only reason for the rating. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star rating.
3.0,this is really cute but for DDs you have to wear it over your regular bra as a cute accent
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of these, and they are difficult for my toddler to put on by herself. I am returning."
3.0,"Cheap quality , lasted three weeks"
3.0,"These are okay.  Would not order again.  In fact, used the pink one on our last trip a few weeks ago and when I went to get my luggage, no travel strap on the suitcase.  Have no idea what happened."
3.0,Very cheaply made. Would not have kept it if it had fit.
3.0,"Received this cute belly button ring, but one of the jewels had already come off in the mail. Will have to glue it back on. Otherwise, cute."
3.0,Not so great looking on long torso women.
3.0,They are big on me but I washed them in warm water and dried them so they would shrink. They did a little bit. I just wear them around the house. Very comfortable. The length is fine.
3.0,Fits well but not as warm as expected for a winter outdoor excursion.
3.0,The colors were not as bright as pictured. But they fit.
3.0,"This dress is pretty. Runs true to size. I loved everything about the dress, but it has a shiny finish on the fabric that made it look cheap. So, I returned. Otherwise a nice dress"
3.0,for the price its a nice one....
3.0,School bus yellow with iron on looking lettering.  Thicker material.  Wouldn't buy it again because it's not attractive.
3.0,It was a little small.
3.0,"Received product timely.  Problem is with sizing.  Ordered XL and it may fit American Size 4, sleeves extremely small.  Though love the dress, can't wear it.  Also, no return label in package.  This company needs to review and adjust their sizing for American measurements."
3.0,Ok for the price. The make of it seems alittle cheap. Not really as pictured. Can't decide it I want to keep or send back.
3.0,I thought the logo would have been better quality and not a sticker.
3.0,A great play badge for my grandson. But tarnished over time..
3.0,Super cute but runs large. I knitted it in the back to tighten it up. Still turned out cute for the pictures!
3.0,Don’t really work as a stay warm sock
3.0,It's a pretty concept but it's huge and made me feel like big bubble of cloth too much material - it's a shame cuz I really wanted to like it but just not right for me! I'm 5'5&#34; 150 and I had ordered a large should've ordered a small maybe.
3.0,Cute but top was smaller than expected - large doesn’t fit a C cup
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e7f8047676eab610c5f6c4bdf5e2567f]] Super cute‼️‼️‼️ But they run a little small, so I would suggest going up a size ."
3.0,The worked.  But the clasp broke after they were used 5 times.
3.0,The white the bracelets is missing a beat.
3.0,"Cotton/Spandex/Poly blend but very thin. These socks don't feel like they'll stand the test of time or too many washings and wear. I can see through the fabric. Size is fine and they stayed up all day. Though I do suspect they will loosen with only a few wears. The product description claims that they are ultra soft, but I wouldn't go that far. I love the colors."
3.0,Color was more of an orange than a red; still a beautiful color.<br />Material was flimsy. I would not put in washer/dryer.<br />Returned to Amazon. I am thick and well endowed in the chest area; the sweater did not lay on me as in the photo. The cut was not flattering to my figure.
3.0,"Returned. Very cute and fit well (runs small but is nice and stretchy). Only reason I returned is because the color is off. Weird blue, doesn't look denim enough for me."
3.0,"The fit on this was okay, and the length was just enough to cover my bottom, which is what I wanted. Unfortunately, this has no support on top, and since I have D cups, I had to return it. This would be an awesome suit if it had underwire cups."
3.0,Broke or battery died within a week.
3.0,"Poor quality, my nail went through it and ripped it the first time I wore it. Cute design but very thin."
3.0,"Cute t-shirt, good quality material but it’s brown..... not green"
3.0,"It said  that one size would fit all but it does not.  I am female with  an ordinary size, bit was too tight.  Took off the name tag which gave me a little more give, but still tight.  I did order another one for a grandchild, but I doubt I will wear the one I kept.  Nice hat, but  maybe you need to make the brim a little larger."
3.0,They fit great but smell awful. Have to wash them. It made me gag they smelt so bad.
3.0,Very thin plastic ... and could have been a much higher quality for the price!!
3.0,Nice quality. Great shine.
3.0,La calidad de la tela debería ser mejor
3.0,"I like this jacket, and especially at the price! The only thing I can knock it for is that the armpit areas are tight, and the zipper is on the wrong side!"
3.0,I was upset because this was a gift for my granddaughter on her Birthday on April second. This Mermaid 3 piece is beautiful but runs too big.
3.0,Cute design but one side was not the right size to stay attached to my ionic. Fortunately I have other bands that I could take the part from and attach the band to which makes it usable.
3.0,Dress was tight across the chest but decent overall
3.0,The faces did not line up properly
3.0,"Was disappointed with these. I ordered hoping to get certain ones, and for a good mix for projects. Mostly ended up with horse shoes and rocking horses that can't be used for anything I do. Some of the horses are poorly made blobs of metal.  A mix of one sided and double sided. A small number are really pretty and well made, but it's seriously inconsistent. It's supposed to contain 4 colors. Didn't get a single rose gold. I did order a second time hoping to get the ones I wanted, but it never showed up so I gave up and found them elsewhere. Elsewhere I was able to order the specific ones I wanted for a lot less. For a lot like this it should be split up more. western theme should have the horseshoes, boots and so on. Rocking horses should be in their own lot. Double sided and single sided shouldn't be mixed. I ended up with a few I like, but with the amount given here I should like most of them. Gave most of them away. Pictured are some of what I kept."
3.0,Just feels and looks like pajamas.
3.0,Small than picture
3.0,"I order a Large, due to me being full up top.  It was big and it open when it's button. I do like the feel of the martial"
3.0,Good fit and print but I don’t like the shiny polyester material. If there was a or fleece cotton lining then I would’ve kept it.
3.0,"It is nice quality but, it's a bit large for me and not very feminine."
3.0,Nice running socks but no better than much cheaper store brand ones.
3.0,It arrived completely soaked. I could squeeze water out of it.
3.0,"I cant say anything bad about the snowsuit, it looks exactly as shown, cute and warm. Unfortunately I cant give it a full 5 stars due to the extremely long time it took to be delivered."
3.0,This piece of jewelry is very attractive. I wore it nonstop for three months before it lost its biggest stone. The stones appeared to be glued onto the earring. It was disappointing to lose the stone because this earring was definitely one of my favorites.
3.0,Very stretchy. Probably could have went with a smaller size but lots of post said they ran small. I
3.0,"They are super cute, but they do run big! I always wear a medium, and should have sized down!"
3.0,"These were super pretty out of the box, but cause major irritation on my skin. Which is weird because I have other gold plated earrings that work great. Not sure what happened but had to take them out after about a week."
3.0,"Padded on the inside of the boot & the width for the toes is fairly comfy. They are not however, as clean a line around the ankles as fetish boots which lack a padded lining. Zipper is convenient for easy removal at the end of a night."
3.0,Is fit a little snug
3.0,"these are much smaller than they describe them, and I even got out a ruler to see how big they were. They are pretty, though."
3.0,Arrived earlier than expected.<br />While it's quite spacious some on the gold accents on it are abit dull. The smell is going away...all in all its a good bag quite happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Update to this review.<br />The clasp on the straps broke after about a month and half of use. I'm forced to used the handles now which so far is holding out ok.<br />Abit disappointed being that it broke so quickly.
3.0,It's cute but it be nice to have the bottoms to wear with the top 💁‍♀️
3.0,The hat is a bit too big.
3.0,Too hot for summer (polyester) but very nice.. I'll return it and look for something in cotton.  True to size..
3.0,All of the items were Smaller than expected. My daughter was not as surprised as I had hoped.
3.0,"The top of the dress fits so nice on me. I also love the pockets. However, the material is just too thin and even though it swings, it still clings and I cannot stand it. I do not understand why designers do not use a thicker material . If you are thin and tall, you will probably love this."
3.0,junkie its like something you get out of a gumball machine not a fan
3.0,Hair band does not feather finishing ill put another feather that I have<br />Otherwise it’s fine for one time baby photography
3.0,The material was cheap and it just looks like something that you buy at a dollar store so I mean it'll be nice for around the house but it doesn't look like it does in the app.
3.0,WAY to expensive for a plastic bracelet. Would not recommend!
3.0,To small for a man wrist
3.0,Very cute overalls. A little tight around the shorts. Looks really cute with a crop top.
3.0,"We were expecting a hard shell helmet. What arrived was a very flexible and floopy latex rubber mold of the helmet packed flat in a shipping bag. As a result, it has dimples and creases when worn. It was for my son to play and pretend with, so it is not a huge deal...just disappointing."
3.0,These pants run smaller (slim size) and meant for more of a boyish figure. If you have curves these are not the pants for you. Also they are very low cut. I decided not to return mine as they are just meant to lounge around the house but I did buy two pairs and disappointed I did.
3.0,Fit small.  Gave it to m niece who loves it!
3.0,The hook comes undone easily wish it had better support. It's very pretty though
3.0,Returned because dress was too long and didn't like the polyester fabric. I'm 5'4 and even with heels this would drag.
3.0,"A bit bigger than I had hoped and one of the closures was kind of wonky when it arrived. We fixed it (had to bend the closure back and forth a few times to get it to work right) but overall the product is, well, worth what you're paying for it. Bells move freely, which makes these a pain to put on. They're cute but not exactly what I'd hoped for."
3.0,"The plugs are very pretty and worked okay for some time, but the gummy plastic starts chipping away and it makes them look gross, plus it compromises the integrity of the photo."
3.0,"As with most things, it looks better in the picture than it does in person. That said, it works well enough. Paired with some paisley leggings and it is cute enough, and super comfortable."
3.0,"Hugely disappointing.  I was expecting a stretcher with a turnbuckle in the middle, unfortunately that’s not how this one works. One side of the turnbuckle is glued (yes, it’s called LockTite) so it doesn’t turn.  So the only way to adjust this is to turn the one half and then try to put it in your hat.<br />I will spend some time in the shop to get this thing to work right, but had I known all this I would not have spent my money on it."
3.0,"These are fine. I have one kid who hasn’t had an issue with these. My other kid likes to swing his arms and he keeps losing these. The grip is OK for your average kid, but if you have a super active child, your best bet may be the glove clips that go through the arms."
3.0,"The necklace is very nice. I will be interested to see if it sells in my shop, and if the person who buys it also buys peacock feather earrings to go with it."
3.0,"This dress looked so cute on the model and on others in pictures. When I put it on I looked like I was about to hop into my covered wagon and ride off into the sunset. The material is thick and not breathable so even though it looks like a 'summer/spring dress' it gets really hot.<br /><br />Maybe this dress would look better on a tall person, at 5'2 it was not flattering on me at all.<br /><br />Unless you are looking for a super conservative, olden-day style this dress is probably not the one for you."
3.0,"Im a bit disappointed.  The buckle is all plastic,  that doesn't seem to be very strong.  Tge snap to the belt isn't too sturdy.  Definetly not a belt fir somebody overweight like i am.  I will be passing these onto my daughters."
3.0,"This handbag is very nicely made and the leather is very soft.  It is a good medium size handbag.  The conceal carry area is too roomy and I felt there was too much room for movement as the holster that comes with it is basically just an oversize hook and loop strap that attaches to the side walls.  I wasn't comfortable with the movement it allowed east and west of a handgun.  This was the biggest issue, the secondary issue was how wide the shoulder strap was.  It just felt massive to me and it rode a bit high for a cross body bag.  Unfortunately, it didn't fit my needs and I returned the bag."
3.0,A tad bit smaller than advertised
3.0,too small returned it
3.0,Quality just so so. Color more muted than shown online.
3.0,"The fit was fine but this fabric gets so much static, even if you don’t dry it. Annoying."
3.0,"Mask fits well, not pulling on my ears."
3.0,"First, I was pretty disappointed that these don’t come in black because I would have majorly preferred that, but I decided to get them anyway. However, I do think it would be a huge plus to add some more neutral or common colors like blacks or browns. Then again, I guess you can find plenty of those other places, so perhaps this brand wanted to think outside the box. I won’t fault them for that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these a lot. I haven’t worn these kind of biker shorts since I was in high school probably and I remember loving them so much when I was younger. I generally shop in thrift stores and haven’t really see these around much so I was pretty excited to run across these on a product testing site. I wasn’t too happy with what I got. The coloring on the picture for the purple ones is pretty accurate and they fit a few inches above my knees. They really help keep my thighs from rubbing together, which was my favorite part of these.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wasn’t too impressed with them otherwise. I wouldn’t buy these again as they just aren’t as comfortable as I would like them to be. I feel like these felt really tight getting on. They do seem to fit better with some wear, but the elastic seems too weak to hold them up. I was adjusting them quite a bit since they were rucking downwards, which might just have something to do with my belly. They aren’t a terrible product, which is why I did give them three stars, but they weren’t anything that made me excited to wear or tell others about.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discount in return for an honest review."
3.0,"One came broken, but they are cute. But MAN they smell... like strong paint.... other than that and one coming broken, cute."
3.0,"Fit was great, but the seam in the back came open in one day of use. Luckily I was wearing spank like shorts under it and have a great sense of humor. If you buy this be sure to pull at all the seams to insure you wont have a major wardrobe malfunction!"
3.0,Socks are great. Just thin and tight.
3.0,I do not like the interior. It sounds like I have a bag filled with plastic bags
3.0,"I think the pants would have been fine, but were way too small.  I wear XXL in all pants I have, but with these I could not even begin to button them. Gave them to my son-in-law!"
3.0,"they're cheap, a little tight, but ok"
3.0,"I am a size 14 and ordered the 2xl, I couldn’t even get it over my head it was so small. My granddaughter will be wearing for Halloween and she is a size 6. I do love the pattern and the quality for the money but the sizing is all wrong."
3.0,"It’s really a great idea, but it does loose its stretch in a few months. I need to buy a new band."
3.0,The color is halfway between grey and light blue. It goes with a lot. The leather is almost a suede so it does tend to get dirty and I may need to replace it in the future.
3.0,smaller than what pictured. nice for what you pay for tho
3.0,The shirt fit much bigger  than I had expected. It’s pretty long and very loose fitting. Plus the shoulders seem large. I am 5’0” 120 lbs and I ordered the small.
3.0,"These were nice - cute and comfortable, at first. Very warm (can be a good thing). After a day on the motorcycle the material covering the knees was stretched tight and hurting my knees."
3.0,Pretty for the price. Took two weeks to arrive.
3.0,"I ordered an XL, and I can't even get it over my chest, it is so tight that it won't even fit my daughter who is a medium. The shirt feels nice and looks nice, but I can't use it. I have no one who is that small. The shirt does say XL, so it was not the wrong size, it's not even a child's XL, it is that tight. I need to return it. Sad, because it is cute. It did not even fit my 11 years old great niece and she is small. I suggest to stay away from this shirt unless you can get it in much bigger sizes. Who makes up some of these sizes?"
3.0,"Really pretty glasses, however they were too small for my head.  They seem to be made for a child. Even having them adjusted would not have helped the sizing. Very disappointed!"
3.0,"Not stylish at all.  It is very thin and looks just like a piece of velcro around your waist.  It gets the job done, though.  I probably would not purchase another."
3.0,Although they are represented as the complete Bible they only went to 1 John. Not a complete Bible.
3.0,"I thought it was the one, since wife picked it out, but alas it too was returned."
3.0,"The sweater is gorgeous. It fit my child well. The only reason I’m giving it three stars instead of 5 is that the sleeves were rather short. If it were described as a three-quarter sleeve sweater, I think that would be better so that the purchaser knows exactly what they’re getting. It made me sad to return this because it is a beautiful sweater."
3.0,run small/ not correct support
3.0,"Cute, but snug."
3.0,Very nice but the clip opening could be a little wider to clip onto thicker visors. Also wish the angel was positional on the clip. Mine is practically over my head. Can't see it when I'm driving.
3.0,"I liked that this could be customized. Seems to protect the phone thus far but the one complaint I have is that you can't charge your phone with wirelessly, because of the material or thickness on the back which is unfortunate."
3.0,quality is nowhere near what I expected - its also heavy - Could be picked up locally at the mall or flea market
3.0,It was suppose to be Prime but it took 3 weeks to get here!! I did not like it one bit! The size ran small!!
3.0,"They are definitely not worth the money, not even in sale."
3.0,Poor fit!
3.0,"Material feels cheap and its not flowy. Product picture looks better than real product. However the seller did include a gift of a cellphone beach protector which was considerate of him, given than many customers bought this kimono for beach occasion"
3.0,it's okay but not crazy about it
3.0,"These are completely see-thru.  I don't have a problem with that, I've purposely bought others that were see-thru.  This just isn't quite what I expected though.  Maybe i missed something, but it seems to me that this seller did nothing to accurately represent the material.  Anyway, moving on...<br /><br />The material is, well, an interesting choice.<br />Think of nylon...<br />Now think of window screen material...<br />These are about halfway between the two.  It's a fine mesh with the holes being big enough for pubic hair to stick thru.  (I'm adding a photo where I'm holding them up with my hand inside to demonstrate.)<br /><br />Next, regarding softness and feel, again think of nylon and window screen...<br />Again these are halfway between the two.  Seriously.  It's a finer thread than the screens, which makes it feel softer, but it still has some of that scratchy quality that you feel when you run your hand back and forth across a window screen.  That's not to say that it feels scratchy when you're wearing them, because it doesn't.  But neither does it feel soft and silky, which I think is more of what a person would want and/or expect from a sheer fabric.<br /><br />On the plus side, I ordered these according to the size chart and they fit well.  By that, I mean that they're snug enough without lots of extra fabric.  (Notice my wording; I personally like them a tiny bit snugger, but that's preference.  To be fair, I think these are sized correctly.)  Just fyi: I'm 6'2&#34; with a 29&#34; waist and I ordered size small.<br />Also a plus,  I don't see anything to complain about in their construction.  Like many other underwear on Amazon, I think that they're reasonably well made.  And, when it comes to product vs. price, I feel that I got a good deal.<br /><br />As for my rating, I deducted one star because I don't think that the material is a great choice for underwear.<br />I deducted another star because I think that the pictures in the ad are a bit misleading and don't accurately represent the product.  (For the record, I bought the all white ones and, in my experience, white also tends to be the most transparent color.)<br /><br />In the end, they're not quite what I wanted and I don't think I would have bought them had I first seen them in person.  I don't feel like the ad crossed the line into deception tho, so I'm not going to send them back either.  I'll just chalk them up as a wrong choice.  Maybe you'll still like them though.  At least now, you'll hopefully have a better idea of what you're getting.  Cheers!"
3.0,Waves of the ocean knock the suction off.  Maybe the saltwater took the anti-fog away pretty quickly or there was none at all.  They were really foggy from the get go.
3.0,"The case is sturdy and attractive. The manufacturer needs to point out that it is NOT meant to hold air pods independently, but to hold the air pod case. There is a small loop on the side whose purpose is unclear, especially since it is so small. The manufacturer could have made it more useful by putting a metal ring in it. As sent, it seems incomplete. There are no instructions. The top flaps open and cannot be secured without the air pod case inside. I’m not sure I could recommend this without more development by the maker."
3.0,"Great fit, but tick ugly polyester material."
3.0,"They look cool, but one has a longer metal piece than the other, so when you try and hook the axe head onto the handle, it looks weird. They are cute and workable though."
3.0,The texture of this jacket isn’t too bad . A bit long but I order Small . I should order XS . I am 5’4” 130 lb but lean . Not bad ! I may order another one but XS
3.0,"The elephant is exactly the size I thought it would be.  The detail &amp; rhinestones are cute-- however, I am not able to wear it, yet, because it arrived with a broken chain.  I'm not even sure how it was even possible that it was broken in so many places.  The chain had at least 3 breaks.  I was possibly considering replacing the chain, anyway- but it sucks that it arrived damaged."
3.0,the material is soft but really too thin to be a &#34;sweatshirt&#34;.  It's really just a long sleeved shirt/tunic with a hood.
3.0,"I'm short 5'0&#34; and size 14 bought the XL so it wouldn't be to small, but it's too long. I have to have it altered or it will drag on the ground like a wedding train"
3.0,It's a beautiful piece of jewelry. I've had it for a few months now and it's still in great condition. My only complaint is the bar is a bit too long for my ear so I find it twists a lot which can be annoying. But that can easily just be my ear. Overall I would reccomend but warn about a long bar.
3.0,Love the material. Fit a bit on the snug side for me.
3.0,"Good bar, the dice are kind of small. Smaller then I'd like but okay. I got green and the dice are more of a yellow. So not impressed with the color, but still worth the money."
3.0,"Beautiful pattern, the colors are nice and strong, but the fabric itself is very definitely hard stiff polyester, or at least something that carries that same feel. I'm not picking up the sensation of silk, for sure.<br /><br />I will probably not wear it because it is so polyester feeling, but I will probably use it as a table runner. Disappointed that I cannot actually use it as an article of clothing as I intended."
3.0,I love that this watch is unique with its look. However am a little disappointed with the chain area the color is not as the photo.
3.0,"There are holes in the bottom of these so if you wear when it is wet out, your socks will be wet also. My son wears these to basketball tournaments and we didn't realize they had holes in the bottom when I bought them. They will work good when it is actually summer out!!"
3.0,comfortable except there is something with the clasps that make me itchy decent value for t he money
3.0,"The fitted long sleeve jumpsuits that tipsy elves make fire perfectly! But this one did not :/ it was a little snug and the legs were way too long. Also, it advertises that it isn’t see-thru, but it clung to the outlines of my undergarments so you could easily see them. I had to return, which was unfortunate because the quality was great and it was cute. Just had an off fit."
3.0,I ordered the 2x. You get what you get when you wait til the last minute. It gave what it was supposed to. The flap/sash thing at the top of the dress kept leaving my bra exposed all night. Be prepared to pin or sew it in place.
3.0,Brim is very large. It's hard  to see in front of myself when walking.
3.0,I wish the legs were longer by about 9 inches ... I feel I am wearing 'little boy' clothes!
3.0,"Absolutely nice nonetheless. It's tight in that area for me just because that's what I've got. The type of fabric it is is fun and flowy but it is restrictive so just remember that when you buy it.<br /><br />The pattern matches the picture, it's as flirty as it looks on her and also able to be changed out for a work wardrobe piece."
3.0,I like the style and was very flattering on. Unfortunately the size is very small under the arms and across the bus line. I normally order a large but had to order an XX large for it to fit properly.
3.0,I like the way it looks but my son does not like wearing them.  I think he finds it very uncomfortable. He is too young to explain to me the exact reasoning but I can tell he does not like wearing them and picks out his other tennis shoes.
3.0,"These are awesome except for the size. I usually wear a large but sometimes a medium. So, I chose large since the designer brands usually run small. I probably could have used a medium. They are high rise, which would be nice except that I probably also needed a petite. Ugh. That being said, I'm definitely in love with the fabric and the style. I will wear these around the house where I won't care if I trip over the legs. LOL! LOVE LOVE LOVE these and will hope to find a better fit one day!"
3.0,I was kinda disappointed with how the gold necklace looks.
3.0,I really like the style.. just not all favorable about the fabric.. was happy Bcuz it finally fit.. after trying to purchase just at least one dress for my upcoming trip this one finally fit.. I did however have an EXTREMELY BAD EXPERIENCE ORDERING IT<br />I got chgd 2x for it .. and amazon won’t admit their wrong.. I’m still waiting for my refund
3.0,"I like the Avengers print, but this lanyard is stretchy and not very comfortable for my little boy to use"
3.0,"The jacket looks exactly like the picture, except there were loose strings, and its very very thin. It is slightly small. So you should go 3-4 sizes up. Depending on your height the arms might still be small. The jacket is sew through, and soaks up water."
3.0,"So it comes with an extension, which is good because even with it on the last hook with the extension it's extremely snuggle, and completely unclipable without the extension."
3.0,"Wanted to love these earrings, cute, light weight,wore them one day only and the back fell off !"
3.0,The plastic pieces that pull it right in the back are annoying as hell. They rubbed during my entire run.loved the stretchy fabric but  Returned it.
3.0,"Great appearance.  I've gone through three of these though, all of which have had the spring mechanism in one hinge come apart.  The temple then comes off and I've had to jerry rig until I can get a replacement frames.  It has usually been the left hinge that does this."
3.0,I own a couple other Onzie tops in this same ladderback elastic style and they are both M/L size. But this one felt so much tighter around my chest. I would say if you are more in the S/M range this bra will work.
3.0,"Looks so cute in the photo, but when I tried it on it has a super weird fit around the boob area."
3.0,"I know there are a lot of negative reviews on these but I thought I would offer maybe a slightly less negative review. They did take 9 weeks to arrive but actually fit ok, granted I bought a large normally wear a US small. I could see them being good for Halloween (order now for 2021) or maybe working out at home since they are pretty light weight"
3.0,Well made chaps. Good for moving through brush. Not quite. My biggest issue is the Souther California yucca poke right through. Seem as though a snake fane would do the same.
3.0,"Order size up, fits snug and you won't be able to move much in fear of seams busting."
3.0,"Son super livianas, comodas pero recomiendo media o hasta una talla mas grande."
3.0,Small. Thought it was for a woman’s but looks more like for a child.
3.0,Comfortable. Fits well and supportive. Would definitely buy more. Much nicer especially in the summer than clasps and straps and underwire.<br />Cute and lasted the summer but that’s about it. Didn’t wash well and hold up.
3.0,The lenses are way to dark yellow ... almost brown.<br />I would love an exchange for a different pair with a lighter tint but don’t want to end up with same issue.
3.0,The buckles get stuck .
3.0,"I enjoy the &#34;crazy socks&#34; fad, as it allows me to bring personality to my &#34;polo-shirt and khakis&#34; work wear.  I try to acquire socks for every major holiday, and bought these for Thanksgiving (obviously).  Unfortunately, from a distance, the turkey neck and head look a lot like a certain part of the male anatomy, as my mother (!) pointed out to the amusement of the crowd at our Thanksgiving celebration!  I was embarrassed, and will probably never wear these socks again.  (The fit and quality were the same as other crazy socks: well-embroidered, slightly thin, and nearly sheer.)"
3.0,"I wanted to like this sooo bad but the other reviews were pretty spot on. I love the color and design of it, but the material isn’t as soft as I thought. The elastic on the pants is tight also."
3.0,The dress was made from very thin material. I return it.
3.0,Screws on right side always come loose and finally fall out but what do you expect for $3.33?
3.0,very tiny/dainty but pretty.
3.0,it's bigger than i thought it would be for my 3T ballerina.. l like the color though
3.0,Nice pants for the money.  The hit is way too small.  Order 2&#34; greater than what you wear.  Nice light weight for warmer weather.
3.0,This fit me too big. I ordered a medium. I am 6'3 and 180 pounds and it was still baggy.
3.0,"Wasn't to happy with the fit, wasn't very flattering on me."
3.0,Disappointed runs small!
3.0,Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter.  It is quite lovely and sparkly but the ring that attaches it to the change broke very quickly.  The manufacturer did include another clasp and we used it.  The chain is also very nice
3.0,I ordered a small and it looks like a table cloth on me.
3.0,It is ok. Happy that it is working; the black one adjustment knob broke.
3.0,"These are a basic flat fashion sandal, no arch support. They look nice and the straps are soft. I bought them to wear to work on casual dress hot summer days. I would walk for long distances in these, with no arch support and just a little cushioning. They do have nice rubber soles, so they are not slippery like a leather soled sandal."
3.0,Much thinner material than expected. Size is also on the smaller side. Not really what I was looking for. Price is good though.
3.0,it keeps you warn as least
3.0,"I ordered it big, but I usually do and this thing is like a tent with a train on it."
3.0,The top I received was polyester and rayon..  I expected shrinkage and there was not any.  Product returned and money refunded
3.0,Should have bought 2 sizes bigger usually a 38...not even close
3.0,This is ivory.  Needed white.
3.0,If you want this to look as it does on the model size up at least 2!
3.0,Skirt is adorable. The top looks like an apron...not cute.
3.0,Beautiful set but could have been made better skull comes loose after being worn a few times
3.0,This is a plain black sweater dress with a tie belt. The photo makes it look like it has more shape and texture than it actually has.
3.0,We ordered this vest set for my 6 yrar old son for his piano recital. My husband was shipping out for the Army that day so it was fitting.  The fit of this vest is short and stocky...my son is by no means stocky but it dis the trick....it comes w a vest a bow tie and a regular tie no shirt  the quality seemed to be good the tightener on the back of the vest was a joke but the idea of this vest was too good to pass up
3.0,"I've never written an Amazon review, but I was so impressed with customer service that I felt compelled.  The top was not ideal for me, and customer service made it right literally within minutes of my request to them.  The top itself is very soft, great fabric, just not exactly was I envisioned from the website and shorter in the body than described (mind you i am 5'10"").  Should be great on someone shorter and more petite."
3.0,"It's slightly small around my chest and thighs/ bum. So I suggest to get a size up. Other than that, it feels great"
3.0,Was not what I expected but for the price they work great.
3.0,Tight & short
3.0,Just ok. Nothing special. Has the look and feel of a shirt that won't last more than ten washings.
3.0,Tiene una calidad un poco mala y es muy pequeña
3.0,"This probably fits the way it’s supposed to, given the spandex content.  However, it you have don’t have arms like Lara Spencer on GMA, or like Michelle Obama, then this is NOT the garment for you.  But if you have slender arms, you’ll enjoy it.  It’s very nice! #notlaraormichelle"
3.0,It leaves ur skin itchy and rolls way to much not good for working out but if ur home its ok
3.0,"Hoping to lose some weight, feels sturdy, but my butt has broken bigger things! :-)"
3.0,"Really love the style and color. Very disappointed in the quality. For twenty bucks o could have got something much better at a department store. The fabric is very thin and cheap feeling. The fit was also poor. I got a size 2x to be sure it would fit and it's still snug. The length is great but the arms are tight and it's tight around the middle. To be fair, a thinner person wouldn't have this problem but I did get a size larger than usual to try to make sure it would fit. Overall a nice shirt but not worth the amount I spent for it."
3.0,"It's honestly a beautiful dress, and fits really well! It's a little too short, and rides when you sit. I only got to try it on, and then noticed a huge snag in the lace on the side seam. Super upset! I was hoping to wear it to my Bridal Shower, but ended up sending it back."
3.0,"This wallet is REALLY grey, the pictures are a little different from what it looks like in person."
3.0,Bottoms were a good fit but top was WAAAYYYY too big for me.
3.0,This didn’t fit. The shorts did at least a little but the top had no stretch I couldn’t even get it on. I ordered my usual size. The color is beautiful but the material is a little cheap feeling.
3.0,This rain is a very good rain but I was kind of disappointed with the sizing I wear a size 11 ring but when I got it it didn’t even go over my knuckle I had to give it away to my aunt and it fits her like a glove ! If you have a size 11 but your fingers and you’re out this will work for you but if you have fingers like me a size 11 in Chevy they won’t work
3.0,"My son isn't cubby, but the warmers still seem tight on his thighs. The ankle part of the warmers are just as tight as the thigh area. This is the first time I ever bought baby leg warmers, but I really assumed the leg hole would be bigger than the ankle."
3.0,It’s cute but very uncomfortable too heavy and runs large.
3.0,"This tutu is full and does the job, but I literally washed it 4x and couldn't get the smell out. The smell only seemed to bother me. My husband and daughter didn't mind."
3.0,Product did not look like the picture on line!
3.0,Made well but too small
3.0,Don't fit snug - loose.
3.0,I like the stretchable material the jumpsuit is made of.  It fits well but I would like for the hip section to be a little wider.
3.0,"This product is good, but has some imperfections, the sewing is not very good, and It fit a little small on my shoulders, that's rare because I have small shoulders. And the sleeve are small too. But It's ok."
3.0,"The dress fits, but it is way too short.  I am 5'2"".  I returned it."
3.0,"Be sure you look closely at the pictures, particularly the picture of the back of the shorts. Any bizarre text that shows up in those pictures is actually on the shorts including some kind of strange multi-line product description nonsense on the back of the right leg. Considering what they cost, I guess they are 'fine', but definitely odd."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and on the thin side, and I bought the size small.  I really liked how the body fit, perfect amount of length and figure-flattering without being tight.  However, the neckline was too tight to fit naturally off the shoulder, which is what i was hoping for.  You will def have to order at least a size up if you want that loose/off the shoulder fit."
3.0,"Runs really small, seems good other than you need to go up 2 sizes."
3.0,these look great on my son .... WAY TOO small for me
3.0,The description says that it has a detachable long strap WHICH IT DIDN'T!! Also there is silver permanent marker on the handle where thy must have cut it. Tried to get another but not sold by Amazon. So I'll probably return..sadly
3.0,"I'll give it a thumbs up for design and quality, however, I wouldn't buy it if your head size is over 6.5.  It sets on my head like I got in my son's closet.  I keep it and leave it on a shelf for posterity but I'll NEVER wear it. My head size is 7&1/8."
3.0,"The watch is OK!. It is only useful with certain outfits. Otherwise, it would look awful. A little tight also."
3.0,"I was excited when I received the bag as it looked great. Unfortunately on the second day I used the bag the long purse strap anchor broke off and it can no longer be used.<br /><br />Updated: The company has outstanding service. They contacted me and sent a replacement bag. I will check back in in a few weeks to let you know how the strap is ho,ding up."
3.0,My grandson out grew it in about 8 months.  Had bought another NFL jersey from another company and the quality was much better than this one.
3.0,"The shirt fits nice, but it’s more a t-shirt material doesn’t look like the picture on M<br />Amazon.  I was hoping for more light sweater material. It is cute and fits as a expected. I’ll wear it just not to work as I planned."
3.0,A little bit too see through .but i love ot reguardlesss
3.0,The top is a weird design shape and fits wierd
3.0,"Great price for 3 but too tight. Fit my kids well, but my head is a bit big anyway and it was too tight for comfort. But they worked for Halloween themed masks. Thin. Cool graphic prints."
3.0,"Very sad they are much darker than is shown here .  Yeah ,  I would send them back if it weren't so much trouble but someone will like them ...  Very smooth tho"
3.0,chinsy for the price. would not buy again.
3.0,"The build quality is good. I have 11 1/2 size foot. I ordered 12 1/2-14 size socks. They are so tight across the top of my ankle, that it cuts off circulation. Very uncomfortable after wearing for a full day. The heal pad falls short of the back of the heal. I guess I should of tried them on, before washing them. Washed them on cold and dried on cool. I imagine if you have a very petite build. these would be great. Just a waste of $120 for me. Back to my redwing socks, for a better price. I wouldn't advertise these as a ""men's boot sock"". Just rebrand them as a ""woman's boot sock"" with the mens sizes, sense you have to order 4 sizes above your true foot size, to get a fit."
3.0,"These are cute and you get a lot of them, but I ordered the “silver” ones but received the gold ones. It was t that big of a deal to me because I like both, but just be aware it may happen. For the price, I was happy with the product."
3.0,Returned. Runs small for size. Came in the wrong color.
3.0,"Fits smaller than claimed. Top feels a little cheap, but it looks good on."
3.0,"The fit of the jacket is nice, I'm not into the cycling world so, I was surprised to find there are no side pockets, the pockets are located on the back of the jacket. The jacket description says men's however it has a unisex zipper closing and there is not enough thermal/fleece material to keep you really warm but the black outer material allows for it to breathe well"
3.0,For the size I ordered it didn't fit not even close. Quality was good though.
3.0,Not what I was looking for for my mom. Too tight and material is very wrinkly. Just didn't look right on her.
3.0,The belt is fine but I ordered a 39-40 but I received a 36. my son was still able to fit it but barley.
3.0,I love the watch but had to get a professional to take out the extra links!!  Thankful my brother-in-law is one!
3.0,I guess the size by the measurements and the fit was too loose and had to return.
3.0,"I ordered this hoodie because cold weather is coming and I love having new, cozy, warm hoodies to wear. I bought this one in the largest size offered, since I like my hoodies to be big and roomy. Unfortunately, this is smaller than it should be. While it does fit, it's nowhere near big and roomy like a normal 2x would be. I'm disappointed, as well, that it took FOREVER to get to me. I ordered it on August 21st, and it was marked as shipped on August 22nd. The tracking claimed it was coming from NJ. I live in PA, and it definitely shouldn't have taken 15 days just to ship (especially when it was in stock) and then another 6 days to come from a location about an hour from me (where it landed hours after it finally did ship). While it is a nice, soft hoodie, it's not big enough, and it took 3 weeks to arrive. Very unhappy about that."
3.0,"It looks great and does not look cheap at all. I only wore it once and my sparkly bag spoilt the dress by just brushing against it once. So while it definitely does not look cheap, it is cheap quality. So make sure to not brush against anything poky/uneven/rough while wearing this."
3.0,"I ordered 4xl because I usually wear a 20 in shirts and am 42D, but it was a little big.  Padding was sufficient in the bra part but because shirt is just a little big didn't do much for the girls. Comfortable but 3xl probably would have been better."
3.0,"The weight, design and machete accessory we're top notch. But after one month the back broke on the mask, rendering it a paperweight."
3.0,They were just OK. I returned them. Kind of feel like they’re not worth the price even though they don’t break the bank.
3.0,I returned them because of the feel and weight of the fabric. It didn't feel soft and smooth on my skin and was rather thin and flimsy.
3.0,Sub par stitching. Great material quality
3.0,Wayyyyy too long.
3.0,Nice little glasses but wish they were rubberized like it said. Hard plastic like adult glasses with thin rubber coating on top. Not flexible.
3.0,Ear rings are clip ons
3.0,Quality on the portion that holds onto the watch is a bit lacking but other than that it’s pretty nice in staying in place although I am a bit concerned on its ability to keep its shape.
3.0,The blue purse does not match the image. The blue is not as bright and it comes with a blue strap instead of a brown one.
3.0,"I ordered this to replace another piece of jewelry I had worn. It fits quite well, but when I removed the balls to clean the piece after wearing it after 2 weeks I noticed some internal rusting on the screw and curved barbell itself. I cleaned everything off and when I went to screw the balls back into the barbell the threads stripped pretty easily.<br />You get what you pay for I guess  : /"
3.0,"Very nice shirt, but, if you have wide shoulders it will accentuate them."
3.0,I don’t know what it is about them I don’t like. I just don’t like them. Keeping them in hopes I will get a wild hair and fit them into my shoe rotation.
3.0,"This was somewhat smaller than expected, but it is wearable. The material used is of great quality and the bill seems sturdy enough while still being foldable."
3.0,Its just okay it looks cheap to me.
3.0,I used the size chart but these gloves were much too small. I am disappointed I can’t wear them. I like the style because it covers the back of the hand.  The vendor was willing to accept a return. The shipping would have been half the price of the gloves so kept them to give to a friend.
3.0,No screw-down crown makes 200m water resistance questionable.
3.0,It came tangled and I had to untangle it.
3.0,"This have a great look to them, but are definitely too heavy for long time wear."
3.0,"I like these a lot, they get good use, but they fall short of perfect for a lot of reasons. For shorter rides in the cold they are great but for a longer ride they could be a bit more comfortable.<br /><br />The good:<br />They're super warm. You can go out in sub 50 and be fine in these which is a huge plus.<br />They reach down my leg a little past the ankle which prevents it from getting cold which is really nice.<br />The straps have a breathable mesh back that keeps you from getting super sweaty and overheated.<br />The zips by your feet are long so if need be you can unzip them and roll them up if you get too hot which I have on some high intensity day rides.<br />They look sleek and are ubobtrustive while also having reflective strips.<br />Overall construction quality seems decent.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The padding on these had a lot of issues. It isn't evenly distributed at all with some areas having half an inch thick pads and others having next to no padding at all.<br />The areas with padding are super squishy too and get extremely uncomfortable after about an hour. They're plush for a shorter more relaxed ride like a commute or a relaxed ride but not suited for training with any kind of volume because over time they squish and get really uncomfortable. A more evenly distributed semi firm pad would be far far better for long rides.<br />The placement of the butt pad is really weird. It's really far forward with the thick pads I mentioned earlier and I wish it went just a bit further back. I'm not a super big person but with the medium it got like halfway across my not very big butt.<br />The fit in the groin is really inconsistent. There is not enough overall compression which leads to the front hanging loose, some of which I expected as these are men's and I'm a woman but it was really excessive, and at times slid around in an uncomfortable way.<br /><br />In conclusion: I will keep wearing these for sure but there are definitely some improvements that could be made to the shammy that really hold them back. I want so badly to give them 5 stars for the heat and comfort of the fit on my legs and the shoulder straps but because I can't ride in them more than an hour without a ton of groin discomfort I have to give them a mediocre rating."
3.0,Fit was not typical of what I have had in the past for this style- I have it away.
3.0,"Puzzle/Play rings are always fun, if they don't break apart because the two rings which have to be attached onto the ""circle/ring of origin"" aren't soldered well enough. I purchased two from this source. Both broke within an hour.<br /><br />Disappointed. Not enough to send back for a refund. I'll use them in some form or fashion."
3.0,Feels super cheap. I've never worn it out. I can't stand the way the fabric feels. Too bad.
3.0,I feel price is little bit high other than its fine
3.0,The clamps seemed to have lost their grip after some time. I now have to scrunch my dress shirt up a little bit to make it thicker so the shirt stays could grip it.
3.0,The jacket runs small and the zipper is kind of cheap but I'll admit they refunded my entire order so they got some good customer service
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter who is 5'4"" and 146 lbs. She has broad shoulders and doesn't like her clothes to be too tight. I like the shirt. It is a little thin, and almost see through, but she needs it for choir and can wear a tank under. My only concern is the neck line. Where the model makes it look very modest, we had to add a scarf. She felt very exposed.<br />Cute top for the money."
3.0,"It's a bit large and the material is not flattering. The color and style are spot on, but it does not hang on me the way it does in the photo. The arms are skin tight while the rest of it is a bag on me."
3.0,Pretty true to size but the pictures can be a bit deceiving. Looks a little bit like a sac. It come together in the back to make pleats. Would have been better without that.
3.0,"My husband has this same watch band in the 42 and I was very disappointed that the 38 was the same width of a band. Very masculine looking, so ladies, if you are looking for something more feminine, this is not it. I ended up returning it."
3.0,It doesn't wash well. I liked it the first day (not loved it) Then I washed it :(
3.0,I got a size 11 for my boyfriend and his finger is a 10.5 and it was to big for him. So I bought him a 10. Hopefully it fits perfect.
3.0,"This dress kind of seemed like a sack, It had no shape to it and just kind of hung there. I didn't hate it, but i couldn't see myself wearinig it. I returned it for this reason unfortunately."
3.0,Updated Review: It's ok. The half of the band where the adjustment holes are has separated. It still works and you really can't see it since it's on the underside when wearing it but it still should hold together better. For a black leather band I'm trying another brand and so far it's been holding up well.<br /><br />Original review: 5 stars:I'm using this for my Apple Watch Series 2 42mm. Got the adapters for attaching the band to the watch and cut a hole in the middle of the cuff so it touches my arm for full functionality. Also like that you can wear it with or without the cuff.
3.0,Very odd fit at top of dress. The chest/wrap doesn’t cover chest. An undershirt/tank is a must. Disappointed.
3.0,It’s a pretty enough bag but the zipper doesn’t separate so that really bites when trying to get books in or out. That sad zipper is the only reason I would not buy this again.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:4750307d963e4bdee880ff506a673585]] I ordered two of them for stacking.  They arrived in two separate packages on the same day. Initially I was impressed, the stones were beautiful. The metal was perfectly polished. Then I opened the second one, polish was great, but was MISSING A STONE. Both were returned as these were bought to stack together."
3.0,It is pretty but fabric is not great
3.0,"It’s OK, not the best quality. A little shorter than I expected. I’m 6 foot and about 220 pounds. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"One chain turned a copper color and the ring that holds SpongeBob broke, patrick came off the other one in the same way"
3.0,The heart and cross was no where close to fitting on the chains.
3.0,"These are comfortable and quality compression shorts. However, only 1 out of the 3 pairs fit me. I was so excited when I tried the first pair on and love how they fit. A couple of days later I put another pair on and they barely come to the top of my rear end. So disappointing, the 3rd pair did the same as well. They all show the same size on the tags, XL."
3.0,"Too dark, lenses are a little big"
3.0,"Arrived broken and piece missing inside cellophane bag, so shipped that way.<br />Shame-looked pretty."
3.0,"I really like the way they look. The only thing is, they're fragile. Maybe I put them on too tight, but they're chokers, they're supposed to be flush with your neck and not hanging. But when I go to take them off, I've broken the chains a few times. Easy fix, but flimsy material. They are cheap, so I can't really expect much more."
3.0,"Needs more room for the chest area I had gotten my size but I'm top heavy ,"
3.0,"This product is great but when I received it, one of the shoes weren't displaying the same colors as its pair. I tried to follow the instructions on how to fix this but it wasn't as easy as the instructions specified. However, I was able to return and replace it. I would have given this item a 5 star but getting defective product sucks and having to go through returning the item and waiting for a new one was just a hassle."
3.0,"I wore it before washing and it fit perfect, after one wash it shrunk considerably and got a lot shorter.  I wish it had come pre-shrunk."
3.0,"They fall pretty short above the ears. On an adult man, I feel like they look more like a kid’s hat."
3.0,Leg<br /> was not what I would consider tapered.
3.0,Top is very small and pants very large.  I went with a medium and weigh 140. 8 would advise a small and just expect the top to be tight but its better than rolling your pants 3 times
3.0,Works but runs small
3.0,"I like the look of this purse.  It has plenty of space too.  I also like that you can zip the entire bag closed, which was one of the reasons I bought it.  It is not cheap-looking at all.  The biggest reason I don't like it is because the liner on the handles has already started to peel - i had to tear them off.  Maybe not for everyday use."
3.0,"This item ordered on 8/3/2014 arrived 8/5/2014 sold by KRT Distributions. The material of the pouches do not appear to be microfiber cloth. I would be guessing what is the material of these pouches. There are no labels of fiber content, and nothing there is listed by the seller. I would be strongly concerned cleaning my expensive lens with these bags. The Camouflage patterns are attractive change to the basic black bag. I'm somewhat disappointed in that I expected the fiber content to be microfiber (though nothing stated the fiber content)."
3.0,"I love the selection of shapes included in this set. The quantity is definitely good for the price. Unfortunately, I find the finish, the color, extremely gaudy and unpleasing to the eye. I am considering adding some rub and buff to tone down the bright, very gold color and make them a bit more ""aged"", vintage looking. I am using them in projects that are not wearable so that may do the trick for me. I do have a couple that are bent but for the price I gave, I don't actually feel a loss there. If you are looking for that brighter, very golden color then this could be a good set for you. The sizes are relatively small in comparison to some but not too small to use for a variety of things/projects. Perfect for small accouterments on gift tags or cards and a great size for many jewelry applications. The couple that I received that are bent, it doesn't sway my feelings that these are relatively sturdy little key charms but I can't speak on the durability of the finish since I have not had a real reason to test that out and I haven't had them that long anyway. I am hanging them on some decorations that are more likely going to be hung outside on my mom's patio, under a covered area so I suppose time will tell how well that finish holds up with the humidity we experience around here in the south, USA. If the need ever arose again and I needed the brighter color, I would actually consider ordering again but as of now I have to find a successful way to tone them down a little."
3.0,More of a lightweight sweater than a long sleeve t-shirt.  It is a weird polyester blend.  I suggest sizing up if you want it to fit like it does the model in the picture. Ok for the price.
3.0,"Nice glasses ,A little fragile though.Handle with care."
3.0,"These are pretty good glasses. I have the polarized black ones. The polarization is strong, the lenses are dark. But... the right lens has a slight distortion. It's not major, but enough that it distracts you at times. When you only pay this much for sun glasses, it's about what I expect. I'll probably keep them and throw them in my work truck for when I forget glasses otherwise, but these won't be my everyday sun glasses."
3.0,"The license plate is great quality and looks awesome.  However, it is really thick so now I'm in the process of trying to find license plate screws that are longer than the standard 3/4"" because the screws that came with the adapter for my truck aren't long enough to go through this plate and into the holder on the front bumper.  If I can solve this problem then it will be great (although I will only be able to screw in through 2 holes and it is too thick to fit in the slots on the bottom of the holder)."
3.0,"Somewhat in the small size, but I love it, it just give me the incentive too loose a couple of pounds, I love the material. So everything I have purchase."
3.0,"They are huge, I cut them in half"
3.0,Band is really pretty but after a week or two began to fray. Not very good quality.
3.0,Okay so these are extremely comfortable and fit as expected... BUT....They are very thin. I had to stop wearing them to work when my husband said hey I can see the outline of your underwear. Doh... Darn because I really like them.. I got black ones too thinking it would help with sheerness...
3.0,"3 stars cause they're cheap and look good, but the don't last long. The screws come loose and it's strips very easily when you try to tighten them. The plastic frame also cracked on me somehow when I wasn't looking, could have been from just being in my pocket."
3.0,"I recently bought a previously loved Lexus for myself.  It is the first time I’ve had a key FOB and the hole in it was too small for my  key chain.  When I saw a picture of this one I thought that I could place the FOB on the horizontal piece and put my other keys on the other metal clip, but it is too thick for my keys.  So I now have my house key next to the FOB and need to carry a second key chain for my other keys.  I really like it but am disappointed that I still need to carry two key chains."
3.0,"The top is cute, however after one wear the shirt had piling on it. And it's also shorter than I would prefer. I wear size Small tops, and got this in a small as well, but if I raise my hands my stomach hangs out. I would not order it again."
3.0,Definitely not squat proof. They were also a lot longer than expected.
3.0,it is not remove blurring
3.0,I love this necklace but I lost two stones after wearing it twice. That was disappointing.
3.0,"The glasses were great, but there was so much packaging at this price point, if have liked them to be cheaper without there packaging. I'm buying glass, not packaging."
3.0,The colors are not soft as shown.  The shape is strange and unflattering.  I am returning.
3.0,"Super disappointed.  I got this &#34;rain jacket&#34; to take overseas anticipating rainy days there that are normal there in the fall.  It fits perfectly, the design is perfect for my hourglass shape, its lightweight and attractive.  It does not however keep out rain like a rain jacket.  I ran about 20-25 feet in a normal rain shower and the rain soaked through to my shirt underneath.  (I had zipped up all the way and hood up)"
3.0,"Lightweight, not very durable."
3.0,It not last long and had to clean to fast
3.0,"Dress is comfortable. True to size. Jersey material all front buttons functional but no pockets.<br />I took away stars because the placement of the elastic band is right under the bust so I had to have it altered as it made me uncomfortable and gave the ""pregnant"" look. Torso should have been longer and I'm only 5'4."
3.0,The bodice fits great! I love the longer fit so i can wear layers. The straps are a problem. They are to long and when washed they tend to shrivel and not lay flat.
3.0,They are clear and comfortable.  I hardly know that I have them on until I sweat and they fog up.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:64ba77308cf1daac3ab2530b63589df1]] The Fallorchid Women Scoop Neck Tank is made from a very thin fabric making it very see through. I will definitely need to wear a bra or something like nipple covers underneath it but, I’m afraid even those will show through. See attached video and photos for reference....they are taken away from a window on the other side of the room, and also in front of the window.<br /><br />The fabric has absolutely no support either like other tanks I have purchased on Amazon that have stretch enough to be somewhat supportive of the breasts.<br /><br />The front and back of this tank are cut almost exactly the same that it makes it almost impossible to differentiate one from another. There isn’t a tag on the back side either that would distinguish that it is the back (see attached photo).<br /><br />I find the neck line to be on the high side and unflattering. The straps are thinner than I thought they were going to be.  I found that both of these things were hard to recognize on the model in the photograph in the listing because of her hair.<br /><br />This is not my favorite tank."
3.0,I ordered a medium. I should’ve got a large because they fit tight around the thigh area. I ordered black and received black and gray.
3.0,Very small barely visible.
3.0,Very thin.  Unable to cover front at all.
3.0,Not at al km whst I expected. Quality and durability very flimsy.
3.0,"I loved wearing this watch so much! Affordable, stylish, and comfortable, I was hoping that it would last with some TLC. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, the watch lasted almost two years to the day since I purchased it."
3.0,Fits very big and i have an regular wrist
3.0,"Much like most people, sometimes you need a LBD in a pinch. This did the trick but the fit did require some extra help (read: safety pins) and the material isn't high quality so it likely won't stay in my closet long. The design was nice and elegant though - I'm tempted to find the same style in a higher quality."
3.0,These are very cute for day to day wear. They do tend to run on the smaller size we returned and sized up.
3.0,I like it but too smal
3.0,This shirt isn't as stretchy as I hoped. As soon as you put it on it sort of starts to stretch out and just lose shape. It's still cute but not the fit I was hoping for
3.0,sweater fits but hard to put hood on
3.0,Bought this for my girlfriend she loves it says it is super comfy the shirt is a bit tight on her though
3.0,"I normally wear a 1x, however I purchased the 2x to be on the safe side, but it was too tight in the arms."
3.0,"Came on time and the quality of the material and print were excellent, the only thing is the print came slanted on my shirt I received. Really dissapointed, I ordered the wrong size so going to return and get a medium and hope it's centered."
3.0,"Really cute! Very, very thin though. It doesn't add any warmth. Fits as expected."
3.0,"I like the socks but just barely fit my feet.  I wear size 6.5-7 shoes.  Not going to purchase again, would if they came in sizes."
3.0,"Was cheap looking... yes, it is a child’s but they could have sold it from the bargain store for a couple bucks.  I guess it’s ok for something that’s going to be at the bottom of a toy box before too long,  but the price was way too much."
3.0,"I bought a previous dress the same brand.. Woosea and did an XXL, to big but kept it anyway... so I thought o should order a L, received and tried it.. so bummed... it was small... I am keeping it though so it forces me to lose weight. I will buy another, same brand and try a XL and see how that goes."
3.0,The shirt was stiffer than it looks in the picture and wrinkled easily. I was expecting a better drape.
3.0,"Good, a little heavy but it's ok"
3.0,The material was not what I expected. But it fitted perfectly for me. Especially when I have a small body
3.0,Quality seems good but runs small - returned it
3.0,Poncho smelled absolutely awful when I got it.. I had to wash it a few times to get the smell out.  I'm 5'6 and it barley cover my butt.. but then again I might of shrunk it washing it so many times..
3.0,to  floppy  style  is  nice  nice  color
3.0,I don't think it's metal but if it is it's very lightweight. I liked the design but it was less impressive when I received it. It was a gift though and the recipient loves it.
3.0,"If you have a squishy tummy, don't expect much. I researched for a while for affordability and fit. These looked very promising until I put them on. I am a mom so my lower tummy is soft and squishy, it makes me look like two sausages in their casings. The elastic is 1 inch wide and twists up withing the fabric. It is not a high waisted option so if that is what you are expecting keep that in mind. Camel toe for days if you try to pull em up too high."
3.0,Very helpful staff at yazilind quite plz with the out come thank you for the quick respond look forward shopping at yaziliand jewellery again
3.0,"They look nice but they are kinda wide. Other than that, not bad."
3.0,They were just way to small. I'm not a large person or anything but these &#34;one size&#34; fits all is actually a joke.
3.0,There's no tummy control in these pants as advertised.  They're just a regular pair of yoga pants. But fabric is good and fit well.
3.0,The ring itself is very pretty. It just runs a size too small. I was looking forward to wearing it sadly it doesn't fit
3.0,"A *little* itchy.  Next time I'm getting the non-wool version.  If you're not itched by wool, try it!"
3.0,really cute but ran small
3.0,I'm a size 11 1/2. But I ordered size 12 just to be safe. These fit me like a size 10. If you have wide feet forget it. If you're ordering from the USA order one to two sizes larger
3.0,"First of all they are absolutely beautiful,but that's way to many with the backs off of them,none should be broken off when your spending your money. I'm a person that hate sending things back,so I gotta take the time to glue them back on so I can use them 🤦‍♀️not fare!"
3.0,"Good enough that returning it isn’t worth my time (I’ll use it as a backup), but I would definitely not buy another.  My go to sun hoodie is the Patagonia Tropic Comfort.  This BD hoodie has less coverage under my chin, no thumb holes and fabric already has a few snags despite wearing it only 2-3 times of light use.  Fit is good"
3.0,"Overall too large.  Length is odd; the shorter in the front thing doesn't look good.  Seemed really comfortable, but had to return because of the length issue."
3.0,"A nice color and pattern, but scarf is very thin. It doesn't really do much to keep you warm, but it might work well as a fashion accessory in climates with mild winters"
3.0,I should've expected this to be tight even in its biggest size still cute though
3.0,It looks like it does in the pictures except for the stars are on the right side so I feel like an idiot wearing it
3.0,Order 1/2 size dwn
3.0,"It's beautiful, got a lot of complaints"
3.0,Nice dress.  The 3x fits like an XL.
3.0,Had no idea it was so big!
3.0,Product was super cute when it arrived but it got discolored very quickly and one of the chains broke like the next day.
3.0,This Much smaller than I anticipated. It would be perfect for a child
3.0,"I ordered the black version in medium-size and it fitted perfectly despite not having adjustable straps.  The navy version was also in medium but was like one size bigger even with the adjustable straps.  I suspect that I actually got a small of the black one.  There seems to be a lack of standard in their sizes.  The dress is rather long so a petite person will need to get the dress shortened.  Another thing, the zipper gets a little stuck on the lace part.  But I do love the black version because it complimented my shape.<br />I would like to order another one because one was really cute but I don't know which size to order now."
3.0,These are really cute and I loved them while they lasted.
3.0,"The neckline for this bra is really really pretty. However, it offers very little support even for small chested women (32B). Doesn't do much to give any lift or support."
3.0,The wire didn't last long around them.
3.0,"I ordered these for my 1 year old, I know she's small so I ordered the smallest size - they are HUGE!! I don't understand why the manufacturers think babies feet are so big. 4.33 inches is very big for a small baby, my baby's feet are about 3.5 inches. I think these sandals are adorable and would love to get them if only they would fit."
3.0,It's beautiful and soft but the elastic is weird. It flops and folds and makes me so uncomfortable I never want to wear the skirt.
3.0,"I’m 5’2”. Although these were super cute and great quality, they were VERY long. Not something I could use."
3.0,It was good but not for outside only for home<br />Yes it is low quality sleeveless shirt
3.0,"100% polyester. Fair enough with me.<br />But, it is the most shiny tie ever. Like it was made from plastic.<br />Many nice ties have a slight sheen on them, in fact I love that look. But this one is a glare that shines so much you cannot see the pattern on the tie! If I was saying a regular shiny tie is ""semi-gloss"", this one is ""high-gloss"". I wanted to love this tie so much as the pattern advertised is cool. But, it is a big disappointment. It could just be this one specific design. I got another from the same company that was very slightly less shiny (a darker tie - although still felt a little bit plastic). The tie length and width are perfectly fine, though. Described as a ""formal business tie"", that is quite laughable though."
3.0,"I’m a 34DD & the top was wearable but definitely on the small side. I did not get to even wear this though because when I received it, the seem on the side of the top was ripped. I will say the material is nice, the purple I ordered was STUNNING, &<br />I did really like the skirt & the way the skirt fit."
3.0,"Said $8 and prime product, once I bought it it charged $22 and was not prime. Very thin and runs small."
3.0,The unusual lilac pink color is so pretty -- and flatterning to my complexion (very fair).  The elastic on it is fairly constricting across my arms but I got used to it and wore it to a couple of summer events last summer and received some compliments on it.
3.0,"On thing that I do not like about the Stompeez slippers for kids, the sizes are way bigger than what a child normally wears. The small size for a child, fits a woman that wears a size 6, a med. can be worn by a woman of a large size. These should be made smaller for children. So what happens is the child's heel doesn't hit the part that makes the mouth open up. Not pleased with this product at all."
3.0,"The packaging was pretty bad its was flattened in the packaging. The crown is bent on both sides. But, the quality is good and the crown is easily fixable."
3.0,The zipper broke on the 1st use. You can still close it with the buttons but disappointing about the zipper
3.0,This states it’s a 16g and it’s more like a 18 or 20 gauge. I have 8 piercings with a 16g and this is not.
3.0,necklace is cheaper made than I expected. the heart is actually a hard plastic and I expected more of a thin glass
3.0,"These are okay. The fit is weird, and they are uncomfortable. Very see through as well. Luckily: I cycle in the comfort of my own home so I’m not too concerned about how they look. Functionality wise, they do the trick. They provide extra padding for comfort, and I saw a noticeable difference. Overall, they get the job done."
3.0,To big and I  Got a small
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:82ed03dfc7905d1299539c98411ed3b3]] I ordered this shirt to wear for a relaxed casual occasion.<br /><br />This shirt is made of cotton and linen and the material felt very lightweight and also very thin.<br /><br />I ordered a large size and this shirt ran small, was very tight and I was unable to wear as it was not a regular fit in large. It felt more of a slim fit shirt.  My son who wears a medium was able to comfortably fit in the shirt and it<br />looked good on him.<br /><br />The material did not feel durable and there were many areas of the shirt that had bad stitching and extra thread sticking out.<br /><br />Overall even though I was able to give the shirt to my son for use who is a medium, the size did run very small for a large.  Otherwise, I would have needed to lose at least 10 pounds to be able to wear it. The shirt did look ok on him but the quality fell short. Therefore I rate this product a three out of five stars.<br /><br />Hope you liked this review and let me know if it helped you out."
3.0,"The fabric is super stiff, even after a few washes. And the arms are sorta tight."
3.0,Quality seems good but they're about a half size small. Not quite what I was expecting. Returning.
3.0,I love the color a mix of pinks and blues. A whole lot of material and I couldn't quite get the wrap like the picture but its a lot of material.
3.0,"The oversize is correct.  A little too big I think.  The frame is a diffent type of plastic is light but stiff. Looking for a diffent pair.  The blocking of the sun is nice though, so they will work for now."
3.0,I usually wear a large so I upsized to XL and it was still too small
3.0,These Skyway glasses are cute.  It is too bad that they are so fragile and thin.  They are more like dollar store fashion glasses than I hoped.  I would look at other glasses for a few more dollars that will last longer.  I am afraid they will bust the first time I drop them.
3.0,"These are cute jogger pants but the sizing is just way, way off!  This is listed as a women's large but it would fit more like a small-medium sized teenager or an XS woman size.  The pants are heavy weight (made from rayon, nylon and spandex) so they'd be great for the winter season but would be too heavy for spring and summer.  One feature I really like is the reflective fabric around the pockets-this is a nice safety feature for when a person is walking at night or dusk.  Overall, nice pair of jogging pants but the company needs to fix the sizing of this product!"
3.0,"Very pretty, but the hummingbird piece fell out within 3 days :/"
3.0,They fall down constantly... I need to order from another company.. would not order again
3.0,They were significantly too short for me unless I wore them very low on my hips... but that’s not how they were made (then the crotch is too low.)<br />Probably could have ordered up a size. (I’m 5’6” 130 lbs for reference)<br />The material was also a little thicker than I’d like for summery pants. Unfortunately had to return because they just didn’t work for me.
3.0,They are comfortable but are a bit tight. A half size larger would be too big for me. The shoes look the same as the picture.
3.0,"I sized up a full size and was still too small. I normally wear a size 10, ordered an XL and still too small."
3.0,The earrings were not same length one was longer than the order
3.0,Easy to install and comfortable. Discolored extremely easy. After wearing this for a couple of days it started to discolor.  :(
3.0,It just did not seem like the bottoms and the top went together well. It was made nice. Thick material. Enforced. I returned.
3.0,Bands are way too large on my wrist .
3.0,"Very cute, but order a little smaller then you would normally wear. It was really big."
3.0,"Ordered an xs and was snug, but I’m okay with that. I do like the shiny black but unfortunately they are not sweat proof. Did not hide the coochie odor. They are extremely flexible, though. I would order black if I were you to hide the sweat marks."
3.0,"Quality was not as expected, shoe was too narrow and long (wrong size)"
3.0,The black pair was cracked and fell apart immediately. Please note that these posts are on the thicker side too. I forced them and had a bad time.
3.0,"Runs big, and does not look as nice in person as in the photo. Skirt is not as full either as pictured.Fabric has a funny feel to it."
3.0,These were more like underwear or spanx. Great for under dresses or skirts. Not ideal for gym or lounging. Fit is good
3.0,"Love these as they are super comfortable. However, I was disappointed as the top ball shattered after wearing for two weeks."
3.0,"I love this skirt and the pockets. I give it a 3, because the seam is starting to come apart a little in the back other than that the rest is great."
3.0,Got a medium but fits like small. Get one size up! Cute though
3.0,I like the style on the shorts but it’s just a little to long
3.0,"it works great, love, love, love it...the only issue I have is when I have more than a few bills, it doesn't close properly...I work around it...but, wish it had just a little more money room...I could take out some cards...but everything is a card these days...thanks for a great idea..."
3.0,These are bigger and thicker than I expected them to be
3.0,"Disappointed that the color of the jeans I received are a darker blue than the photo. I had expected them to be lighter with a greenish tinge, as suggested by the photo and the description of the color. Also, the ""premium"" denim is thin and cheap."
3.0,The material is good but too small
3.0,"The size run small! It is a beautiful dress.  Beware, the return shipping was deducted from my refund. I will NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!"
3.0,Robe is much heavier than expected. It is more like a knit material than cotton. No really what I was looking for. Packaging accidentally thrown away so can't return.
3.0,This mask is gorgeous and I love the print but it swallows my entire face. Wayyy to big for the average person’s face.
3.0,"I rate this for comfort.  A very convenient and comfortable bonnet for any desired hairstyle.  My main concern is the thickness of it.  It really doesn’t retain moisture in hair as expected.  However, it is still a decent bargain."
3.0,I like the shoes but only one shoe would come on in I had to charge the other one but there was no UBS cord or instructions come with the shoes at all so I had to charge the shoe with my phone charger hope I don't mess the shoe up using the wrong cord.. But my son is going to love his new shoes..
3.0,I'm disappointed. They have a much darker shade than my previous ones with the same label. Not near as gold & crisp. I could have bought something like these at a dollar store
3.0,"I ordered this mask to use for a Jabberwocky Gladiator Cosplay. I took off two stars because the paint was peeling off. It wasnt that big of a deal to me because I planned to add spikes, whiskers, and completely repaint the mask. So I just used some Goof Off to finish taking off the peeling paint. However, if someone was expecting the mask to be in wearable condition, they might be upset. The peeling was quit severe in some areas.<br /><br />Now, for my purposes. This mask is well built. It was comfortable for my daughter to wear all day. It made my daughter's cosplay look even more beautiful."
3.0,It does not fit as the model in picture shows. its more of an empire waist... even for me... someone with no breastage.
3.0,"Sizes run small. I bought my daughter who is normally a medium an XL and just fits her.  Fabric feels like costume material as well, but my daughter still loves it."
3.0,I have a small size A cup chest and this dress barely squeezed them in and made them look flatter (which when I already have a small bust that is never the goal). The material felt strange - almost costume like. I didn't realize until I had it on that it zipped on the side so it was hard to put on and off until you realize that. The straps also seem to be oddly spaced.
3.0,"I am a &#34;top-heavy&#34; 42DD, so I bought these in 3XL just to be safe.  They are tight... REALLY tight!!  They may work okay for workout, but I wore one all day under a summer dress and my shoulder blades ached all night.  Well made, but you'll want to buy a couple sizes larger than you think you'll need."
3.0,My kiddo just turned 2 n the 3t is tight on her. my hubby actually cut the neck because it was tight going over her head. Mind u she is not large for her age (50% average wt n ht)
3.0,Super cute but they run small 😕
3.0,"It's very pretty and the jersey knit material is quite slowly but the size is quite large  So much so that the collar exposes more  Lady parts than I prefer.<br /> As I do like how pretty the colors are, will figure out a way to change the color together or something so I don't always have to wear a shirt underneath"
3.0,My son isn’t really able to wear these I bought a larger size but they barely fit over his heel they are really cute and not bad quality but they run really small
3.0,"I bought these goggles for a 4 hour chemistry lab. They do not fit my face properly and there are holes around my nose and cheeks where vapors can get in. Do not recommend. I am a girl, so maybe they just aren't made for girls faces? Regardless, they don't work for my purposes."
3.0,Not quite what I was looking for but they work.  Love the pocket!
3.0,They are a little on the heavy side and keep sliding off my nose
3.0,Liked the color but the boots have too high a heel and are heavy which hurts my knees.
3.0,As advertised. Just be warned - they are very thin socks!
3.0,"Sitting down the legs are too tight. I am an average-size athletic guy at 5'11"" and 170 lbs."
3.0,Very poor quality. Many loose threads and uneven seams. Seams were stitched on outside of sweatshirt and very roughly done. Only reason not returning is because bought for work so looks don't matter.<br /><br />Edit- increase of 1 star as Colosseum reached out to me about the issues.
3.0,My wife was not happy that this three inch diameter tomato only measures two and a half inches. Less room for pins! We would have bought the four inch one instead. Otherwise fine.
3.0,"Meh, expected something a little more snazzy, nothing wrong with bag, just doesn't have that pop! Looks exactly as pictured, denim is soft..."
3.0,I ordered some of these a while back and these are thinner than the old ones. I liked the old ones better. These don't really show through which is nice.
3.0,Very pretty but a bit small in the chest area.
3.0,I wish they were bigger
3.0,Este articulo lo compre pero no le quedo bien a mi hijo y ya fue devuelto hace 2 o3 semanas
3.0,"My wrist is 5 1/2 inches and this watch band is too large, such a disappointment. Nice watch but I'll have to return it."
3.0,They say its a official shirt this is what i found when I bought it. It looks like a good shirt.
3.0,This is a cute top but after a few washes it starts to get pills.
3.0,Would get 5 stars but the shape of the crystal is not what is shown
3.0,"I wanted to wear this amazing jumper with a long denim jacket for a friend’s Denim, Diamond and Pearls Birthday theme but my jumper ran small so it was a no go"
3.0,"It arrived safely, the color was true but after 4 days I'm waiting for the fishy odor (I think it's the glue) to disappear. It's not very pleasant. The quality  seems mediocre, but I need it now."
3.0,Not made for warmth or durability. I've had them less than a week & most of the buttons are gone on all of them. The touch screen fingerpads work better after washing mine. Still cute gloves and I'll use them this season.
3.0,Cute purse. Bought to have something smaller. But very kiddish.  Ended up giving to my 10 year old.
3.0,"The waist beads themselves are well made and carefully woven onto durable string. Completely adjustable and the beads seem like good quality. Unfortunately the color schemes in set 1 weren’t well thought out , but a good set nonetheless. I really only like 1 out of the 4 so I will be giving those away."
3.0,"For the price I’m not too upset. Seams are uneven and not well sewn so i have to wear a cardigan over. It’s a nice light breathable material. Good length, on the long side but I’m also 5’2”."
3.0,a little on the frumpy side.  I think the fabric should be a little thicker for a dress.
3.0,Good. It slides up though.
3.0,Larger frames than expected
3.0,"This  one  was  disappointing  it  looks  cute  and  functional,  but  the  coverage  is  questionable.  I  would  not  recommend  this  swimwear  to  a  friend."
3.0,I love the style and color of this dress! It runs a little small though and I will need to alter it to make it fit comfortably.
3.0,I ordered 3xl and they fit like a xl
3.0,The shorts were fine. Just not my size.
3.0,"Honestly, I ordered this because I was curious about what would arrive; what I would actually get for so cheap a price and would it really be made of silk. There were no reviews when I placed my order. This is my experience: This set is beautiful. It looks exactly as pictured. Everything arrived as described within 15 days of order date. I ordered XL (size is listed at the end of the description paragraph at the top). They look more like a small/medium. Each item is individually packaged in a ziploc bag. It is certainly silky-soft and I was thinking it really was silk, though a poor quality silk, until I washed it. I washed the robe and nightgown as you are supposed to wash silk, (in cold water, in a bowl with your chosen silk detergent), then I rolled them in a towel and set my iron to silk. I had my suspicions when they weren't wrinkled as I unrolled the towel, but it was when I was ironing that I became certain I was ironing polyester satin and not silk. It doesn't act the same as silk when being ironed. I did not do the burn test. I don't feel like I need to. Maybe someone else will. It's worth the money, though. It just won't fit everybody."
3.0,The dress isn't like the picture. The pleats aren't spaced like the picture. The color is exact color.  Size was fitting exact. Back was lower than I expected. Middle of back.
3.0,Fits small but a size bigger
3.0,"While pretty well made, this is much too small for my needs. It also is not a real fanny pack as advertised."
3.0,Like the way they look
3.0,too bulky for me okay if you like huge beading.
3.0,Even on the tightest loop they are too big.
3.0,Kinda of cute for costume jewelry . Chose the pink set.  Chain broke on first wearing about 1 hour after I put it on.
3.0,"Cheapo belt to hold my work equipment pouch. Inexpensive and basic, but gets the job done."
3.0,Bar lenghth was too big to use as a smiley but spikes were perf size so I put them on different length bar
3.0,"I like the look and feel of the belts however, on one of the belts the metal clip on the end of the belts fell off the first time I used it.  So far on the two other belts the metal clips are on solid but will have to wait and see how they hold up"
3.0,"The material for this product is not sweat to suit material at all. It's very thin and lightweight. It comes as pictured, but not what we expected. It does run quite a bit big but for the price we paid it will work when she grows into it"
3.0,Shirt is okay. Necklace is super cheap looking and went into the trash. Somehow I ended up with 2 of the same color when I ordered 2 different colors. Wouldn't order again.
3.0,It was very inexpensive so cant really expect much. Its a nice looking necklace but I had to glue one of the stones back on from shipping and the lock was soled closed so I had to open it with pliers and change the clasps with new ones.
3.0,Alittle tight in the body and really long for me it seems as thought as you ordered bigger size they just added length
3.0,They was a little tight need to be bigger
3.0,"Got more compliments on this watch then I have of any other in the past. It is a decent watch but don’t expect it to keep great time. Mine would regularly lose a minute or two daily. The second hand was more jittery then the low end seiko style movements I have owned. It would straight up pause for 3-5 seconds depending on how my hand was resting. The band felt really nice but the threads came out causing it to look cheap and tacky in less then a week.<br />If you need a watch to bang around and don’t care if it keeps good time or not, then this may be ok for you. On the other hand, if you want a smooth hibeat watch that keeps good time and has high quality parts you may need to look elsewhere."
3.0,Not exactly what I expected but they are cute for a night out
3.0,"I have been looking for a quality pair of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses and based on the reviews (and a &#34;Lightning Deal&#34; offered by Amazon at the time), I purchased the &#34;TOREGE Polarized Sports Sunglasses With Five Interchangeable Lens&#34; black frame with rainbow lenses model. When I tried the sunglasses on, they didn't feel right. I looked in the mirror and saw that the glasses were crooked on my face. I then took the sunglasses off and put them on a flat desk. Sure enough, the frames were crooked, with one arm visible off the desk while the other sat flat on it (I have attached pictures). I contacted Torege and after asking me to provide pictures, they responded &#34;i think it is the reason of bad shippment&#34;(???) and added that they would send a replacement. Being skeptical, I returned the sunglasses to Amazon for a refund. I'm glad I did because the replacement sunglasses, as I expected, were also crooked. Also, the instructions on how to change the lenses was also missing from the replacement pair. Not sure if this flaw is specific to the &#34;black frame with rainbow lenses&#34; but I don't want to bother with contacting the company again to try a different base lense. It's a shame because the glasses come with great accessories and the lenses seem high quality. The frame on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />***UPDATE 7/25/2018***<br /><br />Today I replaced the rainbow lens that are installed with the Black Polarized lens (one of the interchangeable lens that comes with the Black Frame/Rainbow Lens option) and the frame sat on my face correctly and the arms both sit on a flat surface. I did not try the other lens to see if I would get the same result because it is somewhat difficult to replace the lens and I did not want to go through the trouble. I'm not sure why the frame is crooked when using the original rainbow lens but I suspect that the base lens might be flawed. I emailed TOREGE with my findings."
3.0,"Overall, top and bottom are a little on the big size.  The boy shorts only had strings on one side and I'm quite sure they should have had them on both sides.  The waist on the bottoms are also too big.  It is a really comfortable suit though and I haven't decided rather to keep or send back in smaller size and also with the hope of getting one that isn't defective (strings on bottom).  It looks a little weird with one side tied up and the other side just hanging down."
3.0,"I'm 5'7 150lbs and these are WAY too tight. I wish they were more stretchy bc other than the fit, I love how soft and warm they are."
3.0,The earrings are nice but not the quality it should be for the price!! For the price I expected a much better made pair of earrings! The image isn't clear and the detailing is poor and the wires are thin! I guess I paid for the subject and not the quality!
3.0,QUICK DELIEVERY Long chain and just as seen here.
3.0,Very cool but very flimsy
3.0,"They are soft, but feel a bit cheap. I did not receive the deep green color, mine was more of a dark tan. The also were shorter then in the picture. They will work in my freezer of an office."
3.0,IM GONNA HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT TO FIT THIS BUT ITS VERY PRETTY
3.0,"This dress is made of a light material that feels really nice but that is a bit sheer.  With darker colors, this should not be an issue.  I had planned to wear this dress in public, but I have decided to keep it as a night gown because it shows every body curve (including the unwanted ones)."
3.0,strap is adjustable....but doesnt stretch
3.0,"La camiseta era muy grande como para un adulto, yo me metí a camisetas de jóvenes y no pensé que fueran tan grandes tal vez fue mi error"
3.0,"These run small.  A girl in the thinner side would be fine (but they would be on the shorter side). Unfortunately my daughter removed tags so I can’t return, but heed the warning."
3.0,I like the top (fits on small side for a large) but the bottoms were way too skimpy for me. The back was very revealing...half of my rear was hanging out of it. Seems like quality material though
3.0,It was fine needed help from my husband to put it on.
3.0,This material is so thin and just fits so blah for me! I will use it as pajamas!
3.0,"I like these. I needed them for postpartum swelling. But, my nurse was not a fan. She said it did do much for my feet. They were perfect for my legs though."
3.0,"These shorts are super cute and I love the pair I ordered. However, they do run pretty small, and I suggest sizing up."
3.0,Shorts run small
3.0,Didn’t expect to be as loose fitting as it was. I was intending to wear this under my hart had and I feel it wouldn’t be comfortable. They are definitely high viz and reflective. Just was expecting something together and thinner
3.0,It is for the long neck . It does not go with the neck curve . It is not for a long time wear
3.0,they look really fake
3.0,Was well constructed but the fabric felt strange. I had no idea it would feel slick like that. Felt it would make me too hot so returned it. Otherwise it was nice product.
3.0,Cheap! but that's what I paid for Cheap! I haven't put it on yet because its so cheap I'm afraid it'll just fall apart.
3.0,"The pictures indicated some opalescent shine on the stones. While I wasn’t expecting high grade opals, all I got was clear rock chips… no shimmer."
3.0,I was worried it would be too small if I bought my size so I went larger.  I am pretty sure I could go with a size smaller than my normal size.  Looks like a giant bag on me.
3.0,Love the look and fit but the neckline goes down so far that it will not stay straight. It keeps moving to one side.
3.0,"I love it only because of the SEGA logo, as it is my main console to collect for now! Though, hat seems to be a bit small, and the front is oversized, which is great for a lot of other people, though I like a more of another style of hats"
3.0,"This was really cute, except I looked terrible in it. Had to return - chest part was too big and leg length was not quite what I wanted"
3.0,Sleeves were super long but torso part is perfect.
3.0,Disappointed with the quality and fit
3.0,"Overall the quality of the bag is great and I love it, the issues I have with it are that the design on the bag is not the same as advertised and that was disappointing as I really love the design shown on the bags page, the design is similar and still great but not nearly as good as what is advertised. The other issue I have with the bag is its size, it is not the same size as advertised, most likely an inch or two less, it is definitely a small bag and is meant more for fashion than for really carrying things around. The quality of the material is great and the bag overall is really nice and I enjoy it minus the faults I have listed."
3.0,"I love the socks themselves. The Queenees Women's No Show Bamboo Ultra Low-Cut Sock Liners, Pack of Four, fit well (I'm a size 6) and are very comfortable. They don't slide off my heel either. HOWEVER There is an excessive amount of packaging for these socks. If you are looking to reduce your carob footprint these socks are not the way to go. Each pair of socks was on cardboard and individually wrapped in plastic. Then the set of four were also in a clear plastic bag, THEN that bag was in another plastic bag. If you are trying to make more eco-friendly purchases, don't buy these until they change the packaging. If you don't care about that buy the socks... they're decent."
3.0,I originally ordered the medium because that is my normal size. It felt a little baggy so I ordered the small to compare. I ordered them both in Apricot but got 2 vastly different colors. The quality is nice. And the small definitely fit better (size down if you want a more tailored/fitted look). But beware of color inconsistencies. The medium is the dark one and the small is the lighter. I preferred the darker color but it didn't fit as well....
3.0,"They’re nice shorts and fit really nice! They’re tight in all the right places! Good for a upper body but not for lower body days, they are not squat proof and they already ripped and I only used them twice"
3.0,I usually wear a medium. But new from experience that I needed to take a large because they are running very small
3.0,I am 5'6'' 150 lbs pant size 27 and I ordered a Medium. I had high hopes that these would be full length but ended up being high waters that sit right at my ankles. Too long to be a capri too short to be full lenth. The black color faded super fast.  The pants are very comfortable and I will be getting them hemmed to continue wearing in the spring.
3.0,"The quality of this bag (I got the hickory one) was fine but it was a few inches taller than described so it was too large for my needs.  Also, be aware that the cosmetic bag that came with it was canvas, not leather as stated.  If you need a large (almost like a Whole Foods shopping bag size) tote then this could work."
3.0,"For one I didnt realize my ears were already stretched to this size, If you're wearing stone plugs that are 9/16 like I was it's not worth getting these they were the same size as the tapers. I called customer service to see what I could do about it see if I could return or exchange the item. She told me it wasn't worth the return or getting an exchange. So now I am stuck with these tapers."
3.0,Only lasted a few washes
3.0,Starting to fall apart after just a few weeks :(
3.0,"Not to forgiving on my body type, must wear my spanks, the quality is not the greatest."
3.0,"The shirt has unexpectedly shiny finish to the material. It's comfortable, but it looks odd because of this. The fit is good. I purchased a gray shirt.<br />The collar is a little floppy. Compared to my Under Armor drifits, you can tell this is a cheaper shirt without a doubt. The Amazon Essentials drifits are a higher quality."
3.0,I didn’t like the way it fit to wide on top especially under arms
3.0,It was slightly larger than it appeared in the photos and the chain was a little cheap. Overall it looked more costumey in person.
3.0,The color is different from the picture.
3.0,Dress is cute but I washed it on gentle cycle and hung it to dry and the material at the top of the dress has holes in it now. Wish I could have worn it more than once but the material is very flimsy.
3.0,face is too dim
3.0,"The clip is very hard to move and its smaller than it looks.  Wouldn't buy another one, but it works ok."
3.0,2xl was way too big. Can't review
3.0,"Great customer service. Unfortunately the product itself doesn't hold very long. After a few times wearing, two of them each got detached from the metal ends, and one was broken in the middle of the leather band. I tried to superglue it but didn't work for long. A pity, since the design itself if great and the metal ends have magnetic clasps."
3.0,"I got what i paid for, so they are work. They are thick on the inside. They are lined with a faux fur material. So they are a size too small."
3.0,Should have got bigger size
3.0,me gusta el material y se ve cómodo pero no cubre tanto el cuello como se muestra en la foto.<br />UPDATE:<br />Ya pasaron 3 semanas que lo compré y ya se cayó un moñito y se empezó a destejer.<br />...
3.0,Looks a little frumpy....I'm short so it drowned me. I am normally XL and bought an XL.....sleeve are weird. It is as pictured but doesnt look like what I expected on....lays different.
3.0,It lasted a long time shining beautifully but it did begin to tarnish after awhile.
3.0,The quality was as expected for the price. It was too large though. The color was pretty!
3.0,"Sooo they started out super cute fit true to size but then there were these two pairs... a bit inappropriate for a 2 year old to wear, the others we’re fine so i just tossed these 2 pairs, whoever designed dropped the ball on these 2"
3.0,wanted for cosmetic uses. it's okay but a bit snug.
3.0,Kind of cheap but so was the price. So there you go.
3.0,not a huge fan of this piece...
3.0,"I really liked it, however the chain broke after 5 days of having it."
3.0,"fit was fine, but very thin material.  I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Even though smaller than anticipated, I love the look & design of these earrings. Have received many compliments on them. Unfortunately, the silver wires on this pair are also fragile (aka flimsy) and do not come with clear stoppers/backs to keep earrings from easily slipping out of the ears. I had to buy a package of stoppers/backs to keep them in my ears. The wires are supposed to be sterling silver, but for some reason they irritate the pierced holes in my ears."
3.0,"Piping around pocket zipper is silver, not white as shown in pix!<br />Not really good value!"
3.0,"Very disappointed in this watch band. It really needs one or two extra holes for people with smaller wrists. It looks cute on but I am not sure that I will be able to use it because it simply doesn't fit. Other than that it is very cute. Feels a little cheap, which is disappointing for the price."
3.0,I really like the look and feel of this strap but have a difficult getting it on and off. Once attached the strap doesn’t separate which means it comes on and off like a bracelet. I have average size hands for a man and struggle getting it on and off. It should fit most women and children but needs another inch for me to recommend it for a man or allow one end to come out.
3.0,"The size is as expected, but they are a little snug on the waist because there is no stretch to the fabric."
3.0,These are cute but VERY long. Almost too long to wear with many outfits.
3.0,"These are cute and warm but the material is kind of scratchy and the socks are very tight. I have a normal size 9 foot. Regular width, ankle size, etc., but they're very difficult to get on. Not very stretchy."
3.0,The shipping was great didn't take long at all. I tried them on and their slightly smaller than I expected. They're not stretchy like most leggings so you can't really wiggle yourself into them.
3.0,"So far no problems,love the look of the watch. Hope it works better then the first watch I brought."
3.0,"I loved them when I first got them. The material is really soft and comfortable.  However, one wash and dry on delicate and they shrunk A LOT. They went from long pajama pants to capris and a 3/4 sleeve shirt."
3.0,"I didn't realize it was stretch, so I was surprised by the fit, but otherwise it was fine."
3.0,Not as vibrant of a tortoise shell look
3.0,A little chiquito
3.0,"So far, it's greatly exceeding my expectations. The glass is very scratch-resistant, everything, including the dual and the buckle, feels very durable. While I was confused by the provided instructions on adjusting the clasp, once you know the general idea it's very intuitive. The design is also modestly stylish.<br />UPDATE: It's already malfunctioning. After one month, it's beginning to forget second, causing it to incorrectly keep time on a consistent basis."
3.0,This product showed the heart part with an additional circle to add on... it does not come like that. It came with just the heart.
3.0,I love the cap but the metal chain broke within a day and I almost lost my key. Just throw the chain out and use a loop instead.
3.0,"Update: Finally found a reasonably priced, good alternative to these sunglasses - Smith Pivlock V2 Max. They still don't work with the eye garage, but they're short enough on the arms that they don't hit the back of the Poc Octal helmet. For less than $100 on Amazon, they're hard to beat.<br />--------------------------------------<br />I really want to like these, and in some ways I do. They're great cycling sunglasses, but I'm not sure they're worth the high price.<br /><br />I own the POC Octal AVIP MIPS helmet, and I wanted a pair of sunglasses that match the helmets color and integrate with the &#34;eye garage&#34;<br /><br />I own 10+ pairs fairly high end sunglasses, mostly Vonzipper and Dragon Alliance. None of them seemed to really fit in the eye garage. A lot of them don't have raised nose pads, which leads to a lot of sweat forming on the lens. Most of them also have looped ends by the ears, so they don't fit into helmets well.<br /><br />The Pocs have a raised nose which I thought might keep sweat from forming around the nose piece.<br /><br />Pros<br />The look stylish as far as cycling wear goes, in my opinion. I would not wear these walking down the street though.<br />Comfortable to wear. The flexible nosepads are great<br />Comes with two lenses. The clearish/purple lens work decently well at night if you have a good light.<br />Changing the lenses is relatively simple<br />Lens clarify it great. Can't really say if they're durable or not, I've been pretty careful thus far and don't want to test this.<br /><br />Cons<br />I'm not confident in their ability to stay in the eye garage. They literally just dangle by the ends. I can't push them far enough back to lodge into the plastic pieces on the side of the helmet, because my head is in the way (not much I can do about that). Any sudden twist or movement can send the glasses flying, and that's probably going to scratch the lenses<br />The fog up like crazy if you stop and it's humid/cold. I know this is hard to avoid, but it was just as bad as other glasses with less venting. On the plus side once you get moving again they clear up quickly.<br />Having the raised nosepads does not help with sweat. After 30 minutes biking hard in hot weather, I can barely see out of these. Just as bad as other glasses I have in regards to this.<br /><br />I'm probably going to end up returning these....if these were my only sunglasses, maybe they'd be a good investment. They are no better or worse than other high end sunglasses, but there are cheaper options that are just as good, and some of the advertised features are not that great. I suppose if you want to do the all Poc look they're a must have."
3.0,"I liked the colors, but the pants are so long! I am 5’5” and they go up to right under my breasts with room at the ankles. I also am not thrilled with the cut of the top but for the price it is fine. Overall ok for around the house but just wish they weren’t so long."
3.0,They look good. The combination of the face mask 😷 plus the 🥽 fog the 🥽 anyways.
3.0,"Unfortunately it didn't work for the person we bought it for.  I don't believe his colorblindness was as bad as other people who have had success with these glasses.<br />That being said, the frames are well made and looked good on the individual."
3.0,It fits as expected but it's long and looks weird on my daughters head
3.0,"Love the texture, but it is not size appropriate.  Shirt runs small."
3.0,"First thing - the material isn't canvas. It is more of a &quot;plasticy&quot; type of material. Also, when I got the bag, there were some issues with the zippers, but they disappeared after working the zippers for a while. Based on other reviews, it seems like a common problem.<br /><br />Apart from that, I loved the bag - it has a good number of compartments, and they are very spacious. If not packed, the bad doesn't look very big, but you can definitely get a lot in there if needed. Including regular-sized magazines. So, despite of the disappointing surprise with the material, I decided to keep it.<br /><br />It was great for about a week. After a week, the strap disintegrated at the seam!!! I was traveling, so returning the bag was not an option. I patched it up myself and I continue using it, but I feel like I shouldn't have to have this problem with a BRAND NEW BAG..."
3.0,"I ultimately returned this dress because the skirt fabric looked cheap and the design appeared to just be printed on. It looked better online, and I was concerned it wouldn't hold up after washing. I'm 5'3 and 160, ordered a large but probably should have done a medium."
3.0,About 75% of the earrings are as shown. They are thick and do come with earring backers but if your heart is set on a particular pair you may not get it.
3.0,"The product seems see-through but it's not on the body which is nice. Material seems mediocre. My husband is muscular so the tanks fits nicely UNTILS you was them. They shrink about a size so prepare for that. My husband is a L, so we ordered that but after washing it's about a M. So account for that or air dry it"
3.0,Zipper on one pair broke the first day. Comfortable gloves though.
3.0,Didn’t like the material. Wasn’t soft T-shirt material
3.0,SMALL BUT I STILL LOVE THEM
3.0,"Decent product, wish the padding for the Palm is slightly thicker."
3.0,"I ordered the XL, but it is too small. I ended up giving it to my 12 yr old. The fabric is soft, but an XL is not a 16/18."
3.0,Size up<br />Too small<br />Not flattering for those who carry extra weight around the middle<br />The ruffle and the waist will showcase your rump and belly
3.0,"This dress is nice, but it was too big on me, just so much material, and a weird length. Im 5'2&#34; & i think this would be best on someone much taller. Its a good quality for the price."
3.0,"The crotch in these things is 12”. It went almost up to my ribs. I am 5’4”, and a size 6. I ordered a medium. I should have ordered a small."
3.0,"Pofash Women's Sexy Tulle Deep V Neck Split Party Cocktail Evening Maxi Long Dresses - Size Large<br /><br />This is one of those instances where what you see is not what you get. I’ll start by saying the dress would be perfect as a maternity dress. The deep V cut you see in the picture is not quite how it plays out in person… or at least for me it wasn’t. The sequins do not go high enough up the straps and the band hits right around the bra band. The slits on the side go pretty high, but not too high. Crisscross in the back. Could be worse. But definitely not impressed. I think the main problem is that it is cut with a very short torso; this is more of an empire cut than pictured. 3 Stars. Hope you find this review helpful."
3.0,I was excited to find my size available. So sad that they were too small and I returned them.
3.0,Everything actually fit perfectly until I needed to loosen it around the chest area.  I’m a little wider so something to adjust would’ve been perfect since the cup size worked and the bottoms fit.  A medium was great minus that problem.  Couldn’t use for my vacation.
3.0,It is a rather thin fabric and a bit wrinkled- also the color was quite drab-- I will wear it around the house when the weather is cool-- dlp
3.0,"Usually I never have a problem with yoga/stretch pants, as a larger framed person, but these XL barely came over my hips :("
3.0,"Bought this shawl to wear for my winter wedding with my dress. The color was exactly as shown in the picture (a light blue/green/seafoam color). And talk about SOFT!<br />Only two issues with it:<br />1. It leaves fluff EVERYWHERE and sticks to anything that has even the slightest texture, but I guess that is the nature of cashmere. Keep a lint roller handy.<br />2. The tassels were all stuck together with fluff in between them. I wanted the tassels to have a bit more movement so I actually used some sewing scissors and cut the fluff out from between the individual tassels. It took a while, but I thought it looked much better after."
3.0,"3 stars for the cuteness of it. I even like the fabric. I just don’t think it’s just not practical to wear In public if you’re bigger up top. No sure if ordering up would help I weigh roughly 140 currently and am 5’ 4”, size D cup. Would be great for a photo shoot or cute to wear with a white bandu and high waisted pants."
3.0,Not what I expected.  Looked better on line as opposed to direct eye contact.  Has me second guessing my decision not to go with the &#34;Purple Peacock&#34; set.  If  I could exchange would do so in a heartbeat.
3.0,"Nice light weight vest.  But, as others have noted, the zipper is “girl” side.  I thought it would be no big deal, but is a real pain having to think about zipping!  Kind of like driving in England-reflexes all reversed!  My grand daughter happily took it off my hands."
3.0,huge even for an adult
3.0,"This is an odd looking shoe. Not attractive at all,"
3.0,"I just got these so I can not say how they work in the real cold.  Looking forward to finding that out.<br /><br />I have an iphone and the touch screen fingers don't work.<br /><br />Headline reads ""-40F"", tag in the gloves says ""Cold Resistance -30F"", ""Comfort Temp -15F"" I have no idea how to interpret this.  It is clear the Amazon description doesn't  match the gloves so either an error or a plain deception, either way this is misleading and should be corrected.<br /><br />If they really keep my fingers warm at -15 F I'll be happy.  If not expect the rating to fall.  Not looking forward to the cold but I'm looking forward to seeing how these gloves do when it arrives."
3.0,Wish it was connected to a metal ring instead of the rubber. We had it for about a year and it ripped through the rubber.
3.0,"I like the compartments in this handbag. I also like the length of the handle. I'm 5'2&#34;, so I'm able to use it on my shoulder. However, the reason I'm giving it three stars is the color: the &#34;camel&#34; is actually a VERY light tan. It's OK for the summer, but I think the color really affects the quality of the look."
3.0,"Too small for what I need, but MY fault for not reading and looking closer"
3.0,my man like it
3.0,I did not like how the top buttons. Its very hard to get to and almost impossible to take on and off by yourself
3.0,Boy package comes with 3 pair of girl colors socks!!!
3.0,"The view through the lenses are on par with spy optics, they installed nicely but the lenses are thinner so they don't fit as well as the originals.<br />I am happy to have my spy coopers back in action though. Sorry only 3 stars."
3.0,"For the amount I paid, I expected a pair that had higher-quality materials than something hanging on the turnstile display at a discount retail store or corner gas station. I guess the lion's share of the cost is in the photochromic lenses, which do fade and darken as expected. The fit is reminiscent of tolerating the complementary 3D glasses provided at the movie theater-- no I take that back the 3D glasses are a skosh more comfortable. With that being said, the lenses do provide clarity during day-time rainstorms and dusk-time commutes; and the foam padding does postpone the drying out of my contacts as I drive my motorcycle."
3.0,It was a little smaller than I expected
3.0,"The only pants I've ever worn that needs a instruction manual. While they need a manual, it doesn't have one. This is hard to put on and hard to figure out the straps. While they are comfortable, the straps and pouch are hard to place correctly for comfort."
3.0,Its really cute. The waistline is a little too high but I can work with that. It's very long I will have to get it altered but for the price it's ok. The breast do not show too much. It snugs around them so there wont be no peep show. Lol. I recommend
3.0,"My waist is 33” and my hips are 49”. Gapes in the back, must wear a belt."
3.0,"This suit is really fun, and my son was thrilled to get it.  I like the zipper closure—way better than velcro.<br /><br />It does, unfortunately, run small.  My son fits into the XL range and is *quite* slender; however, the suit is very tight on his arms (the seams are pulling) and a bit short on him.  The crotch is rather low, which looks odd.<br /><br />He’s happy with it for now because he and his younger brother dress up as Spider-Man together.  But I’m on the hunt for a suit that will last him longer than a couple of months when he grows again."
3.0,Love the look of the suit. I agree with a lot of other reviews as it may not fit as expected. I'm pretty large in the chest but not the rest of me. There is a lack of support in that area. It still looked nice on me and it will be my go to swimsuit. Just not something I would recommend if you are going to a water park and going on slides. It's a good swim and lay out suit.
3.0,It is okay. Can't beat it since it is so damn cheap. Thanks.
3.0,"I found this item cheaper at the store, but waited and of course it was gone.  I agree with the other reviews, when we received it the watch was not working.  We replaced the battery and it works great."
3.0,"She loves the appearance, it made a great gift. However, it gets horribly tangled and is nearly impossible to untangle. She rarely wears it as a result."
3.0,"I like the bottoms a lot, sporty look with a bit of a higher cut on the sides. The top sits fine around my chest but it’s super tight under the arms.<br />I am 5’ 4” and 150lbs and L was a good fit overall."
3.0,"They are great to put in your purse, etc. The vision doesn't seem as sharp as others that I have owned, though."
3.0,i am afraid the chain will break it<br /> is pretty tho. it is not for not for extreme wear thought!
3.0,"These are probably very good watches, however, the watch itself is too large for my wife's wrist and the strap needs more holes.  Thus, the reason for the three star rating."
3.0,"It’s a great gi. Unfortunately, it arrived without the free belt that was supposed to be included. That is my only complaint. The gi is great and the navy blue is a really nice color."
3.0,"Not what I had hoped it would look like.  Very nice material, but way too long and just didn't suit."
3.0,"The fit is comfortable, but the baby makes the front way too heavy. There is no support for the baby, so you still have to support the baby with your arm. This hoodie is not for long outings because your arm will be killing you by the time you finally get to set the baby down."
3.0,"They are great, but they are big and VERY VERY heavy. Just know that if you dont want a super heavy weight on your ears? Dont do it. Otherwise amazing product. Very pretty and different"
3.0,Shorter AND skimpier than I expected. I ended up returning.
3.0,They are great but I can't seem to get them off :p
3.0,Backing bent right out of the box! Holder keeps falling off
3.0,"I loved this watch band so much.  It's extremely comfortable and feels like your not wearing anything at all.  I have really bad RA and most watch bands were hurting my wrist.  This one doesn't hurt me at all.  Only bad thing is,  after wearing it a week it's already stretching out bad.  I keep tightening it,  but I fear it'll be useless very soon.  And I won't be able to tighten it anymore.  It makes me sad because I really like it."
3.0,"If you have long legs and a small waist, these will fit you fine. I ordered a smal,  I'm 5'3"", 125 lbs, and the waist was too tight, cutting in making a muffin top. That doesn't typically happen to me with joggers. The length was somewhat long, but since they have a band at the ankle, it's not the end of the world. Plus, they'll likely shrink. May order again and try a medium, or may just try another brand."
3.0,Cute jumper but was baggy in the crotch area which I thought looked funny. The rouching was uncomfortable but otherwise the fabric was soft enough. Great for a vacation outfit.
3.0,"I love these, but I have not even had them 4 months and they already have at least one hole through from my heel to the floor!  They are amazingly comfortable and I love the lion heads and shape, but it was only about two months before the inside soles had holes in them and my toes would get caught in them when I flexed my arches or toes.  When I first got them, I loved how warm they were (without being absurdly hot - I've had slippers that make my feet sweat), but now the soles of my feet are cold when I have my feet on the floor (whether sitting, standing, or walking) because the soles of these slippers and the padding inside wears out so quickly, leaving almost nothing between my feet and the floor.<br /><br />Also worth noting that the reason I marked no problem with the arch support is because this is a fabric sole, so there can be no arch support.<br /><br />I really wish these had some kind of stronger sole.  I love them, but I can't afford to buy another pair every 3-4 months and it doesn't take long before the sole is worn so thin it doesn't keep my foot warm on the bottom at all."
3.0,I returned this without opening the clear plastic around the sweatshirt. I thought it would be a lighter Heather grey. I don’t think it looks like the photo.
3.0,"Shoes can't stand up to eleven year old feet for long, regardless of the brand!"
3.0,I wish that it had adjustable straps. Otherwise I am happy with it. I'm 5'10 and its not too short.
3.0,"The color is very different from the picture, And the sleeves  are almost capped as opposed to being a little bit more like a razed back.<br />The quality of the material is good for the price. In the end I returned it due to the look and the color."
3.0,These are nice and do have a good stretch to them for a comfortable fit. Unfortunately the v-neck is high on the chest-and shows at the collar for many of the sheer style blouses I bought them to fit under.
3.0,This is so funny looking just as I had hoped! The material is kind of itchy but it fits nicely and looks just like the picture. It did however take a while to come in the mail.
3.0,"Just ok, def doesn’t fit like the picture, I ordered the large and it’s got a lot of loose material especially around the waist. Will see if it’s better after washing. Also pretty thin."
3.0,They are okay one already ripped other than that they're fine.
3.0,"Loved the style and idea of the dress, however it just wasn't quite right. Fit was good, I ordered a M and I'm 5ft6. But the collar was too ruffly and the chiffon overlay didn't drape well on the upper body, especially round the shoulders/underarm. I considered making adjustments but decided to return it instead. Overall it just didn't have the flow and wow factor like on the model (not surprising)."
3.0,"Very nice, but very heavy"
3.0,To large for my liking.
3.0,Light didn’t work
3.0,Beautiful material but really tight around the breasts
3.0,Very tight around the hips. Ordered an XL and are very tight. The fabric is soft.
3.0,"I’m 5’9” and 145 lbs. I ordered a large because some reviews said it ran small. I wouldn’t say it’s small, gaped a bit under arms on me. It was, however, super short in the body. Not wearable for me. Have to send back. You’d have to be probably at least 2 inches shorter or have a short waist for it to work. Cute pattern and style otherwise."
3.0,Porque no esperaba lo qué mira en la fotografía cuando los compre i el metal molesta mucho por la parte de la nariz
3.0,Did not fit well on my face but had cool packaging!
3.0,It’s ok for the money but it irritates my skin.
3.0,"Okay for one time use.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, you get a random assortment.  I got 2 of the same masks (hearts) and no winking man.  Also, the eye holes are hard to see out of, so you can't wear it for long."
3.0,"The compression and elasticity lasted only maybe 5-6 wears before I found them falling down my legs at work. I need something that will last my entire 12 hour nursing shift, these do not cut it."
3.0,"STUCK! Ordered these as they stated 35mm, but the opening is 20mm. This should have been part of the description. It’s too late for me to return and so I am stuck!"
3.0,La tela es buena pero el tamaño es demasiado grande
3.0,Decent bag. Big enough for day trips to keep enough stuff in. Don’t have to run back n forth to the car for water or stupid things (just to drop off goodies)<br /><br />Wish the adjustable strap was a tad longer (busty gal) and it would be PERFECT
3.0,Super cute and I love how they look. However the shoes will leave glitter EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!
3.0,The necklace was very short and the heart seem lower quality than expected. It is nice enough looking
3.0,"These are large, bright, lightweight, and colorful.  Bigger than I expected, and these do have rather a cheap look and feel.  Still they are fun and playful.  Each comes individually wrapped in plastic and on a display card.<br />These are quite large (larger than I prefer) and have a strong 80s vibe."
3.0,Loved the front of this suit - but the backside is VERY cheeky - meaning if like showing almost half of each butt cheek or are a Card carrying member of the No Assatol Club - this maybe this is for you.  I hoped that by having a center panel in back - it would cup each side favorably - unfortunately NO :(
3.0,"Received on time, however missing pink ribbon and pieces started falling off when trying on..."
3.0,Very sheer but light weight
3.0,Champion is consistent the no frills sweatshirt department.  I've worn and wash this sweatshirt plenty of times and it holds up just fine. Good deal for the price.
3.0,"I have seen similar sets more expensive so I think it was good priced! The PJs had a nice design and color. Very soft and has a satin feel. Unfortunately, the first button popped out as soon as I tried it on. Its an easy fix, I can sew it back. I did think for a Large it felt a little snug on the waistband and the long sleeve shirt. I am a size small and I got this in Large for my moms christmas gift and I felt a large fit me just right. Hopefully it fits her okay and not too tight. I would recommned sizing up."
3.0,Love the style and form but it's not as sturdy as I expected. The more you tighten the more the boning digs in to your ribs and hips you must wear something thick and soft beneath it. It should have been double layered and boning should be stronger. I'm no newbie but it's good for the days you want a flexible feel and not waist training.
3.0,"The product looks lovely but the base is made out of a doily type of fabric, not metal or plastic. It has an awful smell that is difficult to mask especially when it is something to wear close to your face. The base is a completely different color than the metal dangles, more of a chartreuse than a gold. I’ll have to likely use fabric paint to fix this how I want it for a costume, but it’s a good base to start off of if you have crafting skills."
3.0,"Tiny, tiny earrings not well stamped. Too small to see details."
3.0,Not a true fit.  They run small and the fabric is not very soft.
3.0,"Mixed reviews. I absolutely loved the feel, the color, the smell. It just didn’t fit. My husband is over 6’ tall and a large man. Not extremely large, just large. With the strap on, his guitar came up to his breast"
3.0,Looks different than online picture
3.0,I ordered these hoping for a comfortable bralette that I could use during my postpartum stage. I’m currently a 40D and I ordered an XL. The cups fit fine but the side boning is crazy uncomfortable when sitting as it rolls up and in and the band that should lay flat under your breast also rolls up when sitting and is uncomfortable. The 4 hooks are very difficult to latch. Somehow once there are more than 3 eye hook latches it gets to be a pain. I tried an extender to see if it would make the bra more comfortable but all the same issues remained. I realize I am overweight and have extra “fluff” going on so I think if I was in better shape then it would fit great. I just feel that of you’re a certain size or shape this bralette will not work even if you order the size you need. Super bummed since these are cute and affordable. I might try a smaller size once I’m back to a post partum size with less flab around my top half. These do seem to run small but again if you’re a certain shape they probably won’t be very flattering or comfortable regardless of the size you order.
3.0,The material is a lot different than I thought.
3.0,Could be a bit bigger but it's warm. Wash before wear though because it itches my forehead.
3.0,"Beautiful purse. I just wish it would come in charcoal grey instead of light grey.<br />Smaller than I expected, so beware of that.<br />It's medium sized, not too small, but not as large as bags usually are nowadays.<br />Stiff exterior, which is another drawback. Still, all in all, a good overall pretty purchase."
3.0,A little bit small for a Large but overall I really like this top! It's cute and comfortable. And it's s good length.
3.0,As advertised.  Not the best quality but I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,The middle piece pop off the first day it was worn. Hot glue gun helped but other than that it's a very well-done piece
3.0,Takes forever to put on.
3.0,Not Christmas red
3.0,Super cute style but it is see through and very snug. Had to return.
3.0,"Way too large, even after allowing for size conversions, etc. Top of cap id like an inverted bowl - overall a poor fit. Look elsewhere..."
3.0,"The earrings are cute but first time I put one on, hadn't even put the back of the earring on yet, one of the pearls came off of the earring and proceeded to go down my bathroom sink drain. Disappointed."
3.0,I had to wear black leggins uder it. Good for the price. What do you espect.
3.0,Inside zipper broke
3.0,"The buttons that hold the straps on are mismatched. Two are white, 1 has a logo that faces inside and one has a logo that faces outward which is the correct way.<br /><br />It’s fine for my beach towels but just a little disappointed."
3.0,"Very cute,  but definitely not big butt friendly... Couldn't wear it because my entire butt was exposed. It also had a weird smell, which may come out after washing."
3.0,"Good quality sweater but runs short in length. Ordered this for my husband who normally wears a XXL and is 6&#34;3', but this sweater reached just under his belly button. Wasn't a match for him but could work well for someone not as tall."
3.0,Too small and thin.
3.0,"Doesn't really fit over my glasses, but the lenses are nice."
3.0,Loosing brightness after few washes
3.0,Gets bigger as the day goes on.  Not in love with it - but wearable.
3.0,"I'm a little disappointed. Cute shirt but why they are called compression, I have no idea. The torso is tight but the shoulders and sleeves are loose and that's where I really needed some compression. So, I ordered a set in large hoping to feel some compression. They fit exactly the same as the XL."
3.0,Perfect price and quick delivery for a white party I attended. Super cute for summer beach and pool parties.<br /><br />Only issue is that it seems like someone already used it and returned it because there was make-up on it. You get what you pay for!
3.0,The metal parts of the lanyard wear away on each other. My lanyard lasted two years before falling apart.
3.0,"Husband liked the style but the fit was a little tight, not solid on the inside cuts into his finger."
3.0,"evennif it is somewhat large on me, they are ok and very sturdy... fact is you can even wash them and maybe reuse them before disposing them."
3.0,Loved the charm. Necklace scarred my neck.  I had to put the charm on a different chain.
3.0,El reloj es muy bonito lastimosamente debería decir que es para niños porque es muy pequeño de ahí es funcional y el precio es muy bueno
3.0,The finger lights were fun and bright.  Unfortunately many in the box didn't work - we couldn't get them to light.
3.0,"Love the dress, but the material is pretty cheap. At least it's inexpensive and I should be able to get about 10 wears out of it."
3.0,I mean for needing them prime delivery to use for a project overnight this isn't a bad buy. Lol.
3.0,"Cute but big, and the fram was a little off"
3.0,Make sure you read the full description because the title alone will mislead you. This is gold plated....not solid white gold. Don't get me wrong it's beautiful but it's cheaply made. Only the smaller stones are Swarovski crystals and the large one in the middle is cubic zirconia. May make a nice gift for a child but that's it.
3.0,"Fit was great! i am a size 11 in jeans, purchased a large and fit to size. fabric was soft and really stretchy around my backside.<br />Draw string didn't do much. No care instructions/tag of what the material is made out of. Washed ONCE on delicate in Eco Warm water and hung to dry. pants shrunk from a little lower than my ankle, to almost mid calf range. bummed."
3.0,I normally wear a large and had to order an xxl. It's still a little small because it doesnt fit like shown in the pic. It is also a little thin and clingy. I wanted it to look like pictured. It's still a cute pattern. I just hope it doesnt shrink after I wash it.
3.0,"I sweated through it in about 3 hours, so they aren’t super absorbent. Plus, they’re sort of thick (equal to about 2 pantiliners stacked up) and change the size and look of my baseball cap. However they fit perfectly unlike the cut-to-size pads I’ve been using and stuck well; and it was nice not getting pimples on my forehead from a sweaty hat so I’ll keep using. I’ll just cut off the ends so I have less of a trucker look next time."
3.0,For the price this is a pretty good jacket. It is comfortable and fits good. I did expect it to be a little heavier and thicker.
3.0,Lace area is White.... BUT the other material fabric has an OFF WHITE/ Pink-ish tinge to the blouse.<br />Could've been a fantastic White blouse IF it was a very white/white Blouse.
3.0,"Looks like they dont even start making these bags IN CHINA until you order one. Such a lovely job of not letting you know where the product comes from until you find out it will take A MONTH to get it. Crochetted bags are the way to go...they hold a great deal, are easily cleaned and stored but there is no excuse to send ONE bag across an OCEAN for 4 bucks. If you are looking for American made, this is a fail. I wont order this again. Total FAIL"
3.0,A little flimsy but ok for 1 time use.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:1f66bc84dbd60d9f69888354fb684188]] The small piece that holds the band in place once fastened broke in 2 weeks. It’s very cheap material, and I had to rig it with a hair band. It’s really cute, and I love the graphics, but that one cheap piece makes it useless unless you replace (or rig) it."
3.0,Too thin and just not comfortable especially in waist band very wide tall and tight enough to mark skin<br />I like soft and comfy
3.0,"The watch came today and it is very difficult to adjust the watch band to the correct size.  It looks OK, but is basically worth what you pay for it if it lasts, including the gold plating.  It is not comparable to a $50 or $60 watch!"
3.0,its ok just a little confusing no clamp to keep it together so it moves
3.0,"While I love the material and prints of these boxers from Stacy Adams, I find that the cut is not full enough in both the seat or the thigh, creating more constriction. It's as if the rear seam cuts to much toward the center of the brief creating that constriction. For us big guys, we need that extra room to feel comfortable throughout the day. I recommended going at least one size bigger."
3.0,"This is so pretty but the chain is super long.  I took it to a Pandora store to see if they could shorten the chain and they couldn't.  I would have to buy a new chain and spend $35.  I had to cut the chain myself.  However, the rose is pretty and it's what I expected."
3.0,they break to easy
3.0,"So cute, but the maroon fabric is very see-through.  I also bought the black floral and the fabric is thicker.  I’m 5’3” and 160 usually a size 8/10.  Large fit comfortably, but had to hem."
3.0,"Bought this 2 years ago at a very impressive price ($14) from another retailer.  It looks good, folds well, is water resistant on the positive side. It also fits well.  It feels high quality.  But after less than two year the fabric in the middle seam on the bill started to split (see photo).  I've washed the cap probably a dozen times, never putting it in the dryer.  Compared to the Sunday Afternoon Sun Trippers cap the OR item is less sturdy. The Sun Tripper cap also started to show a bit of wear, but after 5 years of heavy wear.  I would agree with Brimstone's review that the cap is fairly hot, especially for summer in a hot climate.  In Fall, Winter, or Spring it's fine, but in Summer (esp. in the South) its a bit steamy if you're outside for more than 30 minutes or so."
3.0,"First impressions: this shirt is a very stretchy jersey material. I thought that it would be more cotton feeling. Also, I bought a large and it seems like a weird length, maybe a little short. If you are prepared for those things than this shirt is pretty cool."
3.0,"Overall, I really like these glasses, HOWEVER, the main selling point for me was that is said &#34;rhinestone&#34; in the description - yes, I am easily distracted by shiny things. When they arrived, there were no rhinestones, just grey indentations where the rhinestones would be (had I not been distracted by the promise of shiny things and read previous reviews, I would have noticed this). I contacted the seller and asked if I had received a defective pair or of their description was inaccurate. I didn't get an answer to that question, just told that I could return them. I kept them because they are still cute, and returning would be more hassle than it's worth, but... come on, at least update your description. This is blatant false advertising if the pair I received is how the come and not defective."
3.0,"Nice thick coat. Flattering, runs big. I got a medium and it was perfect.  One problem, at almost $80, you expect your pockets to be pockets. Mine were sewn right through. I took out the stitching but I don't know how that's going to affect it in the future."
3.0,"The actual stone of the ring is much bigger than I thought it would be.  If I had tried it on before buying it, I would not have gotten it.  The quality of the ring is great.  It is well made and the rose gold is beautiful.  I just did not expect to take up my entire finger."
3.0,"My bad.  Didn't realize .6mm was so thin.  Can't clasp it without help or with the help of a mirror.  Nice gold color, though."
3.0,i love these earrings.. the only reason i’m giving them three stars is the fact that after two weeks the stainless steel starts going black. wish they’d do some type of protecting coat
3.0,These gloves are stinky lol
3.0,Very pretty. But Asian size. Order 2x<br />Still too small. Will give it to someone if I can find someone that small.
3.0,The price is obviously cheap so I wasn’t expecting a luxury item but I could have done with out. Nice dress for casual but definitely not dressy or special occasion.
3.0,"My inseam is 33&#34; and these are definitely too short to be pants (another 3&#34; would be nice). I can wear them as capris, but that wasn't the intention. They are really soft and comfortable. If you don't have long legs, they're probably great."
3.0,really cute but it bends really easily... you get what you pay for i guess! it was really cute though... I got tons of compliments
3.0,Decent quality gauges but it almost seems like two different gauges and not a pair. One is lighter in color than the other and different saddle style (longer and curved edges) and a bit larger...just a bit odd.
3.0,"You get what you pay for; these necklaces are super cute, but they break pretty easily. They're cheap enough that I just repurchase whenever they break."
3.0,"I got the largest size and it was much too small, so I have placed it in my drawer and am looking for a better brand. The only upside is that the design is very nice....too bad it does not fit properly."
3.0,somehow good
3.0,"I bought this dress because I needed a pink dress. Beware that the pink is more like hot pink (think highlighter pink)! I returned it because it was too bright and the material was like a fleece material (not what I expected). The fit was perfect, the bow was perfect, just the color and material was not for me. I'm 5'3, 140 and the L was just right."
3.0,I like these except that when I’m<br />Doing yoga I have to always pull<br />Them up in the waist.<br />They fit like tights.
3.0,"Okay so I’m a guy and I cosplay. I do a lot of gender-bend cosplays. I’ve done boy-versions of Tsuyu Asui aka Froppy from MHA, Himiko Toga also from MHA, and also Nezuko from Demon Slayer. I wanted to do a gender-bend cosplay of Ghost Spider and this suit fits me great! I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly, true to size. I have two issues with the costume. #1 it is very sheer. If you look closely at my picture you can see my tattoo thru the material. I’ll have to wear a white shirt underneath or something. #2 the quality of the mask is pretty bad. There is no zipper on the back like most Spider-Man costumes that you’d buy from Amazon (which I’ve done plenty of times) and it’s not at all form-fitted for a face it’s literally just a spandex hood with lenses. They didn’t even bother to stitch or taper it to where it would fit snug on your chin, it’s basically like a super long beanie with Spider-Man lenses on it. Aside from those two issues I do really like the costume itself, but I mean I paid for that mask and it’s so low quality I refuse to wear it. So that’s wasted money, hence the lower rating."
3.0,"I'm 5'1, so yeah, super short. This dress is SO short that my butt is almost hanging out, and I ordered a size up, so that doesn't make a ton of sense. I ordered it for a corporate holiday party, definitely couldn't wear it to that."
3.0,Was some what bigger than it looked.
3.0,More of a casual belt. Fairly wide and does not fit my idea of a dress belt.
3.0,"I find the bar is a little short and I end up getting stabbed with the tops of the bows. It'll do for now, but it isn't always comfortable. :("
3.0,Pieces fell off after a while ..
3.0,"These things are HUGE.  They almost hit my shoulders.  When I first got them I thought I probably would not wear them often since they are so dramatic and not really suitable for work.  However, I have found that I do like to wear them when I wear my hair up in a pony tail since the long earrings make the look seem more dressy.  The pearl is really nice.  The ""gold"" portion is really thin and light weight.  I would recommend the earrings if you are looking for a longer/bigger earring."
3.0,"Cute dress if you're pretty thin-armed. 5'7, 115 and a large is tight in the arms and shoulders. Also, the fabric on the dress looks the same as the photo, but the dress I received is not slit up the sides as shown pictured. It's only a button down shirt dress with short 6 inch slits in the back. It's not a dress that flows like it appears to in the picture-- the front buttons going down to about knee height on my dress can be unbuttoned a little higher up the leg, but it still doesn't make this dress flare out as shown in the advertised picture-- either it's a different dress or the modeled one has been altered to have side slits. Disappointed it lacked side slits as shown but it's an ok dress for the price-- just not nearly as flashy or interesting."
3.0,It’s decent and I like them a lot. I get plenty of compliments on how beautiful and unusual they are.<br /><br />But I noticed since wearing them for a while now the one side was hurting a lot and I assumed it was from my sleeping position. I took it out a few moments ago and saw the “silver” part rubbing off to that copper.<br /><br />Only the bar itself is 316L. The rest is just played jewelry. May buy a second set in the new future. Just disappointed that they didn’t last long. Especially since I keep it in a piercing that I don’t want to close up
3.0,Looks cheap and there are flowers that aren't noticeable on picture
3.0,Needed for a young child birthday but was too big for our little
3.0,Very nice but to small
3.0,They're nice and soft.  But they are extremely casual - think pajama bottoms.
3.0,I love the product but I had to size down. I normally wear size medium in normal shirts and have been wearing small in most scrub tops.  I originally bought a small and it was way too big. I bought a XS and I like the way it fits. See photo.
3.0,"I really love the cut and style of this. However, I am returning because you can clearly see the padding, so if I ever want to wear without padding and with sweat as a factor, I’m sure you will see even more. I think I will buy again with darker colors. It is comfortable and medium compression. I usually wear smalls but sizes up to med for chest (32b/c) this made it more comfortable, I think small would have been okay too but more compressive."
3.0,Not as comfy as I thought they would be
3.0,The women’s mask were too big and I’m an average size woman.
3.0,"I was worried when I pulled it out of the bag that it was too big,  but was going to keep it as it's not too big for me to be able to get away with, and it was but more so the weave of the thread is very stretchy and after wearing for an hr the thread started to pull at the V-neck and started to look like holes. So I am returning it but for $10 I'll be getting a lrg and hope it doesn't let go like the first as it is a good deal as long as it's wearable"
3.0,"I like the dress and the look of it. However, the strap broke before I even wore it. It had to go get fixed before wearing it."
3.0,I really love this unique piece but it actually started fading after the first wear. The price is nice to keep buying when needed but it’s to much to keep buying over and over
3.0,"I like the convertible feature.  I walk my Beagle several times a day and am able to do the &#34;pick-ups&#34;  and bag tying without taking off, and dropping, the gloves.  After the second day in action, i sewed the thumb slit closed.  Now after a month, the lining has come loose = not enough stitching to the outer glove.  Overall, I like them but do not think they will last the winter."
3.0,"At first look, the actual dress did not match the color description. The white and purple dress actually has a fair amount of pink too. It’s comfortable and lightweight, but it doesn’t look as attractive close up as it might farther away (such as in photo shoots). Although the length was good for me, this would not be a full length dress for anyone above 5ft 5 inches as an FYI. Overall, I didn’t think it matched the description and for the price I decided to return it."
3.0,I don't think you really need this to wash your NuBra but it's good to have it in hand. Nothing to urgent to own...
3.0,"Stylish, but cheap. If you try to bend the metal to fit your ear, it snaps."
3.0,"I love the design, fit, and flair of this dress but it feels like cheap costume fabric. It's a cotton spandex blend. Stretchy with a little shine to it.<br /><br />I was hoping for a posh cotton. Something nice for tea. This is too shiny for tea and it's a shame."
3.0,"These are cute holiday socks, but like way too many socks, they're small on the calf, and become uncomfortable. For smaller people who don't have thick calves like I do, they may fit well, but I can only wear them pushed down, and even then they tend to leave marks on my legs and become uncomfortable wearing them over time."
3.0,"very pretty color, nice cut. i wish it was longer."
3.0,Very cute but suspenders clasp does not clasp tight enough to stay on pants waist
3.0,Hurts my ear fits though
3.0,"Nice looking bracelet but that’s about it, maybe measure your wrist and show the measurements of the bracelet."
3.0,My daughter loved the dress till it fell apart and my mom threw it out
3.0,Sizing chart did not match the dress. I ordered an XL but fits like a M. I will have to send it back.
3.0,"This is for a very tiny wrist, however it is very pretty. I gave it 3 stars bc I dont know many women with such a tiny wrist."
3.0,The design on the robe is cute but I was hoping when I read fleece that the material would be thicker.
3.0,I liked them but the sticky part keeps falling off.
3.0,I bought this as a gift for someone large. I ordered xxl. It is actually like a regular large. So now I can't give it as a gift as it's way too small
3.0,Se me rajó y rompió muy rápido
3.0,It's really nice and the fur inside would definitely keep you warm in the winter even though I order a 1X it was too small
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because it's cute but it's a shirt. I'm only 5'5 and it fell just below my goods and I bought a L (I'm curvy) and L is my normal size. Either go a size bigger or shrink your height.
3.0,the material is not good. i think it should be review.
3.0,It did not seems to keep me as cool as I had hoped. I could have wet a towel and put it around my neck and gotten the same results.
3.0,"They run small! I love everything about them though, so I’m going to order another size up!"
3.0,Just dumpy looking when it's on and the rainbow fabric portion looks like something you can buy at the dollar store.
3.0,"Belt fits, I’m disappointed with the stitching feels backwards and the logo was Stitched on the inside wear you can’t see it."
3.0,"The product itself is nice, but the sizing is waaaay off. I ordered a size XL because according to ZEAGOO .measurements it would fit bust size 34.3&#34; I'm a 34C so should be just slightly loose on me. But the shirt that was shipped was A LOT bigger than the stated measurements. Had to return"
3.0,"Nice fit, thin fabric, not a bad dress for just bumming around the house. Cut in front is weird which prevents me from wearing it outside."
3.0,This skirt was smaller than I expected and did not seem to flare as much as it does in the picture.  It is fine but that's it.
3.0,"I ordered this shirt following the size chart recommendation., Like a fool, I took the tag off as soon as I received it. Then I tried it on and found out it didn’t fit. It was way too big and sloppy fitting.  I really like the style and feel to this shirt and wish that I could have returned it, and get another to replace it,  No more taking off the tag before trying it on for me. Wouldn’t you know that this is a shirt that wouldn’t shrink, mo matter what I tried. Guess I’ll have to see if someone else can use it."
3.0,I always  wanted this bangle .
3.0,Ok quality but there is a seam sewn in down the middle of the sole which is quite uncomfortable.
3.0,"The socks are warm & fit well on my feet, but are too binding on the leg part.  They put ridges in my legs & I have thin legs."
3.0,"white is completely see through. I was hoping to use this dress as my bridal shower dress. however it is completely see through and too thin to wear a slip under it. so I will use it as a bathing suit cover up. the front is a good 2 inches shorter than the back, which you could play off because it is a thin, casual, cotton sun dress. White will work perfectly for a bathing suit cover up... just a little disappointed. was hoping for it to be thick enough fabric to be able to wear a slip underneath at least."
3.0,"I like the bracelet, however, it is very light and does not feel like it will last long with regular wear."
3.0,Stitching on the hood is pretty good. Zippers are cheap and break easily. Sizes are cut smaller than normal. What is labeled as large is equivalent to a small-medium. Adjust your order accordingly to avoid return.
3.0,..... but there is no way this shirt will button across my chest.  I am a medium and I ordered a large and it is tight in upper arms and across chest. I am in process of losing weight so hopefully the arms will not be so tight but I doubt I will ever button it.  I am keeping it because I have another denim shirt I like better for wearing buttoned and will use this as a light jacket even if I end up cutting the sleeves off.
3.0,They are awesome and I get tons of compliments but the one shoe lace stopped lighting up then it died after 2 hours. The laces worked great for a few months Atleast!
3.0,"This suit just didn't fit me right, or look at all flattering in my opinion, probably because I'm not slender. I think on a slender person it would be fantastic."
3.0,Returned- It was very cheap and way too small
3.0,Get the next size up as this item runs small
3.0,Nice but came without the nose pieces! They forgot to put them in!
3.0,"The body portion fit nice, but the bust area was large and pointed.  I didn't try washing it, but it seemed like that wouldn't help."
3.0,"Fabric is kind of odd, I thought it would he like cotton. Also, buttons aren't functional, wished the bottom would split open in the front so it didnt look as fake"
3.0,Size and color were great. But they were one sided printed and not 100% cotton.
3.0,I like how they look. I had a little problem keeping them on my ears. i had to add a little butterfly to stopping them from falling off!!!
3.0,Fit too tight was suppose to be loose
3.0,pretty dress. I appreciate that no ironing was required by the dress did not fit me as expected. This maker 's sizing is simple is  not cut to flatter my body type.
3.0,Decent quality lace top for the price and nice color selection.The sizing is better for juniors as it runs a bit small and both the shirt and liner are clingy. The neckline is flattering.
3.0,"I broke my hip, so by the time I got home this dress arrived & I no longer wanted it, so I sent it back."
3.0,Fits good but not too wrinkle resistant
3.0,"Kinda disappointed, I know they are cheap but one pairs stitching fell  out, like the leg came undone, after wearing them one time. Otherwise they look great ant fit really well."
3.0,"The colors looked great , but the dress was not what I expected. I ran alot smaller than expected. If you are fuller in the middle section this is not the dress for you."
3.0,The item looks nice for the exception of the O rings that turned silver after a few days. After a few weeks the infinity piece of the bracket changed colors and the gold pealed off.
3.0,The color I recieved is more of a rusty orange rather than the cranberry color shown on the model. But I still like it
3.0,"These earrings are so beautiful. The colors are very vibrant. I wish I could wear them, but they are too heavy. As soon as I tried them on, they stretched out my ear lobe & it looked very unflattering. I could imagine it stretching out my ear hole if I were to wear it for a night out.<br /><br />**If this review was helpful, please take a literal second to press the button below and let Amazon know. Thank you!**"
3.0,It does not look this nice in person. Also the whole shirt is wider than I was anticipating.
3.0,"Love the pattern, not a big fan of the fabric."
3.0,"I bought these at a discount in exchange for my honest review! So I bought these sunglasses for my wife and they are really nice looking and seem to be built nice and strong. The nose piece is built right from the frame so it is nice knowing that they won't break off! Unfortunately, The one problem we have with these glasses are that when you put them on something is not right and they sit crooked on her face, I thought it might be the shape of the face so I tried them on and they did the same thing. So they don't fit well at all and in turn she obviously is not going to wear sunglasses that sit crooked on her face. I am not sure if it is only this pair that was defective or if other people have encountered the same issue. Other than that, they are a really nice set of glasses. The lenses work great and have a nice color to them that we are very happy with and they are also nice and stylish! If it wasn't for the glasses sitting crooked they would be ideal!!"
3.0,they was alright
3.0,Cheap quality.. I wore just a few times and now it looks so worn and old that I don't wear it anymore. After washing and not even drying the fabric looks worn out and the fabric has balled up leaving those tiny little balls all over the shirt.. disappointing because I loved the way it fit!
3.0,"A seam on the front of the hat, attaching the lighter pink cloth with the ponies to the hat proper, tore almost immediately, and not from any great abuse (well, except for putting it on a kindergarten aged person).  This was repairable, but still.  It is cute, though."
3.0,"While the sizing fit and there was support to the bra, I only give this style three stars because of the way it was made. The material is very itchy and rubs your skin raw. Not only is there no padding in the cup - which means all of the lines show through your shirt - but there is no padding on the underwire either. I hated wearing it. I do not recommend."
3.0,"These glasses aren't bad for the price. The heart shape does not stand out as much as the photo shows, and they are very big for my head. But still, I can wear them and they look cute!"
3.0,Love the shirt but is is really short
3.0,"I don't feel like the size listed for these is accurate. I wear a 7 1/2 womens shoe size and ordered the 5-8 shoe size socks. They are very tight, I wish I had gotten the next size up. Otherwise these seem good, I don't think they will be prone to slipping down or fall off."
3.0,I wear size M which is technically 8-10. This t-shirt is closer to 8 rather than 10. It's really snug and shows all the imperfections I have in tummy area. I do not like that. It's well made and is genuinely a nice t-shit but it feels very confining and constricting when I put it on.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7dea9b56856bc40f30ba3a3773d0db08]] This off the should dress runs a little big I ordered a M and could have gotten away with a S just due to the middle section not being flattering as it looks big! I was able to tuck it a little to compliment frame better. Just size down; however great thick material nice for elegant date night or evening
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7579d2d0bea96f5c2872e4e194fadd55]] I read reviews and knew before buying this band that it wouldn't fit my Samsung Active 2. I liked the colors and style, took my chance. I filed one side, got it to fit but the pins were too long. I took the pins from the band that came with watch and tried those but they were too fat to fit. I ended up cutting the thread, removing the metal pieces I filed, sewed it back closed and used the fat pins. It works and looks like I thought it would"
3.0,The quality is wonderful but its missing the shoulder part of the katana holder and the gun holsters which sucks i can't find any that match to just order separately and the description said it  came with everything  😭😭😭
3.0,I purchased this product several months ago and should have returned it.  The shoulder harness is comfortable but the neck cords do not hold my alto saxophone securely.  It drifts down as I am playing.  I see no way to tighten it.
3.0,"I got size medium and the fit was fine, good quality, loved these! Except the first time I wash/dried them (on low!!!) they shrunk in length so much, I can’t even wear them!! They look like the weirdest capri leggings now and I’ll be donating them since I don’t know anyone short enough to fit them now"
3.0,Looks to dark yellow. Looks cheap. I have to wear it now
3.0,Love the color and feel. A little small for my needs though.
3.0,Very thin material but fits nice.
3.0,Meh. Runs a little large. The overall look is okay. Good material and put together well. It sits kind of weird on the shoulders.. like they're really broad.
3.0,Really cute shirt and good quality but the sizing is way off. Order a size or two down or your kiddo will be swimming in it.
3.0,"The product came in fast and looks exactly like the picture, I really like it but unfortunately it's causing my neck to break out. I may be allergic to something in the metal, but it is causing red marks and bumps. No hate tho, it's a pretty good product besides that."
3.0,Product is fine except that the length of the chord of the pant is too short and keeps going into the hole. I am thinking of returning it for this reason .
3.0,Nice quality but run very small
3.0,not the quality I expected for the price
3.0,"The shirt is alright but it is nothing like the shirt in the picture. One of the major differences is the neckline. I think possibly the stripes are further apart in reality as well. The material is a little weird, almost like a workout shirt, but not quite. It’s alright to wear around the house though.<br />As far as fit, the armholes are huge and the top has not shrunk at all after going through a hot wash cycle and a couple of dryer cycles."
3.0,I LOVE the aesthetic of these and was super excited when they came but they literally are so heavy on the front geometric side they lean forward. Add those earrings and you're basically just stretching your ears. I rock the cute earrings with different tunnels or plugs and they are killer I absolutely adore them. Just know they will be very heavy and they are VERY cute.. Wish they evened out the tunnel's weight!!!!
3.0,Very cute and comfy - Fit was just as they advertised. Would recommend!
3.0,They are cheap looking but they're cute. I'm going to wear them whenever I go to South Carolina in June so they're good enough for the purpose of what I need them for
3.0,I really like this necklace but you do get what you paid for. The sun got black in a few days. I did shower with it on so maybe that's why it wore down faster so just don't shower with it on. Other than that it really is a cute necklace
3.0,"I didn’t get every earring pictured in the assortment and didn’t get to choose which designs I did get.  Of course the pair I wanted the most that was pictured didn’t get sent.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of the earrings are great for the price."
3.0,Larger then I expected but great if your going to wear long johns underneath. They said lined but  I don’t think they are lined.
3.0,Not as pictured. The elastic part that is supposed to be the waist falls instead just under my breasts (36 C). Very thin fabric. Does not feel quality.
3.0,cheap crap. but nice cheap crap.
3.0,"I bought these socks to wear for tromping about outdoors.  I was disappointed that they were not truly knee socks but only came up to my calf.  I am 5'6"" and my legs are average length so they should have come all the way up to my knees.  The result was that they fell down as I walked around.  It is annoying to have to be re-pulling up socks especially if you are outdoors.  The wool is soft and the thickness fine.  I just wished they were longer."
3.0,"The style of this dress is very cute, and I really wanted it to be a keeper. However, there were two deal breakers for me.<br />First, the fabric. Being entirely synthetic, it was terribly static. As I tried it on, just taken out of the bag, it was making that crackling noise AND it was sticking to my body, instead of flowing nicely. Heaven forbid you're looking for a flaring dress to hide some imperfections.<br />The second thing I did not like is that the top is definitely made for smaller breasts. While this will fit you even if you are bustier (I am a 36DD, and it was not tight or anything), the stitches that are supposed to lay right under your breast (like an empire cut should), will sit unsightly right in the middle of it."
3.0,"In terms of quality, they're fairly good. However, for some reason I received a shoe size of 7.5 instead of 6.5 like I ordered so the shoe is pretty big on me. Normally I'd return them and ask for the correct size, but with the con I'm going to coming up, the shipping range makes me nervous. I did receive these in a pretty timely manner, but I really would not like to take any chances and be without shoes for the con.<br /><br />Now in terms of the fit. I would say they are very... Straight? There is basically no cinching at the ankle which will probably lead to folds as seen in the photo. Also there is no flare for the calves. My calves are wider, but luckily since these are lace up, you can kinda adjust. I just worry the tongue wouldn't be wide enough if I had a smaller size.<br /><br />Also as a side note, it seems as though the laces are sewn together in the middle as seen in the other picture. I was able to hide this behind the eyelet, so I'm not too annoyed by it, but just throwing it out there."
3.0,"The scarf is a nice lightweight fabric so you can wear it throughout the day without overheating. However, the color is an orangey-red. Not a true Christmas deep red. I bought it to go with a particular outfit and it did not match. When I went to return it, I got a prompt reply from the seller and very good customer service. I recommend the seller but be careful if you want this scarf to match a true red."
3.0,It is a. Cute dress. Fun to wear.
3.0,Love my tikkas
3.0,I was disappointed to see that the smallest pieces were so tiny.
3.0,These beanies are good for a child. I don’t know what happened to north face beanies but it seems they only make them for kids heads now
3.0,"Excellent price, but kind of get what you pay for. It is a thinner material, but not see through. Nice loose design to had any tummy issues. The only negative for me was the v neck is too big/low. For larger chested women (D cup and up) it would be fine I think."
3.0,"The skirt fit well and was made from a nice, solid material. There was no mention of attached shorts in the description and that was not what I was looking for. Returned."
3.0,"It’s a good looking band. Problem is putting on and taking off. I’ve almost thrown it across the room a couple times trying to put it on,"
3.0,"I ordered two pair of these and went by the sizing guidelines provided. It recommended an XL for my dimensions However,<br />they were extremely large in the waist, a little large in the legs, but just right in the rear end. I ended up keeping these thinking<br />they would be alright, but when I wear them I am forever pulling up the waist. I should have went with my gut and ordered a large,<br />but numerous other reviews reported they were tight in the legs, so I went by the sizing guidelines.<br />I would order these again, but in a large instead. They are nice and comfortable when I am not pulling them up."
3.0,The dresses is very purity but they run a little big I had other a small and is still big on me
3.0,"I like Filthy anglers glasses that I have but these seem real cheap. I have a hard time thinking these will hold up like my others. I did pay more, not sure if they changed the quality or not. I will send these back and buy their more expensive ones for a try! my sons dog chewed up the pair I had :("
3.0,They do not stay on my calf as expected.
3.0,Skirt material was ripped
3.0,We used for a mermaid costume for my 12 year old.  The mesh tore at the seam and at the hem.  We got lots of compliments on how cute she was though!
3.0,"I actually mistook this for something else. I imagine the images were showing the inside of a case. They don't. It's a single piece, with the pouch on one side and the organiser on the other. I had thought this was enclosed, maybe by zip. As it stands, it's great to organise, but not so much to protect. All your devices are exposed, because they're not enclosed in anything."
3.0,"The crystal looks nice, but is MUCH lighter than the picture shown in the ad.  The &#34;gift box&#34; is also just some cardboard held together by light thin red paper and was falling apart when I received it."
3.0,I realize these are not boots (I was referencing the Nancy Sinatra song-These boots are made for walking). Very cute but extremely high (as are most Jessica Simpson shoes -this from someone who lives in heels). I wore these to work on a short (4hour) day then went to the mall for a quick second on a Saturday. They rubbed the tops of my feet in the middle section between the bottom of your toes to where your legs starts to go up. When I was putting lotion on my legs and feet on Monday morning for work that area was still raw! So beware. I made the mistake of picking these as everyday casual wear shoes when they could easily be Fri or Sat night out heels (dance for a couple of hours then run home and get out of them)!
3.0,"Way too small... bought a 4, too small, returned for a 6 and still too small... oh well<br />My girl is 33 inches and 35lbs"
3.0,It was a little too big in a medium and im a size 6-7
3.0,Pros:<br />- Keeps time accurately<br />- Nice look<br />-Cheap price<br />-Fits well on my wrist<br />-glass is stratch-resistant<br /><br />Cons:<br />Feels like plastic not metal<br />So light it feels like a toy watch<br />Almost of cog wheels are static and don't move at all
3.0,"Extremadamente pequeña,  no corre igual tamaño a la XXI de punta abierta. No me sirvio."
3.0,"The dress fits, but looks cheaply made."
3.0,Very attractive piece that could  pass for a piece of jewelry. My only drawback is that it is not in a typical rosary fashion. I travel frequently and find these type of rosary bracelets convenient.
3.0,Material was uncomfortable and the stockings were too short. I’m 5 foot 4 so I’m not exceptionally tall but they were too small for me. The dress fit well.
3.0,"I think the velcro strap could be a little longer.  However, the fact that I am petite is the reason why I chose this shoulder pad and it works fine."
3.0,They didn’t fit exactly like I would have liked but after a lot of mink oil they started to come around
3.0,I can’t really complain considering how inexpensive this top was. But just to make future shoppers aware. The screen print was already beginning to peel off when it arrived. The actual material isn’t bad. Not great but again you have to consider the cost of this top
3.0,"Okay fabric...kind of thin though.  Has some stretch to it, which is needed because it fits small and is hard to get on.  Wrinkles easily.  I wear a large in tops, ordered an extra large thinking it would undoubtedly fit...I was wrong, but this brand seems two run small, as the other dress I ordered had the same issue."
3.0,One of the Diamonds fell off the ring. The quality of the ring is good but the diamonds are falling of which is what makes it pretty.
3.0,"ok for the money, not bad."
3.0,super cute but definitely not practical. depends on what youre wearing it'll get caught but other than that its just a fun statement piece
3.0,"Really good accessory, and durable too, still though it is kind of cheap and for the price I'm pretty sure you can find better."
3.0,The top triangle was sealed off-centered
3.0,"Cute, but TOO BIG FOR MY FACE!"
3.0,Not is fan of the top ruffle.  Ruffle at the waistband pointing up.  Didn’t notice it online.  Returned.
3.0,Not worth the very high price.
3.0,Nice bag size wise but for the money thought the quality of leather wasn't good
3.0,"I really wanted to love this top. But honestly, the fit is just strange. Besides the fact that it looks almost nothing like the picture, I am 5'5&#34; and my measurements are 40&#34; 30&#34; 40&#34;. I ordered the XL and it was a bit too... Wide on me, a tiny bit too short, and the neckline doesnt really give me enough space to comfortably pull it off of one shoulder. And the sequins are a bit pokey!! Also, there isn't a tag in the front or back, so I wasn't totally sure what way to put it on! Hopefully I can figure out a way to wear this on New Years or something, because it is unique. Maybe if you are skinny, and have narrow shoulders this top will work well!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange of my honest, unbiased review."
3.0,"Ordered them because of the attractive black & white design. They didn’t disappoint in that regard. Although, they  are a little snug @ the front, otherwise, wide enough to cover my feet adequately .They don’t feel cozy,<br />like lightweight slippers, but more fitted,<br />more in keeping with a sheath, or snug sock. May be better suited for travel, easy to pack, convenient for long flights, hotel stays, providing added foot protection."
3.0,The fabric isn’t what I expected
3.0,"I like that you can carry cash or credit cards undetected. This pocket is large enough to carry the largest of phones, passports and other items but the bulk will show. So it’s most ideal for lightweight slender items."
3.0,Poor quality for the $. Had tears and snugs.
3.0,These are very stiff and I don't let my daughter wear them if she has to be walking. Of course she loves them!
3.0,"Not compression at all, pretty loose."
3.0,"The hat was definitely warm.  It was too small, though and not my go to hat."
3.0,The colors of the item we received was not as pictured.  Ours was much more burgundy and very little blue. Design and patches similar. Like the colors of the pictured item better than the one we recieved.
3.0,Fit and wash well. A tad heavier than I wanted.
3.0,Pants for true to size but the top fits short
3.0,Dress is very sheer in the pink color. Would return but I’m lazy.
3.0,The arms snap off at the screws with very little pressure applied
3.0,It was to small so I sent  it back
3.0,This dress fit perfectly however the material is like a stretch dockers material. I wanted this dress for a wedding. It was nit what I needed so I returned it. It would be cute just for casual wear!
3.0,"Love the style and fabric , i ordered a large fits slightly big on me think mabey should got medium instead ?"
3.0,"I got this as a gift for my significant other,  it's kinda cheap made but it's still a pretty piece of jewelry,  not quite long enough to suite my Mrs. I give 3 star 🌟"
3.0,Dress is perfect not the same item cardigan is really short not the same outfit. Will keep because of price.
3.0,Driving at night
3.0,"The sandals look very nice and are almost identical to Vionics.  The only difference is that they are narrower than the same shoe in Vionics.  They do have velcro to adjust but the construction of the footbed is narrower and it doesn't look great if you have to loosen the straps so much that you see the velcro.  Except for this, they look very nice and the arch support is identical to the much more expensive brand.  If I buy again I will get a half size bigger."
3.0,Good product. Sizing is just too small.
3.0,They were nice as far as the ones that I received. I did not receive the complete set and they are quite hard to keep on. But they look great and stylish.
3.0,"Color and quality are good, LOVE the pink!<br /><br />I don't have a long torso, but the torso in this suit is VERY short.<br /><br />The bottom half of the suit fits well, it has a nice peek of cheek and is high cut which gives my short legs some length. But the straps on the top are spaced so far apart the straps won't stay in place. In addition, the short torso has the breast cups resting just above the bottom of my rib cage. As soon as I bend over at all the girls fly right out. It's like a one of those one piece wrestling suits, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!! There is just no support or hold, maybe if you have substantial assets you'll be okay.<br /><br />I'm hoping I might be able to cut the straps and sew them a little bit differently because I really like the color and the cut on the bottom half.<br /><br />For sizing reference, I ordered a medium. I'm about 5'3"" 140lbs, size 6, 36D."
3.0,"Proportionally, I have a very long torso, 36 D chest and very short legs. This was a cute suit and flattering the first time I wore it. (Size L)<br /><br />It appeared to fit well but then the connected section separated and it became a two-piece suit. This happened while I was wearing it. The suit didn't feel tight or strained, I was mainly floating around. Very light activity.<br /><br />As a two-piece it did not hang well. The assymetry looked sloppy, rather than intentional. The bow was nice though. The way it floats in the water is really pretty."
3.0,"Way too big, i went by the size chart which says 2x  wgen i typically wear a medium"
3.0,This top is just okay. It's not the greatest quality and the size was larger than expected.
3.0,"I’m 6’ 185 and muscular (have wide shoulders) . A large fits me perfect - nice trim fit. I’ve had my covert hoodie for a few years now and I must say I don’t wear it very often. Partially because I have a lot of light coats but mostly because I don’t find it very versatile - there is  a small window of weather and wind conditions I can wear this. Be warned, if you’re using this as an outer layer u can find yourself miserable if the wind picks up because the wind goes right through this and anyone who knows about the cold knows that the windchill is what goes to the bone. I have to think AT wove this loosely to increase its breathability but it kind of fails at that even. Better breathability than I’ve found with Polartec and Kuhl but I still would never wear this as a base or mid layer....it would have to be pretty cold because with activity you will sweat like a pig. As well, there is no adjustment for the hood so it has little functionality, especially so since  the wind goes right through it. As far as a technical piece....I would never climb or hike with this...it simply has such a small window of weather conditions it would work well in, and is  not worth packing Both in terms of weight and compactability. I would much rather have a merino wool garment or a lower fill down or down alternative for climbing and hiking. Of course this is just my opinion. Like all AT stuff it has a flattering fit for an athletic body and is best suited as “an around town” type jacket."
3.0,What I expect....good shape and feel not scratched. Good enough sunglasses.
3.0,Beautiful but irritated her skin
3.0,Shorts seemed to cup the vagina area in an odd way.  The padding in the top made a weird round &#34;Bologna Barb&#34; look!!
3.0,"The bag is beautiful, but I am return it just because it is bigger than I usually carry. It is a lighter gold than I thought too . But the vendor had packaged it perfectly. Very nice if you like bigger bags."
3.0,Very cute but cut way too low in front
3.0,"This dress is very pretty, as expected. I would order a size smaller than the chart provided indicates as this dress has a good amount of stretch.<br /><br />The stitching is secure and sound, the fabric is a lighter-medium weight, yet still hangs well.<br /><br />The pleats on the skirt are attractive, even, and lay flat enough to prevent bulking around the tummy/hips, yet allow an attractive vintage, swing-style flare. If you were to add a petticoat or crinoline, you would easily achieve a more retro fullness, if that is what you desire. The color is vibrant (though I have not laundered it yet, I do feel it will maintain it's color...I ordered red but it comes in black with white dots and a pale blue with white dots).  The zipper is sturdy and the bodice of the dress is lined with soft, stretchy lining; the skirt is not lined but does not appear to be sheer, even in the light.<br /><br />This dress comes to my knees, which is what I wanted.<br /><br />When ordering the size, I followed the size chart posted by the seller. I order most all of my clothing online, and frequently order clothes in Asian sizes. Normally, I wear a US 12-14 and that translates to an Asian XL. According to this manufacturer and size chart, my measurements required that I order the XL, but due to the stretch, I should have ordered the L and would have been a bit happier with the more, form-fitting piece...and even have adequate breathing room. As it is, I do not even need to utilize the zipper to put on/remove this dress. I can leave it completely zipped and still easily get it on and off over my head.<br /><br />The zipper is located on the left side seam, ending right under the armpit. The zipper is secure, but it is not placed appropriately to allow it to fully zip all the way up to the top. The zipper ends about a quarter inch before reaching the seam under the arm. This should not be an issue, but there is no hook and eye closure to bring the opening together, ensuring a truly secure closure.<br /><br />The bodice meets the waist of the skirt at exactly the right place.<br /><br />I do have a bit of an issue with the seams where the bodice and the band connecting it to the skirt. The waistband is a bit crooked along the seams at the sides. There is a bit of &#34;puckering&#34; that would be remedied easily with ordering a smaller size, allowing a more fitted top/waist and relieving the looseness.<br /><br />You will have to give this dress a good pressing, especially at the neckline, as the lining and the outer fabric tend to &#34;pull&#34; and the lining will be exposed a bit. And a good press will also fix the fact that the hemline is not smooth.<br /><br />This dress is a good buy, for the price, and is a nice, soft cotton so it is very comfortable Just order a smaller size than the chart suggests.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Fits ok just a little snug. I ordered this expecting cheap material and it was that cheap shiny fabric that feels like it might last 10 washes. It's ok though the design is spot on.
3.0,The chain is very thin exactly 16 inches. But compared to other ones that I read online the horn is very small and hollow.
3.0,Style no like picture no pretty on foot.
3.0,I really like it. I just wished it would fit like a xlarge.
3.0,"I ordered a large.  I am 5'5"", 155 lbs.  Dress was very flowy...but too flowy for me.  If I would have ordered a medium it probably would have been too tight in the chest area.  Also, the straps were adjustable but when I received the dress they were already at the longest length and I could have used a bit more length in the armpit area.  Another thing....it was really staticky.  Ordered the white, was not see thru at all.  Very cute but did not work out for me."
3.0,Part of it was too tight and part was to loose. It just did not fit like any other unitard we have tried or purchased.  Started the return but then told time to return ran out. Tried to give it to two other kids and they couldn't wear it either.
3.0,"Beautiful charm, gotten many complements but the chain is unwearable since it tears out my hair."
3.0,"Bought a set for my kids. The hats are cute and warm. I also live the colors. The downside, for me, was the hats were a little tight for my 4 and 5 year olds and it didn't hold it's shape well (just be careful not to let your kids tug on ot or pull it off too hard especially if they are grabbing it from behind)."
3.0,does the job on darker shoes but with white shoes its another story. not a bad little kit but the microfiber towel they give you has really low-quality stitching. the cleaner smells great and I do not feel like I wasted my money.
3.0,Love the colors but the size was to small so I wasn’t able to fit it.
3.0,Good fit.<br />Material is somewhat cheap.<br />Collar is clumsy.
3.0,RIDES UP - MAYBE BECAUSE IM CHUNKY
3.0,"The material is very soft and the top half of the dress is great. Unfortunately it just does not fit my body. I'm 5' 3&#34; and about 125 lbs, and this was a bad look on me. I ordered my usual size small, but this was far too big. It went past my knees and was excessively baggy. I easily looked 20 lbs heavier and like I have no dress. I am returning the dress. I would reorder in an XS, but unfortunately they don't offer that."
3.0,"While these earrings exactly meet the product description, the actual product isn't what I wanted/needed. The straight piece, the part that goes through your ear, is thicker than expected and doesn't go through mine w/o pain and considerable effort.<br /><br />Please note that if your holes are somewhat stretched then there shouldn't be a problem. If yours are like mine and fairly close to the original piercing size you may have trouble.<br /><br />Overall, these were a good value for the $ spent, they just weren't right for me."
3.0,"They are very pretty..,however they are smaller than expected and very thin......"
3.0,Beautiful watch except for the band (poor quality).
3.0,"quality is fine, little large"
3.0,"I am 5'9&#34; about 140-50 lbs. I generally wear a woman's size 6-8 and I am small busted.  I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small depending on the brand.  I wanted this to be flowy so I ordered a medium.  Well... it fits like an XL.  The dress is HUGE. Very wide at the chest and in the arms. On the plus side... If you are a tall gal, this dress is still modest.  It hits about 2&#34; above the knee at the shortest part of the hemline.  The blue-grey color is fabulous and the material is very soft-- yet it is sturdy. Maybe I can shrink it or belt it?  If not I have a new lounge dress."
3.0,If someone who likes watches nothing too fancy with a good adjustable band
3.0,"It runs small.  Order up.  The material was disappointing, it looks like t-shirt material.  Good for throw me on and go to the store."
3.0,Merchandise came quickly but the posts were larger than I expected and I can’t wear them
3.0,"very thin fabric and shorter than I wanted, 8 inch inseam."
3.0,Wish I would have gotten a size down. Not really high impact for big breast. It’s comfy but if you are looking for high impact size down one. Also wish the straps were adjustable they are a little loose.
3.0,Cute pattern but not flattering in any way
3.0,Legs run small
3.0,Great fit except in the back where it sticks out. Not fitted at all.
3.0,"Let me start off by saying that this is a great pair of pants. I put them to the test. They are extreamly water resistant, very comfortable and extreamly easy to move around in. To be quite honest, I prefer these to jeans, as they are also light weight, durable and have a relaxed fit but are true to size. My reasons for giving it 3 stars instead of 5 are as follows.<br /><br />1) I bought these in black. The black ones do not have velcro pockets or the pockets for a tactical pen as stated in the product summary. Kinda feel feel like I was cheated.<br /><br />2) When washing these pants, DO NOT was them with anything that gives off lint (i.e. your wifes throw/blanket).. These pants grab lint with a death grip and will not let go, even after re-washing and putting in the dryer a second time.<br /><br />3) They are a little pricey.. If this company offers the same pants with more features, just in a different color, they should drop the price of these to reflect the difference. (Personal Opinion).. Those extra pockets for pens, and velcro pockets, instead of fixed flap ones, would have made these pants awesome..<br /><br />Other than that, I have no complaints.."
3.0,"I ordered this and returned it. 5 stars to the seller, they replaced it due to the elastic being broken on the top of tube top. But the item replaced had areas of threading undone. Just kept it even though it's slightly defective. I also ordered it in black that fits perfect! The white one is a little smaller in fit."
3.0,The quality is good.  They are just too big for my face.
3.0,"Bag was handy and very compact.  However, since I loaded I with souveniers the carrying handles were not comfortable."
3.0,Fit a little small. Also was an extremely see through material. I’m pretty tall but the slit seemed extra deep.
3.0,Love the watch bracelet but not crazy about the other bracelet. Would like it better if it had the snap closer as well. Do not like the charms on the bracelet either.
3.0,Really comfortable to wear but once it gets washed it begins falling apart. If it hasn’t already been suggested in the description I would solely stick to hand washing.
3.0,Somewhat small but still fit. Item good
3.0,Item was bigger than expected. I should have gone down a size or two.
3.0,"This product made a Green Bay fan (EW!) very happy it just runs very large, we ordered it for a 13 yr old and it was enormous. It honestly would fit the head of a grizzly bear. He did love the gift  and commented that he could wear it for the rest of his life 😂"
3.0,I like that i can tide it around my waist but i dont like how the clips are keep falling off and i don't like how there was to much fur and so i had to cut it
3.0,I sized up from reading reviews and the dress is still to small. It is very short! Maybe I can wear it in the fall with leggings. Or get a dress extender. But for now it just hangs in the closet.
3.0,"Just received my order...Navy blue with lime green edge highlights.<br />Guess I was expecting a little something more. The material reminds me of wide elastic....minus the stretchy part. A bit rough and it secures with velcro dots. The plastic connectors on mine are kinda cheap and theres glue showing near the edges. Didnt notice it in the picture until now but the Navy blue is not consistent the whole way around either. The band is half Navy blue and half Blueish-gray. Biggest downfall for me is that one of the connectors keeps coming undone from my fitbit. The band has zero stretch, so the slightest pressure on it makes mine come unsnapped from my Fitbit. It cost around $10 but still expected a bit better quality. Will probably send it back due to the faulty connector."
3.0,"The dress material is nice, it looks like the picture. This would’ve been 5 stars had it not arrived dirty and clearly previously worn and stained. I ordered a large."
3.0,"I could send the product, there was no availability. But they are very serious apologized contacted me and I hope I buy at the next opportunity. thanks"
3.0,Love it runs a little big
3.0,Would not buy again. Should have returned.
3.0,Tight in the toes. Wish I wouldn't have bought them. Was looking for something more comfortable.
3.0,"Bought a large as most reviews stated it ran small.  The bodice fits great but the sleeves, tho long like I like them, are very big and not fitted at all--when wet they seem even bigger."
3.0,This necklace is a glass dome with a photo inside.
3.0,Cute hat but lint comes off a lot
3.0,Lasted 6 mths
3.0,first time I wore them I got a blister which is something that I have not had in a very long time
3.0,Looks pretty but not too comfortable to wear.
3.0,"*edited 7/20/17* company reached out and offered a replacement pair.  Will update again once we try it*  very happy with customer service **We received these Monday, my daughter wore them for maybe two hours, and the toes are already wearing through.  I'm going to have to replace them before we even go on the trip they were purchased for.  Glad we tried them so I know to get something different.  I would not recommend these unless your looking for a One wear use."
3.0,"Eh, super cheap material. Skip it."
3.0,"For me this item was just ok. Sleeves weren't as long as I had hoped, nor was the dress itself. Was hoping that it would hit the floor, but at just under 5'7&#34;, it's about ankle length. For me, it ran true to size, but didn't find it to be completely flattering. Guess it's a good thing I bought this as a swimsuit cover."
3.0,I ordered a size larger thinking it would probably run small.  I should have ordered my normal size.  The burgundy color I ordered was more red.
3.0,"This hat runs small, but one still needs to wear a mask underneath.  There is more gaping when I wore it compared to the model picture.  Returning."
3.0,The ring is nice but the paws are too Small to see them
3.0,"I would give it a five star, however found some trash inside the backpack. Found a gum wrapper and a random business card."
3.0,Please note this will not fit all iPhone 7s.  Check carefully to make sure you have the exact model matching this description.
3.0,After reading the reviews I thought the purchased size would fit appropriately... upon receiving the blouse it was a tad bit too small...i normally wear a size XL in US... for me it's uncomfortable to wear something so tight... someone else it might not matter
3.0,Ordered this in red and it was a coral color. DEFINATELY not red!
3.0,"So the hands themselves look good; however the quality isn't great.  Wore these on Halloween (once) and one of the straps broke when taking them off.  I wasn't yanking on it, but rather pulling one Velcro piece away from the other.  They're still usable, but this was disappointing.  I suppose for the price it isn't too bad."
3.0,Very cute but it was too small and I found it difficult to put the skirt on.
3.0,The color seemed really faded
3.0,"It fits great. Nice smooth material. However the design printed on it isn’t as clear as I would expect for a $25 jacket. The lines and details are blurry. It’s a great concept, but not well executed."
3.0,I bought these and made sure it said for ladies but the pockets sit real low and feel like mens
3.0,Strap is way too short.Overall the purse is kuUUte ! but again strap is very short may be perfect if you stand 4&#34;11-5'1
3.0,"It's a nice Hat, but man!!! I had to perform with this hat and it slowly started coming off, need this hat to be a bit bigger"
3.0,"Its made of cotton, 95%, yes, but of low quality cotton.  However, for $ 15, you get 6 pairs!! Those truly quality combed cotton socks  will cost  you around 15 dollar/pair."
3.0,"I love this coat, so soft and warm. Unfortunately I had to return it, The inside of the sleeves smell and look like mildew and or mold, also see water spots, hopefully this is a fluke. I have already ordered a replacement."
3.0,It's been six months since I've bought this and attached to my keys.... about half the paint has rubbed off... Sucks.  I wish it would have stayed longer.  Currently looking for another keychain....
3.0,Does well to keep the pain away with riding a bike.  I find the waist was too big and I have to constantly pull them up. They fit every where else great.
3.0,Very small. Wasn’t impressed by size for value.
3.0,I still like them and the color is nice I wear socks to make a cozy fit. Not for outside as they are like sock and slip proof.
3.0,very nice bag...but way too large!!!
3.0,Loved the dress but it was definitely too small. I ordered a XL and should've gotten a 2X because it was to small.
3.0,It's very nice and I like it very much BUT I'm very disappointed that Charm has become discoloured so quickly.
3.0,Very soft but they run really small
3.0,The “gemstones” were covered in glue and popped right out.  After cleaning and re-gluing back together they’re super cute though!
3.0,I am a little disappointed on this boots. It hurts my feet and I got them because easy spirit are my favorite shoes.
3.0,Stretchy material. Nice<br />Print but it looked like a sack in me - nonshape. Had to<br />Go back
3.0,Thought I was ordering a reversible belt and got this.  Guess I will keep but disappointed (brown).
3.0,It's peeling lol
3.0,"My son loved the watch, however the watch band broke within 2 days of him having it."
3.0,I was surprised when I first saw it because It does look much prettier on their photo than in real life to me personally. They make it look fancier. But Its still nice and the price was very affordable for sterling silver. The size is good not too big and bulky or too small. I didnt like the chain it came with it kept getting tangled in my hair so I swapped it out for another.So far I dont have any other complaints. I've been showering with it on and it hasnt rusted or discolored.
3.0,Very cute 😚☺
3.0,Looks more purple than gray...
3.0,Very beautiful color but it would snag a lot on my clothes.
3.0,Much smaller then I realized but pretty
3.0,IT FITS OKAY BUT THINK IT SHRUNK AFTER WASHING AND LINE DRIED. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
3.0,The hooks are too small for most hand bags
3.0,It was ok. My expectations were higher so I returned it.
3.0,It is ok but very wrinkled. I had iron before I could use it.🙃
3.0,Didn't fit well.
3.0,They work but they keep getting stuck on my joy cons!
3.0,Little thin for my liking and fit a little big but cant beat the price
3.0,"This is such a cute outfit. However, I saw several reviewers say that the top fit them just fine, with bigger boobs. I wear a 34D and the top did not fit me whatsoever. There’s just not enough coverage. I also could barely get the top on, because the band is REALLY small and tight. Will be returning it unfortunately."
3.0,It's so big
3.0,Was cute to wear on the beach but definitely not for swimming!
3.0,"I love the top! Very comfy, the bottoms on the other hand aren't as flattering on me. They are super cute but I just like how they looked on my flat bottom hahahah :p"
3.0,They run VERY small. I ordered a size up and they were a size too small. It's hard to get the lights to go-but super cute!
3.0,Colors are great. Just a bit big.
3.0,"Looks nice, but my daughter says it’s itchy."
3.0,Little smaller than expected but nice
3.0,"They're ok. I keep them in 24/7, and they don't seem to sparkle much. Also kind of top heavy, so they droop."
3.0,Cute...  They were perfect for my 3 year olds fireman costume but I had a very difficult time opening the clips so sent them back.
3.0,"They're are a little small if you don;t have twiggy calves they are hard to pull up all the way without the stretching out really far but, they are really cute I just had to wear the kind of bunched up."
3.0,Feels cheap but looks alright
3.0,The sizing chart wasn't helpful. The bra was too small so I'm giving it to my other granddaughter. The material ia very soft though.
3.0,Was a nice shirt but was smaller than the size stated
3.0,Really wanted to like this dress but fabric is too stiff and buttons looked cheap. Not for me.
3.0,Arrived with many pieces disconnected and possibly a few missing.  This is cheaply made but still very attractive.  Be prepared to do some repair and upkeep and make some decisions about where you want to put pieces once/if some are or go missing.  The part closest to the neck doesn't sit quite right.  The arc of the pieces doesnt fit the way they are strung together causing a strange fit that doesn't quite want to lay properly on the neck or chest.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"love being able to wash on delicate and hang to dry, (it had a strong smell when first opened, it does look and feel like swede, fit is on the small side for a medium, it's fine as an fashion fringe addition."
3.0,"Typically I really like Carters, but with these particular patterns, materials, they have faded very quickly and started to pill. I purchased in Dec and it is only Feb and they look years old.  And they are only worn maybe once every other week at best.  Sadly, they have not held up. I suspect it is the blue color that has faded."
3.0,Super cute but they run SMALL!
3.0,The removable Liner quality is average. I ride 30+ KM and it didn't feel so comfortable and protecting.<br />There is no option to shrink the shorts a bit and adjust it to your wrist.
3.0,"Color is not navy, but more like a black."
3.0,Cute but turns my arm green
3.0,"Great quality and a perfect winter dress but it's very tight. Both L and XL were too large. I have a thick bottom and this looked like a bod on dress on me. Made an otherwise very modest outfit look trashy. If you're very thin, this will be perfect."
3.0,The fit does not look good.. it has wierd cut. Material is ok but no nice cut
3.0,Ordered a size 12 and were very tight.  I'd recommend ordering one size larger.
3.0,I have a 38mm band and I accidentally bought the 42mm band. The kicker is that it fits on my watch as if it was a 38mm band. The band itself itsn't half bad. The cases it came with though a cheap quality and look trashy
3.0,Nice dress but a little too small
3.0,Fit very snug but still looked cute. The suspenders are made for a much larger child and he wasn’t able to wear them which was disappointing.
3.0,Cute as can be but they run small.
3.0,These lenses seem of fair quality overall. A bit disappointed that they didn't even come with a basic lens cleaning cloth.
3.0,It's ok for my use.
3.0,Edit: I’ve had it for about 2 weeks and the inside pocket edging came apart from the fabric.<br /><br />I wanted a good purse that I could carry lots of stuff and look classy. I got the purple/black one and I love it. The sides are a little stiff at first but you can unbuckle the things on the back.
3.0,Lovely dress. I followed the size chart given but it was still too roomy. Will have it taken in . Pleased with the quality though
3.0,"Photo online shows alot of variation of color, almost camo. Pant received had not variation of color and the green was so dark it almost matched my black pair I have.<br />Sent back."
3.0,A little small for my noggin.  Big headed people beware.
3.0,ONLY GETS 3 STARS BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN CHINA.
3.0,"Glasses are more mod (tortoise shell, oversized lenses) than steampunk, and not mirrored. But they are yellow and I can make do with these as Holtzmann glasses."
3.0,"Bulky, not as small as I thought. Thick."
3.0,"I’m 5’3”, 105lbs and I bought the small. It was very baggy and looked kind of “peasant lady number five” tucked into the midi skirt I bought it for. My mom, 5’4”/145lbs, normally wears a medium/large and this fit her perfectly. I’d say size down. It’s a beautiful shirt and I would have returned it for something smaller but I think with the way this fits I would have had to get an xxs and it only goes to small.<br /><br />It’s an inexpensive blouse so it should be expected that the material is on the cheaper side. Gathered elastic waistband if you can’t tell from the photos."
3.0,I'm not sure how to describe this shirt. It's both too big and too small for me. It's very wide and square. And very short. I was under the impression this was supposed to be a shirt and not a crop top. The shirt is so wide it constantly is falling off my shoulders. And that would be okay but it's so short too and it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's still cute so it's not a complete failure but not what I wanted and not what was advertised.
3.0,"Much darker than I expected. Good quality hair, but even my 5 year old commented it was too dark to be Anna."
3.0,Product seems faded
3.0,Slightly small no lining zipper inferior and balled up when washed until I dried it the second time with a tennis ball.
3.0,Cute and soft. Difficult to put on a wiggly baby though. Should have bought a suit that snapped or zipped all the way down. Material is thick with no elasticity. Having to bunch it up over babies head makes the fabric even harder to manipulate.
3.0,The fabric and design are not what I expected.
3.0,"I got this in blue & I don't like it ... I am 5.5' & 120 lbs. Got the small. It fits well, but its loose around my butt & my waist. Does not fit like the pic. Its alright quality, but I wouldn't get it again"
3.0,I love the style and color but opted to return the top because it cut at the bra line making me look very busty and top heavy
3.0,"very good noise reduction, but the folding ear pods made it impossible to put on easily.  My granddaughter became very frustrated and was un able to use them."
3.0,"Sidefeel women's floral lace plus size top.  This shirt is made with polyester and spandex.  This shirt can be paired with leggings, jeans, etc.  It is fashionable and light weight.  I ordered the black color.  This shirt arrived early and was packaged well in a nice bag.  I laughed when I pulled it out.  I ordered an xxxl expecting it to be an xl or so.  I wanted a very loose top to pair with tight leggings and tight jeans.  This is a very snug top.  It is not an xl like I thought the xxxl would be.  I would say it's an m to l.  It's very short for being an xxxl.  The shirt is thin but soft.  I think it may fit better if it wasn't so short.  I can wear it but it's snug on the shoulders and chest and then too short for my style.  The lace requires that you wear a certain bra or a tank top.  I tried it with a tank top and actually liked the look.  The splash of color through the lace top and then on the bottom where the shirt is too short.  The tank top is longer than this shirt.  I can handle wearing it that way but I expected this shirt to be easier to wear by itself.  I can't even really alter this shirt as it doesn't have enough fabric to really do much with.  Overall I liked the shirt after I styled it with a tank top and gave up my dream of it being a nice loose flowy top.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful."
3.0,If I had known these were going to fit big I would have gotten a size 3 or size 3 1/2 instead. Now I know for next time.
3.0,I have been using these  for many years. Bought most at a golf store . The only visor that will stay on and not give me a headache. This new one I just received is of a much lesser quality material and permanently creased from the way it is pack to be mailed. I think it might work but couldn't give it 5 stars after experiencing the original.
3.0,"Came out, ironically, during my sleep after a week....."
3.0,They  wear  nice
3.0,"I love the material.  It's soft, it's cool in the summer, and you just WANT to wear it.  But the cut is too straight if you have hips."
3.0,Love the quality of these glass frames but the lenses are just too orange and color distorting for me to use on a computer under most circumstances....
3.0,The colors look way different then pictured would have been much to know that. But it is soft n fits well
3.0,Skirt is short. A lot shorter than I like. It is light weight and soft.  Made for short women.
3.0,really thin but good for wearing in a place where it's hot and rainy
3.0,Ordered it as a gift for my best friend who loves elephants . Took a long time to get here ordered in January and didn't come until March but she loves it and the quote made it even more meaningful!
3.0,Material will be fine for casual weekend wear.  It is a little on the cheap looking side.  I am glad I ordered an XLarge after reading reviews saying how small it runs. I typically wear a small or medium at best.
3.0,The clips are pretty. Maybe all clips work the same way. I want something that will actually hold the edges of the garment together and these don't do that.
3.0,"Looks nice, but cheaply made"
3.0,"It’s a cute shirt I only paid $12, so it’s okay. The screen print on it isn’t great. If I paid more I would of been mad, but for the price I’ll keep it."
3.0,Was very tight on stomach/clingy
3.0,Cute hat and it protects my scalp but it runs way too small. I have a small head and I still am annoyed with having to adjust it when it rides.
3.0,Turns my finger  green on one part like it wasn't covered completely
3.0,Its a beautiful purse definitely not as big as i thought it would be
3.0,"This dress is well designed. I am a bigger girl, and I’m tall. The dress fits well. It doesn’t look as good from the side, but that’s because I need to lose weight not the design. The pattern is beautiful as well. Why oh why did they make this dress with this fabric! Ugh, it totally ruined it. This fabric is so damn cheap. First of all, the dress is super low cut, which is good. I noticed that bigger girls who went modest up top ended up looking super broad shouldered in these dresses. I say all that to say. Low neckline, tight fit, high slit, and cheap material = Swap Meet dress. No, no, no. It really is flattering though. I think if you actually dress it down, it won’t look so cheap. Like instead of big jewelry and super high heels, you do a sandle and top knot bun. Hope that makes sense. I think I can wear this as a casual maxi instead of a going out dress."
3.0,"Worked well for a while, eventually broke apart"
3.0,"I love these shoes.  I tried them on in a store but they didn't have the color I wanted in my size.  The clerk wrote down the style name and the correct size, but when I received them they were too small."
3.0,"This shirt is fine, pretty much exactly what you would expect. However, it doesn't seem like the reflective strips are sewn on very well. My husband caught it on something on his truck and it tore the strip off the shirt. He said he didn't catch it hard, the shirt has no damage except where you can see the reflective strip now falling off. It's not like there's a hole or anything where he caught it on the truck. I guess I would say these aren't holding up nearly as well as others we've purchased."
3.0,"The first watch died in less than one seek, I have yet to try the we one watch."
3.0,These boots were not as bright a pink as reflected in the description. Much paler pink. Wasn’t going to mess with a return but only ordered because of the color.
3.0,Unfortunately I had to return it-  blurry and unable to read
3.0,Feel cheap but the lens are pretty sun blocked.
3.0,comfortable but didn't fit well too small
3.0,"keep arms really warm. these are a little stretched out for me though, so I find they slide pretty easily. Not a deal breaker, but it is annoying to find myself constantly pulling them up."
3.0,Stone doesnt look real. There is also no veins in mine it's just turqoise. But the ring is nice and fits accurately.
3.0,"The item came on time. The quality is overall poor. The paper inside the glass is crooked and the band is poorly made as well. I work with children so I needed a basic watch that I wouldn't mind getting ruined, so this does the job, but it is not a watch you can dress up or accessorize to look more put together."
3.0,"Bought this dress for my 7yr old granddaughter- pretty design, nice sturdy material. Only complaint is that the dress runs a little big..may have to take it in- my granddaughter needs the length however, she is quite thin."
3.0,Cute bag but the strap is already beginning to wear. Cheap price so cheaply made I guess
3.0,"Unable to put the shoes on<br />, too narrow."
3.0,Weird rubbery feel to them.
3.0,These pants was so big and I ordered a size 3
3.0,"This is a great face mask. I purchased 2 of them one for me and one for my wife. Mine fit really well, but my wife’s is too big for her small head. Even though you can tighten them with the Velcro in the back. It is still too large. I would suggest making a smaller size if you don’t already."
3.0,Nice set didn't like them in person
3.0,"It fitted ok, just that the fabric in reality does not look nice. But the lower price may compensate for that"
3.0,"Looks nice. Although there are a few problems with it. Its very cheaply made. It broke the first time I tried putting it on, but it isn't to hard to fix. Took a bit of time but I think I got it to where I can wear it with out any problems. Number two it's huge like its still loose on the last clasp. If you are a small person think twice about it"
3.0,"Not very compressive and the socks are white with surface printing, so they turn light-colored when you put them on. But the design is charming and they are nice socks otherwise."
3.0,It looks ok on screen but deff poor quality in my hand. Can tell it is cheap metal and the side buttons do not even press in much less work.
3.0,I would prefer the hat to be with a closure
3.0,"I liked these but as soon as I tried them on for the first time, some of the jewels fell off."
3.0,So I didn’t like the material it felt too thick! I was hoping the material was on the softer side.<br />Also the small fit too snug. I read the reviews saying too big but I feel the sizing in inaccurate. I’d go up a size. For the price I’d say it’s a no.
3.0,I keep using it but I'm not sure it works.
3.0,This pigs don't &#34;poop.&#34; The color that comes out is bright red. More like a rectal prolapse.
3.0,I’m usually on the S/M side so I went up based on reviews and got a medium. I CANT EVEN GET IT PAST MY THIGHS. the top looks like a bra (I have little chest to cover). Sad since the reviews looked so promising.
3.0,"Esta bonito,pero pense que era otro tipo de tela mas fuerte y mejor calidad,me gustaria en ese tipo de vestido una tela de mejor calidad"
3.0,Buckle should be heavier. Prongs don't line up with belt holes.
3.0,"The color is very vibrant and the fit is on the tight side. It rolls up during the workout, yet it is decent overall. The disappointment is that the fabric pills right after the first wash (around the wrists area)"
3.0,nice watch band is difficult to use
3.0,tiny.
3.0,The quality is average.  Just don't expect too much.
3.0,Shirt was short compared to other golf shirts and would difficult to keep tucked in
3.0,"Super flat insoles, provided no support. They were wide enough, but too long."
3.0,sent back didn't like the way it fit
3.0,"I loved this watch! And then it failed (after a good 6 or 7 years but I thought it would last forever). Great casual watch, kind of a rugged, sophistication that I could get away with on casual Fridays. Pluses include the alarm and stopwatch (I never used the dual time). Minuses include bidirectional bezel (would never use for scuba diving (could inadvertently move the bezel)) and no screw down crown which ultimately I believe was its downfall with major water intrusion. I'm trading down to the Casio MDV106-1A ([[ASIN:B009KYJAJY Casio Men's MDV106-1A Black Analog Anti Reverse Bezel Watch]]) -- straight up analog with a screw down crown and 200 meter rating (and less expensive but less features, too). Of course, I still have my classic G-Shock for when I need a real beater. Long Live Casio!!"
3.0,"Nice shirt but has, no give, no stretch. It’s Perfect for under a jacket. Ordered a XL fit is good."
3.0,Too chunky for me and snagged easily
3.0,There was lipstick on my dress when I unboxed it.
3.0,"Cute sweater. Very soft.  But it's not pink, it's purple, like a lilac..."
3.0,Dress is comfy and the material quality is good. I think it fits big considering that I bought a small which is quite roomy though I'm pregnant.
3.0,Ok earrings but the backs are had to get on.
3.0,"Shirt is Much shorter in the front than what it appears!  I have to wear a tank under mine.  It sits right at the waist line almost like a crop top!  Other than that the fit and material feel great!  I did size up 1 size, I’m normally a medium and this is a large!"
3.0,"Loved the look. Fits like a nice t-shirt. Gave it to my daughter who is 35yr old and 5'7"" 120lbs. It look great on her. But me spanks underneath helped. But didn't want to wear them for 12 hrs. Would recommend for the younger woman."
3.0,It’s really short. Like REALLY short. It barely covers my butt. Would have to wear leggings with it to be even somewhat appropriate. It’s cute though.
3.0,Worried the outer fabric will tear. Cheap plastic like fabric. Great on the inside and warm. Hope it lasts.
3.0,It fits nice on me but I didnt like the cloth material.
3.0,Pathetic instructions
3.0,"What I did not like was the cheap feel of the fabric, it's flimsy and papery. Also there is no other pockets than the main one. What I do like is the size and the price. It's a little smaller than some gym bags but it's still large enough to fit your shoes and everything you need. Colors are accurate to the picture which is nice."
3.0,"Bracelet arrived w/flower broken off.  I glued it back on.  It is pretty, but a little chintzy, which I expected for the price.  The length is extremely short.  It’s probably better suited for a preteen girl or a very skinny petite woman."
3.0,"I love the look of this watch. I chose this watch over others watches I liked even though this one was more expensive because the case diameter was listed as 5.2cm. However the case diameter measured to approx. 4.2cm..I will keep the watch because it is so nice looking, but I am disappointed the watch is smaller than I expected."
3.0,"its cute. i like the design but it just didn't fit well on me. i'm 150lbs 5'5 34C so i usually have to wear a large. this was quite loose around the waist which would have been ok with a belt, but the top had too much room left. so it popped out a little near my underarms. might reorder in a smaller size"
3.0,Shirt is super nice but defeneitly size up on this shirt
3.0,When I opened the box the hats had been pushed down in the box.  The box was too small which resulted in the hat being misshaped.  The back of the hats was turn up and so was the front of the hats and nothing seems to work to change their shape back to where it should be.
3.0,"It is a very nice lightweight jacket, however, not true to size."
3.0,"I ordered this sweater in the blue.  Really pretty color and seems nicely made.  However when I put it on, it was way too heavy.  It felt like I was wearing a big blanket.  Plus, because of the weight of the hood, it kept slipping to the back.  Sending back - not for me"
3.0,I was a bit disappointed that the emblems are so tiny or miniature size. More for a child.
3.0,Way smaller than the size on the tag
3.0,"The dress wasn’t what I expected but it’s okay looking and very affordable so I’m keeping it.<br /><br />The dress is silky (polyester) and somewhat cheap looking material and the sleeves do not reach your wrist (it’s about 3/4 length sleeves), which I didn’t expect. You can see the material of the pockets on the stomach.<br /><br />I wasn’t impressed but I’ll keep it as a simple blue dress especially because it’s too much of a hassle to send back.<br /><br />It fit well even though the material isn’t very forgiving. I bought a large, I’m 170, 5’6 with a 34G-GG bust, 30 inch waist, and 42 inch hips.  I was pleasantly surprised that the large fit comfortably over my bust area and it wasn’t too tight."
3.0,Much smaller than I thought it would be. Well made. Great smaller pack though. Makes a good EDC.
3.0,"These are on the smaller size so if you’re big headed like me then they may look to small on your face. I’m not a big fan of the lenses. They just don’t seem to block the sun in the best way. I have another pair of glasses with quality lenses and the cut down the brightness but still maintain good color and clarity. These don’t do it very well but I do keep them in my glove box for when I forget my other glasses. They do block brightness I I use them, I forget my glasses a lot. And for the price I’m not worried about messing them up or losing them/ having them stolen when I leave my door unlocked."
3.0,"Its cute but not worth the cost.... maybe a $7 product tops! Packaging was smooshed, came in  nice little gift box but the box was all crumpled up."
3.0,I expected them to have more of a baggy fit but the elastic waist band makes it hard to achieve that trendy look. Aside from that they are very comfortable!
3.0,This brand is hit and miss. You either get a winner or a loser. This one is a loser.
3.0,In theory this is a great item.. But I find it to be too small.. This size is great for a preteen kid.. But for myself and my 12 yrs old not such a great fit.. If it were an inch bigger around it would be awesome . It also doesn't clip to smooth masls that don't have the pleats very well.. I just did a quick thread and knot to hold it on place so I can keep it attached to the mask..
3.0,"The red is dull, so I use a sharpie and changed each stone to black."
3.0,Finally arrived. These are very thin but will work when a face covering is required but don’t really offer any protection. Long shipping times.
3.0,"fit is good. fabric pills and attracts lint and anything else, like animal hair."
3.0,"Needs to be bigger , it ripped after a month"
3.0,"Gloves had a hole and I ended up not wearing them. Dress fit okay but a little big in the upper back area, but I'm only 5ft.<br />I didn't bother contacting Amazon or the seller. Everything else was fine, lots of compliments on the dress."
3.0,"Not intended for someone with a larger butt. I was really excited to get this, followed measurements but was salt disappointed. the material is not to thick so be careful putting it on I kinda of felt if i stretched it just as little it would rip. The bottom didn't even fit over half of my bum, ik it's not suppose to cover it all as it goes under the body suit but i couldn't even get the pants to even look good. Unfortunately the only thing i can probably use on this whole cosplay is the jacket and try to piece my own cosplay together.  😣😭 I don't have pictures to show as well, the cosplay did not fit and it did not have the coverage it was suppose to."
3.0,Not as attractive as I thought. I found wearing this watch uncomfortable.
3.0,"Feels like good quality and holds a decent amount of stuff.  The hook is small, which limits what you can hang it on.  The only thing I don't like is that the bag tips forward away from the wall when hanging so I feel like my taller items are going to fall out - they never have, but I would like it better if it didn't tip."
3.0,When ordering this item order a size larger to ensure a perfect fit! Because I am a seamstress I can adjust it too fit!
3.0,the shirt is really good quality. it does run big. it was almost like a t-shirt dress so i would size down but other than that it was great for my halloween costume.
3.0,I am a petite 5’3” weigh 120 lbs.  this tunic was too long for me.  The fit was very disappointing.  The color was nice.
3.0,cute but very skinny
3.0,I’ve purchased other tops from this brand that fit great. This one runs a little small.
3.0,"I love the watch. It’s very pretty with a large face. Easy to read. However, it has fallen off of my wrist twice. The clasp seems very loose."
3.0,"These earrings are small, but I like small. They are about a half inch (the gem itself). My main complaint is that the picture makes it look dark purple, which is what I wanted. It is almost clear. A very very pale lavender."
3.0,Very difficult to take off. Supposed to be stainless steel but Metal bothered my ears. Had to return.
3.0,"I really liked these rings, they fit better than any other silicone ring I had tried before. I was bummed today when after about 5 months of wearing them, the sunset ring split without getting caught on anything. The pink ones are fine, the sunset one was just much stiffer than the other two."
3.0,Nice watch but Roman numeral for six is actually four. Had to return.
3.0,I like to wear it but if I wear it for long periods of time my side will start to hurt me
3.0,"The waist and length of dress it perfect, but the shoulders and arms are 1-2 sizes too small for the dress size."
3.0,"This watch was so dainty and feminine, but ended up being just too small for my average size wrists."
3.0,Pretty but difficult to remove links
3.0,Beautiful but the gold spacer lose the color...
3.0,Very pretty well made dress however the sizing is extremely off. This dress was for my mother. She is 5’6” and 100 lbs soaking wet. She is normally a size 4 in a dress. We measured and ordered size 8 and still couldn’t zip it up.
3.0,"Item seems somewhat small,  had to give it to someone else."
3.0,"since i swim a lot in a lake, the color of the bracelet wore off, but it is still cute as just white!"
3.0,"Not bad, for use in Texas"
3.0,"The shoe part of these boots were great, they fit!  I was so excited!  Then I tried to zip them up.  Oh no!  I had measured my calf before I ordered the boots and I was good; but then, trying to zip them up--uh oh, not going to work.  I was within half an inch of success.  Back they went."
3.0,Cell apart 1st week on keychain
3.0,Cute hat. Runs a little small..
3.0,The style was very boxy so we returned it. My son is tall and thin. Looked foolish
3.0,Good wallet. Nothing &#34;WOW&#34; about it. Leather seems lightweight.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008656SP2 Legendary Whitetails Men's Mossy Oak Black Leather Billfold Wallet Black One size]]
3.0,"I bought this dress in this style from this company three times previously in different colors. Two of them were for me and another as a gift. I love my two dresses and wear them often. The fit is good. Both are best described as sort of a tee shirt material. This dress is the same style but is made of a softer, more slinky material which lies on the skin more than the others. I wasn't expecting that. I prefer more of a tee shirt look and feel. This dress is also too long and drags the floor; the others did not."
3.0,"I love this shirt but it's been my experience with under armour that they generally run a little small and or tight.  So I ordered an XXL thinking that fit perfectly.  No so, it is to big on me. I wish I would have ordered the XL. It would have been perfect."
3.0,The sparkle wears off faster than you'd expect for Stride Rite.  But...the kid loves them and says they're comfortable.  Just hold off on letting them wear them til special/dressy events IF you buy for that use. :)
3.0,It's way to loose.
3.0,Seemed to be made to look like it has lots of tears and holes in it
3.0,They ride too high at the waist
3.0,"I really like the zip up. It’s really comfy I wish it had pockets. After not even a full day of wearing it, the red stitching around the eyes started to become undone which was disappointing. Other than that it was pretty good."
3.0,"These don’t fit well at all, the waist gaps in the back and they are uncomfortable."
3.0,"I love the fit, but the waistband is cheap for what these cost. The thread on both pairs started to come out after the first wear."
3.0,The clasp for this bracelet was very small. It didn't stick out enough for me to even put the bracelet on myself. I really liked everything else about it.
3.0,"Was way too small for me; but it fit my 28 year old daughter perfectly and was very flattering. Were I to order it again, I would rather at least one size up maybe two."
3.0,It fit great except one of the arm holes was bigger than the other so I had to fix it myself.
3.0,Not enough structure for me.
3.0,Looks like costume jewelry. Kinda cheap looking.
3.0,Adjusting the band isn't as easy as it's made out to be.  I had to take it to a professional.  Also the pin keeps working itself loose and snags on everything.  I also have it in silver and that ones been good to me.
3.0,"Really loved these when I got them, unfortunately you have to bend the earring to make the opening bigger to put it in your ear. Eventually one of them was so weak it just broke :("
3.0,Fits small I have to add links to fit my neck
3.0,"A little see through, but cute and comfy with pockets. If you wear the correct underwear then it works, but you can still see the outline of my bra."
3.0,to large  my boyfriend says he wont wear it...
3.0,Weird material. Otherwise fits nice.
3.0,"Too big, I should have measured in millimeters the Cain."
3.0,I guess it fits as expected. It took me trying it on a second time to realize I didn't like it. The material is pretty thin. I waited too long and didn't get to return it. Sucks.
3.0,Reasonable size but can find one much more stylish for less at department stores on a sale day
3.0,"I was not expecting the necklace to be so huge - looks like costume jewelry. The earrings are nice but again, they look a bit cheap."
3.0,"Not what I expected. Wanted to return them but totally forgot to. Oh well, I have some new tanks to sleep in now."
3.0,So many compliments on this bag!!!
3.0,Fabric is nice lengths good. To small through stomach and hips
3.0,"The material is so soft, but it rips and runs easily."
3.0,"Super cute! Goes with nearly everything and I get loads of compliments on it.<br /><br />Update: bought in March, one of the strings has already broken (beginning of July). I haven’t worn it much thanks to quarantine, and I NEVER allow it to get wet. Pretty disappointed, since this is one of my favorites and I was excited to wear it out more."
3.0,Not as warm as I thought they would be. You can feel cold air getting through.
3.0,was ok. I ordered the black and white and they sent me the multi color. I was not pleased. My daughter liked them anyways
3.0,Nice fit but the seams have excess string hanging from them. Nothing that can't be fixed or easily trimmed off. The material is very lightweight and fitted. Perfect for a summer night out!
3.0,"They’re nice and soft, but I don’t feel warm in them like I was hoping to"
3.0,I liked the look of the belt but the extra small was too small for me but was the only size available at the time of the order.
3.0,It’s ok but not the best
3.0,OK ORDER LARGER THOUGH.
3.0,"Ok, somewhat does the job but they are ugly.  I'd rather have it cut straight rather than tight around the bottom. I'd rather have the bottom have a drawstring to tighten then. They will be more functional with most of types footwear and will look stylish. It can be worn in the city and outdoors too. The material is quite stiff and not breathable. Their kinda bulky and not as packable but they look semi waterproof."
3.0,I made sure to check the size chart before I bought this item but it was still far to big. I ended up giving them to my sister in law (shes got big feet lol)and she seriously loves them. I really hope the seller updates their size chart so this doesn't happen to anyone else.
3.0,True to size. I'm usually a medium in shirts and the medium fit perfectly. I got the light blue one and put a white strapless bra on underneath and it is really see through so I will be returning it. I'm super bummed because it is a super cute top.
3.0,Looked nice but because the whole back of the band is clasps they kept getting snagged and opening the watch. Unfortunately that meant my Fitbit eventually popped off and fell to the ground and cracked the screen. I'm back to the band that came with the Fitbit and searching for a screen repair.
3.0,"The material is very nice. I don't like the cord it came with, it's very thick, bends the piece and wrinkles it at those sections, and a little short for me in my costume. The product is also VERY flimsy and was difficult to unravel and pull apart enough to get it on. I'm planning to lay it over a cylinder shape and spray it with spray starch to make it easier to handle/put on as well as attaching a different cord to it."
3.0,"Made well, but to tight hard to get on and off"
3.0,"I love these shorts! So flattering, stretchy and comfortable, but these two lines disappointed me so much. Expensive shorts for this? Come on. It was also clearly already bought then returned once probably for the same reason. Ridiculous. The leggings are good tho!"
3.0,Sizing on this skirt is not a standard size as others that they sell. A xlarge in the blue skirt is truly a med/large (for me). Very cute and perfect for summer.
3.0,Loved it but too small.  Had to return.  Would recommend going up a size.
3.0,"I'm actually pregnant and ordered these for something to be comfortable in but also maybe use when i'm not pregnant. My biggest complaint is that they are not the material i thought, the grey ones i ordered are cloth/thick material not like the stretchy yoga material i was thinking. The thick material is hot and I don't imagine myself actually working out in these but they are good for lounging around the house."
3.0,They fit kinda big but still cute
3.0,"The pictures made this t-shirt look so cute! But, as tops go, it's average, at best. The hang feels a bit odd, and the color doesn't pop in real life like it does in the image. Also, with the hang and flow are a bit off, the length is a bit much.<br /><br />I have a feeling this will work well in the winter as the base of some kind of combo outfit. But, it's definitely not something I'd buy again."
3.0,"it was okay, had a hard time deciding but I went with the  BIADANI Women Open Front Lightweight Cardigan... instead.  funny because my friends said this cut was more flattering. lol  I thought it was heavier than the BIADANI"
3.0,"This makes a nice sleep/lounging dress. I would not wear it out of my yard. The material is soft and the color great, but it is too thin."
3.0,"When ordering, I read that this shirt usually fits small and to order a size up. I wish I hadn't. It fits pretty big. I may return it."
3.0,The hat runs way smaller than noted. It’s supposed to fit up to 22 7/8 “. I normally can just wear this size being a little tight. This was not the case. It sat on top of my head like a child’s hat. Another star was removed in regards to the packaging. The box was way to small causing the brim to be bent upward all around. There was no cushioning with in to protect the $100 hat. How callus and neglectful on the sellers part.
3.0,These are OK.  I only received 37 keychains of sneakers and 3 other rubber charms.  There only seems to be a few of the Nike keychains and the rest are other sneakers.  I wouldn't buy this again.  Its better to just order the type of sneakers you really want.
3.0,"I bought this in hopes to be able to wear this slim fit crewneck sweater to work. I normally wear fitted or slim fit tops. But when I received this item and tried it on, it was way too big! I bought a Large and this fit me like an XLarge. So sad, cause the material and feel is very good, it's just the sizing is all wrong."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, stunning look. Even though not true to size, it was wearable without being too noticeable about the size."
3.0,Decent watch.  Not very expensive so about what I expected.
3.0,The size was accurate however there was embroidery on the left chest that was not shown in the pictures
3.0,"Got these for my boyfriend and was disappointed that they didn't seem to make a difference with his type of color blindness. States there is a red outline to things but no change in colors he can't see( greens, blues, purples) he likes the frames though 😉"
3.0,"The charms were MUCH smaller than was shown in the picture (still an okayish size) and was a bit messed up on the actual bracelet part. Also, the bracelet was much too big for my wrist. Other than that, cute bracelet and came to me quickly."
3.0,It has a bit of an odd shape and does the material is a bit cheap. Wish I could return it.
3.0,"For a Halloween custome, it's Ok.<br />The hair sheds a lot......not sure it will last one or 2 seasons of us.<br />But for the price and the purpose of us, it's good."
3.0,"We bought this leotard for a halloween costume.  My daughter dances but can't use this color for class, so it will really be used a few times for the costume and that's it.  So, the leotard packaging said it was an Extra-small but the leotard itself said a small.  We actually liked it, but I would probably buy a size up in her normal dance class color to get a longer wear out of it, but I'm unsure if I would buy a small (and will a medium come) or was it packaged incorrectly.  Other than that, the quality is very nice."
3.0,it is quite red
3.0,"Very please with the quality, and style of the product, also they look very classic."
3.0,"Bought it as a workout shirt, I hope it shrinks a tad bit. Nice color"
3.0,"I’m a size 8/29 in pants and normally a medium or large in dresses.  I ordered this in an XL and it was too tight.  The material wasn’t as expected, it felt like a weird windbreaker material and there is no stretch at all.  I returned it because I wasn’t looking for a bodycon dress, but if it were true to size it would have been cute"
3.0,"El producto está muy bien, solo que la talla 32×30 viene muy reducido."
3.0,"This mask is way too small. I'm an adult male and I don't think I have a particularly large face but the straps are stretched to the limit which bends my ears uncomfortably. Otherwise it's perfectly fine, so I'd recommend it only for small-faced people."
3.0,"I like the look of this tee, but too small."
3.0,"Nice waych, but after 2 months have already had to replace the strap as a pin came out."
3.0,I'm only giving these three stars because the color is misleading in the pictures. They are a brassy gold color instead of the regular gold color I was looking for. Not sure if I'm going to keep them.
3.0,These pants run large.  I would never wear them outside.  More suitable for in home use.  Noty favorite purchase.  The fabric is thick and soft.  Maybe suitable for a homebound person.
3.0,Very hard to get on allow 20 minutes.:
3.0,"Love the color and fit of this turtleneck, but the material isn't my favorite. It's kind of thin and slinky, like how a workout tank top would feel. Because of that I wouldn't want to wear it without having either an extra layer underneath (like a flesh-colored tank top) or something on top like a sweater vest. Otherwise you'll definitely see the outline of your bra. It'll work for what I bought it for, but if I planned on wearing this by itself I definitely would have sent it back."
3.0,I like but was to small
3.0,There is only 3 not 12. I don’t get why in the description it says 12 piece?
3.0,"very comfortable, but the wires break after 2 months of use every time."
3.0,"This blouse came with a stain of deodorant in it, like it had been worn before, I was dissapointed at this. This blouse does run small, usually I wear a M/L, this one I ordered in xxl and it is kind of snuggle."
3.0,"The patches are of good quality it the fit is slightly awkward. Once unbottoned the buttons never really properly re-aligned or stayed stuck back together. The fit was correct based on size chart and actually length of my kiddo, so I think it’s just a quality issue. We got it specifically for a birthday party and it held up for that but I don’t expect to last very long unfortunately."
3.0,"I have Eagle Eyes glasses and when I compared both of these, I had to return this &#34;night view driving glasses&#34;,because they maintained  light brights and they are more heavy. Yes, you have to pay a little more for the original brand but the results are a good reason for do it"
3.0,I was planning to wear this when I workout but it didn't not stay on my head when I was just walking around my house. I wouldn't recommend if you want a non slip headband.
3.0,"Pretty snug for my 12 mo old, despite ordering 12-24mo. Also fabric feels cheap. I would definitely not consider this a replacement for sunscreen!"
3.0,Both pairs I bought came bent. Cute shoes though.
3.0,I like it but material is wrinkled and a bit thin.
3.0,Kinda seethrough
3.0,These were beautiful. Great craftsmanship. Just lovely. Unfortunately they were too small.
3.0,"Hard to write a review - Quality is great, used posted size chart by seller and definitely could have went a size down, but always worried things will run tight... But truthfully, this suit just did not flatter my shape at all!! I have curves - and this suit hid the curves and made me look like a thick block down the middle. Maybe partly from the extra material and partly the cut. I think if i was still 20 and didn't have my curves yet it would be really cute -"
3.0,One earring came with broken wings that my husband had to reattach. I for the life of me can't imagine how someone packing them for shipment didn't see it.
3.0,"I bought these a long time ago for a Halloween costume. I think if you’re strictly using this for a dress up type of simulation, this is a good buy. But if you’re trying to use it for real life looks..Don’t."
3.0,pretty but runs very small
3.0,bags are ok  but not as pictured. colors are way off
3.0,"I finally wore out my old laptop and had to purchase a new one, so I wondered if it would not be a good thing to get a new bag for my new laptop.  I decided to give this leather briefcase a try.  My judgment is that I will keep my old laptop case instead.  Why?<br /><br />Weight: Both the old case and the new briefcase weigh much the same at 3 lbs 3 ounces for my old case and 3 lbs 5 ounces for my new one.  But what can I carry in the case?<br /><br />Pockets, Zippered and Open: My old case has fivw zippered pockets and 4 open pockets. My new one has four zippered pockets and three open pockets with additional pockets for cards.<br /><br />Padding: Thick padding on each side of my laptop in my old case, but no padding at all in my new case. In addition, handles on the case are padded on my old case, and, again, no padding on my new case.<br /><br />Wear and Tear: Both cases appear to be brand new, but my old case is 12 years old. My new case is new.'<br /><br />My assessment is that padding for my laptop and padding on handles while I am carrying it around are very important to me, and the lack of padding will keep me using my old case."
3.0,A little too big but she loved it
3.0,Very nice gag gift but uncomfortable to wear. The faces are funny and they are several choices to pick. The voice activation is responsive
3.0,Fabric too thin for my preference.
3.0,"I really liked the bottom of the shirt in the picture, but the bottom of the actual shirt looks nothing like that. It's soft, and the top half fits perfect. But the bottom isn't long like the picture, and it's definitely not flowy."
3.0,"I have a closet full of Grace Karin clothing, because I love the retro styles. Tops, pants, shorts, etc. I have typically been thrilled with the quality, considering their prices. This particular top, I ordered in black & liked the flattering fit so much that I ordered it in white & green, as well. I am sorry to say that the quality of stitching on the green top did let me down this time! Within a few hours, as I was wearing it for the first time, I noticed that one arm felt quite loose where the elastic should cinch in (around the elbow) & sure enough, it was loose! It was loose because the stitches holding the elastic together had clearly come undone! So, a bit strange looking, I made it through the day. But now I am left with a shirt in need of mend (& I am not versed in such things, so an unwearable top it is now). I am extra sad because I never thought I would look good in green, but I have never received so many compliments in the few hours I got to wear it! So, my overall feelings are: it's a very flattering style (especially if you have a larger chest), I have thinner arms & would guess that the elasticized hem on the sleeves would be uncomfortable around larger arms, the ruched front panel is excellent for concealing a little excess tummy, BUT, please carefully check your elastic before you wear it! (I think if I had done some ""test stretching"" I would have seen the flaw & been able to return it)."
3.0,"Seems like a great product and idea, but the one size didn’t work for me. Too small."
3.0,"Bought and used for several months for hiking and bike riding.<br />I have found that the straps are not very comfortable when the pack is full and you ride for several hours, there is no padding it is simply a strap. now that being said, quality of the pack seems great, i have put it through its paces and has held up great, my only other gripe is the feed where your mouth piece is will leak if its not in an upright position, mine constantly drips making my back wet. but recommend if you like this look and want a cheap hydration pack that wont break the bank"
3.0,Nice but too big of frame for me
3.0,Great product but to Big.
3.0,"Really cute, but the earring backs did not fit"
3.0,I loved the way these fit. They were super cool and held in all the right places. What I could not get used to was the lack of an opening in the front. It was a drag to have to undress every time I went to the bathroom.
3.0,"It was not for me, a short 59 year old looking for a hassle free dress for casual wear. It went back. I am a 6 and the small was too small"
3.0,"I like the sandals, they are fairly comfy and good for around the house or pool. I am size 11 slightly wide foot and it is a big snug. Maybe 12 would of been better. Size 1 up if u can and like things a bit more loose."
3.0,Pouch too small....ness more room
3.0,"I liked the quality and sheerness of the shirt.  They arrived on time, but my excitement waned when I tried it on.  The item was labeled one size, but it was probably at least one size smaller."
3.0,"Nice but too large, returned."
3.0,"I ordered it thinking it was a pink dress, but the actual color is kind of peachy. Like other reviewers said, the cleavage was kind of a problem, especially if you have a larger chest. I had to pin it in place to keep from falling out. The dress was nice and looked nice in pictures. It was a good price as well. It was a bit large, considering I ordered a large and am a size 14.  I thought it would be a little more fitted."
3.0,I returned this item because the material was so itchy feeling.  It hung wrong in all the wrong places and would just irritate my skin.  It wasn't worth keeping and the white was a little sheer.
3.0,I used this product for plantar fasciitis. The cushioning at the heel is ok but the arc support is so firm that it becomes uncomfortable. The product does seem to help the pain to an extent.
3.0,The pants were a bit smaller than the other 3XLT pants I have from Russell.  They are also much shorter.
3.0,"For the price it was great. But onE chain fell off while simply walking around. Booo. Overall, I'd probably order another if I needed something similar."
3.0,This runs small and is not made for people with a chest
3.0,"i'm 5'3"" 110 lbs and a small was too small. My head could barely get through the hoodie. Tight in the shoulders and anticipate not being comfortable after washing. It was super comfy and too short in the torso, so I ordered up 2 sizes. Hoping the large will fit including expected shrinkage."
3.0,"1st one arrived with ink markings for buttons all down the front, requested an exchange at it also came with all the pen marks."
3.0,"Well it’s a shirt, so that’s what I bought it for.  Shrank after the first wash. So I would buy a size up. Also took a month to get to me."
3.0,"The charms and chain of this necklace are much larger than anticipated. Since it's a choker, everything layers very closely together, and combined with the extra shininess of the fake gold chains, it looks very costumey to me.<br /><br />I think it'd be fine for a child or teenager, but I don't think I'll wear it unfortunately."
3.0,I have these and I have only used the gold one. Beware it is INCREDIBLY hard to click and un-click. If you are a new septum piercing DO NOT BUY THESE. They will hurt to much if you have to click and un-click them. Having said that if you always have it clicked and never have to hide it these are super cute. Just beware of how hard they are to click and un-click
3.0,"Extremely cute, shipping was a bit slow"
3.0,"Loved the way it fit in the calf, nice and snug not big and baggy like most but the foot bed is very narrow and hurt my feet as soon as I put them on. So disappointed as it is so hard to find boot that aren't too big in the calf.  Had to return unfortunately."
3.0,This is a nice enough bag in design but it does not feel very quality due to the material they used. This leather polyester hybrid feels very cheap and while it may be durable seems like something you would give a young girl for a toy.<br /><br />It does have the requisite number of zipper and button pockets along with credit card holders aplenty.<br /><br />Functionally it seems like it would do quite well for someone looking for 1 purse / bag to take with them when trying to minimize bulk. If they would have chosen a better material I think I would have been more enthusiastic in my reception however the feel of it is a big turn-off. I'm not sure what the price point is on this item but if it's more than $10 I would probably pass.
3.0,"Purchased this for my 10 year old daughter. I find that this shirt runs a little on the small size! Also, this is the second one I have purchased for her (she grew out of the first one quickly due to the sizing issue), and I find the quality of the seams lacking! In this one and the first one the threads are coming out and I have had to repair them!"
3.0,I like this.  Looks great against a black top or dress.
3.0,"The shirt is a nice thick material, I ordered a medium, I feel it runs rather large. I’m almost 8 months pregnant and large chested and the shirt buttons no problem. I would suggest sizing down."
3.0,They are cute leggings and flattering.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous and it fits nice. The only downside is that it's not made for anyone taller than 5'5/5'6. I am very curvy and I'm 5'8 so no cigar for me. I wanted my dress to hit the floor but it lays right before my ankles and since it flares out a little and not closers to the body I don't particularly like that look. I wanted to wear it to the International Carnival in Chicago on August 18, 2017😭😢. My package came six days earlier than expected which was nice."
3.0,"I got size Large. Usually I wear size 6-8.Too big, too long, easy to see through."
3.0,"These retro-looking pretty blue sandals are too big for my feet.  I ordered a size 6 but upon receiving these, 6 is for the UK while these are really a size 8 for the US where I'm at.  My heel did not go to the sandal's heel which really ruins the effect.  I don't know if it's because this isn't my proper size, but the front of the top piece really dug into the top of my foot.  Perhaps once the sandal is 'broken in' that wouldn't be so bad; however, it could also be because of a poor fit.  I do like this size of heel with just a bit of lift but not truly high heel.  My rating is 3 stars because of the inaccuracy of the sizing and how the top piece digs into my foot."
3.0,Bulky and rubbed my leg when walking
3.0,"After about two weeks worth of wearing it to bed at night, the seam started to rip where the band connects to the bonnet itself. Not the best quality but for the price I guess it’s worth it."
3.0,"The case will definitely hold up and is on the study side. The polarized lens is not as reflective as the RIVBOS equivalent, this product has a more tinted aspect than polarized attribute. Unlike the RIVBOS case, this case has foam padding between the actual sunglasses and each spare lens. This does make the case bulky, but the shape is stable. Also, there is not any lettering on the lens like on other brands. If this product had fit me, I would have used these as my work sunglasses. I do not want to promote brands while at work. It fits best on people with small foreheads and large cheeks. Do not get these if you like your sunglasses to fit like goggles.<br /><br />I have average set cheekbones, a bit on the high side, and have lost all of my baby fat. The grip on the top pushed the sunglasses farther away from my face, increasing the already large gap between the bottom edge of the lens and the cheekbones. I ended up giving them away.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No lettering<br />- Extra padding between spare lenses<br />- Sturdy lens mounting mechanism<br />- Case could be used for something else<br />- Can be used as a gift<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Only fits specific face types (fat cheeks and small browbones)<br />- Polarized lens is not as reflective as RIVBOS"
3.0,Not clear how to add name/address.
3.0,"Satisfied with the glasses except that one is missing  a silicone/rubber? nosepiece.  Therefore, they are not useable - otherwise, they seem to be of good quality and well-made."
3.0,"Purchased this for myself to get ready in before my wedding. Wish I had purchased the same gowns that I had for my bridesmaids as theirs were super soft. The price on this one was unbeatable and I needed it quickly, so I was glad it was available with Prime. The fit was as expected and the material was very synthetic and almost sticky feeling. It does what you need it to, but could be a better material."
3.0,The tulle ripped after the first wear. The top red is faded. Over all it got a lot of compliments. Just wished it was made a little better.
3.0,Some pieces falling off
3.0,The product is small. It looks like a junior size.
3.0,"I am a huge fan of the wrap dress because they are casual but office appropriate, almost universally flattering and comfortable.  When i opened the package i loved the print, the fabric and apparent style until i put it on.  It has a strange cut, highly clingy like a sexy dress, not like an office appropriate one.  It was glued to my hips and butt (i am 5'1"" and 110 lbs, usually wear between an xxs and xs, ordered xs).  Sadly i'm returning but if you are a woman with very narrow hips, this could work for you and it is definitely pretty.  Also i struggled to make the bottom hem hang straight after wrapping."
3.0,"The skirt was asymmetrical which was weird to me. It wasn’t just a “front is shorter than the back” situation, it was also left side higher than right side? But not on purpose? I returned it. The material was also more casual than I needed."
3.0,"I like the fit of the dress. But I was disappointed it was heathered like it the pics. I ordered the pink and it’s just a plain medium pink, but I do like the fit. I bought xl. I’m short, chubby, 4’10 but very busty. It fits great."
3.0,I am 8 months pregnant. This is an okay dress. It was just too long and cheap material. In my opinion it didn't feel like it was worth 30$. It felt like a 15$ material dress :///
3.0,Would have liked a fancier buckle.
3.0,"Wish I could rate this higher bc it’s really cute, but the pendant part broke off the same day I got it. Easy fix with a round jewelry pendant though. The chain is similar to that of a dog tag, I got another, thinner chain and it looked so much better. So after these modifications, I gave it as a gift and they loved it."
3.0,"These are made well, the colors are bright and fun.  They are a little smaller than the size should be, but they are fine.  I'd probably order 1 size larger if I were to buy them again, but they are fine."
3.0,Didn't love this. Fit a bit smaller than size. Has holes in the suit underneath the breasts for what I am not sure. And the pads in the breast cups kept moving and falling out.
3.0,good quality worth the $$
3.0,I bought these because the description says zipper pockets.  They arrived and didn't have zipper pocket.  Returned them and will look for something better.
3.0,"It seems needlessly complicated. The hands often cover parts of the display, making anything under them hard to see. The watch beeps every hour, which I hate, and haven't yet figured out how to disable that feature (or if it's even possible). Other than those two problems, it's an alright watch - though it does get messy underneath it from sweat, but it's rubber, so there's no getting around that."
3.0,"Chain fell off after 1week of use , claps don’t stay snapped"
3.0,"It fits as expected, it is thin. My only dislike is the colors in the blouse isn’t as vibrant as the pictures and that was the reason I purchased it."
3.0,"I’m 5’3,I ordered the XL to have a baggy fit, I really loved this and for the price how could you not. I’m giving it 3 stars because after the third wash the came apart. I tired sleeping it on but the little plastic part on the  opposite side it gone.I’m going to try and take it to my local  seamstress to see it it can be fixed"
3.0,"This key is NOT made out of pewter--if they can prove it is, I'll eat it (which wouldnt be really hard as it is soft plastic) It does, however, LOOK a lot like pewter and is pretty. I put it on a black cotton string and it looks nice. It is very casual jewelry piece (for the price!), but, yes, I would prob buy it again (been looking for a womans' Viking key necklace)"
3.0,Quality was fine just larger than expected
3.0,Nice causal wear. I purchased this shirt for my husband. I would recommend this this shirt. My husband loved it.
3.0,Material tugged across the shoulders
3.0,"I ordered a size 8 and its a beautiful dress. It looks as elegant as the picture, however the belt is awful. Unless you have a zero size waist the ends do not meet. You end up with the rope along the back and it doesn't stay tied. My husband did a fancy knot on it so it would stop coming open and after 30 minutes it busted off the clip part that the rope attaches to."
3.0,Beautiful but the size is for kids
3.0,"This bottom may fit you better than it fit me, but I had an unflattering fit in my opinion. It had a very ""wedgie"" fit and did not sit on the body like a Brazilian thong bikini."
3.0,real comfortable but i ordered an XL and got an XL but it fits like a 3XL
3.0,Like to Shoe but a little disappointed the color wasn't the same when I got
3.0,I would go up a size in this one. I ordered a XL. The outfit fit but I may have gone up a size for more room.
3.0,"They aren't really what I expected,  but very unique and cute!!<br />After an hour of wearing , feet hurt so bad and I wear heels a lot ....these were made for looks..."
3.0,"The hat is very nice quality.  For me, it fits a bit small and tight, and being in Las Vegas, I may need a wider brim.  But certainly the hat is fine and there is nothing wrong with it.  I will keep it around."
3.0,the anti skid material falls off after only one or two washings.  Socks tend to fall down at the heel.  Stretch out of shape very quickly.
3.0,Very cute - but much SMALLER than expected.  My fault for forgetting to look at the dimensions.  Kind of pricey for the size.
3.0,Not so good quality. Ended up returning it. Was very difficult to put on take off
3.0,"My boobs are tiny but the small size in this bra is uncomfortably tight. The measurement around my ribcage is 29"" which I have always thought is on the large side, especially as compared to my boobs."
3.0,Beautiful Quality but very small! I ordered a size bigger and it was still very tight in the bust. So busty ladies beware
3.0,"I ordered a size L (my usual in swimwear) but only certain parts fit. The top and shorts were true to size but the bikini bottoms fit like 2 sizes too small. However, the color was nice and bright though and accurate to the pictures posted!!!!<br /><br />Overall, the style didn't sit well on my petite frame, maybe will do better on slimmer taller ladies...."
3.0,"beautiful look, but sadly the chain broke the second time wearing it."
3.0,"Cheap, lo quality"
3.0,"They are very pretty, but not as pink as what I was hoping for.  I’m not sure what I’ll wear them with."
3.0,"This hat is so cute, but it really is small and the pom poms are hard to position where you want."
3.0,It was cute and the bottom fit great but the top was way to Small and the material was a little cheap.
3.0,Meh. Not that shapely but good as that extra layer you throw on at home.
3.0,"cute dress, runs small"
3.0,Not something I will wear alot as it is hard to get on and off by yourself.
3.0,Nice cotton material.  I'm 5 ft tall so a little too long for me.
3.0,"It’s been a couple months now and I like them. They are better than an other pair I ordered.<br />Pro: lint doesn’t stick to these very easily, nice pocket, nice color, fits my iPhone 7 Plus<br />Con: feel like these are a little too tall to where it’s slightly uncomfortable"
3.0,Love these. Can wear at work. Wish they had black.
3.0,Love the fabric. Was on the small side but wearable. Just not the loose flowing type I prefer. Washes beautifulky
3.0,"The face of this watch is HUGE.  It is definitely a man's size watch - you won't like it if you are a woman or if it is for a boy.  I bought it for my 11 year old son, and it's uncomfortably large.  It functions well, though.  We have no problem with how it runs."
3.0,The color was a little different than I expected but still pretty.
3.0,"These do work for holding your glasses up, but the hooks that go around your ears are to long[ I thought that would be a good thing] and can dig quite painfully into the backs of your ears"
3.0,This belt is ok.  I wish the pictures showed the hooks better. I don't care for these as they don't like to allow the clasp to sit flat. You get what you pay for I guess. I also now know that I wanted a 4 inch wide belt. Oh well. It'll still get some wear.
3.0,"I sized up to an XL, I’m a 12/14 US pants size, or a Large in bottoms...these were still too small!! I would size up twice!! They are comfy though 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"Adorable decoration! But, extremely hard. Not much flavor. Break easily and overpriced."
3.0,The necklace is well made but the orange is definitely not as bright as the pic on the website. The stones live upto the image. Its an ok buy for the price.
3.0,"Leather is not that nice. And its quite big, too much for my taste"
3.0,A little bulky. Its tough to have in your back packet/mostly bc of the airtag. The money clip works great which is suprising. Theres more than enough pockets for whatever i only use 1/4 of them. All in all if you have a lot of stuff you keep in your wallet this is a great wallet but if your more bare bones you can probably find something slimmer
3.0,"These were nice quality and had good support, but they were way too long on my leg, so I had to return them."
3.0,It doesn’t handle the neck flap well when it’s not down. It doesn’t roll up and hide. You sort of have to bunch it up inside and then it makes the hat size smaller than what it is with the flap out. It’s OK if you are going to wear it all the time with the flap out. It’s very not OK if you want to roll it up.
3.0,It's not flattering at all.
3.0,"So you HAVE to use the markers that come with these AND don't get the marker that is provided on a traditional white board surface it's not easily removed.  I wanted to use them for my white board a stickers, they're not a good solution for that."
3.0,It came broken and it looks cheap...
3.0,"I liked that it had pockets!  But, because it was so large (I ordered a medium) it was not attractive on me.  Could be great for lounging inside the house."
3.0,"I don't care for this dress; while it has a flattering fit (I'm hourglass shape) its way too thin. The material feels cheap and stiff, and easily wrinkles. No stretch in the fabric makes moving my arms/shoulders difficult. Unfortunately not my thing."
3.0,Too small and see through fabric.  I returned.
3.0,"It’s okay. The fabric was nice, but all the material around the elastic near the neck was not very flattering."
3.0,Fabric was too itchy for me. Seams were itchy as well. I returned.
3.0,The bottoms fit more &#34;cheeky&#34; than shown on the model.
3.0,Sizing was petite but not weight proportional
3.0,I’m Satisfied with the item but it took nine days to receive it after ordering I think that’s a little ridiculous
3.0,Did not like the way they fit my head.
3.0,"Looks good, but a bit flimsier than expected. Feels like a plastic material."
3.0,"For the price, good deal"
3.0,"We thought these were exactly what we were looking for. My daughter loves all things pink and sparkly. However, unless your child is wearing these shoes to walk slowly and sit quietly in a chair all day- they are not very good quality. Most of the gems and glitter are worn off. Gems started falling off the first day. Didn't stop her from wearing them. I haven't really said anything because she still wears them- but it's only been a month. They look terrible."
3.0,This is a super cute suit that appears to be made well. I order up a size after reading the reviews and it was still way too small. I am 5 foot 8 inches tall and 150 lbs. I normally wear a size 10 in most things. I order a 12. The tops almost strangled me. It was soooo tight. It's a really cute suit but is just made incredibly small.
3.0,"At 1st I didn't get my 2 orders but I contacted the seller and they sent out my replacement masks right away and I got them about 2 weeks later. I love these masks because they are comfy and have the metal nose strip too so it was ok that they came late. Thank you for fixing my issue right away, I will order from here again because of the customer service😊"
3.0,"Beautiful ring, fits well."
3.0,"This is ok, nothing fancy but not bad for the price. I would say definitely for a younger child because the material is somewhat cheap and tacky. Like I said not super horrible tho"
3.0,"It definitely doesn't look like it does in the picture, the slit is in the middle and it's all one piece. And was also too baggy on me."
3.0,"Small but very nice design. Color was nice. I returned it and ordered another bag, Ili 6333. I've had one of these in a tan color for a few years and like it a lot. Love not needing a wallet. Ordered in merlot this time."
3.0,"The temperature in my neighborhood frequently hits 100+ degrees Fahrenheit during the summer, so I thought this shirt would be appropriate attire. Unfortunately, it's bit more uncomfortable than I expected. Putting on the shirt was not a simple slip-on. The shirt's bottom opening is not particularly elastic, so it does not stretch much, which makes putting on the shirt a bit inconvenient. Also, the material is not as airy as I had hoped. The cotton material is ruffled up, particularly after a wash, so it creates a somewhat thick, insulated feel. Lastly, this shirt does not feel great when you're actually sweating (no shirt really does), but I thought the wicking action would be more effective than a regular t-shirt (it's actually worse, and the moisture/liquid really collects and pulls you down).<br /><br />Sizing is not bad though...I am about 5'10"" and 165 lb, and the shirt fits decently (when I am able to get it on properly)."
3.0,i ordered two of these in different color and this one came much smaller than the teal one i bought.
3.0,It's not cut to fit like the photo implies.Zipper is very cheaply made.And it's just not what I expected
3.0,"Although these were lightweight, they didnt feel sturdy and the frames were smaller than I expected. I ended up giving them to a co-worker."
3.0,Love the colour but it ran a bit too large
3.0,I ordered the white floral and it is super see through. I will be returning
3.0,"My wife really wanted this dress because it looked pretty in pictures. The dress is actually pretty, unfortunately it’s very, VERY sheer...... like you can see everything sheer. She’s gonna have to spend more money to get a slip sewed in since there absolutely no second layer at all."
3.0,"Quality is good, but it was a little too wide for the wallet that I wanted to use it in."
3.0,"Its a beautiful ring, but the stone doesnt shine as much as the little ones... it seems blurry... bit disapointed..."
3.0,"Updated. I'm 5ft, close to 200 lbs and bought an XL. It's a perfect fit. Not too loose and not tight. However, after awhile it shrunk and little pieces of lint clinged to it and I can't get it off."
3.0,Still pretty but not like the pictures. Fades and turns black after a few months of wearing it
3.0,"I am a little disappointed in the material, but overall i am okay with the purchase."
3.0,They do no fit true to size!! I like the quality of shirt but recommended ordering the next size bigger!! No other complaints at this time!! Once my return is credited I will order the next size bigger and go from there!!
3.0,"I’ve had these for a few months now and feel I can give an honest review. I really like the fit, they are a true hipster and only come up right above the hip bones. The colors are vibrant, no fading from washing, maintained shape well, no strings coming loose or falling apart. I only gave 3 stars because of the smell, I’m assuming it’s the spandex/stretchy material, it’s like a rubber smell and I noticed it while folding laundry, none of the other clothes have that smell but these underwear so I know it’s not anything else. I have not had any skin reactions from it but it has gotten worse as the months have went by, so they were great at first and still wear wonderfully but I can’t get past the rubber smell anymore."
3.0,I'm a bit small but not that small in between small and medium... it's cute and there's a white stain on it... Going to use it as a motivational purposes.
3.0,"Super cute but I had to return it for a bigger size. I'm 5'8"" and the small was too short on my sleeves and torso."
3.0,"Bought it for me, I’m a medium, it was too big but it was very pretty so I gave it to a friend and it fit her. I’m 5’3” and usually wear medium."
3.0,"Necklace doesn't have clasp. Unless you have a very, very small head, it will not be possible to get the double layer design that is in the product image. I may return."
3.0,Made and shipped from China.  Seems are uneven.  Still cute non the less.  A very non-forgivable fabric.  No stretch.  Not sure how it will wash up.
3.0,Fits as expected. For being a Spongebob shoe you would think it had some Spongebob reference besides underneath on the soul.
3.0,"Nice, but paint on rose was slightly chipped and had come off."
3.0,"I bought a pair of 8.5 mil. of ELR90E-01 White round pearl earrings for myself for this Christmas. After only wearing them a few days, one was missing. I lost it but no idea where. The clasp obviously opened too easily. I have worn this type of earring closing mechanism for years without losing any even at night during sleep. Perhaps this was a lemon, an exception to the usual standards, still I am disappointed."
3.0,They feel somewhat cheap but fit ok and have lasted a few months now
3.0,I thought the emblem was sewn on. Instead it is a cheap looking iron on. I won’t wear into my Legion Post 311
3.0,"These work fine. Just like all the others, they get distorted in my wallet. Maybe I need a better wallet."
3.0,"First, the quality is good, fabric thick - should last until the wedding I'm attending May 4th (may the force be with you, get it?) However, my mistake, but I didn't realize until it arrived that I only was buying the bolero. Silly me, I thought it came with the belt and the tulle skirt. Live and learn, my friends. Live and learn!"
3.0,It's beautiful but not sturdy. It will break easy
3.0,"Waited weeks and was patient with delays for this product, but was disappointed with the dress"
3.0,VERY lightweight--- there is no way it would have ever sold for $400+ as the site indicated.
3.0,This is not for me.  I've been wearing VS for as long as I can remember.  Their prices are sky high so I figured let me see what else is out there.  The material is soft and stretchy.  I usually wear 38C and without the extender it wouldn't have fit.  With the extender on the last hook it does fit.  There is a lining to the cups which is removable.<br /><br />The issue for me is where there would be a wire the bra folds in and under.  It is not comfortable having the material fold in and press on my stomach.  With underwire bras the wire is pressing in the same area but doesn't fold in.  I think if you aren't large chested I think this would be very comfortable but for someone who larger chested it is not ideal.  I'm happy with the extender though.  I will use that on my other bras.
3.0,It will fit your laptop but not much more
3.0,"Nice pants, but I look silly in them"
3.0,"The jacket is really cute, but it's definitely not a rain coat. If it's raining, it will not keep you dry. I brought it with me on a rainy day and had to buy another rain coat to replace it so I wouldn't get wet. It was bad. My skin, clothes and hair got wet while I was wearing it."
3.0,I loved the stickers and the hat. But i wish the hat said academia not academy. Overall im happy with the purchase.
3.0,Nice quality for the money but returned because they are WAY TOO long…I am 5’4”
3.0,"Pretty color and fabric, but just doesn't look right. I'll be sending it back unfortunately."
3.0,The Green ballerina tutu piece was off loose in the package so I can only use 9 instead of  the10 that I paid for.
3.0,This dress was way to large in the bust so there was a lot of gaping. I got a large and am a 34B
3.0,Drags in the floor by about 2 inches!  Runs big as well. I’ll have to cut it off and hem it!
3.0,It's a great quality dress. However it runs probably 2 or 3 sizes to small.
3.0,"To be fair, I never got as far as trying on this dress. I could see immediately that is not the color I expected. In the picture it looks teal; in reality it was a bright, almost neon, turquoise. That color does not work for me. It might be perfect for someone else."
3.0,"These earrings are super cute! However, our favorite color gummy bear is lime green and it came with brownish material stuck in the resin. (See photo.) We’ll have to return the set. 😢"
3.0,The pants are cute and nice material but ran small.  I ordered large and felt tight to get around waistband.
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this jacket.  I loved the navy blue color, the quality and material were spot on.  And, the zippered pockets are great!  Per the other reviewers, I decided to order a large, even though I usually wear a medium.  Although it was slightly big through the shoulders, and that is something I could live with, it was very snug around the hips and gave me a very strange looking profile when zipped up.  So, if you are straight up and down, it will fit well.  Otherwise, you might have to look elsewhere.  I had to return it.  Just for reference, I am 5’7” and 155 lbs."
3.0,Didn't feel like cotton. Made my feet itch. Did not like the socks.
3.0,This swimsuit comes as pictured. The quality is good and was delivered quickly. I did find that the bottom ran a bit small but the top was fine. Because I could not get different sizes for the bottom than the top I had to return. I am 5'5 and 120lbs.
3.0,"I was worried how the top but fit size wise, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it fit. However, I'm not used to this material and the bottoms felt like a diaper and gaped around the leg openings. I'm interested to see how the material will react when wet"
3.0,"Stone and metal wrapping the stone, very nice.  Super cheap chain necklace."
3.0,Larger than expected.  My fitted hat size is 7-7 1/8 and it was too big for me.
3.0,Well I think I should have read more reviews before ordering this &#34;dress&#34; lol. It is in no way a dress. It's super thin material and see through. It looks good over leggings and under something else but not a stand alone item. The finger holes are too far up and not wide enough to use.
3.0,"Its a  great material but made for such a short torso or maybe just no butt. Either or, its wee bit tight. I may just have a giant butt :("
3.0,All the charms were in a weird spot on the bracelet. Cute and came in on time. Nice stocking stuffer
3.0,I have always loves these simple crew neck sweaters. Instant classic. One word of warning - I'm 6' 180 lbs with a 40 tall jacket and I'm absolutely swimming the large size I bought.<br /><br />Will buy again but ill go for a medium next time.
3.0,The eye holes are cool but too far apart to actually use.
3.0,I bought the watch because it was inexpensive and the red band was appealing.  the quality could not compare to the IBSO watches I have purchased
3.0,"Well, this item is deceiving in size when viewing it online. It is too large for cats and some small dogs. The light isn't bad on the red and the white is brightest. However the blue lacks in brightness. I first thought the size would have been closer to a marble(boulder)but is more like twice the size of a large marble."
3.0,"This top is cute but its just too short (i'm 5'10 and thin), probably fine for petite ppl..."
3.0,These faded quickly!  Really wish they were made of better material!!
3.0,"Color says BLUE, but I t was GREEN."
3.0,The sick is not very thick for warmth. One of them frayed at the top on the first wash.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, very cheap looking material and cut"
3.0,First time I washed it it had a big snag in the back
3.0,The magent will demagnetize your debit/credit cards
3.0,"Well....these are not leggings by my definition.  They are thick, fleece-lines tights, which my sensitive daughter refuses to wear."
3.0,I won't bother returning this one because it's so cheap.  One of the zippers is faulty and I fear if it gets too much stuff inside it may rip.
3.0,"It's a nice rings for the money, even though it's obviously an import, but the sizing chart is wrong. I wear a 10.5 and ordered a 10. It's a loose fit. I measured the ring on a ring sizer and it's an 11."
3.0,"The size was as expected, shoulders and sleeves fit great, but if you are a fit guy you will wish it was a bit slimmer.  Also was not that deep of black color and almost sees fitted. Luckily I wasn't expecting much from a cheap shirt."
3.0,"Adorable at first look, the maroon color is vibrant, the material is soft but the socks came in very noticable difference."
3.0,should have picked a better color to match my bags.
3.0,"When I bought this I thought it was a dress, but it’s a two piece. I am a 34D/36C and the top fit a little tight for a medium. The bottom skirt is at knees length."
3.0,Leggings fits great and the colors are exactly what is shown in the pictures. However the first time I put on a pare they got a huge run (like you would see on nylons) so that was disappointing.. still comfy and warm
3.0,"Edges of gauges are a size larger than the actual plug and caused some discomfort to my friend I bought them for. She said she'd rather not wear them, as taking them in and out was painful."
3.0,Nice Jacket feels a little thin.
3.0,"I'm pear shaped and these were tight at the thighs and way too big at the top.  I'm 36/20/40, ordered M. They run big, I'd go a size smaller.  I'll have to donate these bc they look silly on me.  Soft and thick material"
3.0,This looks nice but it’s hard to put on and is itchy!
3.0,I am 5ft tall. And 137 pounds I ordered the medium. The cups squish down my boobs and it seems too short for my torso. I originally purchased to wear as a body suit but it doesnt fit right to even do that .
3.0,"It is a cute tutu and fit just fine. Made the mistake of tossing it in the wash with laundry and most of the stars came off and stuck to the rest of the clothes. Definitely needs to be hand washed. However, my 3 year old daughter did love it and enjoyed wearing it."
3.0,"Runs small, but is a very nice belt, I can’t use it because it is so small, order a xl fits like a medium"
3.0,"The color and style on the model are accurate. The fabric is stretchy, however, so the skirt wasn't flattering on me. It might work with shape wear or something like that to tighten up the stomach and hips."
3.0,Band fell off first time I wore it. Glued back on.
3.0,looks big but maybe it will be fine
3.0,A bit to. Snug
3.0,It was too big and long.
3.0,Yet another fun hat that I have to give to my teenager. It's small
3.0,"It came and fit as expected.  However, it's more of a slinky material (I am looking for something more cotton) and the print, although cute, looked weird because where the center of the flower is located looked not right on my backside / butt area."
3.0,"This wallet claims to fit a phone, I have an iPhone 6s Plus it does not! Also, the zippers are cheap. I regret this purchase for the fact if it doesn’t fit a phone. Now I just have a large wallet."
3.0,"I am so disappointed. I purchased the Easel tunic in black size S at a boutique over a year ago. I wear it all of the time. It hits at my mid-thigh (I'm 5' 5.5&#34;), which is great, since I can use it to extend sweaters and tunics or wear as is with skinny jeans and a long cardigan. I was excited to find these on Amazon, and purchased the gray size S. The fit is slightly boxier and definitely shorter than the black I have. The ruffles fall across my hips. The same goes for the long sleeve tunics. It does not look terrible, but it is not terribly flattering, and I wanted a longer fit like I already have and similar to the models."
3.0,I loved the style of these pants especially the pockets. Unfortunately the came apart during the first wear.
3.0,The iridescent starts to peal off after just a few wears
3.0,"Not true to size.I moved the buttons to fit,but pretty warm."
3.0,"The bottom of the shoe won’t last long,started to smooth out in 1.5 months."
3.0,Not a good fit for a short girl. I am 5&#34;3 and it was too long. This is made to fit tall girl with no curves. Not good for hour glass figures as there is no room for hips. Straight narrow cut.  It's cute if you're a tall skinny model!
3.0,Es muy pequeño en este modelo Porq ordene otro de la misma marca y esa si me qda bien
3.0,"so my hat size is about 7 3/8. With this hat, I had to take in the adjustment on the back quite a lot so it will fit a really big head! I like the color and I like the open mesh so I hope it gets some air flow. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't so darn big!"
3.0,One of the screw drivers that came with bands was completely stripped.
3.0,These are more like tights than pants.
3.0,I'm not sure what 3xl person this was fitting but certainly not this girl. I bought 3xl for the baggyness but sadly I could barely button up the sides of the overalls.
3.0,End of the feather poke my finger & it hurts.
3.0,"They leave a mark on ur wrist if wear it to long, but they are still good"
3.0,"A great pair of cycling gloves should protect your hand, keep it from falling asleep and feel comfortable for long rides.  These gloves run small, the XL size I have is constraining and compresses my hand making it stiffer and harder to grip the handlebars.  The opening at the bottom is narrow, with limited expansion via a Velcro strap.  If you are considering, suggest thinking about going a size up to get a good fit.<br /><br />The gloves are well padded in the palm and the padding is stiff which is good, but it also gives the gloves a plastic feel.  There is plastic type webbing on the back and the sleeve material is a black nylon.  These gloves did not breath particularly well for me, leaving my hands feeling wet, compressed and clammy.<br /><br />I would suggest considering a number of different options, I still like my Specialized and Per Izumi pairs that work well, but are getting a little worn out."
3.0,Only thing I dont like is that the inside is thin and not soft which makes it not so warm.
3.0,"Great idea, but the product itself won't stay in place and bunches up. I think it needs to be a little bit bigger and have more ways to secure it in place."
3.0,Not very high quality but cute if you need a top for a photoshoot that you won’t need again
3.0,Good jacket for fancying up some of my outfits I wear normally. Also found out that it makes a good Captain Jack Harkness jacket.
3.0,"It's lovely but really tiny!  It's a gift for a nine-year-old girl but I'm sort of embarrassed that it's SO small. Also, I would have appreciated a box instead of a tiny plastic ziploc bag."
3.0,"Love this belt. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because after only wearing it twice the fake leather part is already peeling. It also comes unhooked all the time. I have to constantly readjust it. For the price, it's a great fix to a last minute outfit. Next belt like this that I purchase will be one that connects without coming apart."
3.0,Great material. Feels great but USA size runs small.
3.0,Well made and good price but wouldn’t fit my husband who wears a large!  Gotta  be honest...but a bigger size if you want large!
3.0,Great purse. I ordered two of these and just opened the second one and there was no strap.
3.0,"Ive had this for a bit now and have used it fairly often. Mainly for the gym. The 2 complaints I have are the Velcro is already wearing out. So it will soon be unusable. It fits a little odd on my nose, kinda pushes down pretty hard. I can fix that issue by putting it to sit up higher but then it's right under my eyes which isnt much better.<br />TLDR; If you need something quick and affordable its fine, quality is ok."
3.0,"The price is great, but I wasn't thrilled with the dress. First, it needs a much thicker lining as the sequins is itchy. Second, I'm not sure how people think it's forgiving in the tummy area...I def looked pregnant and I'm not fat. I'm 4'11&#34;, 32C and 108 lbs. Lastly, the busy area is huge. My 32C couldn't fill out the Small or Medium size."
3.0,"My son is normally a size 13, I bought the size 1 thinking it was a good idea however it wasn't, the boots are way too big. It's best to order there exact size, however the inside of the boots feel really warm but they felt a bit on the heavy size."
3.0,I like the fabric but it is way too big. I had room enough for my husband too.
3.0,The sleeves are a nice long length but the shirt is kind of cheap and cut oddish.  It is super hard to tell the front from the back unless you put it on first. I did not return but I am not buying other colors. Definitely not worth the price and is not really warm enough for winter imo so its waiting for spring/fall
3.0,"I have to admit, this is partially on me. I have no idea what my chest measurement is, but this sizing chart is absurd .&#34;Small-Medium? Sure, I'm lean, but I've got a highlander's chest and I'm tall enough not to trust a robe that fits small,&#34; I thought. I went to the customer reviews and was assured by comments like, &#34;On-size was too small, size-up fits great.&#34; I ordered the L-XL size and was immediately worried when my invoice marked it was just &#34;XL&#34;. I tried it on and, sure enough, I was swimming in the thing.<br /><br />The material itself felt awesome, but there was no way around it. I had to return it. There were no exchanges available and, by the time my refund when through, the price went up. My advice: don't even begin contemplating the &#34;large&#34; unless you're some mix of ripped/pudgy. You won't fit."
3.0,"I really liked this dress. I did have to alter the back because there was so much material that it opened and it wasn’t fitted. My only issue is the size discrepancy.<br />I purchased a large in the blue and and extra large in black. The extra large was very tight and the large fit nicely but extremely long. I ended up buying the same size in the same color as well and the black fit a lot better and the blue was even longer than the original.<br />The sleeves also are pretty tight so be aware is you have chunky arms like I do.<br />Besides the sizing, I loved the dress. The inside was kind of like a brushed/fleece material and kept me decently warm on a dinner cruise.<br />My advice is to purchase different sizes because it’s so inconsistent."
3.0,"These shoes are adorable and form very well to my toddler's feet.  However, after only one week, the outside material started to wear off.  They don't hold up very well, and already look very worn down.  Has anyone else encountered this problem?"
3.0,"Looked cool for the 24hrs it was on my keychain. The metal it attaches to is so small that it broke off within the first 24hrs of having it on. Just checked my keychain and it was gone, no idea where it is."
3.0,"I loved this bracelet it was so pretty, 3 day of wear it broke. The company was prompt to solve the issue"
3.0,"It's pretty but it's a cheapo watch. The ad says the band is gray but it's actually nude colored. And I sat outside on a humid day and after 2 hours, a lot of condensation had built up behind the watch face and it won't dry out!!"
3.0,Used for Halloween pics- was super cute however tutu started to shred when washed once on light cycle
3.0,the top part was oversized but the waist is very small and not super stretchy on the hem. not impressed but it’s just a generic sweatshirt so no big deal.
3.0,Hurts my head. Too tight. Gives me a headache.
3.0,"As others have said it did come in a big knot, the chain is a recipe for disaster the way the individual chains lock and tangle together. It's a pretty necklace just not what I hoped for and far too long. It sits closer to the middle/ bottom of my ribcage which makes it impractical for daily wear.<br />Not terrible but not a winner either.<br />I hope they update the design because I really wanted to like it!"
3.0,"I have the fitted one and it fits small. I wish I’d known this prior to purchase as it fits tight. I can’t wear it more than an hour or it would cause a headache. Looks nice, but size is smaller than average."
3.0,"Night this fit my daughter's gizmo. Fits perfect but the dream came out after 4 days of use. Maybe it was just an error for the one I got, but makes me think twice about ordering from them again."
3.0,ok purchase
3.0,I returned it. The guard over the winding stem was missing
3.0,"fits my chest okay. its just a little shorter on the toros then i would have perfered.  may shrink in wash.  good for me to knock around at the gym, home, or  yard work."
3.0,The fit runs a bit small...but the product is of good quality
3.0,Comfortable just wish it was a little looser of a fit.
3.0,This is a cute bag to use for pins and keychains.  My only complaint is the strap length.  It is just a bit short to use as a cross body bag (which is useful at crowded conventions).
3.0,The underwear fit but the top can't reach no part of me
3.0,"These are really cute shoes and we get lots of compliments on them. BUT, the glitter falls of really easy and leaves bare spots. I have tried covering the bare spots with black marker, but the glitter just comes off in other spots so I would have to fill in the bald spots every day to keep up with it. For such expensive shoes, this is pretty disappointing. However, I did get them for a great price so I have not been that upset about the glitter. The shoes themselves are very nice and seem to be well made (other than the glitter of course). I do love the glittery shoe look (I mean really, who can pull off glittery shoes besides little girls?), so I will be looking for another pair, but hopefully the glitter will stay on them."
3.0,"Nice, not as big as I thought it'd be. And the buckles and zipper definitely look more gold than silver like they do in the picture."
3.0,"These were nice, but don’t look good on my ear. I felt like the clasp was kinda cheap and feel like it would easily open. I sent back."
3.0,It works great but should be larger. Feel they are a little small.
3.0,Jacquard Black fabric is very scratchy.
3.0,"I was expecting better quality but you get what you pay for. Those pants look like pajamas. Moreover the color is dull. I don’t recommend them. However, they are comfortable."
3.0,I am short waisted and this was too clingy and too long - would fit better on a tall person.  Also sleeves were way too long - returned it.
3.0,I have big calves so these were too small
3.0,I like it but it is definately cheap feeling
3.0,"Bought these for my husband. They are cute, but are very big on his face. He’s not a petite guy or anything, they are just a little on the large side. Would’ve liked them better if they were more the size of regular wayfarers."
3.0,I ordered my 8 year old daughter a size 7/8 and it fit like a 6. I again ordered a 9/10 size because it was so cute. It fits like a size 7. The sizing is definitely off. I am keeping the size 9/10 because I don't have time to order another one as we leave for a tropical trip in 2 weeks. It's cute but order 2-3 sizes up.
3.0,Light weight..... but nice n cute
3.0,"...of decent quality overall. But before you buy, magnify the image of the cap emblem. Upon closer inspection, the emblem is a bit &#34;blurred&#34;. This is not from it being a poor quality picture of the item, but the stitching design really IS that blurry. Not a lot of time and effort was spent on the state emblem design. While it looks decent from a distance, closer inspection will likely leave one feeling &#34;eh&#34;."
3.0,Very nice but a little snug.
3.0,"Very cute; however, they colors aren’t very vivid. Have to look closely to see what they are."
3.0,Loved the hat but was WAY TO LARGE for my head.
3.0,Didn’t like the draw string never stayed<br />Closed!!! And i didn’t care for the shape<br />And I am a big Vera Bradley fan!!
3.0,"I got this for my hubby. His loves the olive green color but it's a little small. The next size would be way too big though. The wrist holes are pretty tight, and the hood is really small, it barely covers the top of his head. He wants to keep it as a backup. I'm sure it would cost more to send it back than it's worth to try the next size up."
3.0,"The top of the bikini was a little awkward. The middle part would make my chest look really weird. It wasn't that flattering. However, the bottom piece is comfortable."
3.0,I like the look. They are a bit warmer than I thought they would be. They should be a little more breathable I think ty
3.0,So beautiful! I love this band! Makes my smartwatch go from looking sporty to classy.  Perfect for me!<br />Update: I have begun to notice that this band catches on delicate materials. It has picked more shirts than I care to admit. I've even not worn my watch some days in certain outfits. It's such a pity because I get so many compliments and love the way it looks and fits.<br /><br />The little diamonds do sometimes catch on certain materials.  It will pick lace terribly.<br /><br />It seems well made but I do sometimes worry that it may not hold up for every day use because they seem to be linked in a delicate way.<br /><br />The color is a perfect match to my Samsung  Galaxy active rose pink smartwatch. I have gotten tons of compliments.
3.0,Cute but have a HORRIBLE odor at first. Had to keep them outside for the first 2-3 days.
3.0,"good quality,loved the color :-)"
3.0,"When I first put these on, I absolutely loved them. They are so comfortable and the color is so cute. I still like them a lot, but they do not stay on your body at all. I’m constantly pulling them up and trying to keep them from going down, they are even that loose. They just don’t stay up so I can’t use it for working out."
3.0,It fits nice the only bad thing is that it isn't an off the shoulder top as shown in the picture and which is why i ordered it to begin with.
3.0,"Way too small. I didn’t realize it was kids sizing. I was hoping for a large comfy sweater to wear with leggings for an xmas party. Soft material and nice quality though, just wish it would fit over my head......"
3.0,Unhappy with the material that the jacket is made of. It feels very cheap.
3.0,"Love the colour, material a bit flimsy but for the price point and everyday casual wear it works."
3.0,"I wish these were a little better. They seem to work fine, after some fiddling with it, but one of the fasteners doesn’t work and I’m no longer able to use one whole set of buckles because of that"
3.0,I had to return this product. I wear a size 6 and ordered a size 6. I couldn’t get them past my thighs. They are very slim in the waist. Cute shorts if they fit your body and they looked and felt like quality material. I may try to order a larger size.
3.0,Too small for my glasses...returned and account credited...extremely happy with prompt attention
3.0,"I’m really torn... I ordered a medium... I’m usually a medium bottom but small on top... I knew the top would probably not fit very snug if I ordered the medium. However, I didn’t want to have super constricting bottoms... and from the looks of the other reviews the bottoms seemed to run kinda tight. Anyways, the top is pretty large for my liking (Bigger than i anticipated the medium being) which sucks because the bottoms fit just like I wanted them to. I’m debating on returning... it’s too bad you can’t pick individual sizing for each item. Otherwise it’s really cute. I hope this is helpful for someone who is questioning the sizing."
3.0,"Nice feel, good look but wore it a total of 4 times and the stitching on the sleeve and hood began to unravel...and that's without washing it! Had to take it to the cleaners and have the ""holes"" repaired. Be warned!"
3.0,"Too small Did not fit well, but shipping was very fast within 2 weeks. they are very nice but wish would be bigger."
3.0,"Pleasantly surprised with how fast these were delivered.<br />Really lightweight. After 1.5 years wearing KN95, it feels as if wearing nothing. They are so light that it actually makes me nervous thinking I am not protected.<br />Nice size and coverage. I have to twist the ear loop to create a tighter seal on my face."
3.0,"A little bit too big, but ok."
3.0,Loved the color. Kind of looks cheap though.
3.0,These have been worn no more than 3 or 4 times and the sewing on the waist band is coming apart on one pair... so far.
3.0,Looks good. Good material but runs really small
3.0,"Comfortable and nice looking pants.  Not crazy about the little tactical rings on the front and I'll probably remove them.  Sizing is off in length-I usually wear 32&#34; inseam, but these were 31&#34;, not off by much, but enough that my wife noticed and made a comment.  I see they're no longer available, so trying a pair with 34&#34; inseam is not an option.  5.11 here I come-get what you pay for."
3.0,"Not the best quality, I could of made this myself"
3.0,They are good enough. Not great but okay
3.0,"Really cute pattern and comfortable fit, but see through."
3.0,"The ruffles on the shoulders did not fall on my daughter's arms properly. She doesn't care for them. There was also an ink spot on the shirt when it arrived. Other than those things, the shirt was super cute. Just not for her"
3.0,These were ok perfect for graduation gift making but i had to paint over almost all of the chips in the silver ones
3.0,Nice quality but runs really small didnt fit
3.0,It's a little smaller than expected - it certainly doesn't have the excess fabric to  ruffle unless you have a very small neck.
3.0,"The clip doesn't have a very strong hold and the rhinestone fell out quickly. It's not super noticeable so I still wear it, but I have to fix the clip several times a day."
3.0,Pretty see through but they’re definitely pants so that’s a plus
3.0,I ordered a large after reading the reviews even though i'm a small and it fits as it should &#34;i guess&#34; being 2 sizes bigger than it should. def doesn't look like the pic though!
3.0,"After about a week of using, the lights on the left shoe stopped working and charging all together. My daughter loves them and would not allow me to return."
3.0,Eh. It's ok. Hurts my kids heels when it rubs. To small for size 13 shoe but good for size 10 or smaller.
3.0,"Came with a scratched ""stone"" otherwise pretty."
3.0,"Eh, it's ok. Not the greatest. It runs small. You'll definitely get weird tan lines but I expected that. This is something I would wear with a cute sun hat and wrap skirt when I sit in by the pool and soak up sun but not sure if I'd actually swim in it. I'm 5'10 and it fit me weird. But I have that problem with a lot of one pieces."
3.0,My son loved these glasses but they broke within two days.
3.0,Cute top but the material is shear and a weird texture
3.0,"It’s definitely more baby blue than a dusty blue, so I’m knocking off 2 stars because the color was very important to me.<br />Other than that it fit as expected and it’s very comfortable and flattering."
3.0,"Material and sizing is nice, but only one of the three has ear loops. The other two just have slits, and they don’t fit as well."
3.0,To y’all in front gave it away
3.0,"I got a 3X wanted it big... Fits like a 1X barely. I usually wear a XL, or 1X. I am big breasted so I like things bigger."
3.0,"This ear cuff is lovely, completely in love with it! However, it broke quite easily, and I couldn't find anyway to mend it."
3.0,Doesn't fit my ankle and I have small ankles. Guess I will just use as bracelet
3.0,"Beautiful colors and lightweight fabric.  This dress is really pretty however the buttons on this dress (feels like 1,000....there are tons down the entire front) popped off.  When I was putting it on and as I was wearing it.  I guess this is to be expected when you buy cheap clothes but I barely got one use from it and there’s no way I’m seeing back all those buttons."
3.0,Fits tighter than expected. Clings to my tummy a little bit to much and the seam where the ribbing and the sweater meet hits on the middle of my bootie rather than below it. The quality seems good fit is just off. I will not by another.
3.0,"Love, love this dress. What a great deal, too; it even included a cute necklace. The fabric is soft, it's comfortable to wear, and best of all, flattering to my figure (and forgiving of a few flaws). I usually wear a 12 and got the XL, which fits well. One thing to be aware of is that it runs very LONG. I'm 5'8&quot; and planned to wear this with some cute flats. I need to get it hemmed about 1&quot; in order to do that.<br /><br />Edited to note - this photo was taken AFTER I'd had the dress hemmed. I should have had them take off a bit more. Still do recommend the dress, but unless you're extremely tall or planning on 4&quot; heels, you'll need to get it hemmed.<br /><br />Edit #2. After one time wearing the dress and washing as directed, the seam is coming undone in one place along the waistband. I think I can easily fix it, but there may be some quality issues that buyers should be aware of."
3.0,"These boots are adorable. However, I could not get my daughter’s feet in them. The opening to the boots are very small and tight and I was unable to fit her feet in them. I returned them. I would suggest to size up."
3.0,"I purchased the Heather Chocolate after buying a pair of the Heather Charcoal last year that I love. The Chocolate color is nice but the fabric composition, as well as the stretch, is different. I love the Charcoal and they are not see through, but the Chocolate feels like it is going to rip or tear if I move around too much. The Chocolate ones also have a cheaper looking emblem that is metallic silkscreen and not the reflective logo like on the Charcoal pair. 3 stars for good fitting Charcoal and inconsistent sizing and material."
3.0,"Too wide and long. Cute, but have to return them."
3.0,"This is a lovely dress, and overall, a good purchase.  I generally wear a size 18/20 and I am 5'3&quot; and 215 pounds.  I am also top heavy so I ordered the 4XL and it fit perfectly.  This is why I recommend going up a size if your measurements are borderline. The top portion of the dress is a stretchy material and the bottom is a cotton blend.  You should probably iron the bottom before wearing as it arrives very wrinkled.  Also, I didn't care for the belt that much.  You could probably cut the loops off the dress and wear without the belt, which is something I'm considering. I purchased the dress to wear to church and I received several compliments.  I felt ladylike in the dress, and for the price, this is a good purchase."
3.0,"The product itself seems of good quality, but it runs REALLY big compared to other sports bras. I have returned this item for 2 sizes smaller so we'll see how that goes."
3.0,You get what you see in the picture. The product is made cheap so handle with care.
3.0,"My husband likes it but it needed to be stitch /sewn properly, fear it might come lose after a few wears....."
3.0,Didn’t Even last a week. Broke apart at the magic area.
3.0,The picture is good on it and tire to size but I didn’t look at the material<br />And it’s 100% polyester<br />I got it for my son<br />We live in Florida<br />So think it’s just to be a bed top when it’s chilly at night<br />I should have read it better
3.0,I like it but its to thin and it runs small. I am a medium and that’s what I got and it was small for me. I gave it to my little sister.
3.0,Really thin u can see threw it
3.0,"Decent size wrap, but it’s paper thin. It also rolls up at the edges. I wouldn’t reorder."
3.0,"I normally wear a small but ordered a medium after reading other reviews, but it was still far too small.  I ended up returning it.  On the plus side it was very well made and a nice soft material."
3.0,Ordered a L and XL. Too short!!
3.0,I ordered 40 pieces of this Handband and after two weeks the gold started to change colour and the bracelet is carefully used. I Only rinse with water and then dry out. Can you tell me why this is happening?
3.0,Not sure how this product is actually supposed to work? Maybe it’s designed for people with smaller bodies. Pulled it out Of the bag and realized I couldn’t do anything with it. I’m returning.
3.0,"This item was too large in the bust area.  I did, however, like the length.  I returned it because of the size.  I think I need to try on this product in person to find the correct fit before I buy another.  I like the idea of it but need to find the right fit."
3.0,"Super cute hat that my two-year-old was excited to wear it, but before I let him, I inspected it and noticed the emblem was already detaching and there were multiple stains. For the price, this hat should have been in immaculate condition, but instead it seems like it has already been used. I will be requesting a replacement."
3.0,"Great material, great style and good sizes to choose from, however, I ordered a size up so the ""blouse"" would be longer, to be a dress. Worst decision.  I ended up with the shoulders too wide and the dress barely under my bottom. But I like short clothing so I made it work."
3.0,This band was comfortable and inexpensive. I was a fan until it created rashes on my wrist? Maybe there's some latex in the rubber on the bottom? Maybe it's just me. I took several brakes and when I wore it again the rash returned.
3.0,"They are good for the price.I would have liked a bigger frame, as I don't think they look like aviator glasses"
3.0,"I feel that the quality, make and fabric could have been better. The black fabric is very see through, and the seems separate easily.  I feel that is a better quality of fabric was used and more time was taken on manufacturing this would have made a great outfit."
3.0,"Please be very aware when purchasing this item.  I don't understand how everyone is reviewing this as &#34;true to size&#34;.  It is absolutely not.  My son is between a Men's Medium and Large size shirt.  I purchased a Large in this goalie jersey.  It's skin tight.  The sizing on the shirt says it's UE - M, USA - S, Asia - L, Bra - M.  While there is a notation on the product page that says &#34;We sell ASIAN SIZE, It is about 1-2 size SMALLER than US,UK,AU,EU size. Please choose the size according to our size form.&#34;, there is NO SIZE FORM on the page.  Had I known that this size L was actually going to be a SMALL, I would have purchased accordingly.  To make matters worse, I'm expected to pay nearly $7 to send it back so I can purchase the size he needs.  I'm pretty disappointed...and so is he!<br /><br />Other than that, the shirt is gorgeous.  The colors are vibrant and so &#34;now&#34;.  The only thing that's weird are the what I would call &#34;quotation marks&#34; on the chest.  They're bizarre and really out of place."
3.0,"Mixed reviews about this project. I make wire wrapped jewelry and I was giving these away for free so I didn’t really care about the price. Till I gave one to my bf and he broke it. So yes they are fairly nice. Issues are the clasp get stuck so try them all at once, and I dislike the extender part of the necklace it’s just super cheap and easy to break. So for small cheaper stuff I think your good if your selling something expensive go for something else."
3.0,The fabric and cut of this is adorable.  The torso was too long and has way too much fabric creating an unflattering look.  I wish I could wear it. :( It hangs down too low due to the extra fabric.
3.0,Pants are long with a TINY waistband.  The outfit is cute though.
3.0,"Overall the vest isn't bad for the price.  However the sizing runs very small.  I normally where a size small in men's, and the XL fits me just right (thankfully I read prior reviews to get the right size).  However, two of the four pockets have rather large holes in them.  They are fairly simple to sew up, but it's a bit ridiculous, especially considering that multiple pockets is a primary reason for buying this product.<br />That being said, it isn't bulky, and it has worked fairly well for my trip so far."
3.0,Material is not exactly as I expected but it's ok
3.0,Good fit. Leather looks painted
3.0,It was a little too small compared to the size chart. The material was nice though.
3.0,Doesnt hold shape well. Doesnt stay on head well.
3.0,"Like the size and look of this, but as other reviews mention- it's hard to get pictures inside without wrinkling them."
3.0,"I got this for my wife who has mixed opinion about it<br />1. The size is smaller than how it looked in the picture. But that is a good thing as it looks prettier. It feels like a perfect size for the ears<br />2. The design is nice. She likes the small stones covering the green stone<br />3. The emerald is ok. The cuts are fine, but if you see carefully, you can see the reflective coating behind the stone, which means the shine is coming from the reflective coating than the cut<br />4. I think it is pricey. For $100 one would expect a more beautiful stone. I deducted one star due to price<br /><br />Overall, they are pretty and good casual wear, but not for special wear."
3.0,Stones look cheap.
3.0,"Cute, but sizing is at least 1 if not 2 sizes too small."
3.0,"very cute necklace, not the greatest quality in the chain ... but fun for throw around jewels!"
3.0,"I really love the look of this earring. I got it for my daith piercing & it's really easy to put in. My problem is the hinge is a little TOO easy to open. It keeps opening & has fallen out at least once a day since I've had it. I'm very sad because it is really beautiful, but I know one of these days it will fall out & I won't find it again. I'll need to go with a different style.<br /><br />EDITING TO ADD: It fell out today & is gone. So I paid $13 for something I got to use for a couple of weeks. Definitely not worth it!"
3.0,"I bought these because I hate taking off my sunglasses when I go in to a store because my old eyes like lots of light when inside. Indoors, these still have enough color that indoor lighting is noticeably dimmer and I still have to take them off to see better. (Did I mention old eyes?) Outdoors, the glasses MAY get a little darker but it is  hard to tell. They have nowhere near the color change that prescription glasses do and that is what I was hoping for. That said, however, because they are not as dark as a lot of sunglasses, they are perfect for me when it's cloudy-bright outside and I need something just to cut the intensity down a little."
3.0,"My son is usually an XL in hoodies, so I ordered a 2X just to be safe.<br /><br />Even that was too small, and he couldn't zip it.<br /><br />Had to return it for an even LARGER size!"
3.0,"The quality is not good as expected so I was not able by myself to shorten the watch band.<br />It comes with a tool to remove the pins, but the pins are very firm in the watch band and the removal tool has a pin to push them out<br />but that bent, and the extra removal tool pin bent, so it made it impossible to do with that removal tool.<br />We ended up going to a jewelers and paid about $25 to have it done. Even they had a hard time with their tools and little hammers to remove the pins in the watch. One positive thing about the watch band itself, you may have a hard time shortening the band, but you don't have to worry about the band or the pins breaking!"
3.0,Cute outfit but took forever to receive and was way too big. Ordered a 18M and fit more like a 2/3T
3.0,For the price you can't beat it even as cheaply as it is made.
3.0,The product is very thin where the fabric crosses won't lay like it shows in the pictures. But then it sure doesn't show or tell you how thin the fabric is
3.0,"the shirt is very nice and well made, however, it seems to run a little small - so be sure to check measurements -"
3.0,It was very cute and I loved the material. I am normally a 12 or 14 and I ordered the 14/16 size thinking it would be plenty big. Wrong! Way to small in the bust and way to short!
3.0,The colors are not what they look like in the picture they looked a little off. I actually brought this gift for someone at my church. She hasn't said anything so I am assuming she didnt like it. Overall I thought it was OK.
3.0,Not great but not terrible either.
3.0,"TERRIBLE to steer. Ends up hurting your wrist, forearm and elbow.  Doesn't hold a whole lot so use it for 2 night trips. I wish I'd bought something else"
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but the material is not flattery on the body. I am 150 pounds and 5,7, the bottom part of the dress looks cheap compare to the top part which the lace is beautiful."
3.0,Pretty but poorly made.  Broke easily and coating wears away.
3.0,Too tight in the shoulders and bust. But feels good on the skin
3.0,Tight fit but well constructed and lightweight.
3.0,"It’s a well made top, the cut is beautiful. The problem with the item is that it is quite ‘short’ - cropped a bit too high for my liking. Not something most could wear to work, so it’s definitely more of a ‘fun’ club crop top type of garment in my opinion. The material however feels luxe, and it has great stretch. It is a very ‘snug’ fit, body hugging, body con styling. Overall great item, though best for someone trying to show off their work in the gym, and no so much for the body conscious types (like myself)."
3.0,"Pretty color, o.k.  material for price...would have given 4 stars but it came with a rip down most of one side of the shirt"
3.0,Liked the color length and material but wish I’d gotten bigger size.  I decided to keep them anyway
3.0,"This was slightly snug in the body (i'm generally a medium and that's the size I bought) and weirdly large on top. I'm a small D cup and the boob part was very loose. If that part had fit, I might have kept it."
3.0,"I received my backpack this week, and it looks perfect except one of the prongs on the orange chest clip was broken. Disappointing, as the rest of this bag looks great."
3.0,"Really cute, just be careful washing it."
3.0,Very lightweight and I love the size but they definitely look more bronze than gold
3.0,It does not always come out the way you want have to move it and keep trying to get it to whistle.
3.0,"Not stretchy at all, had to cut the strap and add elastic in order to fit it over my daughter's arms.  Everywhere else is sized proportionally but the lack of elasticity in the straps makes it way too tight. If we didn't alter, it would have been unusable."
3.0,"This is a really nice rosary, especially if you're Irish Catholic. Durable and lightweight. Would have rated it higher except the beads smell REALLY plasticky and it can be distracting when you're in prayer. But it's good for how cheap it is."
3.0,The fit is a bit odd.  They come up just above ankle.  There is no top or bottom to sock and no matter how I put them on the come up higher in the front than the back.  The toes of the socks do not get smaller as go from 2nd toe to smallest toe making fit in toes a little loose. The colors are fun and they are fuzzy and warm.  They are wearable and I did get used to odd fit after having them on for a while.
3.0,Needed some serious work put into it once it was taken out of the box. I styled it and it worked well enough. We used it for a very casual family costume party... it worked well enough for the occasion... could have been better.
3.0,The hemp is too still and hard to adjust. This was a gift and the receiver has to hold it together with tape.
3.0,These are very comfortable and work great. I just can't keep the darn things clean. I don't have this much trouble with prescription glasses or sunglasses.
3.0,Wasn't carbon Fibre but it is decent quality
3.0,What I like about this item is that is good for the winter. I didn't like that you cant wear it for the summer
3.0,I didn’t like the material of the bottoms. They were made out of the same material as some scubs at hospitals.
3.0,The quality wasn't really good!
3.0,"flashy and gets me a lot of compliments, but it doesn't hold very much, and it seems unwieldy! Clunks around a lot."
3.0,Looked so cute but only lasted four days fell off and became discolored. Kinda disappointed because I really liked it and got a lot of compliments. I am going to try and fix it myself.
3.0,"I usually wear an 8, ordered the large, and it fit perfectly. I love the shape of the skirt--it's much less full than most jersey maxi skirts, and I also like that it is not a foldover waist (who needs that extra fabric?). However, the fabric was weird, almost like really think fleece? It was not the usual thin flowing jersey I was expecting."
3.0,I haven’t yet.
3.0,"They would've looked nice if they'd fit. Certainly did not feel plus size, and Idk if they came with a hole or they ripped when I tried em on. They were extremely tight..."
3.0,"Bit annoying to get on, the rubber obviously pulls your hair.<br />Had to put them facing up because the rubber hurted my ears (I put them almost at the end of the &#34;legs&#34; of my glasses since putting then right behind the glass seemed a bit feminine). All in all, they hold the glasses in place and the material seems to resist being pulled and sweated on, no bad smell remains. But for the price its alright"
3.0,Looks like a great belt but it was way too small for my 38-inch waist.
3.0,"There is one single sparkle/bedazzle stud in the front/center of the blouse.  It cannot be removed.  I didn't notice when I ordered it.  It is actually funny and has become quite the conversation piece, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
3.0,"closure clasp broke on the first day, but I like the design"
3.0,Does the job! But the stitching on these leaves white thread sticking out often.  I don't need more white thread to make me look like I have more gray hair.  But I do love this color selections.  Some are more stretched out then others also.  But again it does what I was needing.
3.0,I gave it as a gift and I don't really think the little girl I gave it to liked the fight or maybe the feel. The sweater material was not very soft. The design was adorable though.
3.0,Shirt is a large but fits like a medium not able to wear and swing a golf club
3.0,"Craftmanship is a bit ""rushed"" looking.  Some threads uncut sticking out from seams. They fit baggy. By that i mean there is a portion under the nose clip that balloons out when you breathe out and vaccuums in when you breathe in. The pouch is smaller when wearing my mask but on my wife's its quite roomie. The ear elastic loops are snug tight. Fine for my wife but a bit much for my face size. The print is cool tho. Wish they came with a changeable filter pocket inside the mouth area. As they are they are made with a soft cloth material that touches your mouth but the barrier between me and the air borne bacteria seems a bit light. Delivery time was awesome and you cant beat the price and availability, especially in these times of Covid -19."
3.0,"Rated a 3 because the gown is adorable but beware, it runs very small. I normally wear and XL. I had read the reviews that it ran small so I ordered a 2XL. It was to small!  I would say if you have any curves at all, order 2 sizes larger than you normally wear."
3.0,Extremely thin!
3.0,"Sleeves too tight. Length good, except it's shorter in the back."
3.0,Cute for the price.  A little difficult to insert at first and slip off the ear lobe without a rubber backing.
3.0,I assumed since this was labeled plus size that I would be safe to order my usual size but I definitely should’ve sized up. The fabric is quite thin and for the oversized look ordering my true size was just way too small and tight.
3.0,"Got a medium because I wanted it to fit a little baggy, but the medium fit like an xl. Also, the fabric feels like bathing suit material, which I didn’t expect. Returning."
3.0,"The black color and the sleeves are very nice. The material is soft and good quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't look good on my body. I have a large chest, and it's just not flattering at any direction. The elastic band hits just below my bra giving the rest of the dress a maternity or “baby doll” look. It also makes my breast area appear larger instead of giving it a flattering shape. I really wish the elasticized midsection band was not used in this dress, as there is no need for it. This design has the potential to work well on a lot of body types if it could fall more naturally and then use the sash to cinch and add more shape. This longer version of this style looks slightly better on me compared to the shorter version which I also tried. With that said, the elastic midsection continues to be a problem for me, which makes this unwearable. It would probably look better on someone with a smaller chest, or a little bit taller than me, as I am on the shorter side. It just doesn't work for me."
3.0,Low waisted and tight.
3.0,The bathing suit looks great! Just like the pic! My only complaint is that the straps arnt adjustable and are way to big so theres no support at all for the boobies I had to cut the straps and sew them to it wasn't so loose ..even then it dosnt feel like it hold up the boobies good ); the back is super sexy
3.0,"Nice gloves, but I returned them because they were too thick. I would have had to remove them to use any touchscreen electronics."
3.0,Very thin. Not even sure if it's waterproof.
3.0,"They are a little flatter than I expected - I prefer sunglasses that curve more around your face.  But they are still fun, just not my go to. The kids get a kick out of looking at themselves in the lenses."
3.0,This shirt was just “ok” for me. It fit however the seam didn’t fall right on my body and looks awkward.  I’m gonna to try to iron and see if I can fix in some way.
3.0,Thin with sharp edges. Had to wrap the handle area with tape to avoid hands hurting.
3.0,The product is made well and it super light. My only problem is I ordered a size 13 and it feels like a size 12. The space between my big toe gets slightly irritated by wearing them due to the material. It's not a bad product at all and I'm wondering maybe because I'm more flat footed that's the reason. Not sure but I can only give it three stars based on my personal experience.
3.0,"This is a pretty dress but it’s not true to the sizing chart provided. I’m 125lbs, 34c, 5’4. By the size chart a small should have been plenty big. It wasn’t. It was very snug. I would love to have it. The style and material is fabulous but I’m not even sure the medium would fit. I might try again."
3.0,"The one-size-fits-all was a little large for me. Once I tried it on in a few styles, I realized I would have liked an infinity dress with a dedicated tube top upper portion so that it wasn't so hard to try and hide a bra under it. I also realized the dress was dry-clean only. Those two factors made me return it. Thankfully the return was a breeze.<br /><br />The material is pretty heavy, and the straps are really long. Lots of material for different styles, but I found that they were obnoxiously long for other styles that didn't involve a lot of crossing or twisting.<br /><br />The color was pretty, at least."
3.0,The product was of good quality for the price. The only issue I have with it is the balls are to far apart and not sewn on that well.
3.0,Please make note that the pins that come with this band are the wrong size for the watch you might be buying for.  Asus Zenfone 2 is mine and had to go to a jeweler to get the right size.  Otherwise it is top notch.
3.0,I did't feel like these thumb covers were helpful for my situation. They were so thin that my release changed. I would have to adjust with more tape or add some more friction somewhere.
3.0,A bit thinner than expected but still nice
3.0,"It works fine, lights up really cool. But has this ""plasticky"" smell in it not sure how to get rid of that as this has electronics in it. Would love a cleaning guide for it."
3.0,"I usually wear an XL, but after reading some posts I chose to buy an XXL and it fit perfectly. The lace was a bit lighter than what is show in the photo. Got this for a wedding and got many compliments on it."
3.0,About as dark as my $6.00 ebay sunglasses.
3.0,A few stones popped out in transit
3.0,They were little bit cute.
3.0,"This jacket comes “shrink-wrapped”.  It’s Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.<br /><br />Though the lining is “furry”, it’s not “Sherpa” lining.<br /><br />What is Sherpa? Sherpa is a fabric made from polyester (fleece), acrylic, or cotton and is sometimes called 'faux shearling,' named for its resemblance to the wool-lined clothing worn by the Sherpa people of Nepal. Sherpa mimics the bumpy texture of sheep's wool.<br /><br />If you place your mouse over the picture of the inside of this jacket, you’ll see that it does not have the “bumpy” texture.<br /><br />I have the size Large.  It measures 22.5” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  The arms measure 19.5” from where they attach at the shoulder to the end.  It measures 19” across.<br /><br />The outside fabric is 100% cotton.  The furry lining is 100% polyester.  Though the listing shows “machine wash”. . .  The washing instructions on the item shows Hand-Wash."
3.0,Chain is nice but the clasp is cheap.
3.0,They weren’t as tight a fit as I had hoped.
3.0,"The hat is very nice, however, the White one I ordered was not received. I received a beige one instead.  I kept it as I liked the hat and could use it in beige."
3.0,"Looks good but turns color. It lasted a month or maybe two before completely turning. I loved it while it lasted, I may buy another one later on."
3.0,Obviously my daughter and ger best friend loves them and for the price you kinda get what you pay for. Still cute saying and a sweet sentiment
3.0,"I used the sizing chart provided, but still could have gone up a size. The dress was quite cute and appeared as pictured. Nice for the price, but I wouldn't expect to get multiple season's of wear."
3.0,"ALLBIRDS compatibility? Well--- not so great. I wear size 7-8 in Allbirds and got the women's XS Laceez which was recommended for 4 hole sneakers. My foot kept slipping out of the shoe when I walked. Even if I tried to double back the lace to make up for the slack, my foot still slipped out.<br /><br />So I tried a Kids Medium which is about 2 inches shorter than the women's XS and STILL my foot was slipping out vs using the Allbirds laces.<br /><br />This tells me that the Allbirds hole placement is not conducive to elastic laces. You need that extra hole near the side like most athletic shoes which help tighten the shoe to the ankle, preventing slippage. Without this, the laces (no matter what brand) are useless."
3.0,The magnetism was not as powerful as I expected.
3.0,"The design is awesome, but, as a watch, it's horrible. The time resets itself. Why? I don't know."
3.0,"Although it took a while to receive, I was excited when it came. The material is soft and very fragile. I look forward to wearing it soon"
3.0,"It looked nice initially but over time, I've noticed holes started appearing more and more.  I stitch them up myself so I am not going to walk around with a holey cape.  I use this to walk the dogs, so it's just a little cover so I don't have to change my whole outfit so I don't look like a hobo.  So for something casual, it's fine."
3.0,Cute but doesn’t fit so the apps work
3.0,"I loved the style and colors on this dress.  However, the pattern is already fading after just 2 washings, and the area where the top meets the skirt is rather high... doesn't hit at the natural waist.  Not bad for the price, though."
3.0,"Bust: 34DD<br />Waist: 29”<br />Hips: 38”<br /><br />I was really excited for this sweater but it just didn’t pan out. Generally, I can’t pull off oversized sweaters. At best they look ill fitted and at worst I just look like a child. Anytime it does work, I go with the smallest size available. There was just too much material around the midsection. I tried pulling it down, letting it naturally billow, and tucking it in. Just wasn’t good for me. The sleeves were fine on my short arms but I’m betting for the general population the sleeves are on the short side. The colors match the image but there was yellow woven into a red stripe. Had I loved the sweater I probably would have just ignored it with slight annoyance but it was enough that some could easily be bothered by it."
3.0,"Nice looking, not flexible, and too large for me."
3.0,They're very pretty and I like the length. They are light weight. So light that they won't hang straight and they seem to come out of my ears. I'm worried I'll lose them.
3.0,"Only the ear flaps and the heat brim have the warm flocking, under the smaller ear flas is supposed to be gaps so you can hear better, but they are just closed off. You could do worse, but as for this type of hat it barely qualifies. Better than a basic beanie, but BARELY."
3.0,"These are nice, but not what we were expecting. My husband will still use them, probably not as much as I would have if they had been made more user friendly.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased opinion"
3.0,"The kimono looked pink with blue & coral flowers in the photo which is why I bought it.  When I received it, I was disappointed to see it was beige with blue & coral flowers. Fit was as expected, very comfortable which is why I decided to keep it."
3.0,I felt the fabric was too thick and for some reason didn’t find it as cute as I did from the picture online. I returned it.
3.0,This is well made and fits my Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch. I have a very small wrist so I need to use the second to last hole. It is very stiff. I will see if after some wear if it softens up.
3.0,"Is very sexy but just runs very small. I am 5'11 and size 10 and it looked darn sexy from far away, my husband loved it, but close up it was cutting into me almost painfully and causing muffin top spillage. So buy it and love it if you are size 6-8 or smaller."
3.0,"I am 5’0 115 lbs 34B, ordered a medium and it fits around my body fine but doesn’t have much coverage. Maybe that is how they are supposed to fit but I was hoping for just a bit more security. Since it’s a bralette it won’t really be an issue but seems like it is a nip slip waiting to happen"
3.0,"i really like this suit, but it is loose up top. the right hand side is looser than the left, and i feel a bit exposed. i ordered a size large, but my bust size is small like a small B. If i had a larger chest it would be very revealing, but since i am small i can get away with it. i may have fit a medium but i kept the large."
3.0,Very lightly
3.0,"I ordered six dresses from various vendors in the same size.  This dress was the only one that was extremely small on me.  Not even close to being able to zip it up.  I kept all of the other purchases from the other vendors but I returned this one.  The quality seemed decent, but the sizing was really off."
3.0,"I'm typically a large, being 183cm (6ft) and about 90kg (185lbs?). Decided to size up, and glad I did. KTM's stuff typically fits a bit snug. Also. shirt quality is not great, tbh. The material feels cheap, although the silk screen seems alright."
3.0,"The color of this blouse is beautiful, material is nice but the elastic material across the bodice is NOT sewn down as you can see in the middle picture. If you tug the shirt down others may get a peep show! The white elastic shows under the arm where it curls down a bit, again because it is not sewn down. The shirt runs small and is shorter than I had hoped/expected. I am planning to keep it but will likely need to lose some weight and have some alterations done before I try again to wear it."
3.0,"the so-called coral stone looks like plastic and they feel cheap and flimsy...sorry, but that's my opinion. wish I could find the same style in a quality made earring."
3.0,Thus box has duplicate colors 😟😡
3.0,"I will keep these pants because they fit my thighs nicely and are a good length.  I plan to lose more weight which will fit better in the waist area but will be too loose on my thighs at that point(maybe).  These are very stretchy so not too uncomfortable at the waist to be as tight as it is.  The material is thin so ANY underwear WILL show through.  I am bummed that I have to be careful with what I wear with these pants, otherwise these pants would be 5 stars."
3.0,Caribiner is well made and like the product but it didn’t come with the T-bar. Disappointing but I didn’t feel like waiting for a return and re-order. I guess they got me on this one.
3.0,It’s thinner than I expected it to be on the inside. But the edge band part seems comfortable. It looks like the picture for sure
3.0,"I like the umbrella, and it seems decent quality, but the very first day I hooked it to my daughter's backpack, the strap broke. It wasn't even wet. The kids don't have a hard time opening or closing it, which is good."
3.0,its bigger than i thought it would be. i love the way it looks. its a decent length. i just dont like what its made out of. the metal stinks and makes me itchy and taste weird.
3.0,It’s ok. Very stiff and gets marked up easily
3.0,Very pretty dress but was too large for the size.
3.0,Dislikes:  product arrived with a hole in it!. (About the size of a penny)<br />Likes:  material was pretty and very soft.<br />My granddaughter picked this out for her 10th. birthday wish list.  I would have rated it higher if it had not arrived with a hole in it.
3.0,"I got this t-shirt for my 13-year-old son who is a gamer.  He did not like the phrase ""I paused my game to be here"" because he plays multi-player games and you cannot simply pause a multi-player game.  The t-shirt also has a really strong chemical smell.  The sizing says it's for ""men"" but this large is definitely a youth large, not a men's large.  Otherwise, it seems to be a fairly well-made shirt at a good price."
3.0,It was cute enough and delivered as pictured.  The bag was smaller than anticipated and the denim was very thin.  It was not the quality I expected so I returned it.
3.0,It is much smaller than we thought it would be.
3.0,Great item however from shipping Jem's were loose. Requested a relacement/refund and was taken care of within 24hrs. Very satisfied
3.0,This dress is very pretty and more on the green side than blue as advertised. I'm 6ft tall and the dress was way too short and runs a little small. Still a pretty dress. Wish it fit.
3.0,Very light weight and the opening for earring stem were too small.
3.0,"The sunglasses I received were missing one of the screws, so one of the sides were not attached. I was very disappointed because they were for my daughter for Christmas. They are still very cute and affordable so I will be purchasing another pair once I receive my refund."
3.0,My husband is 6'5ft 260 lbs. It's so hard to find shorts that go below his knees. These are thin but they do fit so he's happy enough. We got 6X but normally he wears a 4X. I'm glad we went with the bigger size so maybe you should order up.
3.0,"Love the shirt, hate the fit.  I am a medium in most things, a large if I want it loose.  Based on the other reviews I bought extra large, it is very very small.  I had my friend who is a small try it on and the body fits but it doesn't hang as long as pictured even on her.  Going to shred it into an 80's shirt for a party.  That's all I can do with it."
3.0,Para ir a la Iglesia pero primero le coji de ancho
3.0,Too was way too big big
3.0,"I did like these glasses when i received them, but they broke within two weeks. Also the lense had a strange color, kind of a blur to them."
3.0,Dress is pretty. For plus size it was unflattering waist down. I asked a question what bra to wear with deep low cut and transparent shoulders. No response but the ladies who posted their photos look beautiful but appears both altered the plunge neckline with pin or tank fabric.
3.0,"Two pairs are soft and thin and two pairs are thick, stiff, kind of scratchy material. The patterns are cute."
3.0,"Shorter in width than what I wanted, but cute for the price."
3.0,"Did not like all the wrinkles,am still trying to work them out."
3.0,"good concept but broke on me, need to use harder plastic"
3.0,"A little larger than I expected and they vary in size. Very thick and a bit stiff. Decent, pleased enough. Probably wouldn't buy again but not so bad that they needed returned."
3.0,Don't be in hurry if you order
3.0,"This is really cute but the cut is kind of messy, I say buy a size down, the breast area is really over sized, their are no straps so if you have a smaller chest the sleeves will constantly fall down, but it is worth what you pay for."
3.0,fit is snug - should fit more loosely for sleeping comfort.  I would go one size up
3.0,Different colors have different fit. I like the fit of the dark gray/black one the best and wish I could purchase that one by itself.
3.0,I like those socks especially for wearing flipflops on colder days in SoCal. The only issue I have is that those are very thin. They provide almost no protection from the temperatures. I'm also not sure how long they will last.
3.0,"Nice fabric, thin enough to wear in Texas cold fronts. Fit big, size down"
3.0,"I ordered a size 9, but i got a size 11..."
3.0,Color is bright shiny blue with denim print.  Would be nicer if they were more denim color.
3.0,They are tiny....
3.0,Cute designs on the shirts. Run very small. My 2 yo toddler who's less than 30lbs barely fit in the 4T. Definitely order larger!
3.0,"It's a nice looking robe, but it does feel a bit on the cheap side."
3.0,"These pants were good in theory. If I had smaller legs, they would be excellent! They fit great around the waist. Very squatproof. However, they had little compression in the thigh area, and for someone with big thighs, I didn’t like it. Also the bottom of the waistband was slightly high, so I felt that it Accentuated my hip dips. If you are more confident in your leg size, these would be great, but I am someone who needs a lot of compression and felt that these made me feel too open for comfort."
3.0,Okey only one time
3.0,My daughter loves this swimsuit. Our only complaint is that the blue in the top is different than the blue in the bottom.
3.0,They're okay - nothing special.
3.0,"I ordered the pink. It doesn't have the shimmery/satin look that you see in the photo, it's more of a matte, bubble gum pink color, which looks a lot more basic. The fit also dug into my butt a lot and if my boobs were any bigger it'd probably be too small. I'm usually an S or size 2, maybe the M would have fit better."
3.0,"These are really cute, but the picture is a sticker that keeps falling off. I guess I will need to try and glue it on. They are worth the $8."
3.0,I'm not impress they are cheaply made
3.0,I love these earrings but one came bent and I had to bend it back to wear it. Kinda disappointed by that other then that they are great.
3.0,Like the dress but had to buy the next size up. I usually wear a small in dresses (I'm 5'6&#34; and 125 lbs) but I needed a medium in this. The side slits go up pretty high.
3.0,"Cute,light weight.Usually wear a small but sized up.Still a tight fit...prob should've ordered a large."
3.0,I got this particular Walk the Moon shirt because the description stated it is a licensed design. And I prefer to make sure the artist gets every cent they deserve. The 3 stars is for the size runs small. Otherwise I love the design.
3.0,"one will fall down often, doesnt stay up"
3.0,"This band was a replacement for another magnetic one, that the color eventually mostly came off of.<br />This band was a really nice color. The little ""lever"" piece broke off on one side the first time I put it in. To put it on the charger I have I had to unhook one side because it wouldn't fit, not a big deal. However last night I went to take it off the charger and reattach that side and the lever piece broke off of that one too. I tossed it and ordered another from where I got my first band. Kind of disappointing because I didn't have it very long.  It was comfortable and had a very nice color to it."
3.0,This only lasted one wash and it started to bead up. It feels heavier then expected but it keeps you warm. I just wish it was better quality.
3.0,"Go up a size in this sweater, I usually wear a medium and the large is o.k. but not a lot of room. I probably could of got an x-tra large, if they had one in that size. It is a very cute sweater & I am happy with my purchase."
3.0,Soft and stretchy and would be comfy if her bum wasn't hanging out the back. The material is great but there's not enough of it in the back. Returning them and hoping the company has something similar in the same fabric but more fitting for a 5 year old to be comfy
3.0,"I don't really understand this shirt. It looks intriguing, but odd - I have a long torso so it simply doesn't work. I think if you are shorter-waisted, this will be a good bet, but otherwise it looks frumpy."
3.0,I steamed it before we left on a weekend getaway. By the time I got it out it was worse than ever. It is cute but darn those wrinkles.
3.0,While this suit is really cute I had to return it. I am 5'0 slim and small chested. I bought a med but it felt a little too tight all around especially around my neck. While the idea of padding the chest area is good since its white and possibly see through once wet (I didn't get it wet so I don't know) the pads were a bit much and looked very unnatural. Good news is that they are removable. I'm torn to try buying again in a large that it may go the opposite and be too baggy which is even worse in the water.
3.0,"Fits fine. I do not like the buttons, I wish it had different and better buttons. I also wish it had pockets. But, it is comfortable and fits well."
3.0,Fits very well but the lace is cheap and irritating and the boning at the bottom is plastic and therefore bends easily. This bra is pretty uncomfortable but it is cute and I still wear it pretty often just because it’s one of the few I’ve found in my size
3.0,"I ultimately returned this dress because the material was extremely cheap. It was basically a halloween costume, and I wanted something more professional."
3.0,fits really tight
3.0,"for the money i think its over priced, but its an ok shirt, should've been $11.00"
3.0,"Not worth the money. The elastic in the waist band is twisted and made from cheap fabric. Also, runs slightly small. I will not be ordering a second pair."
3.0,"I wanted to love this.  I do love the look and style of this robe.  I am normally a size large for my tops.  I bought this in a large and it was too narrow cut around the middle.  I could get it on and zipped but it didn't feel comfortable. I returned it and ordered another one in an extra large.  This one was still too narrow at the waist and hips.  I carry most of my weight on my top half.  I am 5'4"" and weigh approx. 150 pounds. It fit, and I could have worn it, but I want something loose in this type of garment since it is something to wear lounging around the house.  Not only was the extra large still too narrow for my taste, it was now too long.  This robe would be great if it was cut more full and a 3/4 length.  I really wanted to love this."
3.0,I prefer the fit of the Levi's.
3.0,It has a seam down the front that's weird but the sleeves are lovely
3.0,"Nice band, but for some reason it allows the pin to come loose that holds it to the watch.  I even replaced the pins, but it continues to happen.<br />I don't know if the fault is in the band or in the pins."
3.0,"It was alright at first but after wearing it for a few hours, you can tell it's definitely a cheaper shoe. It's ridgid and even after a few months, won't properly break in so my feet are never fully comfortable. Also, side note: it does not suction around the ankle, there's pleanty of space."
3.0,The product was cheaply made. Broke before I  could wear it
3.0,"Too small even with following the sizing chart. Will be returning and possibly getting the next size up. Haven’t decided yet. From what I saw when I tried it on, it’s decent material. The pads for the chest are weirdly small and really hard to move. So that was a downside."
3.0,these run really small...got an ex large and it looks like ex small...
3.0,"I have a long torso and this was too short for comfort on me. The fabric is ideal and soft. If you are on the short side, or have a short torso, this is a good sweater for you. It literally fell at my belly button, which is too short for my comfort. It is a very soft and comfortable sweater otherwise."
3.0,"Love the bracelet, but it is impossible to put on by yourself. The first time I had my husband put it on me, the dangling chain piece broke off. It's like the clasp is crooked or something... kinda weird."
3.0,"I’m sure this watch band is great, but I have been unable to get the old watch and off of my watch to replace the band as the ring screws are stuck. I can’t find the right screwdriver to get them off. I hope that I will eventually be able to use this band."
3.0,Did not like this coat it was too thin and the fit was not comfortable
3.0,Nice quality shorts ordered a 22 and they were too small :/ to return
3.0,One shoulder has a seam that's not on the other shoulder.
3.0,"Works great, but, only in full Sun. A slight modification in the fan angle would provide better down draft on the waters face"
3.0,It looks good & fits probably with strong enough it’s magnetic
3.0,The clips work great. The buttons however are pretty bulky and cumbersome.
3.0,Love the style. My kid looks great in them. But he's also an active kid and I think this is my third pair of glasses in 6 months for him. They are more brittle than you'd expect and they break very easily if your kid enjoys goofing off or being active in them. On the looks department I give them a 5. But kids glasses should really be more durable IMO.
3.0,"The hat shrinks when it's washed, the strap comes out of the hat making it look awkward."
3.0,"Top fit fine - due to the other reviews that mentioned top was big, I ordered a large.  However - no way was I getting my butt into the bottoms! TOO small.  Please consider making an option to order different sizes for top & bottom."
3.0,Love this one and the burgundy one. Only complaint is that XL in wine color was smaller than this pink one. Love these dresses though! Great fit.
3.0,"I have 4 of these and love the fit. The reason for the lower rating is the fabric nubs really bad, especially if you carry a cross body purse like I do!"
3.0,It is very difficult to remove the links.
3.0,"One ear is fox-like and the other is that of a panda bear or lion (it's big and rounded). I had to tack that ear so that it would be more pointed. Otherwise, it's cute."
3.0,It looked very nice and seemed like good quality but unfortunately it runs very small. I will have to return it.
3.0,"This product arrived very late. It does run pretty small but that worked for me since it was purchased for my preemie granddaughter. Other than being late, I was satisfied with product."
3.0,Product looks exactly as described an in pic but they run very big so would definitely want to get a size smaller maybe even 2 sizes smaller
3.0,They're ok but not 7&#34; inseam. More like 9&#34; all the way to knee. I'm 6'1 and ordered a large.
3.0,"I'm not a fan of pull-on boots because they generally seem geared toward people with narrow feet. I wear a 10.5W/11W and these looked narrow right out of the box. I successfully pulled on the right boot after a major struggle. Once I got it on, I already knew it wouldn't fit the left foot since I deal with more swelling on that side. I tried to get it on the left foot and gave up.<br /><br />The length is probably accurate, it's the width that's a problem, and I don't have super-wide feet. The fabric really likes to attract lint and I feel like the version I got, ""Black Imus"" (whatever that is) made it look better aesthetically. Some of the other variations look especially cheap and child-like. I would pass on these, especially at $50."
3.0,Not flattering at all; Returned.
3.0,It was ok and cheaply made the picture was blurry not like the picture but from afar it looked nice so cheap watch cheap material so don't waste ur time with the hopes of it looking like the picture
3.0,Well the shirt looked nice at first. Washed it and the damn thing shrunk to a small wtf. Good thing I tried it on before just taking it on my trip to Hawaii. Wasted money!
3.0,"It’s cute, but it doesn’t really look like the picture. It’s also pretty large and looks even bigger if you put it in your daith."
3.0,My son and I really love this jacket he is in a 7-8. And I ordered a 9 but I should of went to a ten because it fits just right
3.0,love the chokers
3.0,I wear a size 12 in a dress so I order a large. I top of this dress is to tight and the bottom material has so much stretch to it that it keeps rising up. Not sure if I would order another dress like this.
3.0,"These are gorgeous, but the backing on them is very thick. It's actually painful to get them in. I figured out that I had to stretch my earlobes, then twist them to get them in. I haven't decided on whether I will keep them or not because they are so pretty."
3.0,"Yes, it warms your feet but doesn’t really do a great job. Some part of your feet is still cold because the heating part does cover your whole feet. Also it heats only your sole/bottom of your feet but the top of your feet/toes are still cold. Hearing is also weak. Would not recommend or buy again."
3.0,They are great ring my wife and i love them but youu need to have some knowledge on metal/ jewelry repair if you wanna get em cause not only are they made out of low quality greening metal the fact they are “adjustable” causes them to break mine brok a few months after purchasing hers hasn’t but we both have to deal with the green finger thing i also discovered that they are thinly and unevenly coated in zinc for the silver color and the inside is brass i wear my ring constantly and it is now completely brass colored my wife doesn’t wear hers constantly and its still silver so if you get this dont wear them often and be ready for breaks and greening
3.0,A bit tight but I'm planning on fitting into it by summer
3.0,The buckle rubs on the toe
3.0,It was smaller then expected as I normally wear the size that I ordered. It is very sheer and clingy to the body..shows every curve
3.0,Stopped working after a month. Kind of disappointed.
3.0,"Love it, except it wasnt stated that it was not all sterljng silver....plated"
3.0,These are regular size folks.. maybe they are XL in China where there were made?
3.0,Great look.  Very thin sole.  Worn them once.  I don't think they will last long if I wear them a lot.
3.0,I have already purchased 3 pairs of yoga pants (medium)  from this company that fit perfect but they were not the boot cut. These are really too large and sloppy<br /> Surely not the same quality as the other yoga pants I bought
3.0,I'd size down 1 to 2 sizes.
3.0,"I mean it's a $2 necklace--you can't expect much.  But the chain that holds the long pendant really needs to be about 1 inch shorter--i might try taking some links out.  Unless you're wearing a NSFW top, that final pendant will hang too low to be seen"
3.0,Nice pants but I ordered a 10-12 year old size and my 3 year old is the one that is going to get these instead. Not sure what happened there???
3.0,"I got this hoping to have a super slim minimal wallet. It’s actually quite thick for what it can hold. The bigger problem is that the card slots are very tight. Even with nothing else in the wallet, the slots sheared the laminate off both my credit cards, and it’s a struggle to get things in and out."
3.0,For a Disney product this was a little disappointing.  The show fasteners are just tabs and come undone very easily allowing the show to fall off of the child's feet.
3.0,"Don’t like it , too big for me , not adjustable on the side , fits like a M/ L underwear"
3.0,does not fit smaller people.
3.0,I ordered an XL when I wear a large in everything else and it was still too small and the strap broke the first time I put it on.
3.0,"Good Idea, fits well on the k cups, but does not work in our Keurig 2.0"
3.0,Pretty earnings but much smaller than expected
3.0,"It's pretty. However, I feel strange on the same direction of both. I suppose the two should in opposite directions. Anyway, it has been shown in Amazon's production picture. That I had not carefully checked it."
3.0,"Looking back, I’m not sure what I was thinking ordering this oversized cropped casual hoodie by Siva. It isn’t what I was expecting and it might be one of the strangest clothing items I have stumbled upon. Before I go into further detail, I just wanted to say that I have a dress by this company that I really really like. I’m very confident that there are many items from this brand that I would love- unfortunately, this just wasn’t one of them.<br /><br />Next, I have no problem with the fabrics used. I like the light grey color. It is soft particularly on the inside, stretchy-comfortable. It is thin enough to be airy and flowy which I like. I can definitely tell I would have loved this if the whole cut/design/shape was just changed completely.<br /><br />Alright, so the part I don’t like- the way it fits/looks. I’m not really into crop tops, but I figured this could be nice to lounge in with a tank top underneath or something, but it still looks and feels way too strange because of how huge it is. The length of the arms is insane- I get that you are supposed to pull it up and it would have an oversized look, but it is too much. I would say it probably goes past my fingertips by 5-6 inches. Also, the arms are incredibly wide- so wide that with the hoodie being cropped it nearly creates a square shape when you hold your arms out to the side. It just isn’t flattering in any way- at least not on me. I saw another reviewer say something similar to this- it is like they made an XXXX-Large hoodie and then cropped it just below the arms.<br /><br />Would I wear this in public? Never.<br />Would I wear this around the house with people around? No.<br />Would I wear it around the house when I’m alone? It is looking like a no. It just feels really strange wearing something like this.<br /><br />A normal hoodie with this fabric would have probably gotten a 4-5 star review from me. A cropped hoodie that was not so incredibly huge everywhere also could have possibly gotten a favorable review.<br /><br />The fabric, I give a 5 because it is comfortable and breathable. I would give a 1-2 star rating based on design/shape/fit. To be fair, I will give a 3 star rating because it seems well made when it comes to stitching and materials. Perhaps this style just doesn’t suit me. I’m not sure what I will do with this hoodie now as it is basically unwearable for me.<br /><br />Anyway, I’ll be sure to update this review if I somehow find a way to wear it or use it. I can’t really recommend this based on my experience, but some people may actually like it. Like I stated before, please don’t avoid ordering from this company just because of this item, especially considering I have a dress from them that is awesome!<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’6” and about 145lbs. I usually wear size 6-8 pants. The tag says medium/large. I felt like I was drowning in this hoodie and yet very exposed at the same time.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!"
3.0,"very cute top, but not true to size, order a size bigger and it fits me tight... checked the size chart but still not accurate, overall, nice quality and very stylish top, received many compliments, 3 stars :)"
3.0,I used the size chart to determine size.  Way too small.  Had to return for a size larger.
3.0,"Cute but a lot smaller than I figured they would be, and I'm having issues unscrewing them to even put them in ... Not real sure they are with the price, considering they were delivered 3 days late"
3.0,This is a tight fit and does not have much give. Cute and worth the money tho.
3.0,"The white variety of these pants are pretty see-through. More acceptable as maybe a bathing suit cover up than actual day-to-day pants. Theyre still very comfortable, just cant wear them to work as i had intended"
3.0,These just did not fit my face well at all. My head is on the larger side and these were just too small. They were too narrow meaning the frames didn’t meet the edge of my face. Definitely for small heads ladies lol. Three stars because they are super cute in the pics and I can see how cute they would be on other people! Just not for everyone.
3.0,"I mean it's Yellowstone apparel so it gets stars just for that. It does not fit well, runs small and does t have much stretch."
3.0,The back part of the necklace always seems to make its way to the front of my neck which is slightly annoying. Its cute but I'm constantly having to adjust it throughout the day!
3.0,This shirt looks as pictured and so far appears to be well made.  I haven't washed it yet as I'm not sure I am keeping it.  I normally wear a size 2-4 in shirts and this shirt is very big.  The sleeves are about 5 inches too long.  Also the shirt is 80% cotton so not likely it will shrink.  If you have really long arms and like to wear over sized shirts then this is perfect.
3.0,Nice quality but needs to come in plus.
3.0,Seems like the screen print is a little thick for how thin the fabric is.  We’ll see how it holds up over time.
3.0,It’s so beautiful but the sizing was a bit off. I probably could have done better and researched the reviews more carefully.
3.0,"Came in quickly, and shiny like we needed, but size was smaller than stated online. I selected intermediate size 6x. Package on leotard delivered said 4-6 and closer to size 4."
3.0,"Good for narrow kid faces, age 11-15."
3.0,"These hoops were too small to even fit over my ear lobe, so be careful about the size.  They'd probably work best in a very small child or else a place where a very small hoop would work."
3.0,"I am only giving this 3 stars because i thought it was a thicker sweater than it was. However, when i went to look back it did say T shirt. So, hahah. It fits great and goes nicely for a light cover up or something. I like it and I am glad i made the purchase."
3.0,needs a third finger guard
3.0,Purchased for a birthday party. Let's face it......these shouldn't be expected to last forever. Our grandgirls loved them (two bdays in a week/sisters 7&4/combo party) and I have no expectation they'd hold up more than a month. Lots of friends and cousins to share them with. Purchase was mostly for effect at the party (complete each of their princess outfits) and if they get used beyond that....yay.
3.0,Not as big as i hoped but still cute
3.0,"Some stones missing when it arrived, returned it. They offered to send replacement, which was very nice of them."
3.0,Great dress! Only thing problem the dress was way lighter than pictured but overall cute
3.0,So wasn’t as long in the neck and the color is way faded but the material is nice. Very soft and keeps my 10 year olds ears very warm. He liked it!
3.0,"The gown arrived on time, packaged nicely. It is very soft & fits as expected. The problem is the color purple is pink. Every # matches up. Hoping there was a mix up somewhere. Our little one is a Purple kinda girl. The color was very disappointing!"
3.0,"The feel and design of this bodysuit was so nice!!! I was so excited to wear it - but when I tried it on it was way too tight and wayyyy too short to wear comfortably. I’m 5 foot 6, weigh about 140 pounds, and have a pretty long torso and a large did not fit. Other reviews said it was great for tall people but sadly this was not the case for me and I will have to return :("
3.0,Slipped with cold ice
3.0,Very pretty but fit a bit small
3.0,Arrived dirty and broken
3.0,"I started doing yoga (often times hot yoga) a year ago. I've been looking for a stay dry, snug fitting short that's long enough to stay put and won't ride up. I also wanted a liner so they wouldn't have to be worn over undies. This looked like a great choice. I did notice they make no reference to the inseam length in the ad, so I relied completely on the photos. When I received, they are shorter than expected...they only come a little more than half way down the thigh. (I'm 6' 1"", 185lbs. Ordered a large. Normally a 34W 32L pants...pretty normal build). Also the pant leg isn't really banded, so of course they ride up. Also, they have a very very thin little liner in the front only - totally pointless. Your man parts are very exposed. And anybody that's worn dry fit fabric and really sweats knows you have to have a lining in the back, lest you make other people in the room pass out.  Too bad. Nice fabric. I liked the waist band, and the panels are interesting. But the ad isn't accurate; and I'd really like to know where they get the models who must have very short legs...and why post inaccurate photos? That just irritates reasonable buyers.  Also you have to consider these unlined. If I had kept them, I would have cut out the thin front liner and just worn over undies...not what I wanted. My wife said the look of this length short is like a gym teacher from middle school. I give max of 3 stars and hope everyone considers these points carefully before buying."
3.0,Way too big. Sheer material
3.0,It was ok. I wasn't overly impressed with it. I went and bought a $5 dollar basic police cap which fit and looked better.
3.0,Fit great in the torso area but much shorter than pictured!!
3.0,"While i like the style of the dress and it is very nice pattern, the fabric is very synthetic feeling and not as stretchy and comfortable as some other dresses i have in this style.  Overall a nice dress though."
3.0,"They felt good when I put them on but they wouldn't stay up, kept rolling down"
3.0,I wanted to keep this one it was good
3.0,These are beautiful but the posts are very thick and painful to get into my ears. I wore them once but am not sure I can wear again without doing something about the thickness of the posts.
3.0,"it states 7.5 inches more like 8, too big will give to someone who can wear it."
3.0,Big in the chest small around the lower stomach .does not fall right.  Need some adjustments  I will make it work for me.
3.0,Was super comfortable but super see-through for the white tank🤦🏽‍♀️
3.0,"They look great until after maybe the second or third washing. They begin to pill very quickly, but the colors hold well, and only one has developed a small hole. I suppose they were okay for what the price."
3.0,"I am only giving this 3 stars b/c I didn't receive the R2D2. I instead got an Empire strikes back belt buckle. I will keep it, but I really wanted the R2D2. Just to much of hassle to send it back. I don't know if I will try to order again or not."
3.0,"Little on the big side, but maybe after a couple of washes it fit perfect."
3.0,Has a rubber sole.<br />Fit is spot on with sketchers sizing.<br />Ships from China and takes awhile to receive.
3.0,Overall fit is great. Very beautiful colors. The zipper is poorly made and likely to break. I was worried it would break before my first wear.
3.0,Material was a little thin but fits well.
3.0,"Cute dress, cute material.. love it. BUT- turns your fingers blue, color comes off very easily. Just make sure to wash separately and not sit on anything that you're concerned the dye will come off on."
3.0,"This is totally fine product.  I thought it would be hot, but it's not.  The vents allow air circulation.  I wish I had purchased a size larger."
3.0,"This is a really pretty necklace to look at! The seller's description states that it is 'turquoise' but it is definitely dyed. I accessorized this necklace with a beautiful black and white dress that I wore to church on Mother's Day. When I got home, I was horrified to discover deep red stains all around my neck and on the collar of my dress!! Luckily for me, I immediately spot-washed it with Shout and the stains came right out. This might not be the case with other fabrics, so be aware! Perhaps the manufacturer could put an outer coating that would prevent the bleeding from the dye of the necklace, as it is otherwise beautiful."
3.0,"After receiving the product, the first thing that came to my mind tha,  it wasn’t exactly like it was shown in amazon. The quality should be better, specially I expected foam or support on both side of the golves. Again, the quality is mediocre as it has started to tear from side by side.  This is not what I expected."
3.0,Necklace looks exactly as pictured but it's not made of a glossy material. The material is a matte opal color. It has no gloss or shine to it aside from the glittery opal. I was expecting a glossy opal and not a matte one.
3.0,Had this lanyard since June and it held up but at work I take my seat belt of and the face of adjustment slide comes off. 😲🤔 It last this long I got my value out of it.
3.0,It is smaller than expected. Doesn't fit like I expected.
3.0,The color is a little lighter than what is pictured
3.0,I always wear an XL t-shirt. Ordered a XXL just in case an it is still way too small!!
3.0,"This shoes very pretty. But is harts feet ,uncomfortable"
3.0,"Compression is ok, but would prefer all black"
3.0,"Simple concept for a basic dress. However, the material Is way too thin."
3.0,"It looked quite grumpy looking when put on. I thought I’d be able to cinch the waist with a cute thick belt, but the frills/dress design made it look very awkward. Unfortunately I’ll be returning this."
3.0,It fit decent a tiny bit too small but nothing I couldn’t deal with.
3.0,Love the pattern. Fit is oversized. Fabric is soft and comfortable.
3.0,"The retainer on the headband is very flimsy and broke the first time I went to wear it.  I sewed the headband in place to where it's comfortable and now it's okay.  I wouldn't buy another hat of this brand, but I like the looks..."
3.0,Runs smaller than described.
3.0,"This is a beautiful keychain, but WAY too big for a purse.  Consider the size when ordering."
3.0,"It is silky enough.  It is large enough.  My issue is with both the stitching and the performance.  The elastic is not sown to the fabric.  The fabric slides around the elastic band and bunches up in places.  The cap is fairly comfortable, except for the bunched fabric, but does not stay on my head.  I decided to try it out while taking a short nap and it didn't even stay on my head for a thirty minute nap.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning."
3.0,The dress was ok. It wasn’t as for fitting as it seemed online. I ended up exchanging for a different dress
3.0,I like the style and soft fabric but would order XXL next time.
3.0,"It fits nice but the letters bled and not cotton, but felt funny"
3.0,"I like the shirt, but when you wash it. It kinda shrink"
3.0,"This item came promptly, and in nice packaging.  It looks attractive, but the snap clasp will be the first thing to go wrong.  It is hard to snap and comes undone easily and is already pulling the leather.  But it is a huge upgrade from the dumb metal ones that you can buy almost anywhere."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8f7404e1fc93fd00268c6a6a29392f21]] I'm 5'3 and 240lbs. I ordered the XL and they definitely fit a bit snug. I can squat in these but the the high waist does tend to roll down a bit not much. The material isn't soft to me. I have fuller thighs so when I walk the material makes noise. I have to constantly readjust the waist area when I bend over or sit down.<br />If there was a 2X option I do believe these would fit more comfortably. Although a bigger size wouldn't take away from the material making noise when I walk but at least I'd be a bit more comfy. Also, the design stretches when I put them on since I'm a fuller body frame so they dont look like the picture which is not a huge deal for me."
3.0,I originally gave this 5 stars but now I Gove it a three although it is very pretty and I get many compliments I notice now the loop to hold the band down does not stay in place and the band isn’t holding up like I would hope it would .
3.0,Quick shipment however my necklace is already faded. It was cute.
3.0,The dress is runs very small. I wear a size 6/8 and ordered size 12 that was still too small. I should have ordered a size 14. The quality of the dress is good for the price.
3.0,The backs don't stay on very well.
3.0,"Cheap looking and tbh, you should spend more on sunglasses. The coating on the glass is very important."
3.0,"Order regular size and its s very snug fitting, not appealing at all"
3.0,"I'm wearing them, but they're quite tight all around &, contrary to what other reviewers have written, they really aren't very &#34;soft&#34; at all. I generally buy my PJ's from Walmart, they're soft & fit perfectly as well as being extremely comfortable. Not such a high price, to boot. Back to Walmart I go..."
3.0,"This t shirt appeared to be oversized, it’s not. The shirt seemed stiff and uncomfortable. It was body and did not look flattering. I felt the sizing was not true to size. I’m an XL in every shirt and ordered XL. I think between the sizing being too small and the style of the top, it didn’t work for me. Returned."
3.0,"The ear hooks are good, but the straps will only fit a slim, metal arm. They won't fit on your typical frames."
3.0,The shaft on the pin is a little long so it will not fit tightly on my hat.
3.0,It’s beautiful but I can’t adjust. It came with a tool for me adjust the size but no instructions of how to do it.
3.0,"The MINDENG Men's Black and Blue tie arrived from the seller very quickly in simple packaging.<br /><br />The tie itself was very nice-looking.  I really liked what I received, but was quickly disappointed when I noticed it had a snag in the tie.  I attempted to just have it replaced, but the only option was to return, so returned it.<br /><br />Again, it is a very nice looking tie and I really like the colors, but the quality of the material was lacking."
3.0,"This bra is fine, very low cut as expected and fit as expected. My only issue is that it gave my breasts a sort of weird shape. They looked sort of...boxy. Not my favorite, but might work for someone with a different natural shape."
3.0,"a bit bigger, but since theres a stringer on it I can make it a bit smaller"
3.0,not what I expected.  disappointed
3.0,The lenses were great protection for me. The frame however broke in the same place on both pair that I purchased. Didn't last a month
3.0,"Overall these are a little thin, and the have a stitched seam at the top and bottom that make it tight around the nose. They’re uncomfortable if you have a big head."
3.0,"Disappointingly a miss with these. I ordered the blue gray color in a size small. I'm 5'6&#34;, 135lbs, they fit but the top elastic waist band was a bit snug however the snugness of the legs was perfect. Unfortunately the color wasn't what I was expecting, to me it appeared to have brown along with the black in the heathering of the pattern which I could have lived with but the biggest disappointment is the dreaded see through when bent over, material isn't a thick dry fit and I'm sure sweat would show through everywhere because of the thinner dry fit material. They do feel nice and soft but I have too many workout capris that can't be worn to actually workout in so these will sadly be returned."
3.0,Kept comming un screwed
3.0,These are for a anime costume and they are fine.
3.0,pro: great colors<br />con: patchy and sticky
3.0,Update:The strap constantly slips out of the buckle and finally broke after a few months<br /><br />I love this bag! It looks and feels so nice. The one downside is it scuffs pretty bad even though I take very good care of it.
3.0,Well made; just not sized as expected.
3.0,"It looks like the photo in the model, but it is too big for a size small. If I could return, I would, but it will cost."
3.0,I wanted to like these so much more. They are well made for casual light wear. My issue was that they weren’t comfortable. I needed a 7.5 trying 8 that was way too bug and a 7 was too short. I tried orthotics in them but still didn’t offer the needed long wear comfort. But they’re super cute!
3.0,Wore out fast.
3.0,I really want to give this a higher rating but the metal on the sun is so cheap. It’s still pretty but I think I’m going to have to put a clear coat of something over it so the color dosent flack off or turn my skin green. The bar it’s self seems to be good stainless steal. Delivery was fast and well packaged.
3.0,The band was too big and the blade too long
3.0,I prefer the bands without the adjustable clasp that makes it more bulky.  I sent this back and got a stretchy one without the clasp.
3.0,the skirt is not as full as picture shown
3.0,"Fit up top, but it was very short and would not be work appropriate. The material is also very thin and staticy."
3.0,Pretty but sizing is wrong.<br /><br />I am a 5 1/2 so i ordered a 6 and I cannot even put it on my finger :(
3.0,It is not as quality of a piece as it looked to be.  The material is very thin but it does dance very well.  Just will not last long as it is not very good quality.
3.0,Bra is to small
3.0,My son has been obsessed over Mario lately and told me he wanted a Mario hat with a “M” on it. This hat was perfect and he loved it but unfortunately it didn’t come with the keychain and I was a little upset about that because I was wanting to put it on his Mario backpack. :(
3.0,This ring is somewhat small but I enjoy wearing it daily.
3.0,Love love love. Very sexy
3.0,"I purchased this product because I thought it was platinum. My skill is sensitive to most metals. I found that it was tungsten and it looks ok. I have worn it several times and got compliments. It is a solid conversational piece of jewelry. It would of used a bigger clasp. If you don't have anyone to help you secure it, it takes time to secure around your neck. I love the way it looks with sweaters and turtle necks. It was packaged well and arrived in safely."
3.0,"Really like the print. Unfortunately,  it stretches out throughout the day. Have to adjust multiple times a day."
3.0,Fit me but frizzed after 1 use
3.0,The shirt arrived very wrinkled. It's cute but also annoying because all day I was constantly adjusting the elastic to be on my shoulders as the shirt kept riding up. It is one size and overall fit me with an oversized look.
3.0,"Just not my style! The lace is not as soft and gentle as I thought it would be. I suppose it's just too young a style than I should be wearing.. It's a nice blouse, other than the lace is<br />Not as soft as I felt it should/would be the blouse is soft and fits well."
3.0,We purchased 5T but they fit more like a small 4T. Was only able to wear them a couple of times. Pretty faded by the time we handed them down.
3.0,These earrings are so cute and they feel very comfortable. I have multiple pairs of these earrings in different colors and I alway receive complements on them. The problem with these ones is that the pink coating started to come off after a few wears.
3.0,"This is a nice cap, unfortunately the shipping was not the appropriate, it was shipped in a plastic bag instead of a box that helps  the cap keep its original shape during the shipping."
3.0,Two ends brok trying to install them. Lost one of the Grey centers the first day. I was disappointed.
3.0,"I love this top, but it is SO small. Was hoping to be able to wear it with a highwaisted skirt to work, but it is very very tight and see through. Returning because I just don't have anywhere to wear it."
3.0,"The seems and patterns don't line up, cheaply made"
3.0,"Very awkward fit.  The sleeves are super long.  The material feels like a rug.  I love Velzera, but this shirt was a fail."
3.0,"nice look but, thought it was sweatshirt material...its nylon"
3.0,"Fabric is too thin on the white color, maybe in a dark color would be fine."
3.0,Smallee than expected.
3.0,Lower quality than I expected but I guess you get what you pay for
3.0,The metal connection where the strap connected to the body of the purse kept coming apart.  I fixed it with a little duct tape.  Otherwise I like the purse.  It can hold a lot besides my phone.
3.0,It’s cute. Made of. Made of swim suit material but it works
3.0,"It very pretty, but for an XL it's pretty short."
3.0,"When these leggings first arrived they were great, fit as expected, super comfortable, and I immediately wore them to the gym. A week in though, I found a huge rip from the crotch all the way to the back of the legging, so I guess they aren't as flexible as advertised. If you're doing yoga or using these for recreation it should be fine, but I don't suggest using them for squats etc."
3.0,"They look decent, I'll definitely be wearing these to the next music festival I go to. Only problem is a crack/scratch it came with."
3.0,Too small need two sizes up to fit like picture
3.0,The top fits great but the bottoms are too short
3.0,Costume jewelry or 4 going out not sure if last long looks type to fade in color cute.
3.0,These shorts are cute in the picture but are about 2 sizes smaller than what they say. I wear a 12 and I ordered a 12 and my sister was able to wear them and she is a size 8.
3.0,"This T-shirt looks nice but just doesn't fit well. I prefer a large T-shirt for the purpose of unrestricted movement in casual wear, yoga, dance, walking, working out, gardening, housework, etc. This back of this T is the perfect length to cover my backside, should I have chosen to wear it with leggings. The front however, is too long. That in itself would be okay but the shoulder area is a bit restrictive. Not too tight but I know I'll be pulling at it all day and there's no way, at 5'4"" /123 pounds, that I'll be sizing up to an XL...It would look like a dress on me. I'm returning the Large and moving on."
3.0,Fit is good. But the sequins are really scratchy and scrape my arms.
3.0,Very cute but ran at least 1 size smaller than expected.
3.0,"This arrived quickly and was what I expected for the price. It did break easily and didn't last long, but for the price worked as it was more of a gag gift than anything."
3.0,"It's so nice and very shinny, but I only got it 3 days ago, I haven't worn it and I own hundreds of silver jewelries. they all nice and shinny until they are not. I own so many jewelries so I rotate wearing them."
3.0,I didn’t expect to last long but when it breaks very sharp!
3.0,This fit wonderfully and looked amazing. But it is cheaply made the buttons for the overall kept falling out of the front
3.0,"I was very disappointed in the material. I found it almost impossible to get the belt into any decent ""bow"" shape because of the material type. Actually ended up wearing another dress to my husbands funeral."
3.0,"Note: I attempted to return this product, as I ordered it during a FREE PRIME SHIPPING and FREE RETURNS promotion, and when I attempted the return I got the message &#34;This item isn't eligible for returns&#34;. I contacted Amazon and waiting for a response.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality of workmanship is good for the price<br />Faux fur is of good quality (not the best, but decent)<br /><br />Cons:<br />The cuff is too small to fit over the top of my tall boots<br />The knit fabric is too loose<br /><br />Here are the dimensions:<br />Fur Cuff - 3.5&#34; High, 6&#34; across (making it approx.12&#34; total circumference) - it's tight on the part of my leg right below the knee and I have small legs<br /><br />Knit Fabric - approx. 4.5&#34; below the bottom border of the fur - it's loose"
3.0,"I was very happy with this product upon first getting it! The materials are sturdy and good quality, nothing fancy, basic & durable which is what I wanted! I couldn't wait to get it on! And it wasn't bad I guess for not being laced very tight last night when I wore it for an hour to start seasoning it. Well this morning I went to put it on again for day 2 of seasoning. I had a bit more time to spend with it and I went a bit tighter. Now I'm not as happy with it!.. I re-laced it so it was right, put it on & tightened it up. I got my waist down an inch and a half but when I look in the mirror the bottom almost can't go any tighter and I don't even have an inch up top or a half inch in middle to go tighter... so it's a size 29 instead of 26..... big difference.... I was supposed to be able to lace down up to 5 inches and it only goes s max of 2.... the boning IS plastic after all not spiral steel boning... besides the front edges where the hooks and buttons are and the back edge where it laces, the description said it had 22 steel double bones... (so we're up to 2 disappointments now..) and to &#34;top&#34; it off.. the bottom won't lay down flat on its own.... so I'm trying to train it to lay down flat with a wide sash tied around the bottom edge.. and idk... guess i wasted my money & I'll have to get another.... pretty disappointed...<br />I'm my pictures you can see it's of good quality and looks great! But you can also see that there's hardly any lacing left and my sash around the bottom... then the side-view picture without the sash.... it doesn't show how the sides poof up, which I'd be fine with if the front didn't stick out like that.."
3.0,"Watch face is yellow, but it should work for what I need it for."
3.0,"Adorable, on my 3rd pair though because they’re cheap & break easy"
3.0,"The dress fit ok except the waist line rides up as soon as I move, making the dress shorter than I want. May wear with leggins in the winter."
3.0,Came on time. Fits a little small. But it's great
3.0,"I WAS ON THE FENCE WHEN I ORDERED THIS BLOUSE. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN A SHORT SLEEVE, BUT THESE SLEEVES ON ME LOOK ODD. THEM DON'T SEEM TO FIT CORRECTLY. AND IT IS REALLY BOXY, SO YOU WILL HAVE TO TUCK IN THE FRONT. I JUST THINK IT IS MY BODY BUILD. I THINK ON SOMEONE ELSE IT WOULD BE GREAT, JUST NOT ON ME."
3.0,"I loved the color, but the chest &#34;puckers&#34; in an odd way and the sleeve/ scarfs aren't sewn in the back so although the photo makes it look elegant it ends up being two scarfs hanging from your shoulders."
3.0,To long for me 145
3.0,A little small. Haven't  tried on bike yet
3.0,"Overall I love this wallet/money clip. I just expected better craftsmanship for the price. When I received it, the money clip had a large gap and wouldn't even hold 3 or 4 Bill's securely.  I took it apart and it just from poorly drilled holes and alignment.  I fixed it myself and the clip is tight and will hold even 1 bill securely now! I just think that should have been done from the seller in the first place. PS, the card is great and really easy to access!"
3.0,I got color 19. It's very dull. Like if you left it out in the sun for too long. I was hoping it would be more vibrant. It's also a smaller scrub cap though it does fit.
3.0,"This is a SUPER cute idea and is well-made overall.  The thing that reduces it to 3 stars is that the flowers in front of the horn are glued on too low and slope down (on the one we received, anyway) and as a result the headband doesn't sit flush. Maybe it was just ours that had that issue? My daughter said it was uncomfortable as a result and didn't have anything to wear on spirit day."
3.0,"This dress is really beautiful and I got some really nice compliments when I wore it to a dressy family event.  The big big big problem is that the applique flowers started falling off and there were loose thread ends appearing within the first 30 minutes of wearing it.  If I had been near home or a store I would have left to get something else to wear because I felt like the whole dress was going to fall apart before I even got on the dance floor.  I know the dress was inexpensive but I just did not expect to have stuff come falling off of it.  Not sure if I can still return the dress since I did wear it  or if it is worth trying to reinforce the entire thing with my simple sewing skills.  Also, I am not sure if I just ended up with a bit of a lemon or if this is an issue with this dress period.  Like I said, the dress is really beautiful and flattering, but don't count on it holding up.  If it were not for the quality issue, I would definitely have given this dress 5 +++ stars for beauty and fit."
3.0,I love the dress thought it was going to be too short it fits perfectly!
3.0,This is a nice handbag but the zippers feel as if they're going to break any minute
3.0,"A bit smaller than expected, but it does fit. Very cute, but you have to take the think off just to use the restroom."
3.0,"I love that the house shoes have a grip on the bottom, however, the structure/fit starts to go away after a few washes in the laundry"
3.0,"A very attractive handbag and comes in nice colors.  I would have definitely kept this, but the hardware on the long strap is made of plastic and it broke as soon as I used the bag once.  Since I bought this purse to be able to carry over my shoulder often, I returned the item.  If the strap had held up, I would have no problems with the product."
3.0,"These socks are okay, but don't stay in place easily.  I've only worn them a couple of times, but it seems like they are starting to pill."
3.0,"Got these for my fiancé, the material isn’t as soft as it looks- they are warmer than they appear, and she wears them once in a while, but not what was expected. You get what you pay for, kinda"
3.0,I love the symbol just wish if it was not real that it was hypoallergenic. Cant wear it often because I break out in a rash. But I do like it!
3.0,Eyes are too close together - they pinch my nose.
3.0,Bigger than expected for a children's mask and the picture is slightly blurry.
3.0,I bought XL size since I have a 36'' waist but they are too small
3.0,Not as loose fitting as it looks in the picture.  Comes with the pictured necklace.
3.0,"I really like this sweater, but was disappointed to see that what looks like beige thread in the photos is actually gold metallic. I would like it MUCH better without the metallic detail. The description should really mention the gold metallic thread."
3.0,"The dress was a great fit, but it showed the &#34;girls&#34; a bit to much so I cannot wear this to work which is why I bought it. It's still a beautiful dress and great quality so I will keep it. There is no stretch at the waist so make sure you go by your correct waist measurements."
3.0,Cute for my Granddaughter.
3.0,"i love this purse, however looking at the picture i was expecting something bigger and its pretty tiny."
3.0,"It works as described..... my only problem is that there is no indicator to let you know when charging is complete.  Not the end of the world, but an indicator would have been nice."
3.0,It' a beautiful hat but runs a bit too small. Otherwise it's perfect for the cd weather.
3.0,Unreal. Faux.
3.0,"Too large, bigger size than expected, but they look nice for the price."
3.0,"Looks good, just a little small."
3.0,"This is cute and comfortable, but does not flatter a well endowed figure. It is somewhat short waisted, making for an unbalanced look."
3.0,"Fit and fabric feel are nice but the print is not sublimated.  This means that when it stretches you see the white spandex threads so it looks lighter when stretched. If the print was sublimated, when the fabric is stretched there would be no color change.  I will be returning for this fact since it makes it look worn out in the but and thigh areas."
3.0,My grandson looks adorable in it! Bright colors.
3.0,"Worked for four days. Needed new batteries, then digital malfunctioned."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful with a beautiful pattern and the material drapes and hides every flaw. I deducted two stars as I feel it’s important for the comfort that you know the neck is not as pictured. The model is wearing a dress with thicker wraps that tie beautifully in the back. What you will get is a string, which curls, looks unattractive and cuts into your neck."
3.0,"Ok- major error I guess on my part.. but, so others don’t make my same mistake- Lurex is a sparkly tinsel like thread that is sewn into the actual hat.. and I didn’t know or, expect it.<br />Bigger issue- this was intended for a teenage boy!! The actual hat it’s self is made quite nice which is also disappointing because, I’m looking for this exact tighter fitted KNIT style hat. A lot on the market seem to be Knitted- only end up loose fitting and bulky. Or, one can find a fitted knit hat but, it totally misses the mark as it resembles the look of a burglar or else, It’s made of fleece! Exactly what I’m trying to avoid and why my interest in this particular hat - This hat has a soft texture and seems like quality material and crafting- no loose threads, straight seams and really nice attention to detail. The best of all, it fits your head without the extra 1” of nothing left at the top.. or, the 3” roll of the outer brim- just to size it right. So, for anyone in need of a sparkly hat- this is a great choice!<br />One last thing to add.. the hat to me seems very seasonal or festive! Which could be nice as we are coming right into the holiday season... it’s definitely made for a female audience with a Christmas/new year’s vibe for sure! Not sure how but, I missed women’s in the description.. So be aware, not all hats are created equal!! I tend to think of a beanie hat as unisex... nope!"
3.0,5'8 240. Long enough but not stretchy at all. Got stuck at my butt -_-
3.0,Love my new Pandora crystal heart charm bracelet that's protected for a LIFETIME by Assurant! Wanted one for years and now it't's safely fastened around my wrist and worn day and night! Wanted this for years!
3.0,"Beautiful to look at, but once I put it on I was very dissapointed. The dress is about 2 inches shy of my ankles  which makes for an odd length."
3.0,These are so soft and warm. The zipper on one of these doesn’t work too good!!
3.0,"I suggest ordering one size larger than your usual.  Having had trouble with online bathing suit sizes before, (not matching the manufacturers' size charts) I ordered this suit one size larger than my usual 2x (Woman Within sizing).  The suit I received fits properly.  Thus, had I ordered my usual size, it would have been too small.<br />This suit has removable molded bra cups.  I happen to prefer NO molded cups in my bathing suits, so this worked out perfectly for me. (I had encountered suits with molded cups which were too large for me. i.e., I did not fill the cups)<br />If you like molded cups, however, be aware that the removable molded cups in this suit are on the small side.  They do not provide added support, but serve mostly to smooth the bra area (cover nipples)"
3.0,I have ordered a 1x in the past from Woman Within and that size runs large! I ordered a Large this time and its seems a bit small. I wish they offered an Xtra Large Plus size! HoHum...
3.0,I am a small female with small fingers and it was impossible for me to get the ball off to actually put it in my ear. Be warned.
3.0,"Nice shirt. Fit well. He just won’t wear it Bc it’s too hot and itchy. Also, white isn’t the greatest color for a wild little boy."
3.0,Not a whole lot of quality on the stitching. The design is pretty good. And I will give it give stars but the stitching failed on me on 3 of the masks.
3.0,I did not like the limited space
3.0,Wanted to like this but the cups did not fit right on me due to the sewing
3.0,The dress is not the same pattern as the picture. The colors are even different. Look at my pictures.  Overall for the price I end loving the dress and it fit well. I just wished the seller had put a disclosure that it would not be the same pattern.
3.0,"Too big, would like to return"
3.0,"The eye patch piece is attached with two tiny metal pieces. These pieces aren't built well at all, and come apart way too easily."
3.0,"I was ecstatic upon opening the package, it was very beautiful and sparkly and looked amazing for the price, but sadly after about three days the black started chipping off."
3.0,"I'm currently wearing this in bed as I type a review. I doubt I'll ever wear it elsewhere. The material is soft and elastic, although more snug fitting around arms and bust so less elastic in those areas. It's also VERY thin. It may be more flattering to ladies with hips and bottoms..of which I've got not a lot. That only makes for a nightie on me. I think certain shapes could pull this off as a dress to wear out, others of us may stick to bedtime or lounging around the house. I don't dislike it but wouldn't recommend unless you've got the shape for it."
3.0,"A little disappointed that the whole necklace is all balled up an in knots. Not what i expected, for what i paid on it.  Maybe next time it wont happen but happy with the product."
3.0,"Description is misleading. These are not a long leg boxer brief. They are the typical length of most atheltic boxer briefs, possibly with more stretch - I did not try them on since I was definitely returning them."
3.0,Returned - the pants were huge!
3.0,"This handbag looks exactly as the picture shown. I was truly surprised only that the canvas material is very very wrinkled (and they appeqar to be permanent). I don't know if that is exactly what the designer was going for. I love the size of the purse and the color combinations. It holds a lot of ""stuff""! The price saving was great...saved over $400! I will more than likely keep it because it is the unexpected ""wrinkles"" that make it something others may not like but I find different & interesting."
3.0,Morning Sun  .. These are no better than my sunglasses ... haven't used them at night against headlights
3.0,"Little small, but works."
3.0,this looks great in the picture in the material quality is pretty good however the size of the pendant makes it a little large for the average guy or average female to use without it appearing to be oversized and flashy.
3.0,bought 2 pair / First strap broke within 3 days--&#62; plan to return / otherwise comfortable / hope the second pair lasts
3.0,Not my taste. Very colorful. Not unattractive but didn't match my outfit. Also I ordered a size larger because thats all they had.
3.0,"Ran a little bigger and stretchy. Material was not really was was expected. But, it’s 98% Cotten, so I haven’t thrown them in the wash, and hope that they shrink a little to fit better. But, they do look nice.. so, we shall see."
3.0,"The pins are fine, they have a weird-ish texture and look kind of faded but I bought it for one specific pin, the one of Kurumi holding the demi girl pride flag, it came quickly and I received a transgender pride flag version instead. Sad but at least I have the other pins which by the way are EXTREMELY small."
3.0,"Cute pants, LOVE the way they make my butt look, but the waistband warps and makes it impossible to wear them."
3.0,The strap is really tight
3.0,"The case looks super cute but doesnt offer any Shockproof, this is just a clear plastic case with no cushion in case you drop the phone. I drop the phone alot so this doesnt work for me. I'm looking to protect my phone."
3.0,"Very pretty haven’t used yet, the kit I got with them didn’t have the right needle size."
3.0,Chains turned black and gave me a rash
3.0,My wife bought this but it was too long. This would have been a great photo op for our family but I didn’t like that it was low on her cleavage. Color was great but not a great fit in her.
3.0,Its hard to rate these cause they were too big. I even measured ahead before i ordered. They seemed warm which no other glove has for me but unfortunately i had to give to my fiance. If they offered a size small i would get them for myself and be able to full try.
3.0,Writing is super small and you can barely see what it says
3.0,"Thin, not as long as advertised."
3.0,"The red ""jade"" looks, and feels like its plastic.<br />My kids even told me that it looked like the candy jelly ranchers- how embarrassing!!!<br />However, I do like the color of it...<br />I wouldn't buy it for a gift or suggest someone else to buy it. Maybe for a kid only."
3.0,not very warm.
3.0,I had to fix it. One of the links were damaged.
3.0,"I Thought I was buying a medium, but a large came. Not a huge problem. As a seamstress I can alter it. But the dress is long in an unattractive way. Stops mid-calf. Fabric is stretchy and forgiving."
3.0,it's okay. you get what you paid for. nothing extravagant but you can definitely dress it up and down.
3.0,"I ordered a s/m which was way to small...so then I ordered a m/l  which I was able to get on barely!  The sizing on these are so off it is absolutely ridiculous!  Don't order them!  Don't be the fool that I was, thinking that I would figure out the sizing...because you will be wrong...just like me‼️"
3.0,"Great patterns, but are much too loose to be used as neck gaiters, which is what I purchased them for."
3.0,I’m 5’2” and 120 lbs ordered a medium and it was too small
3.0,I read the reviews on here before I purchased this & I decided to roll the dice. The quality of it is pretty good but the size is much smaller than the description
3.0,nice fabric but way too small/clingly
3.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; tall, so lots of things are short on me.  This is a good tunic length on me. Colors are a bit bright for me, but they do work great with linen khaki slacks."
3.0,"Although a pretty piece, the quality is not the best. Very light weight, edges are a bit rough."
3.0,"WAY TO SMALL!!  It's a cute top, but definitely a size too small :("
3.0,It's pretty oversized. I have couple XL- shirts and they fit much better and smaller than this L-sized shirt
3.0,very very small!! might see if I can make a toe ring out of them
3.0,It's decent.  The suit fit my 11 year old (average height and weight) a bit too exact so we gave it to our 9 year old.
3.0,Kinda smaller then expected
3.0,It's cute... It's not like my silver one I ordered from another company thru amazon...ill probably only wear it a couple times.. Looks like it's gonna tarnish quick.
3.0,Pretty!! A little thin. Adjust easily.
3.0,"Ordered 4 of these and you never know if they are coming by size or by their ages - which I don't like because age is not a standard size and the smallest one came in a smaller, different bag from the rest and was missing the belt"
3.0,"I'd probably not have bought if I'd  realized how big these are. Ican use them, bnut would much prefer a smaller pair"
3.0,"I wasn't expecting much, and I will say $9.xx is way too much to spend for something with hot glue smears visible on it - that looks like it was made of the type of fabric you'd see on cat ears bought from the dollar store.<br /><br />This is for an 8 year old's Halloween costume though, so I don't mind too much. You can see the ears are of two different sizes. And it's all black rather than having white as pictured (which personally I prefer). But if it were for my own costume, an adult, i'd find this entirely unacceptable.<br /><br />Really I've bought better sets of ears for $5 at target or for $3.50 from bulk stores online but then I had to pay $5 shipping for those."
3.0,The look is good (for an Indiana Jones Halloween costume)  but the quality is definitely not great.
3.0,Es algo delgada la tela
3.0,Very very thin material but quite cute and exactly as pictured. I kept because they looked great on me.
3.0,If it was not so small. It is 1 inch from top of loop to bottom of anchor. A hat device is much better.
3.0,"These are look super cool, but sadly, the back of the earring came off and one earring was lost."
3.0,Don't get if you have boobs.
3.0,"Very cute bag, but fell apart at the straps. Used it for several months."
3.0,"Shoes looks cute, just adorable. But they are very cheaply glued together, and not always perfectly. The inside sole was out when I opened them. There was a wierd ball of fabric on the inside of shoe we finally figured out was supposed to be under another piece of fabric inside the shoe. Finally got it &#34;wearable&#34; but very hard to put on two year old who can't help much. We bought the next size up and the next pair had almost all the same issues but because they were bigger they werr a &#34;little&#34; easier to get on. He liked them once we wrestled them on him but not our go to pair of boots cause they are such a pain to get on him."
3.0,"I bought this to wear to opening night of Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I needed something quick and reasonable so this was the cheapest I found, I was hesitant at first but I decided to jump the gun and I have to admit I’m glad I did. I was surprised to see that it was actually officially licensed Wandavision Branded. It is bendy metal, a really good material though. I loved wearing it! Though I must say the parts that go into your hair to secure it were poking the behinds of my ears all night, so it’s definitely for people with longer hair but that’s kinda my fault lol so on my end it’s a 3 and a half star rating, it looks and feels fantastic but the whole wearing thing wasn’t the best for me lol"
3.0,"2 rips in crotch area after 1/2 hr of wearing. It's a quick fix, but that's not the point. Otherwise, love them!"
3.0,Is nicely made. Dint know how it will hold up since I just got it. Holds adequately your stuff. They could of made the back fold strip a little wider so when try to put a picture holder in it and you fold it it closes fully.
3.0,"No wonder they don't show any straight on point of view in their advertising pics. These are well-built glasses and they sent me exactly what I ordered. The quality is definitely beyond what I expected. However, they're pretty ugly. The shape isn't pleasing to my eye they're roundish where they should be squarish and if squared-off where they should be round. Looks are subjective so I'm not marking these down for that. I am however removing two Stars for not providing a photo to show a straight on point of view... this was clearly intentional."
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings, however I received a very light purple instead of the pictured dark, deep (almost blue) purple. The light purple one's are very light and not as vibrant looking as the dark ones appear in the picture. They seem fairly sturdy, instead of cheap-looking. They are sort-of larger than expected, but not too large. I do like them, but I would have preferred the color that is pictured."
3.0,"They do the job, but the colors are kind of dull. The gold looks absolutely nothing like gold, but the silver isn't bad. You can't really see the glitter in the black one. I like the teal, coral, and white. These are comfortable to wear."
3.0,Died today....
3.0,The image appears backwards.
3.0,Cheap leather. Wears easily
3.0,"this necklace doesn't lay flat, it bulks up."
3.0,"It’s not made of good quality material, and the color wasn’t as pictured. The fit was also a little off, which I think is due to the material. I was going to return it, but the shipping was half if what I paid."
3.0,I wasn't a hug fan of this shirt. I wore it once and length was somewhat short for the size I ordered.
3.0,Was darker than I expected
3.0,Fit kind of funky in the chest and shoulder area.
3.0,"Love the pocket - it's so nice to have when listening to music, wearing a dress or pocketless pants us woman have to suffer through.<br /><br />Ordered it in black - True to Color<br />The fabric is normal t-shirt soft<br />Length and girth could be improved, I like scarves that can act like a turtleneck, this is more of an accessory - it will not keep you warm. - thus the minus two stars - I wish they would make this for winter weather - but otherwise it's a great tool for the wardrobe."
3.0,The legs are huge more like a skirt. The pants are much shorter then shown in the photo. The string inside the pant leg that gathers the side works well. Fabric is thin bit seems well made. The first deliver date was almost 5 weeks!!! I contacted the seller and the pants were delivered in a week.
3.0,"Havent ues the strap yet. it is a spare, not exactly like the current strap on the eye glasses but looks like it will work"
3.0,I order a black one was not the same thickness as the brown one love the brown one. The black one did not have a tag on it either
3.0,"I am 5,8 which generally wears a 32-33 sleeve length shirt, and the sleeves are too long. Not really a knock on the jacket as it is well made, and looks great, it is just not sized for us shorter folks."
3.0,I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and they are a little tight on the toes. I washed them and put them damp on a pair of clean shoe soles (not tennis shoes) and they fit better.
3.0,"Got the right size and sis not fit me, gave my 36-38 to my friend with a 32-4 waist fit him fine"
3.0,"This is a decent knock-off of the dress shown in the picture. Top's replication isn't bad but the skirt's material is way thinner than the photo presumes it would be. However, dress is priced accordingly so I guess it's fair?<br /><br />Photos with and without belt are attached. Note the back is see-through lace and you can still see the shape and lines of my bra under the front of the dress.<br /><br />Furthermore, the dress arrived with a funky smell.<br /><br />Sizing help: I'm 5'2&#34;, 36D, ordered an XL. Fits well across my chest and length-wise, it falls about 3-4 inches above my knee."
3.0,"Nice thick product, but sheds green dust literally everywhere. Cant really use it because of this."
3.0,"The vest is well made. Just make sure of your size requirements. I am not in anyway overweight. I wear large size vests comfortably routinely ( I do have several). This ‘large’ fit tight. It goes on w/o trouble but you feel embraced, not straight jacket captured but way too snug. Given my dimensions I say you need to be pretty slender for this to fit nicely and allow for any under clothing. That said it is a nice product. I did not return it. The wife is a seamstress and she’s added additional fleece and a truly flexible gusset"
3.0,"Good socks, but I thought I was buying a smaller size. The product sizing is not clear in the ad."
3.0,Very pretty earrings but one broke immediately.
3.0,"Lengthwise it fit just like the picture. I'm 6' even and 155lbs, pretty thin, so wrapping the robe snug mostly covers one of the pockets. Belt loops are too high for my liking and it feels like the belt is right below my rib cage. Those minor complaints aside, it's exactly what I want in a robe-- ankle-length with a good. And as the title says, it's very warm."
3.0,"The patch is worn and missing boarder threading in several areas, was using this patch on a Blues Brag Jacket, probably won’t now"
3.0,"We ordered two sizes for our girls. One is a C0 and the other a C2. The C0 was the same length and wingspan as the C2, just narrower. The C0 pants were actually longer than the C2 pants but narrower. I’ve ordered a replacement for the C0, just hoping this one item was tailored wrongly. I loved the lightness and the quality of the fabric other than the off sizing."
3.0,"Shipping took forever even though it said Prime. They did respond quickly when I messaged about it. The fit was ok, nothing to get excited about. There’s no tags so it’s a guess if it’s front or back."
3.0,The bag came missing a few rhinestones but still very cute
3.0,"Love the scarf, still wear it - I got the white with black polka dots. 3 stars bc it's not like picture: the white not really white in person; more like light-ivory"
3.0,"It's just okay, not great. Love the color, shape and sized , but the straps re not good. If they are not snapped into place so they won't slip then they are too short for an adult. I'm not even a large adult!"
3.0,"This shirt is... well best off a halloween costume top. The material is thin and almost plasticy feeling. The top is quite shapeless through the body. Being a large square with elastic on the top. There are heavy crease marks which are really in there. Washing and drying didnt take them out and im afraid to iron it because of the plasticy material. There is no front and back side marked. so you kinda guess based on the sleeves which are unevenly belled out. While you can wear this over your shoulders. i pushed it up around my neck for comfort reasons. It makes it really short in the body. I think the material was supposed to be soft and silky like. But it just comes off cheap. It snags easy which is a bummer. In any event tit will work for a halloween top. But just not for every day wear, not for me."
3.0,I’m a flip flop wearer. These were nice in appearance but the bands are very rigid plastic with no give and cut into my feet. Return was easy and went with a similar more comfortable pair
3.0,Lasted only a few weeks.
3.0,Seems like decent quality but made in Honduras . Same material as fruit of the loom . The name Joe's USA hoodies is misleading.
3.0,Cheap as expected for the price but I don't mind these falling and breaking which is what I wanted.
3.0,"First off, the dress seems great as far as fabric. However, I can't say much about the fit as it was way too small. I just reordered. Will update then, but most likely will have to go up two dress sizes."
3.0,"Very small. Doesn't really work for my septum like I wanted but that maybe because I have a big nose, however I love them for lip piercings! Works well for snake eyes!"
3.0,"Smaller than I expected.  They are not 10mm as advertised, but maybe 9 or 8mm.  They should be fine, however."
3.0,I gave it three stars because I don’t like the material but it’s a cute workout top. It can fall off the shoulder if you’re doing a high cardio workout. The material is more like a bathing suit.
3.0,Ideal for summer
3.0,"Beautiful purse, but too small to fit an iPhone 6"
3.0,"I finally received my bracelet. After wearing for just 5 short minutes, the links broke. You get what you pay for. It is super cute and I can probably fix the links with a pair of pliers. Also, the bracelet is long enough that you can wear it loose or tighter."
3.0,"In this case, 2X does not mean 2X"
3.0,"The dress was really cute,  but it was very short! Im 5'10 and it was mid thigh for me!"
3.0,These are very heavy and give me a headache. They were as depicted.
3.0,Tge shirt is small for its size
3.0,daughter liked it but it fell apart quick
3.0,"I normally wear a small which is what I ordered and it was too big for my taste. But if you like your clothes loose it might be perfect for you. If it had been smaller however the seam where the arm attaches to the body of the shirt would not hit so low on me. This made the arms look baggy and unattractive. The photos are a bit deceiving and don’t expressly show off this feature of the top. It’s only noticeable when your arms are up though - as you can see from my pics when arms are down it looks like a regular sleeve. Material is thin and what you’d expect for the price, but otherwise cute. I might like it better in an extra small."
3.0,"As everyone says, suit is great, accessories are trash"
3.0,"Pretty cheap material and only for indoor and/or bath use, in my opinion"
3.0,Quality of material not what expected.  Unpleasant &#34;rubbery&#34; odor
3.0,"There super cute, my daughter loves them but the backs are not clicking in and staying. Bout half the backs slide off... so we’ve lost 2 earnings so far. Not sure we’ll keep them, she’s not having a lot of irritation but the metal doesn’t seem to like her poor ears, so might have to go a lil more expensive route next. Otherwise they a adorable, she loves the Kat and all the unicorns."
3.0,"These are pretty; I have received compliments on them. And they are lightweight, easy to breathe through. On the downside, they are so lightweight that they get into my mouth. Lots of loose threads too, that become annoying and unsightly."
3.0,Impossible to keep them more than 30 seconds in the mouth
3.0,product is much smaller than normal sock sizes
3.0,I'm on the fence about this item. On one hand it is a super cute print but the pressure is not what you expect at 20-30mmHg. Although they do have some compression it feels more like a 15-20mmHg
3.0,I purchased these for PC gaming to use with a 16-button mouse but these are terribly ineffective even when used with a console controller. On top of how I received my pair the left hand ring finger had a seam already coming off and the index of the right hand is already losing all the seams. Compression is nice but not worth the lack of usability in the gloves. The smartphone pads on the middle/index finger as well as the thumb do not work well as I had them barely work on my samsung galaxy s7+. Would not recommend getting these gloves<br /><br />Was contacted to get replacements as well with the older model but both were still not helpful when using them on any mouse over 5 buttons and not easy to use with keyboard as it is hard to move fingers quickly with the rubber pads on fingers but A+ for caring to put the effort in to fix the problem
3.0,"I loved these socks at first, especially since I have a habit of rubbing my big toe against my &#34;middle&#34; toe, but the quality was sub par. One of the dragon designed socks had a hole rip open after only a few slip on's, and the second one is starting to show signs of ripping at the same point as the first. The third pair, the grey one, is doing well for some reason and thats why I didn't give this two stars. Its a shame, because they were awfully comfortable and fit well."
3.0,"Love it, just too small for me."
3.0,My thick thighs kinda bulge out.  Hoping I can stretch them out and they'll still stay up. Cute tho
3.0,"Love the color.  I wanted over sized, order a size up but it shrunk so my Med went to a SM.  Bummed!"
3.0,"Neckline to low for me, returned the dress."
3.0,"Overall my girlfriend looks great in it. The XS actually runs a bit larger, she’s a size 2-4 and the dress doesn’t form fit. Also it’s NOT white, it’s off white at best, almost verging on a very like cream color."
3.0,"Always loved tye dye. Saw this, $5-10 cheaper than others similar. So ordered.<br /> Not really soft. Top fits perfect. Comfortably loose. Shorts a bit tight. (I need to lose a few lbs anyway.) Elastic is tight, not easily stretched. Length ok for around apt. Inside of both are solid white, so dye didn't go thru...?<br /> Main thing... It took 2 mo. If not for being cheaper, I'd have cancelled. I told my family- I guess they had to sheer the sheep, process the cotton, sew the garments, dye them, then pkg and put on back of someone, and have them swim the pkg to USA.<br />What happened to ""Made in USA""? Absolutely nothing I buy online or by catalog says it."
3.0,Cute but heavy earrings
3.0,Pin at the pivot protrudes.
3.0,"The shirt is soft and good quality, but not true to size.  I recommend to a size down."
3.0,Good fit- wish it was more form fitting. Almost like a bathrobe.
3.0,"It so long to come in and when it did it was way too small. So sad. I live the red color but the size was very off. It’s confusing because I bought it in white and got a size large and it was huge, so..."
3.0,Purchased these for comfy stuff pant to wear around the lake... the run big so order a size down.
3.0,I didnt realize that they were bigger in size. Almost to big for my ear.
3.0,"Shorts are really big. I ordered a large and really would need a medium. I'm 5'5"" 150 lbs and the shorts are too big."
3.0,"It is difficult to run on these since they slip  quickly. not great for running, which is what i bought for."
3.0,"I received this sweater dress shirt, okay not sure how I would describe it, through the Amazon Vine Voice program. I followed the size chart, and I am not liking the fit. It is ill fitting and waaay too big overall. The material is very, very thin. I would not wear this in public unless it was used  as a beach cover up or something along those lines. I can't fathom wearing this as a dress! It is made with reasonable quality so I plan to just put it on after a shower or something to lounge about but it doesn't flatter my physique by any means. I think this item needs a redesign or something. And, it definitely fails to resemble the image in the advertisement."
3.0,Unexpectedly poor quality but appropriate to low price.
3.0,"The scrunch isn’t very significant.  Offers some definition but doesn’t really make the booty pop.  Colors aren’t really the same as pictured either.  Still a cute pair of pants, just not as expected."
3.0,Too small for the size I bought which should have fit her
3.0,"I'm not a fan of the fit of this dress. It is not as flattering as it seemed in the picture. It's tighter in the bust and the skirt is fuller than I like. The buttons are functional and run the length of the dress. The fabric has a slight stretch to it but is not a pleasant texture. I have an issue with fabric texture, so this is important to me. The best I can describe it is cheaper polyester.<br /><br />Just not a fan."
3.0,Pretty nice quality for the price but runs very small
3.0,"This is a very pretty necklace, however it is a bit small for an adult to wear. Great for a child."
3.0,"The gloves feel very well. However, they tear very easily while trying to out them on."
3.0,The design of the dress is really neat but the overall fit I don't care for.
3.0,Super cute but is way to small. The fabric is stretchy but clings. The girl in the pic must be a size small but wearing a L/XL.
3.0,"I cant wear this ring, I ordered a size 6 but got a size 9!"
3.0,It's cute especially for the price but i wanted it to be a cross-body bag but the strap is too short for that. Just fyi if anyone wanted to use it as a cross-body.
3.0,Much larger than expected.  Don't buy unless you have a really long neck.  Still very pretty
3.0,son liked it
3.0,Nice size case with unique design protects glass's well.
3.0,The Velcro wasn’t the best and it ran larger in size but other than that it was super cute and the material was great quality!
3.0,Comfortable for the most part the width is a big problem though.
3.0,Runs a little big at waist
3.0,It was decently thick but once washed it is see through.
3.0,"Pretty design and material but was looking with pullover with pockets. It was a fake pocket, just a zipper no pockets."
3.0,Material not AS EXPECTED. I am returning it.
3.0,"These just don't stay up, and do NOT look like leather.  But the price made those issues less of an issue for me personally.  I used them for a cosplay, and was planning to make some minor changes anyway.  The leggings served their purpose, but I probably won't wear them again."
3.0,"Because you no longer have this in a small size I had to order a medium.  This is sad as I love the four others I purchased.  The fabric is perfect, comfortable and never wrinkles.  I reduced the stars for this reason."
3.0,"I am an RN, and pregnant at that, and noticed the swelling in my feet and ankles would worsen by the end of my 12hr shift, so I decided to try some compression socks. I purchased these cause they were less expensive than the Nabee socks that I saw and purchased and thought to compare them.  Both are 15mm-20mm compression and both were for shoe size 11, and since I'm 6ft tall they both reached me right below my knee.  These nurse mate socks were roomy in the toe area as advertised (as were the Nabee) but I found them a little too snug across my arch area and a little too tight at the top part below my knee. They also didn't really reduce the swelling in my feet much and were not as comfortable as I would've liked. But I'm not sure if its because they were so snug across my arch that the swelling looked worse or what.  In comparison, the Nabee socks were INCREDIBLY comfortable and left my calves and feet feeling massaged and energized the entire shift! I forgot I was wearing them to tell you the truth and at the end of my shift I had NO SWELLING!!  I bought these same Nurse mate socks for my mom who is a Housekeeper in a busy nursing home, on her feet for 8hrs a day 5 days a week, and has started to experience swelling in her legs. The size was the same cause she wears a size 10 shoe but is about 5'5&#34; tall, and she raved about them saying that she doesn't have swelling after wearing them!  So I'm thinking maybe the nurse mates socks are too small for a size 11 and should consider making them in an X-Large size cause the Nabee socks were an XL for my shoe size and they were great!"
3.0,"This is a really cute hoodie but it runs waaaaay too small.  I'm normally on the small side of medium.  When I tried to zip this hoodie up, there was a 5&#34; gap between the two edges.  There's no way it was going to zip.  Because I was in a time crunch, I ran down to Dick's to grab some spirit wear.  I ended up with a long sleeve t-shirt in L, which was really more clingy that I would have liked, but I was desperate, and a men's XL zip front shirt/jacket (I'll wear it as a jacket) that was just roomy enough over the t-shirt.  I don't wear a men's XL!  My husband does and would never have fit into it.  I think everything is made in China now.  Their sizes and ours are completely different.  The US distributors need to come up with a better way of marking the sizes, especially for mail order."
3.0,"In the image, the bra is white under the beading. You can especially see that by looking at  the straps. I wanted and expected white to match my skirt. The bra that came was a nude color. Not much shows with the beading, which I expected, but some does, so it's not as I'd prefer.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's pretty average for this type of top. Relatively forgiving of body types within the constraints of size availability, sturdily beaded. A pretty good value for around $20."
3.0,"I purchased this locket to put a picture of a loved one that enlisted in the military.<br />I received the package a week before it's delivery date, which was pretty cool. It came in a pretty little blue box and was packaged pretty well. Honestly, it is a pretty and cute little pendant. The only problem I really have with it is that it isn't practical for actually putting a picture in. It's a lot smaller than I expected, and doesn't come with a photo template, so make sure you look at the size dimensions, something I failed to do-"
3.0,smaller than we expected
3.0,This shirt is really cute but it's so long I may wear it as a dress. It is form-fitting at the waist and I love the design but It's definitely longer than any shirt I've ever purchased.
3.0,Love these. Have a different pair. But bummed with this pair the sole of one of the socks started to peel after the first wash. Other pairs I have are great though.
3.0,"The black chain is kinda crap and the black finish just looks like painted gloss. I'll be etching it when I can, so I wonder if it cracks."
3.0,"These were too big for my shoes, so they took up too much space in the suitcase. Should offer smaller size for women's shoes"
3.0,"It is a nice shirt, but looks like it was printed in someone's garage."
3.0,"I can't complain too much for the price.  The fabric was kind of soft but not really what I would call soft.  It has a semi-plasticy feel like I would expect from a leotard but the fabric was very thin and revealing.  I actually probably would have liked it if it was more true to size.  I got an XXL which was supposed to be XXL: 16-18 Bust:44""- 46""; Waist:35""-37""; Hips: 46""-48""; Girth:64""-66""  The bust felt more like 43"" and the waist was nowhere near 37"" more like 33.""  I soft of expected it to not fit or at least be super tight but it was much worse than I expected.  Another reviewer said it was very comfortable but I didn't find it comfortable at all but it wasn't bad in any particular way.  I think if it had been 1 or maybe 2 sizes bigger then it would be more comfortable but I didn't really like the feel of the fabric on my skin.  My main thoughts are you get what you pay for and for the price it is a decent leotard"
3.0,"I really wanted to like these sandals because they're very cute but there's a few issues that made these unwearable for me.<br /><br />1. I have thicker calves, and these sandals are impossible to get on. I was only able to fasten the two bottom straps and then had to give up. There's not enough strap material and on top of this the holes for the fastener are too far in.<br /><br />2. I've had gladiator sandals in the past but the version I had featured a continuous strip in the back with a zipper so you didn't actually have to fasten every strap. These only have the continuous strip in the front so you have to literally fasten every strap — which is really annoying.<br /><br />3. The gold finish is nicked on the straps especially around the buckle area. From far away you wouldn't notice it, but it makes me wonder if the gold finish will flake off over time."
3.0,"Arrived fast. But sizing is off. Just a tad to big at wrist. Otherwise, they are good."
3.0,The price of these were not bad but I was kind of disappointed I have a big head but these seem to be stretched out already and hard to keep them on my head so I had to end up cleaning them which with other raps that I have bought that are already together I have not had to pin them down.
3.0,Fabric is a little thin at the sole of the foot. Definitely not as warm as I expected but they do let your feet breathe. Slouch on them is perfect.
3.0,not bad but doesn't always keep water out...
3.0,"This is really a pretty skirt and the fabric seems like a good quality.  Unfortunately I have to return be I'm 5'2 and it's way too long. I would've hemmed it but even though the fabric has some give, the waist has no stretch at all and I just found it really uncomfortable."
3.0,"The earrings are pretty, but smaller than I thought they would be.  Perfect for little girls but too small for adults."
3.0,"As soon as I opened it they had the STRONGEST plastic smell ever. Some of the openings were too small and I could fit chapstick in them, making them useless."
3.0,This pj set is cute but the fabric is rough and the elastic on the cuffs are uncomfortable
3.0,"I love this top, however, I did not like the way the collar fit, but overall it's a great top"
3.0,"About 5 inches too long, even with heels on (I am 5'6&#34;). Also, there was a hole o, the back about the size of a quarter."
3.0,"Somewhat large but was not able to return it since they had made adjustment when I ordered the dress. Hopefully, I can give it to someone that can use it"
3.0,Very pretty. I wore it everyday and after a few weeks stones were falling out.
3.0,In the picture it showed a lighter color. When I received the dress it was a darker pink. I also ordered another dress in the same color. It was a much lighter pink like what was in this picture. I had the dress altered at the order so I couldn’t return it. They did disclose that to me about not returning if I made alterations at the time of order. The alterations were fine. The color of the dress wasn’t like in the picture. Before you have alterations done online make sure the color and style is what you want.
3.0,"Generally,  I liked the product and its features.  For running  however, I  feel like suing for lack of support.  Once the inner lining became soaked, we lost containment of the boys."
3.0,"The bottoms fit great, however the top is too small.  It would be nice if we could choose the sizes separately.  It is very cute though."
3.0,"The dress was really cute.  The Med was perfect for me. Unfortunately, it was missing the belt. So I can't wear it until I find a replacement."
3.0,"Because it's european sizing, there wasn't an inbetween for me. 40 was too small up top and 42 was a little big on bottom. There also isnt much breast support, so it made mine look a little droopy."
3.0,Doesn’t fit well. Size not accurate. Poorly made
3.0,Wasn't quite what I had expected.. But still love it!
3.0,I was expecting more darkness in the glasses
3.0,Strap was too loose. Had to take a tuck in it. Now they fit well and are very comfortable.
3.0,sits a little too. covers all of eye brow
3.0,"I'm regularly a Size M but this one is too tight maybe due to the &#34;crop top-ish&#34; style, I wear it anyway"
3.0,Product arrived completely smashed and very wrinkled in an ENVELOPE<br />not a box.<br />I had to steam it and In doing so feathers fell off<br />I had to glue back on
3.0,Nice looking shoe but when I opened the box they absolutely wreak of cigarette smoke. If I didn’t absolutely need these for a wedding I would definitely be returning.
3.0,"Hat fits ok, a little snug for my fat head and I chose the largest size. I'm going to give it a month to try and stretch it our but if it doesn't work I'll end up donating it. It's crazy warm though!  And sturdy material. I'd give it a 5 if it fit better"
3.0,Not what I expected. Large fits like a medium and martial is thin and is not cotton.
3.0,"Ordered these so we could keep a few spares in the vehicles.  Not sure what size head they should fit.  Way too small/tight for my husband, who has a ""standard"" size head.  Too big for my head, keep falling down.  Have to use a small hair clip to hold in place when trying to wear them.<br /><br />So, one size does not fit all.<br /><br />They are easy to breath through, and not super hot when wearing."
3.0,"Beautiful, well made but hard to keep on."
3.0,"Overall I liked the style of this watch, however, the bezel was a rose gold, and the accents were yellow gold.  Didn't really care for the two tone look."
3.0,I purchased this watch at my local Target and not even 48 hours later the watch band was turning blue from my jeans! I know its a $20 watch so no biggie but just an FYI...other than that its a decent watch for the price.
3.0,the fabric has no stretch to it and the cut of the dress is very straight around the waist and I just wish it was more on the fit and flare side? idk
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Very inexpensive to buy, very cheap looking to wear."
3.0,"Stated sold “as a pair” but I only received one hoop. Disappointed in only receiving one when I expected, and paid for two. Been wearing for about a week and no skin irritation so far so at least there is that."
3.0,It was very pretty but didn’t come with the handband
3.0,"It's pretty big but with enough strength you can bend it in a little.  And it looks a little cheap, but not really"
3.0,"VERY tight!  You will think they won't go on but they will.  They give you a nice shape.  However, I already have a run in the black pair (I got the black and gray) so now I don't feel comfortable wearing them :("
3.0,It is extremely thin and is very see through.  Fits somewhat small.
3.0,One pair had a hole in it that was there when it arrived...disappointing
3.0,"Bit too big, might actually return them..."
3.0,Really enjoyed it! Didn't come with a battery though! So that was dissapointing
3.0,"I previously bought two of these belts and they lasted me a year. I felt I got my money's worth on a cheap belt, so I reordered. One of the two I ordered just won't stay. The ratchet keeps unbuckling like the stopper isn't low enough. I don't have this problem with the one I ordered last year. I haven't tried the second one I bought yet. I'm giving three stars because I haven't tried the second belt or tried to return this one or anything. If I have any trouble there I'd give a lower rating."
3.0,"This is a BEAUTIFUL shirt....if I had a redo,I'd order a size up....the sleeve length is short. Other than that,its prettier then the picture,and super versatile, with a nice weight."
3.0,"the printing is only on one side. it is a good print though. soft, sturdy, and they tie well too."
3.0,These are okay. Get blurry from time to time. Fits true to size.  Doesn't turn finger green. Using it as a replacement from my last nushe ring set.
3.0,"Material wasn’t as thick or stretchy as I expected. Gray color is much darker than shown, which mean the dot pattern is barely visible."
3.0,Lovely skirt. Love that it's mostly lightweight. The problem was the zipper kept unzipping 😬 All day long. Finally I had to sew it up halfway..
3.0,"Cute shoes, but they hit my arch in a weird way and are narrower than expected. I've worn them in an office setting a few times now and I can get through the day in them without issue. I don't think I'd want to do much more walking in them than an office setting entails though."
3.0,fit good but pants too long
3.0,"The material is nice, and it's good for holding travel things. Downside is that dollar bills don't fit in the pockets; they are too long. Using it in England with pounds is ok, but would have been better if it fit American money."
3.0,gave it to my granny.
3.0,"Bought as a fall/winter dress because of the long sleeves, very very thin and kinda cheaply made."
3.0,"Looked great, but looked really bad once I washed it. Had to return it."
3.0,"As some people have noted, the material is a bit flimsy and will not last very long. Still, the gold is a pretty accent color and the pattern makes it easy to size the belt exactly for your fit. There's not a good way to tuck the excess so I ended up trimming the end of the belt to my size for a perfect fit. Definitely don't wear this to any event where you expect to bump into things a lot, or you'll get snagged by the edges of the belt and it may rip."
3.0,"The only downside to this band is the cheap ""rose gold"" metal. Also, the notches seem to be a little off... with the regular Garmin band the watch came with, I don't have any gap and it also isn't too tight... it fits me just right.  But with this one,  one notch is too loose and another is cutting off my circulation."
3.0,These are cute but they are not good at all for  absorbing sweat during the work out. They are single ply fabric and quite thin. They also run small. It was very tight on my head. I am 5 foot 10 though so tall for a woman.  I am returning them.
3.0,Pink is too sheer and is see through
3.0,Fit fine.  Sent them back as they were too lightweight for what i was looking for.
3.0,"I was so excited to get these to use while snowboarding because they had the uv and fog protection. I just opened them and my first reaction... dissapointed.<br /><br />Although they look cool, they feel really flimsy. I am afraid that I would nose dive and they would break. The padding on the inside is seriously a piece of  foam padding so it feels scratchy on my face.<br /><br />It does have adjustable band to tighten an loosen which is nice. It is nice that it came with a case and cleaning cloth and it did protect from the sun because they are dark. I don't know about the fog resistance because I havent tried it.<br /><br />However, I did put them on my 5 year old and they fit. So I just gave them to him."
3.0,"Thought it would be a little bigger, the case itself is huge, but barely fits my ray bans which aren't big sunglasses."
3.0,It's just a regular men's shirt with the front cut into a V and then strings criss crossed. Nothing special.
3.0,"Band is ok but the heavy glaze/shine on leather almost makes it look and feel plastic like. Rather stiff leather as well. Hoping after some wear it will break in and lose some of the heavy shine. After seeing it, I wouldn't have spent this much for this band."
3.0,not user friendly for ederly person with arthritis
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes larger, it fit. The material is a bit stiff and thicker than I thought. It is ok..."
3.0,"I'm not that big in the bust, but this was very snug. I wanted to return it, but missed the return date by one day."
3.0,"I had to return this, unfortunately due to it being too small. The corset itself was absolutely stunning and the craftsmanship of the brocade was gorgeous. I was sad I had to return it but will be reordering in a bigger size. I ordered a size up, but I found it runs very small and will have to try 2 sizes up. Looking forward to trying a different size because this corset is so beautiful."
3.0,I'm sad this dress didn't work out. I've been looking for a t-shirt dress that can cover what I got so I'm not flashing anyone. I think the quality is great but the fit just isn't tall girl big booty friendly. I'm 5'7 and maybe 220. I'm a medium/large on top and bottom usually 16/xl. Super cute just wish there was more coverage in the back. Fabric is a 10/10 it feels so nice.
3.0,I’m 5’6” 165 and a large fits well. My only complaint is how high it’s cut in the front and back. I personally like more coverage. If you’re modest like me you may not feel comfortable in it without shorts over it. Really like the fit of the top though.
3.0,"Very wide, boxy, and short.  Returned"
3.0,"very light, durable and thin. holds all cards in place. A little rough to take out but not a bad struggle like some people have in newer wallets. since it's still new I don't know about its longevity. I did rip a $20 bill though trying to take my money out from the band. One thing I do not like is having to Tri-fold my bills."
3.0,"It’s ok for a middle schooler. I ordered the pink, thinking it was mauve pink. It’s not it baby pink."
3.0,"Thought would look a little different, the material is very lightweight."
3.0,"Ok - so I gave this 3 stars because 1: I did not get the extra battery which bums me out and 2: It is not quite as pictured. My wings are the same brushed bronze as the snitch as opposed to a silvery color. Also, it did ship from China although I thought it would come from US - however, upon reading the seller's profile they do say that this might happen. The chain is close to 30 inches. It is a cute conversation piece. I was planning on using it as a christmas tree decoration (and may still have to if I do not get an extra battery). All in all, I would order from this seller again."
3.0,"I love the flowy satin, but I had to return them because they are so pointy that they pinch the sides of my foot a lot!  I have a pretty high tolerance for wearing high heeled shoes, but this one was just too much for me.  Maybe someone with a narrow foot would be comfortable wearing them.  I also noticed there were tiny sprinkles of excess glue on the tops of the satin folds, probably because it is difficult to create the folds without using globs of glue.  I wonder if the folds would last in the long term.  Worn as occasional evening shoes, they might last awhile."
3.0,Shorts are comfy and well padded. The pocket is *just* big enough for my iPhone 7 and can still be closed with the Velcro. Only complaint is the fabric has 0 stretch. When straddling my bike when mounting I have to hike them up a bit to swing my leg over because of the lack of stretch. 5 stars if they could make them with a stretchier fabric.
3.0,They kind of fall apart after a couple wears.
3.0,"I like the overall styling of this skort, and is generally comfortable - however the shorts do ride up my legs a bit and I do regularly have to pull them down."
3.0,Liked the looks of this hat. Won’t stay on even with the chin strap in the wind. Too large.<br />Disappointed.
3.0,Runs really large
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:243c6a3fe4d5d2ee9aac292e3995de34]] Like the color and fit of dress. It snug on the body, but not to hoochie. The only issue is that the split is in a weird spot, on the back side. So definitely can’t trip in this dress."
3.0,"Seemed like a ""Second"" quality item."
3.0,good fine mist. no ugly odor. it took so much product to get a decent stiffening
3.0,"First off let me say this is super cute and fits pretty true to size. I gave it a 3 star bc it has ZERO support for your chest, there's no under wire or anything to hold your girls up. I'm a 36C and the top seems to be made for girls with no chest or small chested girls. My boobs kinda hand out the bottom."
3.0,No es muy buena la calidad
3.0,"Don't like the case! Wish it had a sturdier one, because it's gonna need it!"
3.0,Pretty but not confortable to use in hot climate
3.0,I got a large and normally I'm a size 10/12 but these were a little snug.  Otherwise I like the look and the price.
3.0,This shirt is more of a crop top than anything else. In the photo it looks like it’s long enough to cover your belly but it’s straight crop too when you get it. I ordered a medium and that issue
3.0,The belt quality is very nice and as expected. The length of the belt is too long. 48 inchhes. Screwed it up trying to cut it to 34 inch waist.  My fault. But they should offer proper lengths. However I knew the belt was 48 inches. It was on the web page.
3.0,"The hat is beautiful, however, I ordered 16009_Beige (1 large bow) and I received 16008_Beige (3 mini-bows) and a couple of seams on the mini bows are partially unfinished."
3.0,"Really nice hat, but, i wear about 7 3/5 and it is really tight."
3.0,Too small😕
3.0,Way too much materials at the bottom.
3.0,Ordered a size up but it was still too small in the bust area. Order 2 sizes up.
3.0,"Way to small and I followed the size chart, I looked them over thought they were quite nice but missed the return deadline,,so hear I sit with PJs I can't use and I only wanted to exchange them for a larger size. I still wish I could as I really liked them the are real pretty,  s&h went well. I sure wish they fit."
3.0,"These are thigh-highs, not full pantyhose."
3.0,I was expecting a new coat but revived a used coat its not in bad condition. But it had someone ski pass in the pocket I paid for new not used
3.0,THIS WAS SMALL --- A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED VERY TINY ! PRETTY THOUGH
3.0,"small in scale,but seems to be made ok"
3.0,"They were a little bigger than I imagined, and some of them are extremely painful to keep on because the end digs into the skin. Out of the pack, only 2 weren't painful to put on and stayed on. The others, for some reason, caused a lot of irritation."
3.0,Quality is good but sizing runs large. I found them too baggy and long for a size mens medium.
3.0,Pretty color but the style didn’t look good on me.  I didn’t think it was flattering.  Nice material.
3.0,"Nice sandal but they were too small, a size nine fit more like a size 8.  returned them and bought something else at the store thinking a 10 would be too big."
3.0,"Bought these for my mother - a size too large. She returned them and I got a refund, but we spent more on return shipping than I paid for the jeans.."
3.0,Very cute and seem to be well made.  They lack compression.  I have to layer these tops due to lack of support  and sheerness.  Was hoping for some degree of compression.  I’m small busted and can not imagine wearing these without layering
3.0,Small and snug in the arms. Passed it on as a gift to a woman half my size.
3.0,"This was a little big on me. I had to tie it so tight that it looked really bunched up and awkward. For reference I’m 5’5”, 118-120 lbs, 32B."
3.0,"I ordered this top in army green, however it was more brown than green.  It was also way too large for someone who usually like a larger fit.  I am 5'4, 170 lbs and it was at least an extra large in the fit.  Returned"
3.0,"Lovely shirt, but not actually button down."
3.0,They are great for phones.I bought them to play my games without my fingers hurting.They were great the first 2 wks.Now they don't even grasp the screen.Too bad.I really needed these.
3.0,"I've only worn this belt once.  It fit comfortably, I'm a size six usually. It was a good deal."
3.0,I'm wearing it but the part that made it so unique was the filigree overlay and it popped out and went where ever the missing socks go. It also turned to a copper color pretty fast but I did not keep it out of water or soap. So you can say I didn't follow directions but I'm still wearing it. To be honest the copper color doesn't look bad anyway.
3.0,Chain is an awkward length. Would have liked it to be much longer. Tardis looks nice and is a nice size.
3.0,"I ordered these in two colors. They arrived quickly. The clarity on the tortoise pair, was somewhat distorted in the non-bifocal area, and one side of the black pair twisted when putting them on and taking them off."
3.0,"Fits my 14 year old grandson good. Me no, to small and very tight."
3.0,These earrings are very cute and I expected them to be on the small side and they are but I like that they are not heavy and don’t weigh my earlobe down I even had that sent to my sister and she likes them also. Their size would probably fit better for a young teenager.
3.0,I wanted a true tan color sweater but this is not it. It had so many wrinkles that I have to have it professionally dry cleaned to remove them. It also had lots of shiny marks from where it was folded. I hope they can be removed with the cleaning.
3.0,"I bought three different products from this brand. I just received my orders and wanted to give 5 stars for this earing but its color already came off. I wouldn't expect 18k will last forever but this is new so I assume that I got defective item. Sad. Other than that, earing is pretty. A bit bigger than I expected tho. Looking for a replacement."
3.0,"This is a lovely shoe, but the front is somewhat uncomfortable. I don't think I will be able to walk all day in these."
3.0,"The pants do not fit baggy at all! As someone who is 4'10 and read the reviews, I fit into a size 8, and honestly could've stood to go up 2 sizes in order to get the baggy look. The waistband to crotch length is fairly far too, not sure if that's the style"
3.0,Wife purchased and she said they are too small for he hair.  She has shoulder length hair and they dint stretch enough for her hair.
3.0,Adorable! Runs small ! order a size up
3.0,Did not fit as I expected. Style did not look good on me.
3.0,"I love the look and the feel. But they roll down on me during workouts. I don't know wether they are too big or small,maybe but they do roll. But the design is adorable..."
3.0,I like it bit is a little bit to long for me!! Is just sitting in my closet 🤦🏽‍♀️
3.0,"Inexpensive way to change up the look of my Gear watch. Decent look from 3 or 4 feet away.<br />Up close, it has a slight beige tone that is just a shade off from the brushed silver tone of my Galaxy Gear.<br />Good deal for the money!"
3.0,See headline.  Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"I want to buy these but people have been saying theyre too small, im 5, 1&#34; and 107 lbs, but my thighs arent the smallest thing on my body but im trim, would these fit or not?"
3.0,It doesn't look anything like the picture. It's a small sheer like fabric similar to chiffon. It's still pretty and is a decent length but not as large as the picture made it seem.
3.0,"I used it for a costume. I wanted to return but, free amazon prime shipping wasn't available, so I ended up just using it. I probably won't wear them again. It's kind of cheap."
3.0,The skirt was cute. The fabric cheap feeling. The waist band was very tight. Had to return.
3.0,"I thought they would be scrunchier and thicker than they are. I feel like the material feels more like a pillow case than a hair scrunchie. I’m not a big fan of how thin the band is, I wish it was bigger in width and had more material that was scrunched up so it would be fluffier but they’re still cute enough to wear for fun. The band is slightly not tight enough to sit on my wrist but I have really small wrists so it’s not really the bands fault."
3.0,Beautiful set but returned because bracelet was too small
3.0,"Nice fit, but no stripes on sleeves. The picture shows stripes on the sleeves. Their are no stripes on the sleeves, but the shirt looks good and fits right."
3.0,I am not pleased with these. They dont look quite right.
3.0,"Looks pretty much exactly how it does in the pictures. It’s just too revealing for me. It’s also weirdly shorter in the back. Also, The product pics are stolen from hello molly."
3.0,Its well done but very thin
3.0,Skinnier than expected
3.0,It's a nice dress. but shapeless. If you like a non-form fitting dress you would love this one. I just thought it had a little more shape to it.
3.0,The dress was a Medium. It was too small. Recommend to order a bigger size.
3.0,I'm suze small. Bought medium and still barely got it on. I love the design so I am going to return and try large which would be 2 sizes bigger than what I normally wear. I will update my review.
3.0,"it runs pretty small and i sized up 3 sizes. the button sometimes comes undone , maybe due to weak stitching. i think you could probably find a better option, but it’s an alright product. i decided to keep it instead of returning it because it’s decent, but make sure to size up."
3.0,"This is a beautiful top.  It does have a snug fit especially around the neck area. However, I'm nut sure about going up a size because of the side of the top that is cut out. I did keep it."
3.0,"I really love the way this jogger looks and fits. I love the pockets and how the legs are perfect, not too frumpy yet not to clingy and restrictive. However, there is a very uncomfortable (for me at least) piece of elastic at the top back portion of the waistband that is hard, thin (in width), but also thick (in girth... it's hard to explain... instead of a flat, stretchy, soft strip of elastic, this one is like a hard stretchy square tube) that just kills my back after wearing for a few hours. I'm 5'2"", 114 lbs, 27"" waist. I ordered a small, which apparently fits fine, and the waistband can stretch quite a bit past my waist if I pull it out, but it is just super uncomforble and feels like it's cutting into my back after a while. Sadly, it's going back."
3.0,Not the quality I expected.... Very thin and not at all what I thought I had ordered
3.0,These are beautiful. My biggest complaint though is the earring post bends very easily so I am constantly straightening the post.
3.0,"Returned, too small . tight and too short.  But the material was nice and the I lived the design, just didn't fit."
3.0,Love the colors and how light the bands are. I also love the fact they fit my small wrists with out issue and do not irritated my skin. I feel like its not there. Plus the fact I have that ability to change the colors at any time is amazing.<br /><br />Downside: the bands did not come with the locking pins to to the the watch. I had to destroy my old band to get the pin for these. If they all came with lockingbpins I would have given this product five stars. Other than this issue the products meet all the standrs and stuff I was looking for in a band since getting my Samsung watch.
3.0,It's fits ok. Just right around calfs and I got x-large and it's nothing like picture bug I love them but I'm going to order a different pair so I can feel comfortable all around
3.0,"Very nice outfit, but definitely not true to size…I ordered an xl… but it’s more like a medium"
3.0,simple and nice
3.0,I love the momo brand but my baby girl has narrow feet so these shoes /sandels don't fit her right.
3.0,"My 13 year old did like them but I wasn't as impressed. The fabric was a brighter red than expected. Also the fabric was not what I expected.  Lastly,  the fabric around the ankles is not as snug as pictured. Oh and the pockets are smaller than expected ."
3.0,"For the price I guess its ok. I wouldnt say cheap, but there is always some risk. I did read all the reviews, but no pic that showed how it look. actually dont look how it shows. Mine come a bit defective, I don think I wanna waste my time doing exchanges. there was some stiches come pulling off when i opened the package. So I am sure when u wear it, better be careful ask well."
3.0,"I am typically a XS-S and figured the small would fit fine. It fits more like child sizing, the arm length was very short. sadly I will be returning it."
3.0,The lines on the smiley face are 2 different thicknesses and there are random black stings In the slipper
3.0,it was for myself but i'll give to some 1
3.0,Felt like it runs a little large. Should've ordered one size smaller.
3.0,"I typically wear a medium in gloves so that’s what I ordered. Too small, should have ordered a large"
3.0,"I ordered the EA1 dress.  Its super cute and I really like it, but be warned, that this dress is see through.  You will need a slip dress underneath.  I thought the dress was already lined or came with a slip dress because the girl in the photo is wearing a white one underneath, but that is not so. Also, I don't think this dress is 100% linen, it doesn't feel like linen.  I think the cost is a bit pricey for the dress, but I'm going to keep it now I need to look for a slip dress underneath to wear."
3.0,It's see through way to see through for me. I had to return it. O think it would be fine for some people but I'm looking for maternity tops and you would definitely be able to see my pregnant belly through this top.
3.0,"I like the material and color; unfortunately, the suit is too large with a lot of padding in chest area.  I am returning it for a refund."
3.0,"Love the color and glitter and fairy hot princessness, but the top is awkward.  For someone with a larger chest (D cup) it fits decent, but if you also have a booty, it doesn't seem to correlate.  Then my friend tried it, fit perfectly on her smaller booty but was too big and awkward on her smaller chest (B cup).  Soooo big boobs and smaller booties, guess this is the dress for you!"
3.0,Not a bad apron but I've had better. Very stiff and course. Strings are not very long. I guess it does the job tho.
3.0,Not the best quality - I would of been willing to pay more for better quality.
3.0,Cheap material not big arm friendly .. nice idea .. the xl fits like an xl
3.0,"I got these for work at a summer camp that doesn't want counselors to have visible piercings. They work well for the purpose as the clear plastic just blends in with my skin, but I wish these came with some sort of fastener as it's very easy to lose one and not notice. One major strike is that the shipping is ridiculously high, ludicrously more expensive than the product. I cannot believe they actually cost that much to ship, and the shipping cost should not be doubled when ordering an extra set. It's not like two of these tiny plastic parts weigh that much more than one does, and you'd have to order them by the hundreds to make up even a pound of shipping weight. So why are you charging so much for mailing???"
3.0,Cute dress. My daughter loves it. However it did have a stench. I had to air it out.
3.0,The cuff on the piece will need to be adjusted to your ear. Ye shipping was fairly fast.
3.0,The material is a little thin for quality and price
3.0,Very cute and I like the style.  Problem is I could only use it for several months because the clasp cracked and fell apart.
3.0,"These are lightweight.  I wish that I had up sized 2 sizes, instead of1 size (as recommended).  If I were wearing the duster over just a slip, one size up would be okay.  But I want to wear pajamas, or sweats underneath, and I think 2 sizes up would have been better."
3.0,I didn’t like the quality and returned them
3.0,"silver setting was fine, the stone looks cheap and obviousy plasti"
3.0,"It's a really bright yellow, almost neon yellow..definitely not mustard like the pictures. Bummer. It's really light but the fabric feels slinky and clings to your body."
3.0,"I like these glasses, but I can't recommend them. The hinge broke and I bought another pair. The hinge broke on them, too."
3.0,"These run very small and do not stretch.  I thought if I wore them for a day they would stretch and be comfortable, NOPE.<br />They do seem warm though."
3.0,It's better than the C4 Corvette I bought at about the same time. Sold the car; kept the hat.
3.0,Thinner than i thought but still like it
3.0,"Gorgeous but runs small. They didnt make returning it a problem so far but its truly a beautiful ring,  I just bought a bigger size. I usually wear 7 - 7 1/2 but the 7 didnt fit. I bought the 8 hoping it fits but there was no 9. We'll see how it goes."
3.0,Beautiful vibrant color. The chest is very revealing.  Doesn’t fit quite like I expected though
3.0,"This is s nice looking, good quality sweatshirt; however, the patch on the front is extremely large and very stiff. Sadly, it had to be returned"
3.0,I ordered the red and it was not red. It is more of an dark orange or orange reddish. It’s very thin which will be great for summer. I’ll still keep it since I can make it work but beware. The color isn’t true to photo. I took a picture with a true red shirt under for reference. Size is a true to size.
3.0,I wanted to love this swim suit. Its so cute in person.<br /><br />But its not for girls w big boobs. It gave plenty of side boob action but not enough comfort to know that if I made a sudden move that my girls wouldnt be exposed. I bought a large at first. Then I bought a medium thinking that the cut would be different and it wasnt. Sad face.  Returned both.
3.0,They are cheaply made but cute.
3.0,"Nice for the price.  But needs to be larger diameter.  Although the length is as advertised, they will not fit on an average adults wrist comfortably if at all.  Recommend to manufacturer to increase length 1 - 1 1/2 inches.  I just clipped it to my hiking pole lanyard so I am still able to use the compass and fire starter."
3.0,"They are not as dense as the pictures seem to indicate. A bit short, or at least not stretchy enough to stay on top."
3.0,It’s a great shirt and I’ve bought Gildan shirts before but this small is like a little boys shirt. I cant wear it but not going to bother with a return. Sadz!
3.0,Loved this the first time I wore it. Shrinks pretty bad after the first wash though so super sad about that.
3.0,"Sometimes  it stops, have to reset  and shake it again"
3.0,"Size up. Material is nice, but fits me more like a medium than a large. I might order an xl and see if it fits better."
3.0,"The dress is well-made and is super soft, but it looked more like a nightgown in person. Cute, but not for me."
3.0,These are a cute shape but I bought 2 pair thinking they had the blue light filtering and they don’t so they were returned.
3.0,"So this watch is HUGE. absolutely HUGE.<br />The directions and manual came in broken English, it was poorly translated.<br />The automatic pendulum sticks, as well.<br />Unfortunately, this seems cheaply made overall. I'm disappointed in it.<br />I tried to replace the watch band, but the pins themselves aren't the right size. It just all seems wrong, and thrown together.<br />I don't generally write negative reviews, but I was overall displeased."
3.0,"The wig is similar to the one in the picture, but very, VERY full.  The amount of hair of course makes it difficult to brush, but I intended to cut it anyway.<br /><br />For the price, the quality is not bad.  And the wig looks good, even if it's tangled to heck.  I've tried combing out the curls, and they always come back, keeping the form given.<br /><br />The color is the same in the picture, but it has the dreaded plasticky shine.  The bangs are shorter (but I have a monster forehead, so it might just be me).  I've gotten higher quality kanekalon for about the same price, if not cheaper.  The cheaper stuff doesn't tangle as bad, but doesn't feel right."
3.0,Bought to wear in freezing temperatures but doesn't keep hands warm. The gloves are stiff not very comfortable
3.0,"This shrug was cute but I returned it as I’m not that confident to have my stomach out. Looks looser in the pic and I got the XL. I am bottom heavy, 5’6”, 185lb"
3.0,"The Watermelon Red color is beautiful, but the skirt came with some rips in the seams."
3.0,The sole part and top starting to separate. Used a little glue and its fine. Wish they had smaller sizes.<br />Good price.
3.0,"This is a ""spandex type"" material and pretty large/long. For what it is the quality seems to be very good, I am going to keep it because I may get used to it. I am still trying to find a good way to make it fit and still look presentable."
3.0,They are super cute but aren't meant for those with wider feet like me. They fit tighter than I though and now won't wear them for work. 8hrs in them sounds awful
3.0,"I'm 5'6 108lbs and the bottoms of a small fit me fine. Unfortunately, I have a small chest (34b) and the top was a little awkward fitting. The cups are very small and worked out, but they are not adjustable behind your neck. So the suit hung too low. I'll have to cut the straps and figure out a way to add string to them so they can be tied."
3.0,"Cute, but it’s thin and way to short to be worn as a dress."
3.0,It’s cute and comfy but short where the side knot is and almost looks nightgown-ish.
3.0,Cool design but material is too thin to wear as 'mask' but this should be ok for riding bikes/motorcycle. the edge is not hem so it rolls when you try to put it on.
3.0,I ordered the tshirt after going through the size chart but received size is much larger than expected.
3.0,I bought these after so many of my fellow moms recommended them to me. I must admit they were one of the only swimming shoes out there that fit my son but they were so flimsy. They were falling apart after 1 wear. They did last us the whole summer season but by the end of it they were looking pretty rough.
3.0,Nice but the inlay sticker image isn't very sharp.
3.0,Have not used it as yet. but it seemed ok
3.0,very sheer material<br />i wouldn't recommend<br />Fit to tight for me
3.0,clumsy and feely kind of weak. we will see
3.0,It's a cheap watch but it's okay. I like bracelet watches & can't afford high end watches.
3.0,I find the attachment thing jabs me in the temple.  That being said they are the only ones I have ever found to fit my very wide glasses.  so I have to need to wear them to put them on.  So just ok.  Like the style though.
3.0,Very large. I got the small and I'm swimming in in. I'm 5 foot 3 and about 100 pounds. But I'm using it to work out in so it fits it's purpose with a sports bra underneath.
3.0,Disappointed this dress was extremely pretty. I washed it on delicate and it fell apart. If you plan having this to wear more than once place in dry cleaners to clean.
3.0,"They are a decent material, decent length, and have a good sized phone pocket. Problem is the fit is weird. The interior shorts roll up and won’t stay put. Not the worst if you just need cheap black shorts with a big phone pocket, but not the greatest either."
3.0,"Great fit at first - but after light use in the pool with kids, and washing on the delicate cycle, it is not holding up great... and it’s only been a couple of months."
3.0,Will serve it's purpose. The white outline of the tree is pink.
3.0,Classy looking but my fit bit flex shakes around a lot in side. But I think if u made the slot any smaller it wouldn't be as easy to put it in and take it out
3.0,"These are very cute and a good price, but they aren't made to hold up. The heel especially is very cheap and impressionable, just trying mine on caused them to get little dents in them!"
3.0,Necklace is super cute and quality is as expected for the price. The fact that it came tangled to the point where it took me 30 min to untangle to wear was disappointing.
3.0,Only one hat.
3.0,"If you think you wear a large, check the sizing chart because the sizing is not U.S. sizing. It is much smaller for much smaller women. The outfit is nice. It is very sexy and great for clubbing. You will want to go out to the clubs in this outfit."
3.0,"I was really excited to get these. I had some tie underwear from Victoria's Secret years ago, and wanted some again. I don't have an overly large behind and barely any hips so I figured even though they were one size fits most, I'd be good. I was wrong. I should have taken into account they are a product of China, and I'm severely obese compared to their most. The panels are a very soft lace that leave little to the imagination and are so pretty, but there just isn't enough of the panels to allow them to be sexy on my body. The construction of them is of high quality, which I wasn't really expecting at this price. I'm upset that they did not fit properly because I was super excited to wear these for my husband. They do tie easily, and it is aside to tie before putting them on. I would recommend these to very small hipless friends and family.<br /><br />I did receive these underwear at a free or discounted price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. Had they been larger, I would gladly pay retail for them."
3.0,"I've purchased Corclova Polarized sunglasses at AMZ for years. Really love them.<br />I wear sunglasses all year because I have corneal dystrophy and light hurts my eyes.<br />So I purchased these to see how they work.  The frame is really too big for my face, they do not come in a hard protective case and are too large to fit into a Corclova case.  The case that comes with this is just a bag with a drawstring.<br /><br />Perhaps they're OK for you.  I'll spend over $100 at my optometrist's office for those wonderful wraparound blue lens sunglasses.  Corclova was good enough to keep me happy.  Motine is not."
3.0,"The only reason it’s getting three stars is because it’s gorgeous on! BUT I wore it for a small work event and it GOT SNAGS all over I don’t even know how and then when I got home I took it off to cut the snags off and there was a whole under the armpit!! Idk how this happened If anything it was loose on me, but not worth the money for this quality material. Will be returning 🙄🙄"
3.0,"I like the look, but they are way too lose. They always slide off my face."
3.0,Really unattractive fabric...better suited to cover a chair maybe.
3.0,"Cute, but not worth much more than like $5 in my opinion. I can see some beach shop selling these for surfers or sun goddesses, but they really don't play well in any other aspect. They are itchy to me and just lack any high quality to them."
3.0,"No strap adjustments, otherwise very nice"
3.0,"Barely fit, we will see how they hold up...though it does say size 6-9...which I did not see, and  I am a size 10.<br />More importantly, the paper wrapped around them says NO WASH...HAND WASH ONLY.....<br />the description on the site clearly says Machine washable.  Jury still out, but I have doubts"
3.0,Runs a little small. The material is like paper. Sat in my car and it ripped by my thighs and arms. Served it’s purpose
3.0,Pockets are too small. Kind of flimsy so it beats the purpose of organizing my purse.
3.0,"Honestly, the whole thing felt 'cheap'. The necklace seems to be made of an inexpensive metal - it feels and sounds cheap.  The color is a bit strange as well.  I like the quarts stone - it is well cut and semi-polished.  The elephant is not well centered.<br /><br />I cant picture any adult woman I know wearing this.  3 stars because I do think my tween daughters would like it.  One loves elephants and they both love pink."
3.0,a lot smaller than what it looks
3.0,"Purchased in a small and had to exchange for an XS - and I’m definitely not a true XS, these just run incredibly large.  They don’t have a ton of compression and I found myself pulling them up frequently.  Additionally, they got a hole after only a few washes. In short, they’re not super durable but they’ll do the trick if you need inexpensive leggings."
3.0,I could barely fit them on my calf and I'm not a heavy person I have an average size body. They weren't expensive at all though so I'm not really upset by it. If your a very skinny person wanting more of a thigh gap though I would recommend.
3.0,"A good looking bag and a convenient size-neither big, no small but where is that promised &#34;genuine leather&#34; , I wonder?"
3.0,"Bit thinner width-wise than I expected, and definitely does not have enough length. Its a decent scarf but too small to keep you warm, its more of a fashion thing. Bit too expensive for what it is in my opinion."
3.0,It it an awkward fit.  Had to wear a tank underneath but it was still just not right.
3.0,These earrings look nothing like the picture and the color is not black and gold but black and different color stones on the edge. and very tiny They are very light and flimsy.  In the picture everything looks raised when actually it is flat and looks like they have been run over by a car.  I may or may not wear them.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  I know they didn't pay much but then didn't get much.
3.0,"The color is much more pink than the picture. The picture implies a pastel pink, but the actual color is brighter with more orange. Combined with the sheerness of the fabric, it just wasn't a good look. I usually wear a medium in tops, I got a large based on the size chart and it fit well."
3.0,Front skirt part is sewn incorrectly. Layers on both this style and fabric should not overlap - especially by the tummy area. Very unflattering. Color and print was otherwise beautiful. I bought (and returned) the colorful vertical striped one.
3.0,The color is definitely not as pretty in person as it is in the photo. In the photo it's mint and in real life it's a really muted/pale green. Also it's really wrinkled and I'm not sure the pleats are going to hold up once ironed. It is very sheer but fits as expected with it being shorter in front and longer in the back.
3.0,"Dress was super cute on model,  and in other reviews,  however i thought it just looked dumpy on me.  I purchased it to wear to a wedding,  however if i raised my arms,  it would also be waaaaaay too short while dancing"
3.0,"Not a big fan of the fit. They aren't really compression boxers, which was to be expected by the reviews, but the material is really thin so although they are rather tight they don't offer compression. If I were to go a size up they would be too loose and make the side pockets useless. They don't provide support or an out-pouching type area for groin, its just flat and thin. The only good part is the pockets on the sides, they hold my key on one side and my phone on the other without any discomfort. I wouldn't purchase these again though, I would pay a little more to try another brand, but there also aren't a lot of options for these types in this length."
3.0,sandal width is a little wide. I have a narrow foot so wish it came in different widths
3.0,Pensé que serían más gruesas<br />Están bien suaves(demasiado) y la talla que pedí fue L pero en ellas dice Xl y están grandes<br />Dice que la a puedo cortar espero no se arruinen
3.0,Too big size
3.0,"It sllides down to easily, but serves it purpose of keeping the ears warm-There is nothing else to say about this product"
3.0,The googles are too big for ou ur 2 year old.
3.0,"These run small. Bought the 12-24 month for my 21lb, 30.5 inch, 9 month old and they are too small. Otherwise seems fine. Like the grips on the bottom."
3.0,"One of the new polyester blends irritates my skin like it's on fire.  Unfortunately, this is made of that stuff.  Lovely color, beautiful shape.  really disappointing."
3.0,"Dress is solidly made and comfortable, but the smudged pattern printing and gleam on background don't allow it to look like anything other than an inexpensive dress.  I don't feel attractive in it."
3.0,"I really like it, but the fit is not what I expected.  I got a size bigger than I usually get because it said the sizes were somewhat smaller. Should have gone two sizes up - it's a little tight in the hips.  Material is also pretty thin, but for the price, not bad."
3.0,Nose wire is like stretches & reshapes paper clips & poking out at the 1st time wearing
3.0,"The overall quality of the “jeans” are good. It’s soft and very comfortable to move in, although the L size I ordered was unfortunately to big. They aren’t exactly a skinny or slim fit. They fit me more like a bootcut style. They are also a lot longer than I expected, like way longer.. I typically do have an issue with pant length because I’m 5’1 but these had to be folded up twice and still were long. I did return them and am waiting for the M size in hopes that it fits better than the L. It did fit but not to my liking of tightness."
3.0,"This Chinese made dress seems to be pretty well made for the price. It is made of a very stretchy knit material and although I haven’t worn it yet, seems like it will be quite comfortable. Upon opening the dress, which came nicely packaged in a zip lock bag, I noticed a strong chemical smell, strong enough that it made me concerned for the individuals responsible for making and packing it. I washed the dress in cold water with plenty of detergent and fabric softener and hung it in the sun to dry. I may re- wash once or twice before wearing just to get the smell out. I am large in the bust and have broad shoulders so I sized up, but even then, this dress is tight across my chest. There is a seam which on me, is right under the breasts and which makes the girls look even bigger. Those with a different body type who carry more weight in the hips and tummy,will find this dress skims over and flatters their figure better. The length is perfect for me at 5’6” .  Because I will be wearing this dress as a costume with a shawl over it, it’s fine, but I would be embarrassed to wear anything this tight across the chest without something on top."
3.0,Had to give these to someone who could actually wear them. They were too big for my head
3.0,"We loved the necklace, but after putting the keychain on a set of keys, it immediately broke off. We are sad that it broke so easily."
3.0,"The inseam is shorter than I would like. Okay with flat shoes, but I wanted these to wear with a Cuban heel."
3.0,"Absolutely too long, awesome dress, too darn long,looks gothic might send back, sad!!"
3.0,Comfy and cute but run very small
3.0,Bigger than what I expected. Maybe it’s meant to be an oversized shirt but I ordered a small and it was still big. Nice shirt and quality though. Wish it fit
3.0,This item runs small! I’m normally a medium and I ordered a large and it’s fits me like an extra small! I had ordered large bc the other reviews mentioned runs small. Glad I did! The material is ok and it kept me warm in the cold! It’s an alright sweatshirt!
3.0,Good quality but small!
3.0,not my style but they were okay.  Too slippery for me
3.0,"I ordered two tutu's. They will work for a costume I need but, the purple<br />one was obviously returned and packed poorly in the bag, it was all crumbled up and it was much bigger. The pink one was in perfect condition and smaller which is what I wanted.  I cut the purple one sewed the ends together to make it smaller, wasn't worth returning.<br />Still cute tutu's."
3.0,"This sweater is ok. I don’t think it will hold up to a lot of use, though. And the elbow patches are not attached well. They look more like they were just slapped on and stitched. However, I didn’t expect much for the price, so I can’t say I was surprised by what I received"
3.0,Good fit. Nice colors. but I don't like the fabric.
3.0,Love the watch. The watchband is already  broken
3.0,beautiful ring but the black scratches easily if you are exposed to hard or rough surfaces
3.0,Nice material but fits very weird at the top<br />If you have any boobs beware
3.0,"The item is very nice looking, but it didn't last more than one school year before the zipper broke. Would have been nice if it lasted at least 2 or 3 school years."
3.0,"Good for the price, the orange is brighter than the picture."
3.0,"It doesn't look like the photo. The photo makes it look a lot thicker then it truely is. The piece that hangs down, is separated from the rest. It doesn't flow like it does in the photo. The straps are too loose but around fits fine."
3.0,The fabric was not what I expected and a little larger than I expected. I purchased item for cruise.
3.0,My only issue with the product was the color of the Mask compared to what was advertised. The initial image within the product was very Brown whereas this is very yellow.  Outside of that the mask did come on time within the shipping time listed. In regards to the coloration I assume it's nothing that a little paint can't solve. But that is the only reason I gave it three stars.
3.0,I'm  6' 1 and they were long. Quality appeared good.
3.0,"Sizes are not accurate, I bought small and it was way too big. I am normally size 4."
3.0,For under $20. Not a bad watch to wear for a night out of drunkeness and not caring if u lose it .
3.0,"Arrived quickly! The box said to cut to fit which I did. Then while on a trip, the belt came undone and had to be cut again. I used a lighter on it the second time and it has stayed so far"
3.0,"Fits well and looks nice, but not very water resistant.  After a month or so, the paint on the metal components is wrinkled and wearing away."
3.0,"Using the size conversion chart I ordered a 4XL. I normally wear a 10-12 in trousers. They did fit but look nothing like the picture. They fit more like cropped yoga pants. They are not wide leg but tighter at the top and more flared at the bottom.  The fabric is nice, but also not what I expected. They are knit, it is a nice knit,  very thick, but I was hoping for a  normal wool blend fabric not stretch pants. They might be right for you if this is what you are looking for, I sent them back."
3.0,"I bought this for my mom and she loved it but after a while the bow fell out, only complaint really, but overall cute product, whoever watches sailor moon im sure they’d love it"
3.0,The suit fits well. Its easy to get on/ off but 5he white border that fits around your neck flips over and the seam stitching shows. This looks awful! I had to get out my needle and thread and tack it down. I hope it holds this in place! Shame on the designer for such an expensive suit!!
3.0,I don’t like the quality of the material and it’s advertised other things that didn’t come.
3.0,"Dress is cute, but the material is cheaper looking than I expected. It clings to every curve then flares at the bottom."
3.0,Carter's generally fits true to size.
3.0,Is a nice ring. With a very good price
3.0,I didn't like how thin the material was.
3.0,faded ink and printed writing was poorly done.
3.0,"The colors available are either all black or (evidently) white with red trim.  I ordered based on the pic and was confused when I received a black hat.  You  need to look at the description not the pic of the item.  There is no option for a white hat with black trim even though that's the pic that shows for both.  That aside, quality is just ok. I expected more of a nylon feel but this feels more like a cheap cotton hat.  Will do the job though."
3.0,Slightly smaller than would have preferred. Love this dress have worn it several times. I did have to wear it three times before i noticed there was a zipper on the side. so much easier to take on and off once you use that.
3.0,"At first I liked patterns, until some said to me nice clown shirt.  The COLAR collapse doesn't hold structure form."
3.0,There are silver buttons on the pockets you have to look closely. (Just for looks) Plus one fell out after 3 times Wearing it.
3.0,"Small, but appropriate for young teen."
3.0,I'm giving these an ok because the color is hardly  lavender.  They look to be an ivory.
3.0,"The bust was really way too small for the bottom.  I am a 38D and ordered a 5x, the bottom fit perfectly and is beautiful.  the top barely covers my bust and i had to squeeze them in.  The padding is oversized for the material.  After i cut the padding out the top fit and looked better.  Full figured girls with small boobs will look great in them if you order two size larger.  I am a size 16 and ordered a 5XL andd the top was still small."
3.0,"Bought them for mining clothes and they didn't last long as weekly washes.  Plus, they don't hold much so don't expect to carry much in them."
3.0,Sleeves are a bit tight. Otherwise it's a great sweater.
3.0,"The bracelet is not as thick as expected.  It's cute but not quite what I thought I was ordering.  I like the charms - crown for royalty, heart lock with key, and anchor.  It would make a nice gift for a teenager or pre-teen."
3.0,"Loose strings, cheaply made :-("
3.0,Too large and too long for me. It was a nice product but not for me.
3.0,The buckles are a little bulky keep getting caught on stuff an pop open
3.0,"Size is 6-12, my feet are 11 1/2.  When I put them on fresh out of the package, one sock from each color has a hole about the size of a dime on the side."
3.0,"It does heat in the areas it says so, but one thing to look out for is that it is either too hot so you have to turn it off or it takes a while for it turn on to reach that temperature. The front heating where the portable battery is stored, it is a concern when the front heating is turned on. The battery does get hot thus, I cannot use the front warmers, only the back."
3.0,"Nice fabric, stretchy so size down."
3.0,"Got the orange dress which looks more like coral in the picture, but in reality it is closer to a peach than a coral (and nowhere near an orange). Got it for a bridesmaid dress, the bride is still okay with the color, so that ended up being not an issue. Quality is barely above okay, I don't expect it to last too long, but $22 for a bridesmaid dress is really okay with me, and I won't be heartbroken if it doesn't last. I like that it is convertible and can be worn many different ways. The material is rather thin, but should be just fine for summer."
3.0,"Pretty cute at the price. Unfortunately, Chinese sizing strikes again: I am usually an 8 and ordered a medium, which I couldn’t get over my hips at all! Size up and you should be fine. I’m returning, since I suspect anything that fits my hips will be too large in the waist."
3.0,I was disappointed with the lenses being a film basically and not a thicker plastic. Feels like cartoonish.
3.0,The band and face is really pretty but there is no clasp so it doesn't work if you need to make it smaller.
3.0,These shorts look good and the material feels good against the skin but I cannot tell you how durable these shorts are as they run very small.
3.0,Can't turn my arms freely. Front panel too tight? Missed the return window.
3.0,I love their look but the screws keep opening
3.0,The color is the same as the picture. It shipped really fast.
3.0,It will show your bra straps =/
3.0,"Super cute and great patterns, but they are made for someone with a face much bigger than mine. They’re soft and very padded though"
3.0,These are definitely for little kids and not grown-ups.
3.0,Very odd sizing...it was very comfortable but it just didn’t fit. Ultimately returned it.
3.0,Lovely picture.  Was just a bit smaller than expected.
3.0,Foesn’t look that nice from front
3.0,Was advertised for fitting children around the age of two and they fit me and when trying to put on my child it dangles benith her chin and doesn't sit on her face at all
3.0,Fits like a glove!!!!
3.0,Got to change my patch electrodes to snap on to give it a real test an the sandals could be an inch longer
3.0,I don't like it. Sent it back. The fabric and the quality is not ok for me
3.0,"I wear Elomi bras and have other Elomi swim tops. This particular molded top was not a good fit for my breasts and was quite a bit larger than expected. I wear a 40J in Elomi brand, which is what I ordered for this; might have been able to go at least a cup size down, but I was too uncertain. I returned, with no hassle from seller."
3.0,"These earrings are fine...but you will have to replace the backs unless you want to lose them. I'd suggest to buy them elsewhere for a better price. I wanted them cos the one's at my local Walmart didn't have gold backs & I decided it'd be worth it to spend more here & not have to buy new backs, however the backs on these are useless. They did arrive quickly & were everything promised but they're not any better than ones I see in stores for cheaper...tho if you're looking for them & can't find them elsewhere go ahead cos they're just what they say they are otherwise."
3.0,"Really like this dress, beautiful color but seam under arm came apart needed to sew it but otherwise dress is great"
3.0,"I wore for the first time and within 5 minutes I got a snag. Of course it had to be the black ones, my favorite. Since came as a set with 2 other leggings, doubt I can exchange. A bit disappointed. As for being comfortable yes (although a bit small), and the fleece lining will keep you warm in the winter."
3.0,Cute but not the best material
3.0,Waaaaaaaay to small.  They work great for my daughter though!
3.0,I got this for a Halloween costume and it’s cute but horrible quality. The metal is super thick and I don’t know if it tarnished cause I never wear it but I wouldn’t be surprised if it did.
3.0,These roll like FTL and are no more comfortable than FTL performance underwear. 1 pair of these as much as a package of average underwear. Can’t understand the good reviews.
3.0,Not leather the quality is not good !
3.0,"This is a very nice shirt that can be worn with jeans or dress pants.  The material is soft and it is very well made.  It does run small, so I would suggest going up a size or two depending on how loose you would like it to be."
3.0,"As advertised, very durable so far!"
3.0,"I like these rings and they are the perfect size for my nose, but they unfortunately came in gold rather than rose gold.  The color is okay... just a little brighter than what I was expecting or hoping for"
3.0,I like them and they do help with night time driving.  I took them to my eye doctor and she added padding to the plastic clips that could of scratched my lenses.
3.0,"grandson is 7 and wears a size 8 but these are not quite large enough,  Product was good though."
3.0,"Let's get the negative out of the way first, the &#34;one size fits all&#34; size is equal to other brands small/medium so if you have a large head skip this item. I stretched mine out to fit me, but heard some stitching break in the process. Once is was comfortable it became my favorite cap until it shrunk in the wash.<br />  The positives are that the material is good and this is not just some cheaply thrown together knockoff. The logo (front) and band name (back) are stitched into the material, and the elastic sweat band inside has the name and logo alternating all around the inside so there is no doubt this is a HIM cap inside and out.<br />  Overall good quality but small size, if the carrier adds a large size to the market I would gladly buy another."
3.0,Very cute and nicely made but they run extremely big. Purchased for my almost 6month old and ordered a 6-12 month first and then re-ordered due to such large size a 0-6 month pair which were still too big... very cute though and he will grow into them...
3.0,Nice dress a Lil too tight even when going a size up but I still managed to rock it!
3.0,"Fabric is very strange, somewhat stiff, fit was small. Returned"
3.0,I ordered the medium size because they don’t have the small but it was big I returned
3.0,Very light in texture.
3.0,I've bought Athletic 10 High 4 years ago and it was much more better than this model;<br />This model:<br />Pros:<br />- lighweight<br />- YYK zipper presents<br />Cons:<br />- The insides much worse than I expected.<br />- Size 9.5 is not US size but UK. So these boots are actually 10.5 US size.I haven't found in description information about size mess.
3.0,"It feels a little like something that you might have been able to redeem 400 tickets for at an old arcade. It serves the purpose that it's supposed to, but I wouldn't be surprised if it fell apart in a month or two. Really could have benefited from a bit more polish to the design and execution. That being said, it is shiny and holds your tie down, and lets others know you like nautical compasses, so there's that."
3.0,My 12yr old loves this hoodie crop top. However she can't wear it until we have the hanging strings fixed. It's so bad it looks like it wants to unravel.
3.0,"The shirt is outstanding, but I have to admit it feels like false advertising because it was made apparent that it came with the shorts, but did not.  Great shirt, but the shorts in the photo can really mislead."
3.0,"Too small - XL fit like a L.  Tight in the shoulders and chest.  Arm length was short.  Returned item.  Also, material didn't seem durable."
3.0,Tight fit for my size 11 foot.<br /> Some of the socks are better than others size and comfort.
3.0,Top was too large. Had to return
3.0,Colors are not like the picture and the size is not what I ordered either
3.0,"I usually wear a 2X, but went with 3X to be safe.  It was way too small!  The dress is pretty, and arrived in a timely manner, unfortunately it was designed to fit a petite woman."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this pack. I run long distances and love that there are so many pockets for nutrition, keys, phone, etc. The ability to have both water and some type of electrolyte mix in the bottles is awesome. However, if I run more than 8 miles, which I do very frequently, the part around my neck rubs my skin off. I can ignore it for half marathon distance or so, but I would not use this during a 50k or longer race. I need to either figure out how to get it to stop rubbing or find another pack. Adjusting the straps to make it looser or tighter doesn't seem to help. It's too high up on the neck for me."
3.0,It’s beautiful but the clasp broke the FIRST time I wore it. I never even made it out of my house. Disappointed!
3.0,i think i would love it never rec'd it.
3.0,It does what it is supposed to do but why is it so heavy?
3.0,To small for my hands
3.0,Definitely fits smaller then expected. Does not tie as well as it does in the picture. But it’s a great price and is made of good quality.
3.0,Is ok kind of heavy
3.0,"The ones I received in the mail were not gradiated like they appear to be! Beware! Also they feel very cheap. You get what you pay for I suppose.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just thought y'all should know, they did send me a replacement pair that is the correct pair. However you should also know that they emailed me asking me to remove my negative review, which doesn't really sit right with me."
3.0,"The gold seemed to be more yellow-golden than the picture (which is a more subtle/muted gold). Cute though! A little too big for me even though I ordered the XS, but not too noticeable."
3.0,F1 clothes and accesories are way overpriced
3.0,"I do like these shoes, but the instep is awful.  If you have high arches you will need to buy new instep.  Kind of defeats the nice price"
3.0,"I got this to wear at work during the holiday. I live in a warmer climate and work a fast paced customer service job. I couldn’t wear this more than 2 hours cause my face was sweating so much under it. Cute mask and good quality, but not ideal for people who run warm."
3.0,Smaller than I imagined. Probably should have read the description better. Won’t even fit over my head.  Beautiful though.
3.0,"I purchased a white and a red one, flowery material and feels good next to the skin. Bought a flower pattern one and material clings to itself, rough on the skin and heavier material."
3.0,Runs a bit large. Material is very this. Comfortable to wear around the house.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter it was delivered today. The packaging was really good. The box that it was in surprised me and my daughter. She was able to get 8pearls in it. The 4biggest were 7.3mm the other 2were small 7's/big6mm. The magnet is really strong so don't worry about your pearls falling out. I give it a 4 star because the 6 pearls that came with it were fake, if they are fake they should say fake pearls included.  And because of the chain on the necklace it looks cheap and would get caught in someone who has long hair."
3.0,Heavy material but poor button. Both broke first night
3.0,Red coral is not an original stone.But I love the ring.
3.0,Returned in very long and made me look dumpy
3.0,Too red...hard to see
3.0,"The shoe is cute, but the USB heater was broken in two days."
3.0,Cute. More orange gold kinda color than I was Expecting. Fits super small I think And very low cut. It’s okay not one of my favorites but I would be cute with some cut off shirts for dinner vibe.
3.0,This is not sweatshirt material more like your 80's track suit. The outside is slick and the inside is not soft. Still cute but NOT as described.
3.0,"Not as form fitting and flattering as I hoped. Quality was cheap, but so was the price so its what I expected. I returned it, but I could see on a different person this being much better."
3.0,"Definately not oversized, nor is it particularly warm. I ordered a medium (5'4 135, athletic build) and it's just a little long. Apart from the length nothing is oversized about it. Some of the stitching is a little sloppy, especially around the wrists, but it's very soft and the color is nice. Mine was $6 and I wouldn't pay any more for it."
3.0,This pretty but I am an old lady and I feel like it’s too skimpy. So I must wear an over shawl or something with it.
3.0,"Ring is cute, it's a size 8 womens, but the color of the ring is more of a gun metal gray, than a bright shiny silver. (Which I was disappointed about it) it shipped in 2 days which was pretty fast👌"
3.0,"I have the white one and love it. The green looks like Kelly green, but in actuality it is a dark olive, almost brown."
3.0,Design is not that great
3.0,The picture is much prettier.. looks like a dress with a feminine shape to it.. it's  q boxy Wal-Mart quality long flannel is about it..
3.0,The material/quality of this dress is not great but it's worth the money.  Looks nice and fits pretty well.
3.0,"I have given every other Hamer product that i have purchased (and I've bought quite a lot) 5 stars except for this one. It looks pretty cool, but to be honest, it looks more like a cornucopia than a peacock. Also, was rather disappointed that one of the pieces fell out as soon as I took this piece out of the wrapping."
3.0,"The mask is exactly as described. Although the masks are expensive, they come as a 5 pack and are reusable.<br />I returned the masks because they were not a universal fit for everyone in my family.<br />Because they are not adjustable the masks create a ""pinch point"" at the face and ears."
3.0,There was no bracelets! The reason I purchased it!
3.0,"The shirt is way faded when I got it, the colors aren't vibrant at all, not that I was looking for something as genuine that a cosplayer would use it, but it came out of the box looking like it had been washed and beaten on rocks for several hours before packages and sent to me."
3.0,"The dress was &#34;OK&#34;. I followed the measuring guide, but it was way too small."
3.0,"I thought the material would be more comfortable and for beach use.  However, it's cute"
3.0,"this ran small in my opinion, but is very good quality for the price."
3.0,T shirt haven’t good quality.
3.0,"It's big I. Stomach are and too wide for me, the sleeves were too tight. Otherwise is cute just didn't fit me"
3.0,the bottom fits but the bra cups are WAY TOO BIG
3.0,pretty big for a size 1
3.0,"cute, but the watch inside is garbage, however the outside is cute, worth the $2 paid for it for the outside only."
3.0,The dress style is so cute but made for women with smaller breasts. Mine were popping out with no way to secure them. I wish it wasn’t so low cut.
3.0,"The material is really shiney and not very stretchy, sort of costume like. The arm holes were a little small. But i've see a shirt like this online before and it's a pretty good deal for what you get. I will probably have to make some adjustments though."
3.0,"These look of decent quality and read reviews saying to go up a size and I did. They fit length wise but they are SUPER NARROW. I do not have wide feet, just medium width. I was gonna reorder a size larger but realized that they would be too long then and still be too narrow. I am returning them, but it did occur to me that since they are a natural fabric, if someone wanted to test it, they could be stretched like you you re-stretch shrunken natural fabrics like wool and cotton. I didn't want to take the chance so returning. They are super cute."
3.0,I have 22 prs of danskos and this is the first pair I have gotten that felt like they were woren before I love the colors but I am wondering if they were tried on to many times at the uniform shop not happy
3.0,"Beautiful shiny gold tone pieces. The woman's very petite, the man's more masculine. As per the pictures, however, there were some problems. There is not much difference in length between the two. The ladies version fit my wrist fine, but unless the guy has small wrists, I doubt any would find that it fit or was comfortable.  Also, the man's version had 2 very deep scratches on the plate.<br /> These would probably be fine for engraving if the sizes worked.<br />One really odd note: the packaging was weird. Both came in a single box, which is ok as it's meant to be a gift for  a couple. However, each piece was wrapped individually in some kind of clear plastic that was a pain to get off, especially the female version. I am sure this was done to protect the pieces, but there must be a better way. It was unbecoming and a nuisance."
3.0,"Really cute suit which is why I give it 3 stars but the straps are a little long. This makes a weird gap by the armpits. I ordered a small and I'm 5'5 116 lbs. The bottoms fit okay but also a tiny bit too big.[[ASIN:B075N4YGP1 RUUHEE Women Floral Printed V Style Bottom Bow-Knot Bikini Top Bathing Suits 2 Piece Swimsuit (S(US Size 2-4), Yellow)]]"
3.0,Fit on the small side
3.0,I like the hat but the crown is a little too round.
3.0,They looked cute but were too large. They also weren't as well made as similar shoes made by Sperry or Sketchers.
3.0,These are still tight! Aren't really diabetic socks!
3.0,Definitely not a large!  I gave it to my 11 year old step-daughter.  It is beautiful!
3.0,Does not fit to expected size run small
3.0,small but sturdy
3.0,This dress was too tight. I looked at the reviews and it size chart and ordered an extra large. I am a size 14. It's zipped but it hugged me too much. I have thick thighs so the skirt opened up too much on the side.
3.0,3 stars...not the color that was shown in the picture.
3.0,"I am giving it three stars ONLY because the dress was too wide!<br />I ordered a Large, i am 185 lbs and and 5'4. It fit above the knees.<br />The length was good BUT it was too wide. it made me look like i was pregnant/fatter than i already am! LOL<br />but its nice. The pattern is beautiful and so is the color. The material is so light and very comfortable. I would recommend this dress if you can alter it around the waist or if you accessorize it with a belt.<br />Like i said, the only down side was the width of the dress."
3.0,This bag is not as big as u'd think and the material is kinda stiff. I will give it a thumbs up for durability as I've had it a pretty long time and it's still usable. it's simple and neat but the suede is rough.
3.0,"Fit good, really cute, only complaint is the &#34;tutu&#34; part is really thin and it gets snagged easily but since our daughter is mostly in water with it it's not a huge problem but if it's for a very young child that might just be &#34;hanging out&#34; just expect to have lots of little strings and snags to deal with!"
3.0,"I like these well enough, but they are extremely thin. Not at all made of fleece. So if you’re expecting something to keep you warm (like I was), I’d look elsewhere. If you’re ok with thin sweats, then they are just fine."
3.0,"I just received my watch and it wasn't working. had to have the whole mechanism replaced for 40 dollars.<br />Dissapointing.<br />Also, one day after having it for about a week I noticed a large scratch across the face of the watch. I had not done any out of the ordinary things while wearing my watch and am quite perplexed as to how something like that could happen. I guess it's not such great quality."
3.0,"At first, I liked wearing these sunglasses. More than anything else, the price is affordable. The design is cool, and the overall quality is decent. After a while, I realized the legs were too long, pressing my ears too hard. I wanted to use these sunglasses as my cycling goggles but there is always sunray streaming at the corner of the glasses as I ride bicycles. Not very good to use it as a sports sunglasses."
3.0,I almost always wear an xtra large hat. I used a tape measure to get a precise measurement but the xtra large was a little to big.
3.0,Super Cute but the spaghetti strap was not attached I ordered a 3X but I wear a size 14.
3.0,"The fabric is beatiful, really soft, comfy and fit amazing, but they came with a little hole. I fixed it and any blouse can hide it, but when your bying something new is just not aceptable."
3.0,It’s smaller than I expected but it’s still so cool!
3.0,Stiff and slightly bent but served its purposed.
3.0,"I LOVE the material and color. However, it does NOT stay up on my face and I will have to sew it, or more likely, return it, unfortunately.<br />Update, I sewed the back a little and its perfect! It's light and easy."
3.0,"Okay quality, made of hard plastic"
3.0,"This bandana is pretty and stylish in the way face coverings are right now.  However, the fabric is very thin--not sheer or silk thin, but close.  I don't think it will be suitable for ski wear and I'm equally doubtful that it will keep my droplets from spreading to others.  If you are wearing it only for decoration, it's perfect."
3.0,"The slit of the dress that I got is different from the one in the photo and from what everyone else got. I like how it is like in the photo more.<br />The dress is thin, but it is not see-through if worn with nude undergarments.<br />My dress did not fit off the shoulder on me and the sleeves are too loose. On the good side, this is not a very long dress so if you’re short, you won’t have to worry about that. I’m 4’9, got a size small, and I think it’s perfect with heels on.<br />As much as I want to like this dress, I cannot not take a step without my heels getting caught on the material.<br />Will be returning this dress since I don’t whole-heartily like it for the reason that it is partially not the same dress and that the material gets caught on things too easily."
3.0,These are adorable. But they were too small . I needed them for a costume and they were too small on my face. I hope I can return them.
3.0,"Purchased for my 6yr old son to wear during Spring season baseball and I will need to get the next size up before the fall season this year because the underwear is super tight around his thighs. Runs small, in my opinion."
3.0,These are cute have just the right length u set the knee but little thinner material than expected.
3.0,"These are ok but way long in the torso. Quality is ok, nothing fantastic. It gets the job done and looks better than a regular tank."
3.0,Product design wore off. Good customer service though.
3.0,Description was not specific on length- but these shoe laces were about twice as long as I expected them to be. I measured my preiovus dirty laces (for converse) and ordered the closest size and the laces were still way too long to use. I ended up returning my order.
3.0,"What a ridiculous price for such a skimpy item.  This is what my nephew requested, so I ordered it but was appalled at the product.  Though it is well made and thin, as described, it was still a shock."
3.0,Item is durable...except it was missing the shoulder strap
3.0,Good thing  I ordered a size up.
3.0,How is this the smallest size? This looks nothing like the photo.
3.0,My vest was a XXXL and the size was more of a medium or large.  Order 2 or three sizes up.  It looked nice.
3.0,"It's a perfect replacement for my Casio watch, but the bands don't hold up more than a year and at $15.99 they're WAY overpriced.  Either make it with stronger material to justify the outrageous price, or drop the price to a reasonable amount."
3.0,I have size 9 feet and these socks were very skimpy.
3.0,"I have tried these pants in two different sizes. It was hard to choose how to describe the sizing of these pants because they are either too small or far too large.  They are ALMOST perfect. Where they fall short is in sizing and materials.<br /><br />In the product description these pants claim to be 50/50 NYCO (50% Nylon and 50% cotton) which has been the milspec material for quite a while. In reality, they are 50% polyester, 20% nylon and only 30% cotton. Had I known this I promise never would have tried them. This mostly synthetic fabric is noticably hotter while wearing it than milspec pants. You will be tempted to leave the zipper pockets over your quads open for ventilation. . . And then the second you go prone you will have dirt/mud get scooped up into your pockets. Definitely less than ideal.<br /><br />The sizing is also way off. The jump in size when going from medium to large is ridiculous. The large is basically a US size 39 with some elastic adjustments to attempt to shore up the waist. The medium is a much more accurate waste size (US 33-34), but the hips in the medium pants are a size small at best. If you're a fit person with a muscular build; sizing will be as impossible for you as it was for me. TL;DR large is huge and medium is tiny in all the wrong places.<br /><br />The kneepads with these pants are great. They fit well in the pants with no indication they would fall out or shift, and they are very functional. The camo pattern matches my issued OCP top and my old Multicam stuff well enough that no one would complain about it.<br /><br />If the sizing were better and the materials were actually what they advertised, these would be the best Crye knockoffs on the market BY FAR (Idogear is trash, I've tried it).<br /><br />However with the materials being less than advertised and the sizing issues you will encounter, it will be a crapshoot whether or not these pants will work for you. They're probably great in cold weather but you'll melt in hot weather. I wanted to love these and they came so close to being the one. YMMV"
3.0,"Shirt material feels pretty good and sizing was fairly accurate, although runs a little on the narrow side. 3 stars is because the material for the v-neck and button section is raw cut material that is stacked. Mine was not cut quite even either, so it has a little wave effect."
3.0,"I love them but when I start using them something star hurting on the insole of the heel like a piece is digging into my heel very uncomfortable, so I have stop using them ."
3.0,Gray color is lighter than the image. Size is too long on the legs. Comfortable and okay material.
3.0,Bought two one grey one black both Lx32 and the grey are like tummy controlling and the black is hip. Comfortable and fit nicely though
3.0,Thinner material than the others I had bought before.
3.0,"Not necessarily flattering. Also, super wrinkled!"
3.0,Great for a kid in pre-teen years. Wouldn't be sad if you lost them while fishing.
3.0,More and less
3.0,"I really liked the cut of the dress and the sizing is perfect. However, the fabric quality is where this really looses points.  I bought this to add to a more professional wardrobe, but one that keeps a feminine touch. It is totally not appropriate for this. It’s so tight that it stretches across the bellybutton and highlights the Venus mound. Even my hip bones were showcased by this dress. The fabric didn’t even feel like it was stretched; it’s just the way it falls on the skin. You best wear at least some heavy duty spanx under this because it does not have a nice smooth look like it does in the picture. The fabric is somewhat thin, which is what I suspect the cause it."
3.0,merchandise right on time
3.0,The boot looks just like the pic which is a plus but unfortunately they’re too small & they don’t have half sizes so if you were a 9 you will have to order a 10
3.0,"I was supposed to review this product because I got it deeply discounted for my review and I have no way of contacting the seller I can't find it on here or in my email to let them know my problems, yet I still need to review the product. I recieved the wrong necklace. I love this necklace it's beautiful from pictures and the one I recieved instead is beautiful as well. I got the double heart necklace instead of this butterfly one but quality is still good it's pretty and shines and has a long enough chain so it sits well. Shipped on time and everything is as it describes in product information just the wrong one :p if i could get ahold of the seller this would be a 5 star product for sure."
3.0,"these shoes are comfortable, but make my feet look soooo long. i am sending them back, but will keep an eye out for teva venturas on sale again, because the corky padded bottoms are nice. and you have to mess with buckling a strap."
3.0,Not as good as seen on the picture. Also it ran somewhat small.
3.0,"The fabric was very thick knit and didn’t sit well on the body. It bunches oddly and kept riding upward. It looks so cute, I wish I had loved it."
3.0,"Soft and comfortable, but I usually order a Medium or Large (5'4&#34; 140lbs) and swims on me."
3.0,"On Amazon they list the material as 65% cotton and 35% poly. When I received them they did not feel like any sort of cotton was in them, so I looked at the tag and they were 65% rayon and 35% poly. They were not the feel and look I was looking for so I sent them back. If you do not mind the more silky poly feel then they are not bad shorts.<br />BTW the girl in the picture must have really long legs. I have normal length legs and they almost came down to my knees."
3.0,Didn’t like the the cloth look that was used to wrap the case
3.0,"Seems to be very well made so far, only the test of time will tell! Delivered quickly and was protected well.<br /><br />Updated 5/28/15-So, I've had the bag for a few months and it is no longer useable. The main zipper has started detaching from the bag and it takes about 5-10 minutes to close the zipper. Also, both of the straps have begun tearing apart."
3.0,You get what you get. It was a little worn when it arrived..and kinda poorly made
3.0,Waste of money.  The flag pealed off in several areas after washing on delicate cycle.
3.0,"Nice, but too small for what I wanted, maybe I didn't check it out well enough."
3.0,"I mean they’re cute, but they’re super frail and thin. The bottom of the lens isn’t glued or attached to anything, it’s just kinda open. They’re cheap. You get what you pay for"
3.0,"It's a decent mask for what you are paying but be clear, the skin color on this mask is NOT like the pictures. The skin color is blue, not white."
3.0,cheap.  flimsy.  sorry I ordered this.
3.0,"I like the dress, but the color ran when washed in cold water on gentle cycle. The polka dots are gray. I'm still wearing it."
3.0,Its a little more purply periwinkle than I wanted. The set is nice though. Just not for the event I wanted it for. My wife's dress was a nice sapphire blue so this just didn't quite complete the look she wanted for the night.
3.0,This is a lovely color but it runs small.
3.0,"They hurt my feet the first couple of days. Not sure if the relief was because I took them off, or because of them working. Only time will tell. But I will say it brings the feeling back to my once numb feet. Just not sure if the feeling is good haha."
3.0,"Really nice hat, I wish it was just a littls more stretchy. It was too tight on- had too return"
3.0,Poor quality washed in cold water the bottom part that's black without looking dull now doesn't look good I will return them
3.0,"Over all, it's okay. It's not fantastic, it's not great, but it will do for what it is. It's not worth 50$ (which is what I paid originally) but it will get the job done for whatever costume you're doing."
3.0,"Beautiful color ribbon and jewels. Neck strap extremely tight on average build person. Cannot wear until I convert it to pin. Clasp is nice, just make strap 1 or so longer for comfort with snug fit."
3.0,Pendant is super cute and exactly like the picture except it's TINY. Chain is very cheap and delicate. Only reason why I am not upset about the chain is because I had already purchased a better one in advance knowing that the chain wouldn't be what I wanted.  However beware if you are considering this idea because the hole the chain goes through is very small and the only way I was able to thread a new chain through the hole in the pendant was to bend the loop part of the clasp and then bend it back afterwards.
3.0,"The color saturation wasn't as vivid as shown in ad. Also, the material was very thin; there was already a snag in it when I unboxed it. Returned."
3.0,It's a cute shirt but the arms were too small for me. So I am returning it.
3.0,"The cap fits well. I do use this when I go outside. I find it preferable to a mask. It makes me feel safer when around strangers who may or may not be wearing masks and who may cough or sneeze. The face shield offers protection from this. I bought this with the intention of wearing it in addition to a mask but doing so makes breathing difficult so, for me, it is an either-or situation. It is easy to clean the face shield after every outing.<br /><br />It does make it almost just as hard to breathe as a mask. I was hoping it would be easier to breathe whilst wearing it but alas, it is not much different from a mask in that department."
3.0,"I really liked this Poncho, and will keep it because I'll pop it on top of my bathing suit at poolside, but Its basically a huge square, and really really big.  The neckline on me was much lower than the picture, and the entire poncho is really large.  I usually wear a size 10 or so, and am about 5'4&#34; and this was really long as well on me.  Its pretty, and I do like the tasseling, but I wanted to love it more."
3.0,"It's a nice knit and a warm hat, but wasn't slouchy at all, like the pic shows.  It fits my head like a classic knit hat."
3.0,Not crazy about the lens it came with. I'll only use 2 of the 5...the rest are not practical for sun use .
3.0,Very cute but the mesh holes are quite big and will get caught on anything when working.
3.0,Hand was waaaay bigger than I thought it'd be...I don't regret buying for how cheap it was though
3.0,Disappointed that the reverse yellow side has the hat tag sticking up out of the back of it.
3.0,This design on this swim suit is really cute. The bottoms are very comfortable and true to size. My only issue is the bra inside the top.  It’s not removable or adjustable so it doesn’t fit good.  It is probably meant for a smaller busted woman.
3.0,I find the product is super lightweight.  I don't know how rip proof it is but I would prefer something alittle heavier of material.  Otherwise its a good item.
3.0,"I love how much space this has and it was great for the first few weeks. Then, the zipper broke."
3.0,"Shoe is fine.  However, the tongue is fixed so it is very very very hard for the feet to get in and come out.  This is a major issue for me."
3.0,The medium pants are actually like a men's XL.. the medium top is more realistic to its size.
3.0,The fabric was thinner than I thought I would be and the size was too big for me. I wear small but this was not a small.
3.0,"They are cute, but the pink butterfly is larger then I expected, and the shorter dangling one sits very strange against my stomach."
3.0,"Love the bottles. Perfect size for mixing up my cleaning products in. However, only one sprayer worked. Absolutely love how it sprays but upset about the other two. I will be ordering again to see if it was just a one time thing as this product has great potential to become a favorite of mine."
3.0,"It was cute. Fabric was well. The armpit area was to big for me because I have petite arms and breasts. I am usually a 4-6, but I would need a much smaller size for this shirt."
3.0,"The shirt looks very nice, but it's made from very inexpensive polyester fabric.  I got a large, when I usually where a medium and it is still too small.  Definitely do not want to buy this shirt with them idea you're going to get a lot of wear out of it.  It'll be good for wearing in casual environments and under a jacket."
3.0,a lot cuter in person which was surprising considering things don't usually look as good as the advertisement but this does the only negative for me is it could be a little more softer but can be a sexy dress or summer outing ❤️
3.0,"The selection is really nice and I got all 20 pieces, I even got the delight of one of the gold tones actually being rose gold color. But, this is clearly China produced and the color is fading fast from the part that needs to be hooked into my nose. They have a tight hold though and the aesthetic is there. A little clear coat of nail polish and I'll go back to using them."
3.0,"For $3.25- why not! I finally got these today. It took quite the while ( a month or so?) to get them, but finally.<br />For the price they're fine. Your basic pair of gold earrings & that picture is exactly as they look."
3.0,This shirt is cool but my shirt shrank a good amount and that was after a cold wash and tumbled dry low. Would probably recommend sizing up or just be cautious if you are getting the size you normally wear.
3.0,its a little flimsy but cute
3.0,"The packaging was is very nice, heavy duty black box, with nice dense foam supporting the, impressive metal casehard disc. I will update my review as I install."
3.0,"Cool, the problem is that one if the sides is going off balence an is messing up the entire pair"
3.0,"Just got it today. I really like the purse, but the stitching on the should straps is defective.  There is loose fabric on the straps in several places that wasn't caught in the stitching. I will return it and order another one, hopefully that one will be good."
3.0,"Hard to close, and got rusty looking after a while- although I didn’t notice right away. It didn’t itch or anything, it only changed color but not the skin it was in. Not bad for a cheap endless hoop."
3.0,Hat is great do Not like that they embroided &#34;Bridgestone Collegiate&#34;  on the back of the hat
3.0,"Light weight hat, good for mild day's and light windy days."
3.0,Buyer beware! You DO NOT get 4 pens like the picture displays. That was my assumption so my bad. Random pick and I got the Knight King... ugh. But still cute.
3.0,It fits. Go wide and bigger for comfort
3.0,Works fair. The 12 V socket. It is not deep enough. It does work but not securely.
3.0,Thick material. Adjustable elastic is nice. Large but adjustable so it fits.
3.0,It is a bit small
3.0,Quality of dress not what I expected.
3.0,"Look just like the photo, but super cheapo plastic, they feel like they won't last too long before they snap. But you get what you pay for, if they last a few months I will be satisfied. Wouldn't buy these again most likely."
3.0,Beautiful dress only issue was arms were a bit tight. Not stretchable material.order a size up for bigger arm space.
3.0,"It could be me, but they are not as cute as they look on the video.  I would definitely size up."
3.0,"Wish the bands were just a bit longer - when putting on or taking off the watch, the bands make it a bit harder that I think it should.  If they were just a little longer?  I’d have to say that the two magnets keep it in place great!"
3.0,"This case is awesome if you never want to remove it.  Snaps together tight, colors are vibrant, and it's a nice plastic case.  My issue with it is that I needed to remove it to load a new SD card in my phone and getting it off was a huge challenge.  Desite the fact that they include a little tool to help you open it up, it was so tight that despite trying to be gentle enough not to break it but forceful enough to actually unclamp it, I almost broke the case.  When I went to put it back on after putting the SD card in (why there isn't just a cutout in the case there I don't know), I can see that one of the top corners doesn't snap as tightly as it should.  It's not going to fall off the phone or anything, but I'm still disappointed."
3.0,I like the design and fabric but it’s too tight to wear without spanks
3.0,"This was too small in the chest for me. Gave away. Otherwise, materials were fine (don't know how it held up to washing-- I never washed it)"
3.0,The fit tighter in the waist and would hope they would be longer
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e98c4ceefa3e827ffc45c9086d53960a]] Okay I love aoxjox and always buy many things from them, also I love the leggings, but I ordered the blue and black pairs and the blue had one dead bug and one alive bug on it! It was a little gross but the leggings are still fine, just rather there not be bugs on the leggings I order."
3.0,I'm disappointed in the way the ring looks bc it looks like I got it out of a quarter machine. It's cheap looking and the flower is sharp and kept scratching people and me. I'm just not impressed at all with this. I will not wear it anymore.
3.0,"Very cute ""T"". I ordered my normal size, a little too snug and on the thin side. I was not comfortable with the size and returned it."
3.0,I normally wear a small and I wanted a yellow tank.  The tank is tight and is a dull gold.  Sending back.
3.0,i bought these for our 2 month old daughter and while there ok in price there horrible in value they made her feet hurt and every time she saw them she would cry
3.0,"Yes, they're super duper soft and comfortable. I wanted the wide waistband version, but that wasn't available in black, so I went with the thinner one-size waistband... and hated them. It's super tight, so everything about and below it pushes out. I don't want a larger size, because everything fits great other than the waist. Sadly, returning them."
3.0,"Good if you don’t want to see through it, but I wanted to use it as a morph suit hat and thought that I would be able to see through when wearing"
3.0,"It’s cute, but kinda cheap looking. I returned it."
3.0,"Honestly, they are as pictured... but I thought they'd be a little more vibrant. They are smaller than I expected so it's hard to make out what is pictured unless you are super close. Other than that, I like them."
3.0,The shoulders are a little out of shape and the color was not the same as the pi
3.0,"Nice blue/gray color and very comparable to more expensive Sunday day Afternoons hat. Only problem is the height of hat is too tall. I have to pull it way down over my eyebrows or the fabric is bunchy on the top and looks bad. Only discovered this after having it for a while. Alsk, shipping took a really long time."
3.0,Should have gotten the next size up but these will work.
3.0,"Won't work for me.  Reasonably comfortable, but not good for sight due to shape"
3.0,"The only downside to this mask is the sizing. I'm a regular sized adult, but this mask is pretty big and baggy, The straps are okay but the mask itself is baggy and large."
3.0,Loved the shirt but ran small.
3.0,I loved these.  I wore them everyday for about 2 weeks and one of them broke!  I guess I got my money’s worth since they were only about 7 bucks.  You get what you  pay for.
3.0,I like how many there is but it filmsy
3.0,"I like the leather texture it is strong and durable. The only major thing I don't like is the band length are short. If you have an average to large wrist the band will fit snug, it will only be able to fasten the first or second whole."
3.0,"Frumpy dumpy. I knew when I ordered this it could go either way. I returned it, it was kind of depressing on."
3.0,this is not to be worn for long...all 3 broke in less than a week
3.0,"Love the look but they are quite uncomfortable.  Have been readjusting them but I think the quality is not there, both in frames and lens.  I would pay much more for better quality.  Thank you."
3.0,This dress turned out exactly like it looks in pictures! It’s super cute and comfy-the fabric has a little stretch. It does run very small! I normally wear an XS/0 and ordered a Small and it was too tight. I’m 5’6” 108 pounds.
3.0,"I'm 4'11&#34;, and a 'medium' size, so the dress fits, but is long. It appears very 'dressy', and almost dowdy. The top doesn't really lie flat, even with dress tape, I couldn't get it to feel 'closed'.  I'm very 'hippy', and this made it worse.  I got this dress https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D161MGU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1  and it worked much better."
3.0,Very very Very see through but just adding a black tank will fix
3.0,"very nice slippers but not true to size, I ordered a Medium (7/8) I wear a size 8 shoe and in these slippers I believe I could have gone with a Small.<br />So the slippers a very comfortable and warm but too big."
3.0,"I cant exchange this as I need it for the Gators game Saturday and I wont get a new one in time. Scuff on the logo where it was printed badly and just has a normal tag, nothing to say its official collegiate apparel"
3.0,"Decent quality, but was a lot shorter on my daughter than anticipated despite ordering size appropriately. May be worth it to order larger and have it tailored down."
3.0,This is the second Colibri Quantum Rio Lighter I've purchased. The color part of this lighter is made of plastic. The first one I purchased the color part is metal that's been painted. The first lighter has the weight and feel of quality you'd expect from a lighter that costs as much as this one. This is a great lighter and would have no complaints had I not purchased the first lighter.
3.0,I kept them but I expected them to be snug and they are really stretchy -
3.0,A little small and quality average
3.0,"I usually wear a medium in this style of underwear, but these sizes are way different. So I got the large. They fit for the most part, but I am used to a more secure fit. I don't like the flopping around of boxers which is why I buy this style. But these don't really do well for me because I am in between their sizes.<br /><br />But, the quality is very good, though I'm not sure it justifies the 11$ per pair price tag."
3.0,"It’s ok. The beads are larger than expected, and the “leather” looks cheap. There is very little variation in the picture jasper beads, so it is blah. The size is more appropriate for a man."
3.0,Nothing to brag about but not bad either.
3.0,Nice bracelet but is smaller than the pic plus hard to get off and on.
3.0,It’s cute but rather large
3.0,"They are cute and comfy, I'm 5'3 a little long but you can scrunch up"
3.0,"Fit great, feel very comfortable, only problem I have was bought them before only got two in the pack, didn't bother refining them cause I forgot.  Liked them decided to buy two more 3 packs should have gotten six pairs ended up with five. Has it happened anyone else or am I just unlucky?"
3.0,"the bottom is really big -  the open zips def. do not fit the way it shows on the picture. the top is also a bit bigger, but I could adjust it. I wish I could order the top and bottom sizes separately.  I wore it with a different bottom."
3.0,"Although these are really cute, they are almost impossible to latch.  I have to try several times and push very hard to get it to pop through the hole.  I’m pretty disappointed in the struggle required to put this on."
3.0,"They are everything I need them to be, except single sided. Both balls unscrew and come off. It's good, I can thoroughly clean them and disinfect them. But I truly hoped they'd be the first true set of internal threaded, single side barbells. They are well crafted, please don't be mistaken. They are the best ones I own (I own about 40 pair so far) and hands down the best price for them. I am sad about the failure in description, but I am happy that they fit the rest of the description. I'll buy another pair just to have them on hand in the event they slip out.  Comfortable to wear."
3.0,One of the always ends up getting loose while the other stays sturdy. The loose one often drops out of my ear
3.0,"Sooo the apron I got was cute but it was NOT what the product pictures looked like. When I ordered it I saw pictures of a black apron with white lettering and a chefs hat symbol with an adjustable neck. What came was a white apron with black lettering and red kiss lips symbol and no adjustable neck. It’s a Christmas gift for a woman so it’s cute in those colors, it’s just strange that it came so different 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3.0,The heart shape is not nearly as dramatic as it is in the picture. You can barely tell they're hearts. They're still cute but I was a little disappointed.
3.0,"A little disappointed, the hat is small, good for children but not for adults.  Thin material."
3.0,"Very cute, but not as comfy on the inside, and runs small."
3.0,I'm 5&#34;2 and it fits fairly long on me but I love the idea of the style
3.0,It was better when I tied a little rope around just above the breast. It gave it more shape. Also you will need pasties
3.0,This is package as a youth regular but Amazon calls it a Peewee regular. Not correct size.
3.0,The only problem I have is I wish the belt was thicker in width.  It was more slender and I was looking for that big and bolder statement.
3.0,Unfortunately it broke rather quick but it was worn daily. I loved the way the ring looked & it was very comfortable but not made for every day wear.
3.0,"These hoops are heavy and feel and look pretty solid. I put one in and it immediately weighed down my ear. If you can handle heavy earrings, these do look very nice."
3.0,"Fits as expected.  However, the fabric has a pungent scent but after soaking it in washing detergent, it smelled much better."
3.0,This is fleece and you need batteries as they’re not included
3.0,Bigger belly and smaller backside will fit this product better
3.0,I like the shirt except I got shipped a medium instead of a small.  I was expecting it to fit like a glove but got it on and chuckled because it was too big for me.  It was then I realized the tag said medium instead of small.  So if you are 5'7 and 140-147lbs medium maybe too big unless you like a loose fit.  No worries though I am about to shrink it on a pot of water then throw it in the dryer.  If that fails to the sewing machine it goes.
3.0,Super cute on picture. Received quickly. Nice and thick fleece. But fit weird on me. Pockets were too high. Has potential. Give it a shot because it is very cute and warm.
3.0,"adorable and I wish I could fit in them,. I don't normally need a wide, but an 8M just won't work.  Going up a size would make it too big in the heel.<br />If your foot is on the narrower size, this will work for you."
3.0,"Not as good of quality as I had hoped for. Also it is very small, unless you have very small wrists (or are a child) this will not fit."
3.0,To big no good
3.0,"I bought this to attach to my dogs collar for when I let them out at night. It worked well for a while but now after a couple months of use, if bumped at all the light will turn off or will start flashing. If you really are using it just for luggage or something like that, then it is great, but not for running around or bouncing."
3.0,Material is a bit thicker than other shapewear. Rolls a bit from the leg area so be careful what material clothes you have on in case it might show.
3.0,Black interior makes it hard to find things
3.0,"I bought this for my son he's 21 mos. He's average size (24lb, 31in). This is WAY too big, he can't wear it. At least he can grow into it. But it fits his big bro perfectly, who is almost 4 years old, and also average size (35 lb, 49"").<br /><br />Aside from size, fabric is soft. Has held up for a few washes at least. Not super heavy. The elastic on the shorts isn't sewn in so it kind of twists around.<br /><br />But the price is good! And kids grow out of clothes so fast, I'm not concerned about it lasting for years."
3.0,Me and all my coworkers love the vest color accessibility etc. but is very cheap started threading and ripping in first week of lite wearing.
3.0,"Hands down, the neck is the worst part. I thought the other reviews about the neck might be true to some extent, but I don't even want the shirt from how awful the neck is. The material is fine, color is fine, the neck is just extremely big."
3.0,Quality appears good however after two drycleanings the material pills horribly.  I attempted to contact the company without any response.
3.0,It’s Cheaply made. Out of some sort of nylon material and better for small wrists
3.0,looks good but too tight.
3.0,"Good material not see-thru nor heavy. Decent dress for any event, I’m wearing mine to church. Can dress it up or down. I didn’t know it had pockets, but they lie down well."
3.0,"Nice Hat, to small for my 7.5&#34; head."
3.0,"This dress was pretty, I like the lace and the color. But it was definitely not flattering for my figure. I feel like it accentuates the hips and it’s definitely meant for people with a tiny waist."
3.0,They look thrown together glue everywhere!!!!
3.0,Arms are short but cute shirt
3.0,Very soft and comfortable. Using it for bedtime though.
3.0,"Too big in the bust, and not very flattering on my body. Sent item back. Think it's better for someone more busty. I'm 35 in bust, about 31 waist,  39 hips, ordered the large."
3.0,"Overall, this is a nice sweater. It is warm without being too hot, and the material is so soft. Fit wise, it is comfy while still being flattering. It’s not as oversized as the model in the picture, though, so I would recommend sizing up if you want that oversized look.  The only problem is that even after washing it, it leaves fibers everywhere. I wore a white tank top under it that was tinged green when I took it off. There were fibers all over my phone screen from when it brushed up against my sweater as I put it in my back pocket. Even my son had green all around his mouth after he drank a bottle and then nuzzled his face against me. 😂 I still recommend this sweater because it isn’t that big of a deal, just be aware of it, especially if you go for one of the brighter colors like I did.<br /><br />UPDATE: the second time I washed and wore the sweater, the fibers were even worse. They were on EVERYTHING. It was so bad that I made the decision to return the sweater. For $40+, I shouldn’t be shedding like a dog in this sweater."
3.0,"The light up function works well and is really cool, but the shoe material doesn't hold up well."
3.0,Bought as a gift. Didn’t realize how tiny this thing is.
3.0,I dont hate it but I dont love it as much as I thought i would. Maybe I need a smaller size?<br />Either way it feels GREAT on my wrist especially since I type in a keyboard all day and don’t have a cushion. The only issue i have with this band is it slides around my wrist so my watch face ends up on the inside of my wrist. Great material though and beautiful colors!
3.0,"I bought this for a birthday gift for my Dad's 70th birthday in May.  It is a good quality cap but I was disappointed it did not have &#34;Original Parts&#34; on the back.  Since the title included those words, I had presumed that would be on the back since it was mentioned in the product title.  The back is a little plain and could use something."
3.0,Bought these to replace a pair of Peltor kid's earmuffs because after 9 years the wire holder had gotten bent. I thought since these did not have wire over the head they would be better. My son wears glasses and these pressed on the arm of his glasses.Long story short they were so tight my son cannot wear them. Passed them on to another child.<br />Pros: great sound blockage<br />  Fold for storage<br />  Storage bag<br />Cons: too tight for someone with glasses
3.0,Very nice quality. Run a size small.
3.0,? Size was too small
3.0,"Had these for two months, loved these things and the frame cracked when I threw my wallet on top of them. Giving these three stars because they’re comfortable. Durability not so great. Pretty bummed"
3.0,The watch is fine but does not glow in the dark. My son picked it our for his Dad for christmas so the fact that it is black on black is better for an adult who does not want an overly obvious batman watch
3.0,"Seems to be a fine quality for the price, but the back strap is an orangy-brown ( I ordered the light brown one). Was not very happy as the color is not quite as pictured."
3.0,Okay. I'm a small or medium usually and I irdered a large and it's still tight in the shoulders/pits when I reach out or do a hug motion.
3.0,"I dont think these could take much daily use. The paint will probably chip or the stem will break off. They are a bit more cheesy in person, when compared to the picture."
3.0,Bottom isn’t sewn and very think material
3.0,The laces are too small in thickness used the locks on cotton laces that came with the shoes.
3.0,Just didn't fit well. too baggy/boxy
3.0,"I like the Jeggings even though it was somewhat small in fit, it was expected. I like the quality of the product. Its a little shiny but its not a deal breaker. But the 3 star is for the hip fit. It keeps sliding down and is very uncomfortable, unless you don't mind trying to discreetly pull your Jeggings back up all the time. If they can add some loops for a belt, then we can effectively secure it in place. This would help a lot of people."
3.0,It was nice but no choker
3.0,"Dress is lovely, albeit very staticky. May need to run it through the dryer. By itself, with no belt, it has a 1920s silhouette. I'm into vintage fashion so this is a plus for me. My husband prefers it with a belt, however, just not the one that came with it. Belts. If it's wide, a couple inches, like this one, make it firm enough not to became a mess every time you move at the waist. On top of that, the belt kept unsnapping. Bend over, snap! Bend over again, it's literally just tied on. Get rid of the snaps and make the belt from a firmer material would be my advice. The dress, fit wise, fit me perfectly, and I'm 36, 28, 40."
3.0,Too tight for a large.
3.0,"First, I didn't realize that these came all the way from overseas so it took awhile to get them. When I put them on, they worked great for keeping the sun out of my eyes but the mechanism for putting them on is bulky & awkward looking when on."
3.0,"I bought a size large, my regular bra size its a 36C. I found the band of these bras to be a bit too tight."
3.0,"The bag fits the size and description. I purchased the brown color one. But it was too shiny for the brown shade. The coffee shade may look better.<br />Packaging was awful. The bag was bend and packaged tightly in the box, leaving a bend mark on the bag already when received. Also outside pocket is too small to hold anything . Inside has a lot of space though. Easily fits in a 13.3 inch laptop."
3.0,"I just received this today, and the main photo seems to have more of a blue lace, and another person said they received one with blue lace - my lace is BRIGHT WHITE.  I wish we had blue lace!  I’m not sure this will go over well in her class where she is suppose to wear all blue.  I ordered a little smaller than what I would normally order based on reviews and without trying it on this looks to be about right.  I’ll have to update once I wash and try it on her.  Worried about messing around with a return since it came from overseas.<br /><br />Update - no problems washing so far, I machine washed with like items and hung it to dry.  It fit my average sized 4.5 year old okay, but was too long for her (and baggy in the butt if you looked too close) so definitely lots of room to grow.  We had to sort of just pull here and there so it would fit decently.  Glad I didn’t size up at all.  Overall it worked, she wore to a grand opening of a new dance studio and everyone thought it was so cute."
3.0,non polarized
3.0,"I’m usually an 8-10, 150-155 lbs, pear shaped body so I ordered a large. The entire thing is too small for me but really good quality. I’d recommend sizing up. Very cute suit!! Would fit me better if my hips were smaller or if I’d ordered an XL."
3.0,Would have given 4 stars but the sizes are for people with a smaller frame.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium but these tops in medium are very tight.  The fabric is a little stretchy (not a lot), so i can wear them, but tighter than I prefer.  I would have ordered a large if I'd known.  They also came with a weird smell - like the plastic chemical they are made from.  Hope it washes off!"
3.0,i like them but need thicker frame material.
3.0,"Got this shirt to be a crop top to wear with high waisted pants/shorts.  It is basically a swimsuit top. It hardly went below my bust line and then it rode up constantly. Would not stay when I pulled it down to try to get it to tuck into anything, and also then my boobs would come out. I have a larger chest 36/38 D/DD and this shirt has a ton of room for them- but almost too much, it was essentially just open the whole time. Would have needed a bralet or something underneath it. I am 5'7 for reference!"
3.0,I like the blouse except the front rides up and I  am constantly having to pull it down.
3.0,Too small in the bust area and its not sewn correctly in the front part makes a lovely house dress
3.0,"Nice shirt, I'm an extra large but this fits like a med."
3.0,It’s a cute piece to add to the wardrobe for throw around but the Jean material is thin and cheap. It’s sewn well and looks like the photo. Just not a “heavy” winter Jean. Definitely a summer outfit.
3.0,"It has a straight, fitted cut but is made from very stretchy fabric. The material is slightly rough and doesn’t feel all that good against your skin. The outside is a dusty rose but the interior, which is visible on the ruffles, is a muted pink. The zipper is hard to open and close. The stitching is quite bad in several areas but is okay for the most part. In general it’s an okay dress, but I’m not impressed by it."
3.0,Working good … Only draw back doesn't last very long on a charge ...
3.0,"First, these have silicone all the way around and DON'T move, which is freaking amazing. However, they are too big for me, a shoe size 8W. If you're a size 9 or above, these would be perfect."
3.0,Love shape of boot but tight around foot and I didn't realize they don't have a zipper.
3.0,Love the fit but the fabric felt “cheap” and light.  Can not wear in the winter unless you wear leggings underneath.
3.0,"Very stretchy elastic.  I have 29&#34; waist and 36&#34; hips - and there is easily  4&#34; extra inches at waist and have to overlap the ends. Overlapping ends isn't that big an issue - but does change the overall look of the item. I gave 3 stars because the elastic its made with is thin and very stretchy...I will not be surprised if it starts to fall apart after a few uses - or the elastic looses its stretch.  But otherwise, an inexpensive piece of 'bling' to add to various outfits for a little added 'zing'."
3.0,"I love these.  They’re super comfortable, not see through, and they stay up (despite my<br />conspicuous lack of a backside).  I wear them mostly to work out and leave them on after around the house.<br /><br />These have a softer feels than the spandex type. Not good under jeans, but great under ski pants or a slicker material. The waist is a tad high, but it’s broad so it’s not uncomfortable; I barely notice them. They breathe very well, too.<br /><br />These were my third pair, and would be 5 stars, but for the seam failure just at the top of the inseam the second time I put them on, which was a bummer.  I’m tallish, (6’/183cm) but slim/athletic (180lb/81kg), so it wasn’t squeezing 10lbs of excrement into a 5lb sack kind of deal.  Will update this with photos once verified."
3.0,"Loved it until zipper pull broke. I was using to and from gym to hold wallet, water bottle, and wrist guards.  Maybe the uses totaled 15 open then close of the bag. No reason for anything to have broken."
3.0,"Overall, I LOVED 8/10 pairs sent to me. The gems were set well and were very sturdy, but 2/10 pairs (3 earrings) had these grey/black dots that ruined the earrings. I bought these for my bridesmaids and am now going to have to do different earrings for my maid of honor because I don’t want to give messed up earrings to my girls"
3.0,My 12 year old just earned herself some new leggins since they was too small for me...so unless you are under a size 8 don't buy
3.0,"thin material, the thread started coming out after the first wash"
3.0,"What you pay for is what you get.  If you are not a fan of sequin material (due to it scratches) do not buy this item.  The cut of this dress is nice, but it was somewhat small."
3.0,Bill seems to long compared to all of my other hats
3.0,"Bought this to store  my friend’s 10 years sober token. It does it’s purpose, quality is just ok"
3.0,"Honestly not the best material or quality.  They look cute, but I would not recommend for long-term wear."
3.0,The fabric was cheaply made and I did not expect that.
3.0,"Ok, so I was looking for an inexpensive military ring for everyday wear and came across this ring.  Looked nice on the site and was a good price.  Received the ring, pretty good shipping time, looked real nice until about a week after daily wear, noticed my ring finger starting to get a green ring from the metal, seems to be metal reacting to my body temp/sweat.  Well, just beware that this is not a daily ""driver""."
3.0,The fabric seemed to pill after the first wash. The top area has no support<br /> I prefer the new line Target is selling of similar night gowns.
3.0,"I bought this onesy for one of my friends for her baby shower. While it was cute and soft, the photo is deceptive. It’s not hot pink and jet black. It’s a more muted version of what the photo shows and the lettering is dark brown. Also, their date of arrival was set for No later than Sept. 21st. It actually arrived on the 26th...which was late for the baby shower. My friend still loved it, and it was still a hit, but if you plan on buying this product, give yourself lots of time for it to arrive."
3.0,Skin tight. Fabric seemed OK. Just a cheap plain dress. Would be cute for layering.
3.0,is not as attractive as it looks in the picture
3.0,Cute dress but after ordering a size up based on the reviews it was still too small.
3.0,Beautiful dress just not for my body type. But Thanks 😊
3.0,"It is really cool but MUCH, MUCH SMALLER than it appears in the pictures. The chain seems a little flimsy but if you want a cool piece of art around your neck? This steampunk necklace is for you. Probably better for a girl due to size."
3.0,"Didn't fit, and is not exactly like photos. Return process was pretty painless, so i'll give them that"
3.0,The top was cute and fit as expected but I thought from the picture the bottom were leggings and they were not. They are wide legs with no fit at the bottom
3.0,"Fits okay with the exception of being tight around my rear.  Since it is tight there, it does not fit like a real tunic should."
3.0,"The first package I ordered a few months ago was great. The underwear in the package I just received (July 2018) is not nearly as good: thinner fabric, larger waistband (small is almost too big for my 31&#34; waist), looser fit overall. I'm hoping a few hot water washes will shrink them. The first package was multi-colored, this one the black/gray."
3.0,"This is a really cute purse, but the inside is a lot smaller than the dimensions would indicate. And, the clasp broke half way thru the wedding I attended this evening...after opening and closing less than a dozen times. I'm going to see how much it will cost to have it repaired."
3.0,it's got....lines.....not the linen kind but forever wrinkles......#nothappy
3.0,"This is cute, but very awkward to put on and keep positioned correctly. Getting the proper tension is difficult."
3.0,"These were soft and comfy and well made. However, they were advertised as having a non-binding cuff. Nope.....I'll have to keep looking."
3.0,It didn’t fot
3.0,Nice jacket but the tabs holding D rings inside pockets were not sewn in very well and pulled out on second use.
3.0,"the mask is small.. and just barely covers my mouth and nose. if I smile widely or yawn, the mask will not fully cover my mouth. mine had a missing magnet on the top part of the filter cover plate and so the plate would fall off if jarred (there are three small magnets that hold the filter plate in place). the fan does work and you can feel the air get moved through the mask filter."
3.0,I loved the suit except for the size.
3.0,It is a sturdy mask and I would pay like $30 for it but the images are misleading. This comes folded up and so you have creases and wrinkles in the helmet and black view sections. The helmet looks lopsided bc of this too. Give yourself plenty of time to reshape. Has an intense chemical smell so give time to air out. Also someone flat out lied in the question section. Would never have bought if I knew it was shipped folded up. It is a very thick mask though and comfortable at least.
3.0,"In the beginning I fell in love with it but after few washes, you can no longer wear it without ironing it. It will just look really cheap"
3.0,"The necklace is pretty, but it broke and fell off.  I ended up losing it :("
3.0,"Looks okay, is smaller than expected"
3.0,Dress is nice and fit but very long.
3.0,"It was shipped fast, and the soul gem and ring are nice.  The only issue is that the black details of both are rubbed off, and the name on the back of the ring is not Mami's, it's actually Sayaka's."
3.0,Very vibrant colors. Fits a little weird but good for a coverup.
3.0,Deberían de especificar
3.0,"We have several pairs for LTR in singles and doubles but the attachment brackets can twist in chop, turning the pontoon out of alignment. Work best when they just touch the water"
3.0,No está como se ve en la foto.<br />No tiene el cordón o la colgadera como se miraba en la foto.
3.0,Really needed this to last longer. Used on glasses while wearing a mask and driving. When I applied as directed it worked great. Then after about 10 minutes the glasses started fogging up again. It wasn’t as bad as without the stuff but still hard to see. I’ve used the product for several weeks and it’s the same every time it seems.
3.0,Very cute but runs small.  Purchased for daughter.  Sent them back and purchased the same size and color at Old Navy.  No problems with them so I know it's this companies sizes.
3.0,Fabric not the best but for the price the garment bag worked.
3.0,"The bracelet in the picture is bright colors. What you receive is pastels. Pink, baby blue... I purchased for my daughter and she hates pink. FALSE advertising"
3.0,The picture shows the dress much shorter but this dress went all the way to my ankles. I'm 5'2 so I expected it to be longer but more around my mid calf area. Definitely disappointed.
3.0,"I ordered the shown four pack pair of small/medium compression socks for work. However, this is was I received. A three pack of large/extra large in not very pretty colors, but of decent quality, hence the three stars. I would wear them, but they aren’t going to be able to do what I needed them for, as they are way too large for my legs. (See enclosed picture) As I dont want to be bothered with returning them, I will see if anyone I know with big calves needs these socks. I was really excited to get these until I saw what the outcome was. The quality of the sock is fine, and if you have bigger calves, the large/extra large will fit you well. If you order these and end up getting the ones I ordered, let me know and we can trade out. 😁 haha!"
3.0,"The design is a screen print, not embroidered.  Slightly disappointed at that.  Fits larger than other shirts from same brand."
3.0,"These are nice, the fit is right but the legs are very wide. Not like the picture, much wider that's the reason for the 3 star rating."
3.0,Runs dmall
3.0,"This swimsuit is pretty, but unfortunately did not fit properly. I ordered according to the measurements and it was about 3 sized too large."
3.0,"Only A Hat and Bracelet,2 pieces only, I paid for 4 pieces and Ordered a 2nd One it had All 4 pieces"
3.0,"I’m 165 5’6. I ordered an XL because I read the reviews, I usually wear a L in bottoms and medium in tops. The top fits perfectly but the bottoms are way too tight and may as well be a thong. I’m still going to try to make it work with a sheer cover up when I hit the beach."
3.0,very cute but uncomfortable to wear for a period of time; at a closer view looks cheaper than it appears online...Ok for a costume party.
3.0,returned. big.
3.0,"the legs look long in the picture...and they are longer than regular... but they arent that long...and if they started out that way, they shrink"
3.0,"I love the mesh idea, however they run large. They don’t stay up where they should be. They are very attractive just too big😢"
3.0,Nice earings but . . . The first pair I purchased were white enamel like the earings shown in the picture. They were lovely and I gave them away as a gift. I liked them so much I ordered a pair for myself. When I received the second pair they were only rose gold without white enamel. Sure would be nice if the product photos were consistent with the inventory. The price is right but I didn't get what I paid for.
3.0,"I got the purse and was really excited! I opened it up and it was a bit small than anticipated but it fits my keys, phone, and ID for when I go out so that's nice! The strap was inside the purse to I had to slip it on myself; one side was smoother but the other side slip was stuck and I had to use a pen to pry it open, it still doesn't open very well. The strap is a little difficult to make longer as it seems it is cheap. The little clip on the front gets stuck easily also, it is hard to turn.<br /><br />Other than that's it's a nice purse to use for going out, you get your money's worth. :)"
3.0,They pinch your nose pretty bad and they feel pretty fake.
3.0,i would have kept this but there is no underwire to support the cups and keep it in place so if you bend over you'll most likely spill out or flash someone. the look of the suit is very flattering overall but i decided to return it for the zero support at the bust.
3.0,The bands were a bit skinnier than the original band. The clips also were not as easy to insert into the band or the watch. But they are a good quality thickness and seem like they will last longer than the original!
3.0,I dislike it to small very tver cut but its thin and small hin.
3.0,Nice design. Poorly constructed.
3.0,Nice quality and made well but not true to size
3.0,arrived as described and ahead of time
3.0,Dress is really cute is looks like the pictures. BUT the sizes are totally off I am usually a small and ordered a medium since I’d pictured the dress would run small but when it came in the medium was more of an xx-small or an x-small. I had to reorder my dress in an x-large hopefully this one fits correctly.
3.0,Wow.....way too small! I ordered a size up and still too small.
3.0,It was too tight order a size up
3.0,"It's really good quality and pretty, but it's super long in the back. If it is tucked in it's okay."
3.0,"Too small, love the color."
3.0,Nice leather.  Lots of options and room.  Was larger than anticipated.
3.0,"Sound quality is good, battery life is now that good. Fits a little on the tight side."
3.0,"The support from the Birko is good and the comfort cushioning is very good for tennis.  However, the problem of universal fit rears its ugly.<br />I bought these insoles to replace the Nike and Asics tennis shoe insoles, which don't have enough arch support.  Unfortunately, the Birko insole is shorter than the indicated US M (11) on the Nike and Asics.  Fortunately, it's wide enough not to slide but short enough notice very occasionally.  I'm not sure going a size up is a good thing either.  You can't cut it or reshape it because of the toe supports.  It has to fit or not."
3.0,"So cute, but way too big-I wear it but look like I am in a tent"
3.0,"I did love this top and planned on buying more until I realized that the material is so flimsy that stains pretty much ate a hole through it after one wearing.  I now have a tiny colorless circle in front.  So frustrating.  Otherwise, it is incredibly comfortable and fits wonderfully."
3.0,Glasses fit and work well. Did not receive the micro fiber bag though.
3.0,Is a little nice necklace . Not sure I would buy again but is nice one.
3.0,"I mean it's meh, cute pendant, but it's too stretchy, it doesn't retain its form. Not like the other tattoo chockers...still cute tho."
3.0,Socks are really thin material. Pretty small too.
3.0,Color and fit is true to sizing.
3.0,"It's pretty and fits good but it's not as short as pictured. I'm 5'5"" and it comes down to the top of my knees."
3.0,Ordered the torti shell glasses and lenses are much darker than in the photo.  I love the frames and have ordered before but would like the lighter lenses like in the photo.
3.0,Love the idea. Love that you are basically adding elastic to your pants when using this. A little too stretchy and the sizing lock/clip is poorly attached and doesn't keep the length of the belt that you set it for at the beginning of the day/night.
3.0,"Didn't look anything like the picture. Received a hot pink, orange, lime green and yellow fringe bikini. Fit well though!"
3.0,Good watch but cannot read the dial of the watch. Day/date way too small
3.0,"I bought three (3) packs of these socks for myself and my two teenage daughters. I wear an 8 in shoes. They both wear a 10 in shoes. The socks fit them both just fine but they are HUGE on my feet. The heel of the socks are no where close to where they should be. The good news (for my girls) is that I'm giving my pack of socks to them. The bad news (for me) is I still need socks. We also live in CT and the winters are quite cold. I would't call these socks ""warm"" unless you live in the south. They are kind of thin and of low quality. If you are just wearing them around the house to keep your feet warm then I""m sure you will be warm enough. If you need these socks to wear with boots to walk through snow and ice....not so much."
3.0,Not really impressed. I bought them for my teenage niece who is tall and skiny so im sure they will fit perfect. I dont think they will fit someone with a larger build :/ the quality is not that good but ok enough for kids... for some reason theses items shipped from china always have a weird and sometimes hard to get rid of smell.  Overall ok product
3.0,the clip pieces keep falling off
3.0,I received as a gift.  The bracelet was adorable but very small. I could barely get on my wrist and when I did I couldn't move it.  Not recommended if you have larger wrists
3.0,I ordered the largest size they sell but still did not fit my wife.  She wears a size 16 jeans and is pretty large breasted. We were unable to get every hook attached.  I think strings would work better as you can keep tightening them from loose to tight. I am sure this product works great for people it fits so do not want to rate it to low.
3.0,They’re cute but a little smaller than I thought. They barely fit my daughter
3.0,"Cute, live the color but runs much bigger the white and beige and has different measurements at the bust. Wish they kept it the same as the white and beige."
3.0,Feels VERY cheap (and it was pretty cheap) and color is nothing like photo. The green is...ugly.
3.0,"The fit isn’t very good, the arm holes stick out and are shaped funny. The material and color are nice. I suppose it might fit someone well but I think it’s just cut and made cheaply."
3.0,Not as nice as I expected<br />Dispointed
3.0,it is small for the bandwidth
3.0,Works for my use. Keeps time on my daily 5 mile walks.
3.0,The clasps get stuck often which can be very uncomfortable when they are in your nose. Some of the colors look really cheap and they break down if they get any liquids on them. Would not recommend as a fake nose piercing.
3.0,Fits great but material is really cheap
3.0,"I am disappointed with the fit of this suit. I am 5'4&#34;, 125lbs, bra size 34A, and wear a size 4. I ordered a Medium because the reviews said that the suit ran small and they were right. The bottoms are WAY too small, at least for me. If you are looking for bottoms that look like a thong, then this suit would be perfect for you. However, I'm not into that look so I cannot wear them. Usually I wear a small top so I was worried that it would be too big because I am very small chested, but it fits me pretty well. AKA: If you have larger boobs, then definitely get a size way bigger than you normally do. I like the top, and since it was cheap I am not going to return it, but I am pretty disappointed. It does look exactly like the picture though on the bright side."
3.0,The glasses are light weight and a bit flimsy. I'm not sure how long they will last.
3.0,The wool is very hard no real movement in the hat the bow is not attached. It's a little tight and I have a small head. I have one I brought from a store that was thinner so it have more movement(bendable) but it great for the price same review for all colors I purchase except for the royal blue one
3.0,Material is a little thin. You get what you pay for.
3.0,the dress is very pretty but the sizes run too small
3.0,Great shirt but fits about a size smaller than advertised.
3.0,"This is in no way a high impact bra, atleast not if you have a larger chest. 34DD and there is no way I could ever do any sort of running or jumping in this bra.<br /><br />It is though super cute and very comfy. I love to wear it for low impact workouts or just to lounge around in."
3.0,Can't fit my head and also the front fell off the first day I tried it on
3.0,"Update: so after having just the one I bought the 5 pack and I'm a little disappointed. 2 out of the 5 are not the best quality. The waist band seam on one is coming apart so I have about 2 inches that are not connected and a second one after 1 wash has the seams in the butt area coming apart and now is just a big hole. So for a total of around $60 only 4 out of 6 are great. So I'll see if returns are an options for the 2. These are still the best boxers I've had but check quality first.<br /><br />I got one just to try out, mostly out of curiosity. And I was surprised. They feel soft out of the package and I like the waist band and the colors. When I put them on I was happy with the fit. As a bigger guy I always have trouble with the thighs being so tight and I have to break the threads to be loose. These were perfect. They fit tight but not too tight and honestly feel like nothing is there. For me that's perfect. They fit great and I will be getting more."
3.0,Way too big for my lips but look awesome 🤷
3.0,"Normally, Coolibar knocks it out of the park, as to design. They are aware that their hats aren't just for the beach. Many of us wear them to drive and walk around office complexes, which means they need to be a bit classier than your average beach-hat. This hat is clearly designed for leisure wear, not of the more sophisticated design, yet classy enough to be worn out and about, running errands and the like. Unfortunately, it has three key flaws which make it a winter-only hat.<br /><br />First, there is a giant hole in the back of the hat. We purchased direct from Coolibar, where they only had one photo of each colorway of this hat, with no photos of the back of the hat. In the back, there is a hole, approximately three inches by two inches, over the middle of the back of the head. It is intended for ponytails. Unfortunately, it leaves a large area of hair-covered scalp fully unprotected. The point of a hat, for many of us, is to avoid the most deadly form of melanoma, the one that occurs beyond the hairline and goes unnoticed until it is too late. This is the one area that dermatologists have great difficulty examining and is also one of the several areas where people typically develop melanoma. The head, specifically, all of the area of the head that is covered by hair, must be protected. This hat does not do this.<br /><br />Second, this hat is advertised as having a three-inch brim. Actually, along the full back of the hat, the brim narrows to two inches. So, it offers little protection for the back of the neck. If you have very thick, full and long hair, then this won't matter as much for you. I have thin hair, always have, and it doesn't fully cover my neck, so this is a huge problem for me.<br /><br />Third, this hat is incredibly hot. I didn't notice when ordering, because all of their reversible bucket style hats have little ventilation holes covered by a reflective mesh, this hat has no ventilation. As a result, it causes sweating of a kind I've never experienced with a Coolibar hat. On top of the undisclosed asymmetrical brim and the giant hole in the back, which they now show in a couple of photos here on Amazon, but not on their own site, the hat has no mesh layer or mesh ventilation holes, which translates into a very unpleasant experience, if you attempt to wear this on a hot day.<br /><br />This hat, which I am keeping, will work beautifully on a cool winter morning, running my errands. It will keep my head warm, offering less protection from the sun at a time when there isn't much sun to begin with, while looking very cute. Any other time of the year it would by too hot to wear this and foolish, given the gaping hole and the two inch brim.<br /><br />Good luck finding a hat that will work for you. I do recommend this for winter use. I can't recommend this for any other time of the year. Your health matters to those who love you, just as much as their health matters to you, so please make sure that you get yourself a UPF 50+ hat that will protect you from the sun, a hat that is well ventilated, to keep you from overheating, and a hat that fully covers your head with at least a three-inch brim. I love Coolibar for all they do and they have many good options, but this isn't one of them."
3.0,Poor quality way to small
3.0,"I ordered an XL and it was too small for me, which is not often. These run small and have no stretch. I returned right away."
3.0,Washed 2 or 3 times and it's already fraying.
3.0,El tipo de tela no me gustó
3.0,"While the body fit is OK, do not like that the sleeves are not fitted. I guess this shirt is made for someone with bigger arms despite being a small. The shirt quality doesn't feel much different from my regular $2 T-shirts, and the washing instructions--hand wash and flat dry--is not convenient"
3.0,more of an extra small than a small. its soo cute and has little rhinestones on it. its fitted but worth it
3.0,"The bra stayed for a few minutes, maybe five to ten, then the cups began to slip.  I really wanted these to work, it just did not happen."
3.0,Not crazy about the material. Runs small
3.0,Bad quality and did fall apart very fast but the seller offered a refund a I can't pretend its not a beautiful watch.
3.0,It is pretty. But it is way too small for the price. I don't recommend buying this charm.
3.0,Fitt was a little off.
3.0,Runs small. Usually a 2x but was skin tight.
3.0,"The description states that the hooks are metal. They are absolutely plastic. I just got them, so I have no idea how well they will hold up. Very dissatisfied with the inaccurate description. They did arrive quickly."
3.0,Good quality but fog a lot
3.0,It looks like the picture but it runs a size smaller then what was posted on Amazon.  It's going to be my weight loss motivation dress.
3.0,"id give it a 5 only if the ring didnt fell off that easy. i didnt even drop my phone & ive only had it for a week. but besides that, i love the matt and the red color. people always ask me if i have the limited edition. and its slim which is the best feature."
3.0,Cute but.. the cross cross arrow with blue stone ring from the set  turned a finger green in 3 days. And the small arrow ring broke in two after a weeks wear.<br />Just costume for the night jewelry  I feel. But So cute.😀
3.0,"They’re cute! Frames are a good size. Obviously very cheaply made, don’t know if I’ll be able to close them because I don’t want them to break. They feel really tight behind my ears, although I do have a big head. Hopefully I can stretch them out a bit"
3.0,"I wore this dress to the rodeo. It’s pretty but do understand it’s cheap. I wore it once, washed it and the criss-Cross straps busted off in the washer. First time that’s happened to me 🙈"
3.0,Not for tall women or long legged ladies. Im 5 8 and this barely comes to mid- knees.<br />Ok Quality.
3.0,"Does the trick, but not great quality. Get what ya pay for"
3.0,This is really big on me. I ordered it thinking that I needed to size up because it was made in China. Nope I should have ordered my real size instead. This is very thin and airy so it feels really good to wear in this Summer heat but it is a little see thru. The material is not cheap it feels pretty durable. I washed this by hand and dried it laying on flat surface. There is a little stretch to it and it feels too spandex-ee and clingy and you will never get the wrinkles out. I used an iron but they came back the second I put it on. It is a nice blouse but it just isn't quite right maybe because it is too big for me. It is casual and can not be dressed up. So it is not the best but not the worst either. I hope this review helps you with your choice to purchase.
3.0,"After wearing it, it starts to get stretchy and almost fell down the bottom of my lower legs. Washing it makes it shrink a bit, so back to the shape when it arrived."
3.0,Cute but completely see-through.
3.0,Very comfy. Love the pockets. True to size. Seams are pilling. One seam split on the leg.
3.0,Fits loosely
3.0,"Bought this for my GF. Size chart grows smaller in measurements (inches) as you go up, which is an issue. Metric appears to go up accordingly. With an assumed bust size that should place her in a large, this was pretty snug. She's a 38 all day. Order larger by two sizes to be in a loose PJ set. Size up by one for comfort."
3.0,"Beautiful but too small, runs a size smaller"
3.0,"these are good shoes and look nice but they are not very comfortable, so I only wear them if i have to stand minimally. I would actually buy half a size bigger and that might feel better."
3.0,"If you have a big wrist, this probably won't fit. I do not have an inordinatley large wrist and I can just get it on. The picture makes it look more like ""brushed"" aluminum but in fact it is chrome shiney steel and the metal parts are lighter weight than I expected from the photo. I decided to keep it because it looks well enough, but it's just on the bubble of being sent back for it's crampness and the metal being much more reflective than the picture (which I would have preferred)."
3.0,Good fit. Has a small but visible scratch. Didn't want the hassle of exchanging so living with it.
3.0,"These earrings are pretty, though they did irritate my earsafter wearing them last night.  Got compliments on them though, being so pretty"
3.0,Shoes for my picky son to wear to church and so far (few months) they are holding up to the drive of a 10 year old fine.  The size was a little smaller than expected but shoe width was great.  The size was not significant enough to send back but smaller than expected.  So far the toe is holding up with no scuffs.  I would by them again in the future.
3.0,"I do not think they will hold up, I've had better ones before."
3.0,Cute but small for my head.
3.0,"I bought a size larger than what my daughter currently wears, sadly I don't see this getting her through to the spring/summer months. She wears an 11, so I bought a 12 but they already fit too snug."
3.0,Loved The Beautiful Brief Case I Ordered until I Started Looking At It Closely. The Inside Zipper Pull Was Missing Pull Tab. I Shopped Very Carefully Because The Case Was So Expensive. I Am Very Disappointed In Receiving A Incomplete Case. I Will Not Recommended Your Company To Anyone And Think You Should Send A New Case or Replace Missing Parts. I Was Planning On Giving The Case As A Gift Today. Very Dissatisfied And Unhappy.
3.0,But they work
3.0,The material isn’t as forgiving as I hoped buying an XL. I have a booty too so when I squat or bent over they’d go down with me. I had to readjust them quite a bit. They did keep my legs from chaffing when I ran.
3.0,"Nice looking watch but the watchface is larger then I expected at 1.5&#34; in diameter so it looks somewhat odd because I have a small wrist.  Don't care for the watchband, for you need to take out links to adjust its size.  An expansion band would have been a lot nicer. So far its kept accurate time. For the price its an OK watch."
3.0,"Look pretty cheap, size small"
3.0,When I saw these I was looking for black jeans and that's what I got I thought they would be much more grey but I got what I wanted and that was black also they fit nice on my legs but once you get to the band it's a bit big but not to big where it falls off but nothing a belt can't fix
3.0,I usually wear a large but these were so tight and uncomfortable. I will have to buy XXL. In their fine print it says XXL is 31.5 inches. Hoping it will fit.
3.0,Beautiful but really small so the abalone shell really doesn't show .
3.0,It's a little longer than any other nose ring I've purchased
3.0,As expected nothing great. One of the fake diamonds is glued on sideways.
3.0,The bottoms were a little smaller than I expected. Suit is cute
3.0,Was dissatisfied in the thin quality. Definitely just ok enough to wear around the house. Elastic at calf is not great. I have athletic calves and they won’t stay down. Raises up to rest just under my knee.
3.0,My teenage daughter bought this hat but it was too small. It seems more sized for children. The material was thin also. She returned it.
3.0,Was supposed to have 7 rings only got 6. Sending back smh...
3.0,"I would love if not so over-sized. The lenses are just too big for my medium, oval shaped face. Great design."
3.0,I love the design but the retractable cord would get caught and stuck and it broke way too easily too. Not happy w the quality of that part. Otherwise the image itself is awesome
3.0,Does not fit like an XL it’s way too small. Feels more like a small to me.. I’m 5’11” and weigh 250 pounds. It’s a small on me :/
3.0,These bracelets are very cool for a man. But one flaw is that the string tie doesn't hold well. Eventually you have to tie a know to get the braeclet to stay into place. Shame...
3.0,The smell of the shoe was awful. I had to return
3.0,Shirt fits great and is super comfortable. Only problem is I’ve washed it once and it’s already falling apart. It is pilling up the back and across the front.
3.0,"It could be better.  I had to return it and get a full refund, because it didn't have a pen holder, and it didn't have enough compartments to fit all my stuff it.  Also the zipper was very stiff to zip and unzip.  Thank you Amazon for hassle free return, and a full refund of this purchase.  I did however get a different brand and more compartments, hopefully I will like it more than this one.  The one good thing is though, is that it seems to be pretty good material that this wallet was made from, that it why I was giving this a 3 star."
3.0,"I like the fabric and style, but the bra cups are too small.  I ordered an XL and although the shirt fits, the bra cups are too small for my C-D breasts"
3.0,I did return this dress. I didn't like the color with the style. In another color it would be a lovely spring dress. Fit was OK as far as I remember. Not liking the dark color I did not  pay close attention.
3.0,Good material but the torso was not long enough and the sleeves are too short. You need to make 3x extra tall
3.0,"These are very cute, but an 8 is very small and narrow.  The shoes are really heavy and I felt really clumpy in these so I returned them."
3.0,"It doesnt look like the picture, haven't had a chance to see how it fits, its kind of see through though."
3.0,Sizing was incorrect-a medium was very small so I had to return the shirts.
3.0,Yes ! I love my glasses! I wear my sun glasses at night lol!!! That's my joke...
3.0,"The pendant as pictured on-line looks like it is an amber color, but what I received is much more orange.  I didn't mind that because on-line photo colors are often different than the actual product.  However, after a little while, the pendant spontaneously popped out of its setting.  It had clearly come unglued.  I popped it back in and can repair it with strong glue, but be aware that glue is what holds the pendant together.  Otherwise, I like the chain and the long length."
3.0,"The leather is very thin and each strand of chain is separate, not a whole piece.  Also, you will need a small wrist, this is made for tiny arms."
3.0,I would rather have luggage tags that are enclosed in some sort of pouch to better protect the information on the tag.  I did permanent marker but it kind of blurred somewhat.
3.0,"This is a nice fit , I thought it was thick material but it was light weight ( ended up working out with expected weather ) . Was a little scratchy by the neck area ~ not sure if it was the stitching or material. Lots of compliments . Overall happy I got it ."
3.0,Very pretty good material but if you a a small butt don’t get it
3.0,Very cute dress it fit great on my baby but the zipper don't work it gets stuck and if ai force it Its most likely I'll damage the dress !
3.0,I weigh 117 lb and it was snug but not uncomfortable. However even with low heals (boots) the dress was too long. The material is a little stiff and not sure if it would have shrunk if washed/dried. The color was spot on. Lastly it made a weird crease by my hips (maybe because I’m too short?)
3.0,Size up on this
3.0,Not as expected but will work
3.0,The boot looks great with jeans. But the tounge is stitched to the boot and the long strings doesn't go all the way up. My feet was cold first day I put them on in december. So I start wearing thick socks with them.
3.0,"Nicely made, adds some warmth. Runs small."
3.0,sorta small and light ok for pinky ring
3.0,I don’t love them. Maybe a size up on this one would have been better
3.0,"The style was fine, and it fit fine, but I didn't like the pattern in person.  Looked like a Christmas tablecloth to me.  I sent it back.  Fast refund, easy return.  Amazon is good like that."
3.0,The price was cheap and I bought these based on all the great reviews. The fit is fine and doesn't ride up and the front pockets are convenient and fit an Iphone XR perfect. The high percentage of spandex of the material feels cheap to me and not breathable and has too much of a sheen for my liking. The good thing is that there is no camel toe or riding up. I am comparing these to LuluLemon or Lucy yoga pants that I wear regularly. I think they are fine for just laying around the house but I won't be wearing to the gym or running errands.
3.0,"Pretty good for what you pay.  They were a little cheap in quality, but the kids liked them."
3.0,"Mmm en la primera lavada ya se puso cómo un tshirt para estar en casa, no tiene buena calidad."
3.0,I have bought similar hats and this hat is very big.
3.0,"Very cute, but adjust too easily and it broke within a week.."
3.0,"Product comes in a nice somewhat fancy looking box from an American company. Inside the box I find it in it's own protective clear -cheapo- plastic case. As expected, product is made of plastic, looks good so far, fits fine on my glasses but definitely fragile. It looks like it could break easily, on the other hand it is to fit on top of my glasses and I am definitely careful with those so I think the product is fine for the purpose. I'm only giving it three stars because for what it is, it is definitely too pricey. I would have preferred the product to come in a simple packaging rather than the marketing gimmick simply made to justify a high price."
3.0,Super cute.  I'm really excited to wear it.  Very cheap material.
3.0,Fits good at the top and like parachute at the bottom.
3.0,"I ordered up a size because most maxi dresses fall short on me, I probably did not have to since the length is actually a little longer. I was disappointed to find a hole in one of the pockets as I ordered this to travel to AZ in September for my grandgirls birthday party. I stitched it with out an issue, I just would like a product to come complete."
3.0,Cuts super small!!! Very short. Plunge is to the waistline.
3.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 135 lbs. I ordered a M but it looked huge on me and was well under my knees. I was looking for a more flattering look."
3.0,Super cute but extremely to heavy.
3.0,"Warm enough. However, it holds lent all the time so I'm returning it because it looks silly when it's looking unclean all the time."
3.0,"I love these nose rings. They are so cute and easy to put in and take out. My only issue is that the hinge loosens over time and will pop open easily after about a month or two of wearing. I have to take it in and out for work, so the hinge gets used a lot. I suppose if you can put it in and leave it in, the hinge won’t get so worn down. Very cute though!"
3.0,"My daughter was very excited when these came in. The boots were sparky, warm, and surprisingly light weight. Since it is light weight, there isn’t much shoe structure so the boot falls flat. After a week of wearing, the heel isn’t as snug as I would hoped so it causes an odd step in the back but my daughter still loves them."
3.0,Nice but not recommended for tall people. It would have to be a stay at home outfit for me now.
3.0,You get what you pay for. One of the boxers ripped within three weeks and I had to throw it away.
3.0,They are a LOT smaller than the photo makes them look (since there is nothing to compare them to in the photos)
3.0,"Cute sweater but it looked a little worn. Runs a little big on top. I own several tops from Patty Boutik and usually order a large, I ordered a medium and it was just a little to big."
3.0,"Bag is smaller than advertised. The size listed on the tag is 7.5&#34; W X 9&#34; H, which is too small for my needs.<br />Color is not as advertised either. The picture on Amazon shows a vibrant red that looks almost hot pink, when in reality, the color is a dark red.<br />It is too small for my needs and is the wrong color.<br />I expect truth in advertising from Amazon, and did not get it. I won't buy from this vendor again.<br />Having said all that, the bag is quality construction and instead of returning it, I will give it to a little girl to play with."
3.0,I like this shirt but the sleeves fit funny.
3.0,Nice just very tiny
3.0,"My daughter’s favorite color is orange and it’s so hard to find cute orange things for her, so I was very happy to find these. The upper part is very fluffy and soft, but there is no cushioning to the foot and the soles are very hard. They don’t seem comfortable at all, but my daughter loves their fluffy oranginess, so that’s why I’m giving it three stars. These would easily be five with a cushioned footbed."
3.0,Loved the softness and how comfortable it was.  Pockets were also a plus!!!
3.0,"I bought this for a pirate costume. The coin is lightweight and just over half an inch across, a little too small for the costume. It mimics a designer coin necklace, but the coin is much thicker than the real gold coin necklace would be so it looks pretty cheap. I wouldn't recommend it as everyday jewelry for that reason. Since doesn't exactly suit either use, I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,The side seems twisted.  Loved the fit the first time I wore them.
3.0,"This product is subpar, thin like a tshirt and poor quality 😭"
3.0,Too small to fit this should have elastics style material so that it can fit multiple specs.. had to return
3.0,"Good product, but a little tight at the top of the shoe so difficult inserting foot."
3.0,"I love the look of these boots.  Very disappointed that their size 10 is not true to the measurements they provide, and unfortunately they don't offer anything larger.  I am typically a size 9.5/10US or 40/41EU.  My toes hit the end of the shoe.  I don't know if they will stretch in the length if I try to wear them for a bit.  I purchased these in Black, Red, and Gray and they are all super cute.  Sad that I will have to return all 3 pairs due to their length."
3.0,"So this is a 7/8 but fits more like an 8/9. It's a little big for an almost 8 year old who wears a 7/8, medium."
3.0,"Brim width is good - wide enough to block the sun but not obstruct your vision. Size chart is accurate. The hat would work best in cool to moderate temperatures.  The top is not adequately vented and is uncomfortably hot at 90+ degrees.  Overall it will be a good 2 season hat, but I won't be able to use it during the summer."
3.0,Lovely color a little cheaply made but still served its purpose.
3.0,This purchase was a replacement for my wife.  She's able to fit everything into it that she wants to carry in this type of container.  Down side:  the awful smell from the inside of the wallet!
3.0,Good build. Good.
3.0,Good band. Perfect size. Very stylish.
3.0,"Silicone is holding up fine, but after a few months of use, the white outline has started to come off. Have not yet contacted seller though to replace according to warranty."
3.0,"This dress did not arrive in the polka dot pattern listed above. The dress had a rather unattractive flower pattern. But, no worries. I cut off the attached dress and kept the top as a flowy summer top over my jeans!"
3.0,Fit very weii Loved the soft material
3.0,"Several faint gray splotches on the brim and up near the forehead part of the hat.  Only noticeable in certain lighting and angles.  Would prefer to have no splotches.  However, the material feels nice, the hat fits great, with it being roomy near the ears for those with thicker hair.  Is comfortable and smooth (no thread poking out).  If it weren't for the splotches, I would rate this hat a 5/5. Mostly happy with it though. Will look great in outfit of the day pictures."
3.0,"Pretty color and nice fabric. I always order extra large because I sometimes wear a back brace, but this was too tight across the bust and it hung awkwardly."
3.0,Well made just doesn't stay where you need it
3.0,Was beautiful but came with a rip down the center seam.  Looks like poor surging but it was gorgeous even with the rip.  May have to roll the dice and reorder....
3.0,They stay on and they serve the purpose. They do not slip off of my foot into my shoe... But they are so tight that they are very uncomfortable
3.0,Ordered a medium and it was a bit large. I had to return as it arrived with a hole. Owner told me to contact Amazon. Just sending it back. What a waste of time!!
3.0,No era lo que esperaba tamaño muy pequeño
3.0,The blue-blocking clip on glasses are too large but they work: my eyes feel better and see better after a session at the computer.
3.0,Shirt is very tight. Order one size up unless you are skinny.
3.0,Not the material i would of liked and the shorts are long but it is good for under dresses or skirts
3.0,I've ordered a few times.  Its fallen out and has gotten lost. Needs to be squeezed together to stay in. And have lost the stone in them as well. Hopefully this new one lasts longer.  I do love the way it looks.
3.0,"Like another reviewer complained, the sequins scratched up my poor daughter's underams after wearing it.  :-(  It's a beautiful-looking dress, but will always have to be worn with a shirt under it."
3.0,They hurt the sides of my head above my ears...Not sure why...
3.0,"Again, the bodice of the dress is too short.  It's been my experience that most of the dresses that come from China are not made for a full-figured woman such as myself.  I can make it work, but barely."
3.0,"I ordered a size medium per the size chart.  I normally wear a woman's size 9W shoe.  The socks were about 1 1/2 to 2 inches longer than my foot, unstretched.  So the whole heal of the sock would be peeking out over the top of my shoe.  I thought the weight of the sock was nice, and the cushioning was nice.  The arch support and toe seams were fine.  The yarns, however, had some broken or shredded threads that looked like they could ravel easily.  I think for the price, they are appropriate, so I gave them a 3, but I think the seller needs to look at the quality control at the source."
3.0,Reviewing again after 5 months of use. I like it except the length adjustment latch is now slipping causing the band to become loose and slip around my wrist. I have to readjust it every day now which is somewhat of a pain in the neck
3.0,"The earrings arrived on-time in a very nice box and bag. From a distance, the earrings look pretty nice and shiny, but when I look closely, the bezel is not concentric, and the gold color is rubbed off at the stem of one of the earrings."
3.0,Adjustable  waist strap poor design for a 300.00 jacket  little bit long  from collar to bottom but i like the jacket over all .
3.0,The front closure is not very sturdy..mine's almost gonna rip.
3.0,"Easy to put on and fits my 2007 Jeep Liberty spare. Nothing fancy, looks like vinyl but does the job. However, it came with 2 nicks/holes and is already peeling. Will probably return."
3.0,"Good price, but as a 16, even the XXL were a bit on the small side."
3.0,"This would probably work best on someone who is slightly bigger then me. I'm a 34a. The bra looks a little weird to me. Its really bulky on the side. Maybe it would be more smoothed out if you had a bigger bust but it's a little weird for me. Also I don't particularly like the top so much because the rounded part of the bra shows. You can see that in the picture but it seems more apparent in real live. Could be a pro or con for you but this bra has allot of padding, which I don't particularly like. It seems like decent quality though."
3.0,They got a run in them after only two wears and no washes.  Sadly disappointed.  Returning
3.0,"Fit as expected, a bit sheer but still looked nice."
3.0,The chain kept coming off the skirt so I wasn’t able to get good use out of the skirt
3.0,Not as sturdy as the original bands that comes with the watch. Always seems to come unclasped. Otherwise a pretty good band.
3.0,Not super great.
3.0,Quality product but definitely the color of the picture is deceiving.  I wanted a more muted coral color (as I feel the pic shows) and it's definitely a bright pink. Tore the package apart so can't return it. 😳
3.0,One broke immediately and I sent it back. The other is still intact. They need to be strong if your going to dance with them on. They are beautiful though!
3.0,The material is cheap and stretchy.
3.0,"I was really excited to purchase this swimsuit and I read the reviews and went a size larger so it would fit. When I got it, it was to big! It also didn't have any support for you boobs, being a size 34dd I needed that! The colors were also not  as vibrant as the picture shows, so it ended up being return unfortunately."
3.0,JUST OKAY.
3.0,"I was excited to receive this dress, but I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was more of a swimsuit coverup. I almost returned it because I was looking for more of a wrap dress, but after trying it on a couple times, I could envision wearing it over jeans or leggings and decided to keep it. I'm 5'5&#34; 185 lbs and the XL fits loosely."
3.0,"I fell in love with the design of this necklace but unfortunately, it didn't hold up well. The black ink on the moon detail started to fade and the necklace eventually broke. Do not wear his necklace in water."
3.0,Beautiful necklace. Flips while wearing it and it's starting to turn.
3.0,Guess I didn’t read close enough but it’s more of a nylon type fabric instead of sweatshirt feel.
3.0,Material appears thicker than what it is. Non- forgiving fabric. Order a larger size.
3.0,"This top was made well, just came way too small. Size up"
3.0,"5 starts for quick delivery.  These are okay for young childs gift.  Not well made, but what do you expect for a couple of bucks? Shipping was free; granddaughters love them, so an OK deal."
3.0,works good for biking bit short on the length be nice to have a longer version 30in or 35in long
3.0,I wasn’t happy with my purchase but they were more than willing to work with me and refund me in full and I no longer need to worry about the hassle of returning it.
3.0,"Way too big, bought it for my 2 year-old base on the provided size chart, had to give it to my 5 year-old nephew. It’s cute though."
3.0,Cute ring. Daughter loved it but it was very thin. Feel like if you adjusted it very many times it will break.
3.0,"The quality is lovely, the people saying the xxl fits thick thighs are obviously not plus sized. Very dissapointed this came up in search for plus sized. If you are over a size 14, steer clear."
3.0,"Takes a while to figure out how to unhinge this buckle. A couple accidents, and you soon learn. Nice weight to the buckle. I think the mechanics could be a little friendlier though."
3.0,SMALLER THAN EXPECTED
3.0,Very clingy. Ordered a large and it was tight.
3.0,"Bought this for my wedding because I loved this look so much and didn’t want to be traditional... but it’s too small on my chest (yes I ordered bigger than I expected). It also seems cheaply made but then again, it was pretty cheap so i shouldn’t have expected it to be anything but that.."
3.0,"it's fine,but I've enjoyed better quality"
3.0,"The cape didn’t button, runs big"
3.0,"For the price, was not expecting a real pearl. However, it fell apart when I was trying to clean the chain. So, done."
3.0,These have so much potential! The shape and design are beautiful! But the stones look cheap and it’s fairly thin.
3.0,It broke after 30 days
3.0,Runs a little small for bills
3.0,"They are pretty. Quality could be better. But ok f o r the price. They keep rolling down. So I cave the to my daughter which is much smaller then me, and she had the same problem."
3.0,Fits nicely not as breathable as I had hoped but still confortable
3.0,"A bit smaller than expectef, do hsasd to trim some pics."
3.0,won't stay on hook......fish want more color
3.0,Love it but it turns my fingers green
3.0,"unfortunately, the color is too &#34;bright&#34; and brassy. otherwise, it's light, great for stacking with other bracelets, and well made."
3.0,I'ts very nice but it runs to big
3.0,"This umbrella is a perfect size for our patio.  However, it continues to move quite a bit with even a little wind.  The tilt feature is very good, but is even more sensitive to light winds.  I would have given the product five stars if the umbrella had wind slots at the top."
3.0,loved this necklace but it broke after the 2nd time i wore it:(
3.0,I have other dresses from this brand that I love but this one fell short for me. Great color but wasn't a good length for me and the bodice was sewn unevenly.
3.0,Very square bought it as a gift didn't really like it
3.0,"beautiful and very functional.  Very good quality, think it will last.  I love it.  fits my 15&#34; macbook fine.<br />Update: I've been using it for 2 years now, at least twice a week.  I use leather lotion on it twice a year but the pocket side is very faded.  Still like it very much.<br />very faded and old looking now in spite of leather lotion."
3.0,it comes folded up which leaves creases in it that are hard to straighten
3.0,"good item for the price, not terrific quality but who really cares for a carry bag"
3.0,"Confusing sizes: the garter belt was ridiculously small, but the stockings fit me fine. Now I have thick thighs, but not very big hips, or a very big waist, so I think the sizes were completely off from one another to begin with. I couldn't put the belt on without it rolling up into nothingness. I ended up using the stockings with a different lingerie set, and they looked good, hence the 3 star rating. So it'f you're only buying it for the stockings, then go ahead, but if you want the set, find a different one."
3.0,"Sent this back, just wasn’t what I liked but seemed like good quality"
3.0,Size up one or two sizes. I returned it to small.
3.0,"I got the navy dot dress with the hi-lo hemline in size XL. I like the hemline. Most comparable dresses are very long maxis, some with slits on the side. The fabric does not have much give. It is more like a weave rather than a knit and it has very little stretch. Between the hemline and the fabric, I feel like the skirt part hangs well and has good movement. I like that the hem is off the ground so if I wear it around water, it won't touch the ground and get wet. However, the bust area is very tight. I bought it to wear over a navy dot swimsuit. The two navy colors aren't the same, which is always a problem with navy. But they still look cute together. Except for the bust. I wish a larger size was available so I could try that."
3.0,"The jacket fit as expected but the cut of it is a little awkward in the shoulder and chest area. If you’re looking for something truly tailored, this isn’t it. But for the price, it did the trick."
3.0,"Loved the style and design, but it's too big for my face, and made me look like a bug.  I just don't like the big, over-sized glasses trend."
3.0,"Poor quality, not a very good depictions of the knights templar. I would suggest to keep searching for an alternative."
3.0,Sadly I returned it because for the size it still was a little tight on me & so that's why I gave it a three star.
3.0,I wanted to love this! When i put it on it seemed promising but after i few steps i realized id have the same problem as always. You know... the unintended thong. 🤦🏾‍♀️ for a slimmer girl im sure it would be great. The lacey part it kinda sexy but NOT when its giving you a wedgie. Lol
3.0,doesn't fit well. Its like top is mis sewn. i would pass on this item. Buttons are skimpy too
3.0,Would have been very nice but runs quite large.
3.0,"Says it is pashmina, but the tag is just stuck on, so I doubt that it really is.  Material is very thin."
3.0,"The dress came with two stains and had to be immediately washed, which was gross and disappointing. The material is a little weird as others have mentioned, kind of like sleek costume material that wrinkles easily. Overall it’s cute, falls just over the knees, and is festive, but don’t expect great quality."
3.0,"Good quality, better than expected.<br /><br />Only downside is it really pulls the hair on the arm."
3.0,the chain part broke after about a month of wearing it. Great product for the price though.
3.0,I love the way it looks. I went by the size chart they provided. Way to big. If i could go a size smaller it would be perfect.
3.0,"While I love the look of these ratings, they are very cheaply made. The metal upper portion and post is of very low quality. I have semi sensitive ears and I couldn’t even keep the poste in for a minute. I often wear Costume jewelry without a problem but not this pair. It’s a pity because they are pretty."
3.0,Cute but was already falling apart.
3.0,"I realllllly wanted this one to fit me. It was far too small, I could barely get it around my shoulders/chest and I'm basically an A cup. I missed my return window on this one, so looks like I either have to shrink or donate it. I gave it 3 stars because it honestly is a REALLY cute dress and if you're super petite, I would recommend!!"
3.0,"Love the size. It feels kind of off, like it's heavier on one side; uneven. But it works for a pair of $9 glasses."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:1b312eabda50c7af71efcb6ce10a8cf2]] I first fell in love with this bag when I saw it from a different seller in 2021 when I was looking for a bag to compliment my dress for a wedding I was attending. I thought this would be great for dinner dates and not just formal functions. I didn’t realize that majority of the bag was mesh and not rhinestone, not sure how I didn’t pickup on that but except I knew it just didn’t sparkle enough for me. The rhinestone are nice on the bag and overall, the bag is cute but seeing the bag on the photos and how much I loved it and having it was a bit disappointed. I checked the initially seller page that made me fell in love with the bag and it is the same exact bag. One of the biggest downfall of the bag is it couldn’t fit my iPhone 13 Pro Max with case. It took a lot of maneuvering to get it in and once in, I couldn’t close the bag. I need a bag that holds my phone, keys, mirror, a lipstick, license, a card and a $20 or $50 bill. I don’t ask for much but this doesn’t meet those standards which is quite disappointing. If you have a small phone or don’t mind that your phone doesn’t fit in your bag then this bag is great. I don’t like the straps either, I think it makes the bag look cheap and I would definitely change it out to make the bag look a little more elegant. Otherwise, the bag is nice for a night out."
3.0,The print was as cite as it was in the picture. I’m disappointed in this shirt because the collar seems stretched out/loose so the shirt looks sloppy when put on
3.0,The claim that these fit everyone is false. The loose-fit claim applies only to a tiny woman's skinny arm. These fit a 5-foot woman of small to average size. I suspected as much going into this purchase so they will be used. I cannot comment on durability as I just purchased these.
3.0,"Cute nose ring, but the diamond is too large and is very obvious, I prefer a smaller size. If was smaller, would definitely recommend product."
3.0,Item wasn't what I expected. No mention that this is a locket. Made it to look open. Also tarnished on the back when received
3.0,"Earrings were MUCH larger than I anticipated.  My 13 year old cannot wear them, but I saved them for a costume."
3.0,Clamps are a joke. Collar is uncomfortable.
3.0,Stretchy material knee length looks like picture !
3.0,The fabric was not the best and the white snaps the white coating will chip when you wash it.
3.0,Bought these as a Christmas present for my daughter they were very cute.
3.0,Size upppppp
3.0,"Very small, or I have a large head."
3.0,"I bought the white & had to put 2 more layers of fabric underneath as a lining to not see through it.  It is a very cool top & I’ve considered getting another, but definitely not white.  The Small was tight on me, but I expected that & only got it because it was all they had at the time & I needed it quickly.  Should’ve gone with a Medium at least."
3.0,"The ring have very  heavy black stain on some areas, I will try to polishing?"
3.0,"Do not like the fabric and was too small, returned...but customer service was very helpful, would order from this company again.  If you have larger breasts I would go up a size, maybe that would help with the fit..."
3.0,The seam by the wrist was not sewn together.  Still wearable but for a shorter time.  They are starting to completely come undone at the seam.
3.0,"I have small hands. My ring finger is normally a size 5. These rings are VERY small, not for large hands. Maybe 2 or 3 of the rings fit past my knuckle"
3.0,"Super cute, great price but lens was cracked. Started a return but got busy and it was too late to send them back by the time I had time to go to post office. So, i just wore them with cracked lens. 🤷"
3.0,Too short for a tall man 6 ft 5 in
3.0,Fabric could be more substantial.
3.0,overall fit a little large for a medium.
3.0,The material was super soft and stretchy but it was very shapeless. For someone with a bigger chest it ballooned out and made me look like a tent. Unfortunately had to return.
3.0,Little small ..
3.0,Not exactly what I expected for me but my daughter like them so wasn't too much of a waste
3.0,"Very pretty and seemed well-constructed, but cups fit more like a demi or balconette. Not what I was looking for, so I returned."
3.0,I liked this coat a lot. I bought the wine colored one and some bleach fell on it. So I actually spent more money and bought another one. Two weeks later the zipper broke!!! I ended up sewing on some magnetic buttons and that’s how I used it last winter.
3.0,Very comfortable. But the tend to stretch on the sides making the bottom uneven.
3.0,I got two of these for two small girls. The red one is much smaller than the orange.
3.0,"5ft 8 in, 132 lbs. I got a M because of chest size.  Lots of fabric in hip area for me(not pear shaped) and if I go down a size will be too tight in chest.  I purchased the white with leaves and it wasn't see through."
3.0,These are rather baggy and they have no tie strings or belt loops
3.0,"The item has beautiful colors and fit well, however it has no lining and therefore exposed under garments and body part therefore I gave it three stars"
3.0,"These gloves/Mittens are a bit loose. Also, hands get really sweaty when being active outside."
3.0,"It was smaller than I wanted for my daughters wedding, thankfully I had ordered another size that was perfect for the occasion but the quality was good."
3.0,"As it happens with most of the ethnic wear, this picture is not a true depiction of what you receive.<br /><br />Pros:<br />For $25, quality is not bad at all.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Colors in the photo are not actual colors. Yellow is more &#34;neon-ish&#34;. Orange is less vibrant.<br />2. The flare of the skirt in the picture is misleading. The actual skirt is narrower.<br />3. Dupatta (scarf) is see through (if that matters to you)"
3.0,Looks nice but it feels a little cheap. It’s also a bit shorter than expected  but if I had sized up it would be too baggy. It’s not right and fitted as expected.
3.0,"This bag is hard to rate. The leather is wonderfully soft, and the pockets, organization, size, etc. are perfect-almost exactly what I've been looking for. Unfortunately, the straps are a deal-breaker. They are stiff, uncomfortable, and will not stay on my shoulder. I'm debating whether to send it back, since the bag is so nice (if I keep it, I'll have to cut off these straps and replace/have them replaced with something workable)."
3.0,"I wanted a simple navy skirt that was fairly sturdy for work (I work in an elementary school).  The color is true, it fit fine, and has a nice drape/weight to it.  Only complaint is that I have yet to get the fold creases out of it from when I received it!  They're not that noticeable to others, but it bugs me.  I'll probably order another in a different color anyway though.  One note on the fabric - it's like a ponte knit, so it's a bit polyester shiny rather than a flat matte look."
3.0,Very pretty and feminine but a bit smaller than I expected.
3.0,You have to wear a slip under.
3.0,"Pretty stockings, however they were quite large for how the size chart fit me. So, while attempting to pull them up farther to where they would stick, I ripped them. :(."
3.0,"The person whom the shirt was for is that size, but the size run too big"
3.0,"The bottom part has a thick seam that can be visible if wearing thin material over it , not the best idea when trying to wear them discreetly"
3.0,Zipper broke really soon
3.0,"Ummmno, this dress is probably just not meant for girls my shape. I'm a 34 DD with a small waist (size 4/6) and little booty (we all can't have J. Lo tushies). I got the dress in a size large after reading the reviews. the top was stretched so much the black became grey. I'm 5'4 and the dress was very long on me. I was hoping to design would accentuate my tush to give the allure of more fullness...as we used to say as kids, SIKE...it looked more flat and just sad lol...it's seems like its well made, but just not for my physique. Returned it must be."
3.0,It doesn’t seal tape on your wrist for long periods of time could be better
3.0,"I tried on the the dress and its a good fit but I was hoping for a deeper purple.Anyway, its okay a bit cheap looking but for the price you get what you get. Overall, I'll give it a three."
3.0,"Not as nice as the picture bc the straps are super long.<br /><br />Also, no room for my fat to hide. This is super body con.<br /><br />Cute, but the straps suck."
3.0,The fabric was not what I expected and the cut is rather small
3.0,These run very large so had to return them.  Take note.
3.0,Love fabric. Pretty.  Too short. Only covers butt.  Only beach wear.  Not in town.
3.0,"I loved this ring, the color was beautiful. I wore the ring every couple of days to work for almost a 2 months until 2 of &#34;diamonds&#34; fell out."
3.0,My head was to....big
3.0,Don’t understand why a blue lives matter charm and a white essential worker charm were included in this bunch… seems deliberately unnecessary.
3.0,The fabric is a bit rough but otherwise it was a snug fit.  Not bad.
3.0,"I bought them because they’re cute, right? Duh! However they’re not that nice material band like that comes with our watches they do hold onto water despite all those cute little holes (I clean homes so I may notice more than others). Just a heads up! Not a deal breaker by any means. I love them and get lots of compliments on them."
3.0,I returned this item because I did not the shiny polyester type material.  Looked to be the right size and color was pretty.
3.0,Balls don't stay on because the strips
3.0,The material is as expected however I needed to size up two sizes.
3.0,Very pretty just like the picture but a little to small for my wrist
3.0,"I'm a 100 a standard size M, MED, Medium and thanks to ALL the reviews I ordered an XL and thank goodness because it fit just right.  Needless to say it runs super small if you are anything over a medium IRL you maybe sorely disappointed."
3.0,The stitching seemed hurried and kind of messy. There's string connecting all the words together. The overall shape of the hat is bulky and not flattering. But I pull my hood up so it doesn't show. It's warm and overall it's a good hat. I get compliments all the time on it.
3.0,This dress is very see through. You will need a slip. On the third wash one of the straps in the back broke off. But it is a very cute and comfy dress. Im 5'4&#34; and 235lb. It is a long dress even with wearing heels this dress drags on the ground.
3.0,Buena calidad pero esta perdiendo el color y brillo en un año de uso
3.0,I have had 2 of them break on me already! I was lucky to notice right away. They are easy to use & I like the colors.
3.0,I was told by everyone to burn it.  Which means it did its job.
3.0,"To short , for a tall man"
3.0,Each item too small
3.0,Lasted about 4 months of average daily use. My 12 year old use it for middle school. Cannot use back packs in school for security reason. Use it to carry her books around in school. Buys one every four to five months. It tears in the stiches. IMO should be able to get 8 to 10 months. Not ment for everyday use.
3.0,"Nice style but overpriced for what you getting, material is very thin and kind see through."
3.0,"Gloves were advertised as 40g weight of thinsulate.  They do well when not exposed to cold wind.  No activity to test and ensure waterproof claim.  Used during winter time bicycle rides and unfortunately, fingers get cold in temps below 35º.  Overall, a good glove in moderate temps."
3.0,"The face covering is very lightweight and comfortable to wear. It’s completely inappropriate for virus protection, as it is very thin. However, for increased warmth in outdoor activities, I would wear it."
3.0,I returned this as it was too big and no support whatsoever but it is very cute for a not so busty woman.
3.0,"They are beautiful gloves. However, I was very disappointed to find they do not work in a touchscreen."
3.0,I did not notice any change in my shoes.
3.0,Shirt was perfect but shorts were way too big
3.0,Too large for but it fit my mother well.
3.0,Very light weight and a little see thru. Runs very small
3.0,"They're cute and I like how they feel like flip flops with the look of a closed toe shoe. Unfortunately I wore them to the mall and got horrible blisters on my heel in less than an hour, I had to go buy flip flops from a store to con time shopping. A few weeks later I tried them again just to go grocery shopping, thinking maybe they just needed to be broken in,  and again got blisters in the same spot. They're not too tight (go up a size if you're a half size) but the material just isn't good for walking around. I'll only be able to wear for short durations, but that kind of defeated the purpose of buying this particular shoe."
3.0,The analog clock doesn't keep time.  My daughter has to re-set it daily.
3.0,The dress is ok but made from Jersey material
3.0,"Cute top, looks exactly as you would think.  Light nice fabric, so you must be prepared to were a cami or a tank under it.  The only problem is that it runs very narrow.  I am in between 2 sizes so I order the upper size to be safe and it's still very narrow.,too narrow.  If you get lucky and can get the right size you will really like it.  The color-blocking is flattering."
3.0,"It does what it is supposed to do but my gosh it digs into your arms at the top right in between your shoulder and arm put. That very sensitive skin area! It hurts! I doubt I'll be wearing this too much. Taking it off was a hassle also. At one point, I thought I would just need to cut it of me! Other than that, it fits well, and encases you like a sausage!"
3.0,Needed it for a Halloween costume.
3.0,"I loved the fabric, and it fit almost fine.  BUT, the waist was way too high.  I am a little high-waisted but the waist on this dress was almost under my breasts.  Not flattering.  I had to return it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ad93190d856d7c7d47f9b5e5f7884a0d]] I will be returning sadly. Not my favorite. I am a size 4-6 and I got a Medium. I could’ve gotten a small for a tighter fit but for some reason it did not cinch my waist like I thought it would. It made me feel boxy and not super confident but it could just be a sizing thing the material feels kind of cheap and it has a white lining so if you stretch it it’ll give that white texture.
3.0,3 out of 4 were okay. One of the chain was missing one of the hooks at the end.<br />I was disappointed when chain was missing a hook and can’t use it for as a mask chain.
3.0,Cool for the price 👍
3.0,"Nice fit, comfortable wear."
3.0,"Cute bathing suit but not the right fit for my mom hips. The bottoms were a bit tight around the waist. For reference I'm 5'5"", 26ish waist, 35ish hips, 34A chest, 112ish pounds. The top was a bit big but I have small breasts so that's probably why. I wanted to love it but it's going back, unfortunately."
3.0,cute and functional but the shoulder strap connector is starting to break - it opens up to let you remove the shoulder strap but it's starting to come apart and I'm going to have to glue it closed.
3.0,The belt is nice but to small for me. I’m a size 8-10 was to tight.
3.0,The color is a little softer than I had expected but still pretty. I prefer softer and more free flowing scarves and this is made of cotton so it is more &#34;clingy&#34;
3.0,I didn't end up keeping this suit because it was too large in the top for me. I think this would be a great halter if you've got D's or larger. Not for the smaller busted. Real cute tho! The bottoms fit great and I have a big booty.
3.0,It was a little tight at the chest and the shoulders have a strange bunching that was not flattering on me. But it’s not bad. The fabric is on the thick side.
3.0,"I bought 2 of these, one for my daughter and one for me and both the same size. Hers fit fine and she loved it. Mine was too small and had some defects in the material. Disappointed that it didn't work out for me but happy that it did for her."
3.0,Buy 1 size bigger i don't know if they have me a boy size but lol that fit my younger brother meanwhile I'm like uh it was for me though
3.0,"See through. I have an old version of the black leggins in size medium, which is too big. I purchased a size small and they are very see through, even though they fit very well. The quality also changed. The old ones are thicker and feel nicer than the new ones. I would not purchase these again."
3.0,The product I received was not the kid’s goggles. Instead I got the adult ones. The quality is nice but I wish I got the right size!
3.0,Not as loose as the photo. Fits right and not baggy at all
3.0,Definitely not tight enough for a 12 hour shift. Cheaply made
3.0,tight fit .
3.0,"I like the style and fit, but the fabric is a little too transparent. I find myself not picking this top to wear for that reason. It might work find with a tank top under it, but it is summer and too hot for that."
3.0,"The style was pretty great, but I had to return it. There were these little balls inside the beads where they were strung together and they kept falling out. Also, the color was a little shinier than it appeared in the photos - I was expecting a more antique finish."
3.0,"bad quality, cheap feel, thin leather, don't buy"
3.0,Too small I recommend sizing up if you’ve had kids. It needed tweaking here and there.  A couple of loose strings that came right out but still...the sizing was off; the 12 fit like a 10 that you would buy at target
3.0,Got this for my dad...well for my step mom . she says it works well to help with snoring but my dad says its not super comfy to sleep is.<br /><br />I received this at a reduced cost
3.0,Awkward fit but good quality
3.0,This completely broke apart the moment I tried to straighten it out. Luckily it looks super easy to put back together so I'm going to find some stronger jewelry thread/beading plastic and put it back together.
3.0,"If you love the long, loose, boho look of this sweater don't bother. You will receive a short, normal fitting sweater even if you order two sizes bigger than you normal wear. I very much doubt that this is cashmere. Material is light and flimsy"
3.0,Image was not straight. Tight and awkward.
3.0,It's my corrected size... Shoe must running larger in sizes.
3.0,"Not quite what was expected, was a gift for a 9 year old.  May be better for someone older than 9."
3.0,Hold up well but keep my feet rather warm
3.0,Very cute but the straps don’t sit well so The stitching shows on the back which is annoying
3.0,Very light weight. Nice design. Very comfortable but the sole started peeling off after a couple weeks of light use.
3.0,The color was not red. It looked like a rustic orange color. And was a lot smaller than I thought.
3.0,"I really like these boots, except they are wider at the top than I would prefer."
3.0,Seems to be of good quality EXCEPT for the zipper. If you get it just right it will zip but if you of by a nano inch no way
3.0,I thought it would be a little more closer to a regular school girl outfit but the shirt is a halter top and the skirt sits really low on the hips. but if that's what you want then it's super cute!
3.0,They are just ok.
3.0,"I purchased this watch on March 5, 2019, the strap broke in less than 1 year of normal use (see attachment). I just asked for a replacement and/or refund? I hope the company fix this."
3.0,"Cute piece of jewelry. Much bigger than I expected. Chain is flimsy and very short- too tiny for my neck, but can easily be placed on a different chain."
3.0,Cute but just fits like a normal cardigan. Not a sweater material. If you want it to look like the photo I'drecommend getting a larger size. I wear smalls and mediums and wish I would have got a large.
3.0,"Beautiful sweater, fabric is perfect"
3.0,The clasp on these does not hold very well. They are constantly coming undone and getting lost
3.0,"Dress overall is alright for a casual outing. Dress was too short for me but otherwise fit alright, I’m 5’9” 145lbs. Material did not look/feel breathable, would not be good in TX weather. Sending back."
3.0,"Nice product how it ran a little large, and I had to return"
3.0,ORDERED 3XL AND STILL A LITTLE TOO SMALL. PRETTY THOUGH.
3.0,"I’m torn. I want to love this  cardigan but there are a few things worth pointing out. I’m a size 6/8 (34DD) and 5’5” so I took a chance and ordered the smallest size they had available. Honestly I thought it would be really big on me, which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a nice, oversized cardigan to wear with leggings this winter. But that’s not what I got. The cardigan is definitely loose, but not that comfy oversized fit I wanted, which is really surprising considering it’s several sizes up. My biggest complaint is that it doesn’t even cover my butt which is how it looks on the model (who is probably only a size 10-12 herself). So I’m disappointed. That being said, the material is great. Is soft and thick and I believe pretty flattering. So I’ll be keeping this one, but just wanted to give this heads up to anyone who had the same expectation I did."
3.0,Was lovely but broke almost immediately
3.0,"I love these bras. Unfortunately, I'm down to two out of the four. My second favorite of the pack broke the first time I wore it, the strap snapped at the connector, which is why I'm giving four instead of five. The bras are so pretty, two of them were quite sturdy and have survived the dryer for over six months. The other one I don't have anymore broke right in the center, between the cups, when I was wearing it one day. I don't know if it was from wear, or if my boobs were just too big for it, but the other bras still fit nicely so I don't think its that."
3.0,"The dress fits but it's tight in the waist even after using the zipper on the size, but I can manage. However the belt is way, way too small so I have to buy another belt that's wide enough from a different company to wear with the dress. Plus sizes need longer belts to fasten around the waist."
3.0,"watch keeps time well but hard to set day-date. band not user friendly, very hard to remove links to adjust."
3.0,I was expecting to sweat more.
3.0,"It look good,  but whay it said make in Vietnam? I thought it was made in Australia."
3.0,"Was too small, and snagged just taking it out of the package"
3.0,I purchased 7 pairs of Compression Ankle Socks.  I love the variety of the colors and the way I feel when I teach indoor cycle.  I have PF. Wearing Compression Ankle Socks does decrease my discomfort when I run.  The only suggestion I have is the size of the sock.  I wear size 5 shoe. The smallest size (M) I got seems too big for me.  I wish it comes with a smaller size to fit someone like me.
3.0,"Pros: Shipping was fast. The belt isn't attached so it makes for versatility in style, Side zipper is of good quality. Stitching is good. Details are perfect! Mine was too small, so the buttons on the front made more boob room (of course I wore a cami underneath).<br /><br />Cons: Runs extremely small. Material is itchy. Tag is itchy. Probably won't wear this one much, although I love the style. It's just uncomfortable."
3.0,Loved them so much and then they broke after 4 wears! :(
3.0,they are soft and fit with a pretty low cut waist. The only issue is that they run small so just buy a size up
3.0,"My title above says it all: don't expect much from a $12 ring, but be happy with what you do get for the price. Specifically, you get a simple, elegant ring that will draw attention and admiration as long as it lasts in its original condition.<br /><br />That's the catch. Since the ring ran small, even the size 12 (not 8 like this review seems to want to say above) I got (which seems to not available anymore) ran small, which means I could not take this ring on and off like I wanted to. So by leaving it on, the stainless steel plating eventually wore off on about half the ring, and one quarter panel of the white enamel bubbled up and peeled off, ostensibly due to its daily exposure to water when I showered.<br /><br />Still, the ring served me very well for 2 months. But I would buy 1-2 sizes up if you want it to fit comfortably and plan to take it on and off, which you should since stainless steel does wear off over time if over exposed. Beautiful for the time I wore it and garnered many favorable comments---so that's what boosts it up to a 3rd star. But when you pay so little, that part doesn't last very long.<br /><br />Very Respectfully,<br /><br />Telly Halkias"
3.0,It's nice and it looks cool but it broke the second time I wore it
3.0,"Bracelet is nice, but chain comes loose to easily. Not very secure."
3.0,Really like except too large
3.0,"Love the graphic, but it’s not true to size. It fits snug, and the description of “short sleeve” should read “tank top”."
3.0,"I think I ordered a size too large.  However, they work, how ever gloves work..."
3.0,"The dress did not fit :( Eventhough I read other reviews and viewed the size chart the dress could nit zip up. I am a DD and ordered a XL. Because it was shipped out the country, it would be too expensive. I decided to give the dress to my neice.<br />The dress is BEAUTIFUL and looks just like the picture. It is made with excellent quality fabric."
3.0,"i wasn't crazy about how tight the glove was around my fingers. i'm a man of large bone structure, and perhaps that is it, but the fingers were so tight. otherwise, the item felt warm. the mitten is nice, it secured well. just not the right fit for me. it made it difficult to remove the glove."
3.0,Too short too small low waisted
3.0,"it says 26&#34;- 47&#34; waist, my waist is 34 and it won't hold my waist!"
3.0,"thought these would be like the align joggers, they are not. Very similar cut, but much more hiking pant material fabric."
3.0,my son love the short but it is now as big as i thought it would be is say a man short but it is mad a lot smaller then a men short but everything else about it is great .. so just make sure you get a size if not two biger
3.0,Super short.. the front has 2 lines that go over your panty line and are 100% see through..
3.0,"It had an extra rhinestone glued on top of another, but it WAS only $10.00."
3.0,My son loves these shoes. The lights in one show stopped holding a charge after about 2 months.
3.0,the ring portion is small and I am a size 5 in ring a full size smaller than standard
3.0,Fits awkwardly. Fits but rides up and doesn’t stay in place. It’s cute but I wish it fit perfect
3.0,"The hat does not look like it does in the photo. It was completely folded and folded again and shoved into an envelope for shipping!!<br />I guess the seller does not really care about the product. I am not sure how to get the wrinkles and folds out? I would be afraid to get it wet and put it in the dryer, it may just shrink even more? I am an average woman with an average size head and this hat is very small. I am a size 8-10 woman. Will not order again."
3.0,"Cute, but quality is definitely lacking."
3.0,Fit but the sides had an unusual clumping of material so it wasn't sleek like the picture.
3.0,"The sweatshirt in the online photo looks more like an 'elongated' top than what it actually is. Its a nice quality fabric but the style fits more like a plain oversized regular sweatshirt. I ordered a medium and it is huge thru the middle. The gray shaded area with the leopard print is more of a dark brownish color, not gray like shown in the photo. Disappointed.  Nancy N."
3.0,This sunglasses is ok sun still shine in your eye and it’s a little small to put over the regular glasses
3.0,"The material is strong, not that cheap Halloween material most costumes are made of.  I ordered an XL to make sure there was extra give, however, this XL fits like a very small Large, or a larger Medium.  It will still work for me with a few minor changes/layering, which I was going to do anyway since it will be cold out.  Definitely worth the price, but be sure you order a size up."
3.0,Very thin material. This is not a Fall/Winter piece. However it's cute. It's just going to have to wait until spring.
3.0,"beautiful, but the clasp broke same day"
3.0,The material of this dress is nothing like depicted in the photo. I bought this dress with the expectation that it was cotton yet its more like a knock-off almost silk material. I definitely wouldn't wear this as a dress but I'm planning on many up coming beach dates so it will work as bathing suit cover up. Still cute nonetheless just not actual dress material.
3.0,Beautiful little shoe for your flower girl but difficult to adjust because the embellishments get caught in the slide through buckle piece. Pain!
3.0,Color was so off..thin...not as nice as the picture showed
3.0,"I really like the look, but in trying to remove to cover to dry underneath, it cracked. Only got to wear it 1 day. The plus side it came with an extra cover, but I guess that means I'll have to wear it until I try to remove it."
3.0,"Very pretty well made dress! I sure wish it was t made for giraffes! I am 5'4 and 1/2 and 180, busty (42dd), all stomach, and thus dress goes well past my knees and because of the way it's made with the irregular hem I'm having a hard time finding a tailor who knows how to shorten it. So, although it is lovely, and the blue is striking, it is of no use to me. Sigh. Wish Amazon had more petite length dresses."
3.0,Kinda cheap looking. China knockoff but &#34;ok&#34;
3.0,"Sorry for the fuzzy pics, my mirror was very dirty! 90% nylon, 10% spandex. So it has a little bit of squeeze. However, the lace part on the bottom always rolls up, which causes an indentation on my thighs that is visible on the outside of my clothes. I usually prefer when the top half sits comfortably under my bra to limit any movement or bulging, but this one doesn't quite get up there. And if I pull it up there, it doesn't stay there. The bulging is annoying, & I did have to constantly adjust it while I was working. So, three stars just because it's not terrible but it's just not my favorite. Might work just right for a skinnier person, though."
3.0,"These look the most realistic, however they are very uncomfortable after about 2 hours. Deep indentations were left in my lobes and it felt like they were bruised the next day"
3.0,My four year old grandson is a little guy.  This set was too small for him.  Would be more suited for a 2 yr old or younger.
3.0,Great looking hat but appears black in photo.. is actually blue cute but not really what I wanted
3.0,Tha hat was a little small
3.0,Buy a size up they come small and tight
3.0,Quality is ok but longer term use is required for a proper review.
3.0,"Very hot slippers, sweaty feet."
3.0,"Some people might love this.  I didn't.  It seems quite well made and the price is good.  It has lots of compartments.  I wanted to love it.  BUT, its quite weighty even when empty, and the opening in the top is smaller than I would like."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, and yes, these are yoga pants, my first yoga pants, so they may stretch a bit once I start wearing them."
3.0,"I really like that this came in a pack of 6. Very convenient especially for me since I normally only have like 3 go-to bras. I like that there are different colors and also that the straps are wide (giving me a little more support). You can tell when clipping the bra that the quality isn't ALL the way there. Also some of the bras are pointy and not round which makes it looks weird through shirts if you're not wearing an under shirt. HOWEVER for the price and the amount you get it's pretty okay. They are comfortable. I have always used Victoria Secret bras & always had a hard time finding my right size this bra fits good for the most part I had some extra space at the top but once I tighten the straps it fits a bit better. I wouldn't buy again only because the quality ins't that best & i think quality over quantity is starting to win nowadays, but if you don't care for that or don't have the funds for something worth more i'd recommend.  hope this helps!"
3.0,"The roman numerals are not standard roman numerals. Ex: watch has IIII instead of IV.  Arrived with extra pieces IN the timepiece, i.e., metal loose under the glass.  Did not break off, just an extra piece."
3.0,This jacket is exactly the style I was looking for however I wish it was a bit smaller.  It wasn't noticeably big to others.  The material is light and feels a little cheap.
3.0,"So pretty, but so very heavy!  I couldn't wear them for very long."
3.0,Well is nice product works okay I hope last long and I don’t have to dealing with Waranty.
3.0,They had a big white spot in the left leg. Someone didn't add enough color to them.
3.0,They fit well and look nice but I assumed that they would be polarized and they are not.
3.0,Might want to prewash this one before you wear it. Good God was it itchy and rough.
3.0,"This shirt is just ok, it fit well and looks good, but it's feels like paper and is super see through"
3.0,"the sewing was not very good the one bra cup was at the bottom of the dress, it was way to long i had to alter it alot, i had to take apart the bottom of the silk and rehem it. the straps were a good two inches to long and the loops pulled out at the sightest bit of tension on the back of the dress had to sew them better so they would hold."
3.0,Not what expected. They look cheap
3.0,Love the product quality. Only problem is the bottoms are not stretchy on the waist and the leg wholes are very high waisted for a child so the tops fit but not the bottom. Unfortunately we are out of bottoms but keeping the tops.
3.0,"Love these boots but they run small.  I'm between a 10-11 so I ordered the 11.  Forget being a little tight, I couldn't even get my foot into the boot.  Which is too bad because they are exactly what I'm looking for and seem to be well made.  I would definitely order a size up - unfortunately 11 is as large as they go, so no luck for me."
3.0,"I cutie and  small,  just need a charm. 👍👍"
3.0,"I have had this several months and I love the look of it, but the metal is cheap and full of nickle so I have to put several coats of nail polish on it so I don't get a reaction. the screws holding it together are small and I didn't realize it needed to be tightened. and the plating is wearing off to show the copper underneath<br /><br />it still looks better than other stuff out there but I would love to have the metal to be at least nickle free so I don't get welts on my wrist. I would pay a few dollars more for that"
3.0,"They are a little small, I have a little larger than average neck so be careful!"
3.0,"We bought these for a Hogwarts themed party. They look very nice.<br />They were not very breathable, so we did not add the removable filters."
3.0,"Got the largest size possible and it's still way too small. Quality was nice, bought it as a gift."
3.0,Where much smaller than expected. Easy to bend to but insert.
3.0,It's a spandex type fabric<br />Sexy dress
3.0,I purchased it for a wedding.  I'm 4 11 150 lbs purchased medium . Its a good length with heels no need for hemming.  The top part is a bit full and needs to be tucked by a seamstress.<br /><br />Beautiful Dress Grape
3.0,"My wife bought this and damn, it’s sexy for sure. The material is cheap though but I guess for a low price internet purchase you get what you pay for."
3.0,Color is more pink than red.  Still cute and comfy. But not what I expected.
3.0,"This purchase will work but arrived with a missing clasp. I can fix it myself to close around my wrist. This is a one use purchase for Halloween, so I am giving it 3 stars."
3.0,It's definitely on the small side. I like that the fabric is described as is. It's nothing special but it works if you have the right size. I like the color a lot!!!
3.0,"Runs way too large and isn't constructed like the photo by a little bit (the waistline is higher than depicted) Having to return because I have around 4-5 inches of extra room in the waist in a size small... :( and I'm not even that small, I'm a size 4/6."
3.0,"Sizes run smaller. Pleats were not always sewn perfect, pressed very nice."
3.0,"This might be a good patch if you don't have an eyeball.<br /><br />Fortunately, I do though, and bought it to help with a lazy eye. It is not a good patch at all for that purpose."
3.0,"The bathing suit itself is really cute but could’ve been a size smaller ( I ordered a Small) and I had to tie up the top just to keep it from falling down( maybe if you’re a busty girl , you won’t have this problem) . It has no boob support at all. It’s literally just a band of material. Aldo , I ordered some time back in May , it didn’t deliver until mid-June."
3.0,"Very cute, style is everything, fit is nice but the shorts ride up A LOT.. perhaps an extra size would suffice? I got the L/XL and while they are really nice and comfortable it's a no on the riding up"
3.0,"Very nice looking luggage, but the top handle broke on the first trip we took and no response from company to fix it."
3.0,"Used for very low impact barre class. The straps are just a tiny bit short for a long-waisted (albeit small-bust-ed) shape such as mine. The ""elastic band"" as the bra band is no stronger than the rest of the fabric. I still wear a 20-yr-old same brand old-style sports bra which has not stretched out in all that time, and which provides tug-free support. I should have known better."
3.0,"The gold color in the product I received looked dull, as if it had been languishing in storage. String holds the blue beads together, I hope it does not fray with use. All in all, a pretty necklace. Will keep."
3.0,"I got this for my little sister and there was one thing that we both noticed, there's a blurred spot right over Rubys rose (which is her favorite character) the rest of the necklace is great but can't not see the smudge"
3.0,"light, good fit, lens can pop-out, but to be expected & they pop right back in.  Too much single-use packaging: one plastic ear-piece sleeve, one plastic glasses sleeve, one plastic glasses zip-lock-type bag, one fabric glasses bag (cinches, but no cinch-lock/retainer), polishing cloth, & it comes in a sturdy box with a polarization test image (which didn't work, although the polarization does) = glasses arrived in mint-condition, but way too much trash created."
3.0,I ordered the red and yellow.  Yellow fits perfectly and the red is too tight.  Both same size.
3.0,"Fit is all over the place. I bought one pair and liked them so much that I bought three more. One pair fits great, one pair fits large, one pair fits REALLY small and the last pair fits small and super short. Clearly quality control is not a priority, but you get what you pay for. Very comfortable fabric."
3.0,"I own lots of yoga pants/leggings from many different brands. In comparison to others, these are just okay. Very tight feeling, nylon-like fabric. I wouldn't describe it as soft, but it's not scratchy. I also don't think it keeps you very cool. I have better yoga pants from other brands that actually cost less. Meh, probably won't buy these again."
3.0,"Fragile, but they're cheap so it's not a big deal. Never had a lense pop out, but the frame bends sometimes."
3.0,"Could have been designed better for the two parts to attach somehow. Not convenient for mobile use. Didn't really work very well when trying to maintain the level on my smart phone during a power outage, even in full sunlight."
3.0,It didn't go past my hips unzipped :(
3.0,"Looks nice but, this Size  is too small. No options bangle size thats tha problem."
3.0,I ordered a large and always wear med or large but really needed XL in this. Very small. I’m 160 5’8” usually wear size 6-8
3.0,I have to return the skirt. It runs big and way too long.  Good material though
3.0,Is not bad for the price
3.0,"Very nice and well built Duffle bag, but it is smaller than expected at 15&#34; long and just under 10&#34; in diameter."
3.0,The only thing I don't like is there is a criss cross in the middle of the stomach area where they attached the sequins I am assuming. It is somewhat noticeable. I should have ordered medium as the bottom flare is a little too big.
3.0,While the earrings are great quality who wants only 1 initial?!  Very disappointed & too expensive for missing parts.
3.0,I got my correct size.  The pants did not fit well overall.<br />I am STILL waiting for a refund left at the Amazon Locker.
3.0,This dress was not flattering at all.<br />Nice peice for the price but it gave me a tail and stuck to places I would have rather concealed.
3.0,"The waist size (34&#34;) was fine but the rise is very short. If you likeb rief briefs, this will work for you. Otherwise, there are mesh briefs available from other sources, but at MUCH higher prices."
3.0,"I assumed ""STAFF"" would be printed on both sides of this shirt, but it only appears on the front.  It is not as useful to only have it on one side.  I need my shirt to say staff on both sides."
3.0,"They're okay sunglasses for the price. The picture is very accurate, color and all. The hinges make me a bit nervous, so I don't fold them in unless I have to. If you like the look and like the price, buy them, but don't expect fabulous quality."
3.0,"This casual hoodie was appealing in how it looked online, but the fit is just not quite right.  My daughter usually wears a large, and we got a large in this purple hoodie.  At first when she took it out of the package she thought she'd like it.  The material is nice, soft, not too bulky.  But it wasn't comfortable.  The neckline felt a little off.  My daughter said it just didn't feel comfortable.  Maybe one size bigger would have worked better?  Although the rest of it fit fine.  But she feels it isn't comfortable enough to wear she pictures wearing it very often."
3.0,Not as wind resistant as I had hoped.
3.0,"I wanted to love this because the watermelon color is a beautiful bright pink. It matches a pair of swim trunks I have perfectly. But alas, even in the size medium there was no where for my 32DD chest to go but out the middle. Because of this it didn't take much to slip a tad and poof we have a wardrobe malfunction ""nip"" situation (before anyone tells me DD that is to be expected, please realize this is the equivalent breast size of a 34D, 36C, etc those are not so uncommon). I don't even think sizing up to a large would have been enough...<br /><br />Often in these situations I just remove the padding, but this is a molded cup so you cannot. I dinged a star for limited sizing, typically a medium has enough room in the cups I just tie it tighter in the ribs to compensate for being otherwise petite. But this just didn't afford that because of the minimal coverage. I'd say size up if you are larger chested, and hope that is enough.<br /><br />I dinged another star because the neck ties are brutal. They really cut in and are scratchy unlike the tie around your ribs, which is nice and thick. This may not be an issue if your chest is ""lighter"" but even then, they are not very soft.<br /><br />At the time of this review they had not set a price yet, so I can't speak to value for the money. It's decently made, just not for the larger bust or those sensitive to scratchy neck straps."
3.0,Appears much smaller in person.
3.0,Decent for the price but like all Halloween makeup you really get what you pay for.
3.0,I bought two of these but the material is different.  I dont like this one as much but love the neckline.
3.0,"I am giving this product 3 stars as I did like the color/style and the price of this swimsuit. However; there is no option to purchase 2 different sizes so you have to be perfectly portionate to for the bikini to fit. For reference I am 5’10 140lbs and I purchased a medium.<br /><br />The top fit perfect but the bottom was too small. I emailed the company to see if I could exchange the bottom for a different size. While the company did offer to exchange the bottom, they advised it would ship from China and take up to 25 days for shipping."
3.0,"The coat looks fine although the stitching was poorly done as it was knotted up on itself in several places.  The coat runs extremely small as everyone says, a medium size fits snug on my 12 year old daughter who is 5' tall and only weighs 68lbs with no curves.  The size chart is even a little off so order a at least a couple sizes larger than normal."
3.0,Picture of dress looks fancier in person just looks very casual ti-dyed.
3.0,"Really beautiful, however, I did not expect the pin to be so big."
3.0,"If using this for a cover up over your suit I suggest you go up at least 2 sizes. I ordered one going up 1 size and it was super tight just over my skin much less my suit. The dress itself was adorable and nice quality. Just to small. I ordered a 14 so really needed a 16 or 18 which they did not have. These people are small in stature, we are not so wish they could make the clothing to size better for Americans!"
3.0,"I have a very thin beard but a big head, thought the XL would do the job but it is still too small, need to get bigger next time"
3.0,Based on the photos some customers got the straight hem and some got the curved hem. Somehow I got one with the curved hem in M and it's cute but idk how anyone taller than me (I'm short at 5'1&#34;) would be able to wear this as a dress. Fit is a little small. I paid $8 though so it's fine for that price.
3.0,returned because the shoe was kind of cheap.
3.0,"A little small in size for most men. Size 10 max., without socks. Otherwise does the job."
3.0,"I bought a pair of black baleaf joggers a few months ago and practically live in them now (Covid shelter-in-place), so I decided to get these in blue space dye. They are just ok. My other black joggers are cotton and super soft. My new pair is soft on the interior but the exterior is made from rougher synthetic material. (I also dried them in the dryer—Covid fears—and they shrunk quite a bit.)"
3.0,"Great color, but the outline for the breasts are too small my wife says. Also, the desrciption says this is &#34;padded&#34;, there is no padding whatsoever."
3.0,Very flimsy and cheap! I guess you get what you pay for though. The kids didn't mind. They loved them
3.0,The zipper is on the left but thats not that important. The arms are to thin to go around my arms. I'm not even jacked. Jacket is warm and feels comfortable qhen I can finally wedge my arms down the sleeves.
3.0,Generally satisfied with the fit and UV protection but the anti-fog coating never really worked for me despite following the instructions in product insert.  I had to resort to using the old standby-my saliva to minimize the fog.
3.0,I buy jewelry for my young daughters off here and they are just as pretty in hand as in pics. Cheaper quality but still great for the price & you can always throw a layer of clear polish on them to keep them longer... Good buy
3.0,The pockets on rear were way low. It looked kinda funny!!
3.0,Hard to get on and off.
3.0,"It's pretty cute -- the color is nice, the fabric drapes well. But some of the seems are poorly sewn, giving it a cheap look. But to be fair, it is cheap, so... I guess you get what you pay for?"
3.0,It's a nice dress just not for me didn't really like how it fit
3.0,Runs a bit some
3.0,They look good but are kind of flimsy.
3.0,I picked the wrong color gray! Can;t see Viet Nam Veteran To light . not like photo
3.0,"They fit, but even after washing the smell was so strong, I had to hang them in the garage for 3 weeks."
3.0,Stylish female watch. After about 1 month it stopped working. I haven't got new batteries for it to see if that's the problem but shouldn't it have last longer? Now it sits pretty on my vanity collecting dust.
3.0,Don't care for the large letters across my forehead. Distracting to carry on a conversation with someone...
3.0,its cute but made with cheap material didn’t last 2 weeks
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ff6fb0275afc89422663eb2a48d6a909]] EDITED: I did not realize I cannot review blouses separately so this changes the star rating and some wording belows rating is for the dusty purple leopard print  blouse please scroll down to see the other reviews tnx<br /><br />Purple leopard S- I absolutely love this blouse, HOWEVER, it is not true to size even wit the 1"" off. My main complaint is the button holes themselves they are all different sizes and when putting the buttons through fabric starts to come apart. I'm not sure if this is because the buttons are too big or if the suits aren't sealed off properly(some companies treat them so they don't fray open). Also the thread from one of the buttons also started to come off just from trying on. Like I said in video I am small breasted 34A so the measurements for small shirt should been more than enough and when I tried the shirt on, the button over the breast area was popping open. Other than this for a small the shirt was quite big for example the sleeves were longer and the shoulders were also bigger except for the breast area it actually fit more like a medium! Now let's talk about how beautiful and classy this shirt is. You can wear this w/a skirt or pants aside from the way they made it look like in pik. You can make yourself look like you belong on on the cover of fortune 500...the material is nice lightweight and soft. It's not meant for FL summers or even late springs but it really is lovely. It would get a 5 star if there wasn't the button and buttonhole issue!<br /><br />White blouse M(with black leopard print but sold as white)-this blouse fits like a small petite! The length is very short the arm are very short and the shoulders do not fit properly! I did measure properly so...one thing I f I stayed perfectly still this looks great!! Anyways I went ahead and ordered a large! The material is light and nice. The material is not as nice as the purple blouse and this blouse is def more casual than classy but still feminine in every way! I give this blouse a 3 star<br /><br />Leopard-02 size M<br />So I'm on the fence on this blouse first off it looks nothing like photo! I was expecting to see more light hues and what I recieved are way more dark hues. The breast area fits fine the sleeves fit right at the wrist (I'd like for the to be just a 1/2 and insh longer) and the length is also okay...if you did measurements it fits the bill however it still fits a little bit on the smaller side I don't know how to explain it but because I feel like a large might be too big I'll stick with this size! I am really disappointed in the color really disappointed and for this I'm giving this shirt a 2.5 star...while I like it...this is one I may just return. Oh and the holes for the buttons also are coming apart the material on this one is thicker not as soft. And I'm noticing my camera is making it look lighter but w/out camera the shirt really is a much darker hue.<br /><br />So I hope this helped and is accepted"
3.0,Dress was a bit tight.  I did not like the neck and sleeves.  Not for me.
3.0,Weave is to tight so it's not good for really hot days better for fall and winter in SC otherwise the quality is very good and fit is excellent.
3.0,"Cute and fits as expected - lined from top to knees, but both layers are made of a cheap poly blend"
3.0,I was so excited to get these!<br />They look great but two snapped as soon as my daughter tried to put them on her wrist. Wish there was a way to get them replaced. Otherwise great product
3.0,"No room up front, square fit feeling"
3.0,"Good quality for the price, but after several uses (opening and closing the cover) the clasp broke and the glass cover will not stay closed."
3.0,Returned for a full refund. Beautiful blouse as long as you are a size 8 or smaller.
3.0,"The jacket looked ok, was a little thinner material than I expected and quality wasn't great. Also the fit was a little small."
3.0,I expected an expandable brim. It fits tight but not uncomfortable
3.0,"Nice feel, but a little small."
3.0,"I liked the tunic very much, the fabric is nice and it looks like the picture but I usually wear S and this is too tight for me. I had to return"
3.0,I wear 34B at Victoria's Secret but this was a bit big and hard to hitch. I wouldn't get again although I do love the style and it was well made apart from the sizing issue.
3.0,"These were bigger than I thought, I was expecting to receive small circular glasses for a hippy costume."
3.0,I am not sure they should be ok for size 14 to 24...they are small for plus size
3.0,So cute and fit my 6 1/2 M foot but I needed more heal support and had to return
3.0,"The design is beautiful but the quality not so much. I washed it before wearing it and the logo came off. It washed with cold water and air dry. I tried calling customer service but I did t get anyone, therefore I’m writing this review. I’m buying another shirt without a chest logo to give it a second try."
3.0,"These really do look like real jeans, they are very cute. The issue with these is that because they do not have a zipper or button and the waist is not AT ALL stretchy, they are somewhat difficult to pull over your hips. Also, I ordered the size I usually wear in jeans & the legs fit very well but the waist was a little snug. My advice would be to order a size up & just use the drawstring to adjust the waist size. This is my only pair so I can't speak for the other designs but as far as looks they look good but they don't really feel like pajamas, especially at the waist. Put just a little elastic in there & they'd be perfect."
3.0,"These are your typical cheaper sport bras. The fabric is not the smooth, almost neoprene feeling fabric of more expensive sport bras. I wear them around the house, but they really dont proved much support for my 34B's. I jiggle just going up and down the stairs."
3.0,They are big. Not really newborn
3.0,Ordered a 2 xl as i wear a 1 xl normally. Tighter than i expected
3.0,Really comfy for plantar fasciitis and for metatarsal support. Unfortunately these are sized smaller than most shoes. No half sizes. Had to return for next larger  size. Hope they fit.
3.0,They're not a solid or bright color like the pictures. Mine have a lot of purple mixed in and are kind of dull
3.0,"This slick stretchy material leaves me looking like the bride of Frankenstein in the morning.  WAY too much static electricity.  Cute, comfortable, but would not buy again."
3.0,Some were to small for my personal likings they hurted when i put them in and gave me rashes/ caused my skin to break out
3.0,"Very cute, but pretty flimsy.  Her dollar store sunglasses seem better made, although these fit better.  Seeing as how it’s for children, I can’t imagine these would hold up.  The arms of the glasses got bent inward already after wearing them a short while, although knowing my kid, I’m not totally surprised as she can be fairly rough on things.  She has received a lot of compliments on them, however."
3.0,"Love the material, especially for a newborn. Got a pair of these at my baby shower and had to order more. When I received I was super disappointed with how small they are. I have 3-6 month footies that snap vs. zip. Ordered 2 pair ni footies that zipped and much prefer the snap vs zip. Fit looser and the 3-6 in the snap seem to be bigger."
3.0,It's ok but took a lot longer with more elbow grease than anticipated. Used on my Alex and Ani bangles. I have eight and it took an hour and a half. Could be they were just really dirty.
3.0,Muy pequeño y un poco dura
3.0,"This bathing suit is cute, actually cuter than I expected.  Fits well (I bought a Large, 5'8"", 165 Lbs). My only issue is the front is fully lined, yet the back is not... how does that make any sense?  Unfortunately, I am going to send it back, as I have a fear that once wet since it is white you will really see my ASSets- you can already see my underwear through it when it is dry.  Why do they line the ENTIRE front, but not the back?  Maybe I got a defective one?"
3.0,"I bought it for a Christmas gift for my son, I like the brilliant colors but the fabric is too thin I don't think it was made to protect you from the weather, I guess it's just a decorative garment"
3.0,Love the shirt but it was huge.
3.0,"I liked the price, and I loved the colors.. but the seams cut a line in the skin across my toes.  I can't wear them.  I will have to give them away."
3.0,"The belt was ok for the money just too wide, could not see it from the picture"
3.0,A little to stiff
3.0,This reminds me of a cameo necklace my mother used to have. The “metal” is cheap and I’ll be using another chain.
3.0,Can tell cheaply wires tend to bend inward and poke the heck out of my side boob Area ouch!!!! Maybe will try for real brand next time this is definitely a knock off
3.0,Beautiful pants but the material started pillin after one wash. Pants lost its quality look after it was washed.
3.0,Way too big for my grandson is could not get the string tight. Guess I got the wrong size
3.0,It works but is just difficult.
3.0,This hat is called a baby hat but was very large and looked like it would fit an adult. nice hat though
3.0,"Not made for buxom women had to wear tank or other shirt under for the front but overall, the material flows nice for what we wanted, make sure not to snag on torn finger nail or any other sharpe objects. Will catch and snag with slight run and makes those little pills. Also clings to the body and shows all your rolls. Wear a body cincher to make it look smooth. If you are skinny, this is a nice flowing dress."
3.0,It works great but it only comes with a quarter of the bottle filled
3.0,Tech used them once for a really mad cat and wouldn't use them again. She prefers the elk hide. They looked like they would work well for other critters.
3.0,"I bought two of these.  They do a good job of covering the bike, but both ripped small holes in them after just a few weeks.  I would have bought something cheaper if I knew they weren't very durable."
3.0,These were bought as an alternative to more expensive black diamonds  They looks nice but the post is very flimsy.
3.0,"Pretty dress and the bottom part of the skirt fit nicely.  The top has no spandex therefore, I could not zip it up in the back."
3.0,These are beautiful but I'm giving them 3 stars because I only had them a couple of months and one of the opals fell out.
3.0,Pretty but color does not hold. Can't expect it to for the price. I'd stick with the silver if considering to purchase.
3.0,It is a little bulky and doesn't stay as well on the head.
3.0,Runs very small. I normally wear a 10 or 12. Not going to bother to return it but I'll keep sizing in mind off I order again.
3.0,"These have an excellent fragrance but are not as nice as the other ones I saw online. They don’t keep the tops of your feet warm. If the return process was not so complicated, I would have returned them."
3.0,Top was smaller than expected and overall this wasn't the material I was expecting at all. It's not cotton
3.0,"If this stays in place, I really like it.  Maybe adding some removable Velcro would help?  I think it would be easier to add this to the bra before actually putting the bra on.  Better yet, why don't bra makers just sew this into the bras themselves!  The front stays in place okay, but the underarm areas come out, and they could even be shortened a bit, as it is hard to tuck them in so far back.  I particularly like the piece between the cleavage, as well."
3.0,Although it was pretty the gold started to fade about 4 days after I used it. I stopped wearing it because it stained my neck.
3.0,The length is fine but the fitment around my head is a bit tight. I wish it was looser instead of feeling like it was squeezing my head
3.0,"Good quality glass, unique piece, would have given it five stars if it were half as big! This pendant is very large, thick, and heavy; I don't own any jewelry even close to this size and I hope that the person I bought it for is more into chunky jewelry than I am. Also, I'm glad I went back to this page to see how to put it on the cord...if you just string it on, it doesn't lay flat, you have to do it like it's pictured here. I would have preferred if it came with a ring on it, I think."
3.0,Package could have been a little more secure But love them for the price!
3.0,Disappointed in this necklace. Not as pictured. No pearl string and no gold chain. The charms seem to be as pictured. Using it for a Halloween costume so it will work.
3.0,Like the style but the material is so think and feels like a nylon apron from the dollar store.
3.0,"Sooo..  i really wanted to love this dress.  I ordered an XL hoping for a fit like the model..  and this does fit, but not loosely.  It isn’t form fitting but this just doesn’t button around my busy.  I’m a size 14, 38 in waist, 38ddd chest.  I got the white one and you can see right through it!  You definitely have to wear something under it.  The material is like super stiff linen. It isn’t scratch, but has zero movement.  Stuff as a board and is definitely going to wrinkle easily.  Does seem well made though, if that matter."
3.0,I ordered my size 8 1/2 and they are Large. Very floppy. The shoe is good quality. Looks just as pictured. Feels comfortable. I really wanted to love this shoe but they are just too big. I should have got a half size down. The shipping was fast and the updates were always precise. Came way before expected date. I can fit 2 fingers comfortably in the back
3.0,little to big for a woman but the first one the digital clock was not working but the replacement was good Thanks
3.0,Okay for a stocking stuffer.
3.0,Pretty - but - clasp is very flimsy and broke before I could even wear it out the door....
3.0,"Although I like the feel of this product, within a week of using them they pilled up with the little fuzzies. Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. They look awful."
3.0,good work shirt
3.0,"Distance vision is somehow a little bit blurry. Nevertheless, the look is very good and I like it; the lens height probably needs to be slightly higher to accommodate more space for distance viewing."
3.0,It's a lightweight chain & the charm is exactly like the picture.  However I could not get it to stay separated like the picture shows
3.0,Not sure yet. It looks like an enormous over-sized turtleneck. It looks cute on the model with its asymmetrical cut. I am hoping for a chilly day to try it out. I think it will be a good layering piece.
3.0,Smaller than i though
3.0,The three stars is for shipping which makes the hat useless. it was sent folded in a plastic bag and it look really bad when you put the hat on. Everything else looks just fine. Its sad bc I trusted to order this set and now  I didn’t have time to get a different hat or set and its going back
3.0,"This is obviously meant to be worn in cold weather. The crop top doesn’t make any sense when you’re trying to stay warm. Unfortunately, I bought it in September for a Christmas gift. Now, it’s too late to return it."
3.0,How are the pants way too big and the jacket too small?
3.0,Button came off of pants soon as he put them on...do better
3.0,Nice umbrella - didn't grip into the sand as I expected..
3.0,Glasses are great but they arrived in a strawstring bag inside a cardboard box.  No case was included as the item description claims.
3.0,"Waaaayyyyy too small. Laughable. Went by the size chart, ordered a size up based on other reviewers, still too small. Returned. Material was decent though and I love the style. If it had fit I'm sure I would wear a lot"
3.0,when I give to her she said it is ok
3.0,I really like these lights. I wear them out running in the mornings a couple of times a week. The battery life is looking than what I was expecting- over a month. Unfortunately I just went to change them for the first time and one of the won't recharge.
3.0,Not as thin as I expected or wanted it to be. It's very good quality though
3.0,"overall the glasses are good - and one of the VERY few that fit my wide head/face well.  My issue with them is that the lens pop out of the frame way too easy, and once they do then they constantly are popping out.  for the cost they are not bad glasses - but the lense issue is very frustrating."
3.0,It’s a beautiful piece of jewelry-I just wanted it to be a little more red in color
3.0,"Love the pattern and comfort , I'm 5'2 and weight about 153lbs. The large fit perfect but the fabric seems so cheap . It's as though my body stretching it out made it expand and look almost sheer /white . My husband's first words were that it was &#34;see through .&#34; I added a before and after pic to show what it looks like with no stretching and what it looks like when u stretch it out (which is what wearing it does ). I'd really love it if the fabric didn't do this ."
3.0,Still stiff
3.0,"The jackets, I ordered 2 in 2 different colors, and even though I ordered a small, they run a little too big and are more like a medium.  I am a Petite size."
3.0,Their shirt looks cute from the front but the back has a mesh insert that does not lay flat on your back at all times. It often time bunch up and looks really weird. I would not recommend this.
3.0,"Runs small, very thin material for a sweater"
3.0,"No Clasp , Feather is not good, Blue stone poorly set, chain is small. Worst !!!!<br />Dont even waste even a dollor and wait for long to get it.<br /><br />Even on top of all the above comments, they responded in 1 day , asked me to send a pic. I did and they refunded back my money.<br />I really loved the chain and asked to ship another one instead of refund, but they said please re order and we would like to refund.<br /><br />Thankyou and appreciate."
3.0,"They were a lot smaller then in the picture,they don't look like the picture either,but it will work,I guess.thanks though"
3.0,"These earrings were much larger than I expected. Towards the end of the day of wearing them ,one came off of the earring hook. I was able to fix it on my way to the dinner with friends. So buyer beware"
3.0,"This was a gift for my grandson. He picked it out after looking at the watches on the Amazon website. The photo of this watch clearly shows a blonde wristband. It arrived with a dark brown wristband – something that totally does NOT match the blonde wood of the watch itself. He says it's OK but I think it is very ugly – and of course, either deceptive or an accidental misrepresentation. He won't send it back (he lives in another state) but you can bet your cowboy boots that I would return it! As far as a &#34;watch&#34; goes, well, it's a watch. It tells time. The face is exactly like the photo, so at least that part is correct."
3.0,Comfortable but stains easily.<br />i ordered a Small
3.0,"This was a nice, thick material. I was surprised, and delighted. The sleeves are a bit big for my petite frame, but they would probably fit perfectly on an average person."
3.0,Broken when I opened it from the package . One of the straps was broken . Quick fix Though I just tied it and it worked out . Definitely worth the money but still kinda crappy quality
3.0,The size chart for this product is not US.  Did not fit at all had to give away.
3.0,"This is a very thin and light weight pullover. Runs small. And the neckline is cut quite large. You definitely need a tank or bralet under. I order an XL one size larger than I normally wear. It's still small- hits me at the belly button. There are no pockets! As the picture shows? But the light blue and white lettering is cute. Not worth sending back, I will probably just us it as around my home sleepwear it's soft."
3.0,Snug in the middle
3.0,The patterns look cheap because they are oversized.
3.0,Awesome but chain tarnish
3.0,It broke within 3 hours of it being on my ankle. And I'm not sure of it really being silver
3.0,"Trainer mat is stiff, maybe within a few weeks, the creases may become flat."
3.0,"This shirt is pretty, but too small around the chest.  I ordered my typical size (xxl) but it fits to tight.  Plus sized women be wary."
3.0,Te aconsejo subir 2 tallas más . O no le durarán más k la mitad del verano
3.0,Nice but not sized for children as advertised in the listing. They were to big for my son and myself.
3.0,I'm 5'2' so the dress is kinda long for me.
3.0,"They fit great and I like the padding, unfortunately, they ride up.  A rubber grip at the bottom of each leg would be helpful."
3.0,It really doesn't sound like a train whistle when blown.  It's more of a screech sound.  But it shipped quickly and didn't have any issues with that.
3.0,Kind of cheaply made.  I was disappointed
3.0,Bought the grey one first. The extended brim is nice. Ordered another one in the faded black. That one came in with a short brim. It’s still a nice hat - but not what I wanted or ordered. Not worth the hassle of returning.
3.0,Bright colors but runs very small
3.0,I bought this for my granddaughter who is 7.<br />Cute purse but the shoulder strap is DUMB. There are two small holes at the top ( not reinforced). You have to feed the strap through and tie a knot in the strap.
3.0,"Didnt glow very well, but it was an OK item."
3.0,"There is no way this material is waterproof.<br />UPDATE: I have worn this jacket a few times and keep getting compliments so I added a star for that.<br />CONS: I have seen small water drops bead up on the sleeve but I still don't think it can handle being saturated. The zipper is on the wrong side for men. All of the button holes have been sewn to the point that they are less than half the size of the button that is supposed to go in the hole, rendering the buttons useless. The pockets are all for tiny little hands. This and the zipper make me think this is a women's jacket being sold as a mans. Again, the hole for the ear phone cord is sewn half shut??? I don't care for the hood, would be better if it had a tighter weather neck. I wear a booney hat if I need head protection from rain.<br />PROS: I love the magnetic hip slot, what this jacket needs now is zip-able openings under the arm pits. RIPSTOP like pattern to the weave. Thin material yet the jacket gets pretty warm when worn. Chilly at first but heats up quick."
3.0,They are too small for being marked as a large.
3.0,"Ordered bigger size. Didn’t fit well, especially in the bust. Had to return."
3.0,Top is to tight. She is not comfortable in it. The pants fit fine  she like them and wishes the top had been a little larger
3.0,This blanket is not very heavy.
3.0,"Its cute, but with having 36DD breasts it does not contain them. This is definitely meant for younger, firmer breasts."
3.0,"Unfortunately one shoe doesn't work well,  it doesn't light sometimes,  otherwise it fits great (since I did their size charts exactly as they put it)  and looks good."
3.0,"I like this dress, but it fits me way to big at the top.  I will have to make some adjustments.  other than that, I like the design and look when 'snatched'.  The sash/belt looks and feels a bit cheap, so will change out with a belt to my liking."
3.0,Great suit. Cute. Fits as expected. The  inside lining is white and it shows all over. The stitching is a little too close on the edges so the lining rolls out and shows. I am returning it. If the lining were orange I'd have kept it. Might just be an irregular and may not be a consistent flaw in every suit.
3.0,Baggy and not as form fitting as I desired or thought. Maybe I should've gotten a smaller size? Might try again with another color... Yet the material started to become fuzzy and not as sheer and nice in places where I was against a table.
3.0,Returned due to sizes run small.  Nice quality material and design.  Loved the shirt just runs way small.
3.0,I received this after only a few days of ordering it! The only reason why I’m giving this 3 stars is because it looks like heavy metal but when you touch it it feels a bit cheap. That’s my only complaint but I can deal with it.
3.0,I loved them but they are not true to size. Order a size up. I returned them.
3.0,The material was too thin for use in many situations.  Pretty but limited use.  I used with leggings
3.0,This outfit is cute but it’s not how it is in the picture the shirt doesn’t come up in the front part where the belly is like that in the picture it’s just straight. I’m also not a big fan of the material so I cant give this a good review. Will upload a picture later
3.0,"I like the softness and warmth of the robe. I dislike the huge size of it. I'm a medium, the robe seems to be XXL."
3.0,"These are not bad for the price, but there are a few downsides.  The white fabric is a bit pink in color and is somewhat transparent.  The leggings are also very long and puddle around the ankles."
3.0,Too sheer for me-laundered so couldn't return. Donated with other clothing to charity.
3.0,"I normally don't buy dresses with slits in the back because I have a big butt and thighs, so my dresses tend to ride up, and when there is a slit I'm more easily to flash people (Haha). I went against my better judgement and bought this dress. I got a large. 32 in waist and 41 in hips, about 160 lbs 5'6. It rides up too much and its unflattering around my hips. I normally like my dresses tight, but this looks too weird. I can't get an extra large because I don't have the boobs to fill it out. I would be swimming in the top part. So, I am disappointed and probably will never wear this dress again. Sad face."
3.0,"Ordered Large but Medium sent instead.  The style, material and colour are good though."
3.0,the cheap plastic rather pay more for better quality but for the price its good
3.0,"They were fine. I used resin in them and they worked just fine. Still, there are much better deals out there that include more pendants for the price, and some even include the necklace part. Overall not a bad product, but there are better deals."
3.0,"I like the fit, quite comfortable"
3.0,The mid sem should of not been or been lowed the material is nice and flows colors beautiful  bright the fit is perfect  just the mid sem.
3.0,"Doesn't fit what I thought it would, so that's disappointing. Maybe if I find something that will fit, I may like it, otherwise it's just kinda sitting around."
3.0,I had to let the hem out of the sleeves; being 5'7'' tall
3.0,You get what you pay for. This dress is see through. Would not recommend.
3.0,The flowers came off the shirt the first time they were washed (glued on). I just stitched them back on since I only paid $6 for outfit and otherwise it was great!
3.0,"Cute dress but is very long, and the fabric is thin."
3.0,It took me 3 or 4 times to wrap it correctly so my boob wouldn't be exposed but when I finally got it wrapped it looked oversize on me. I ordered a small and received a small that fits like a medium on me. The outer fabric is light and the inner fabric is heavy which you need or it will be transparent. It gave me a weird shape and makes me look old.  I give it to my 63 year old aunt and she loves it. Lucky it was only $10
3.0,"Worked for what I needed it for, but the material was super thin and cheap feeling. I did like all the accessories that came with it. I got a small which fit a bit snug in the bottom area. But the top was pretty loose. I’m also more bottom heavy though. 135 lbs. and 5’7. The length was great."
3.0,"I ordered a 4x, usually a little big on me, I like loose fitting shirts. The color is beautiful, better than the photo. It is well made.. I love it, but I can't wear it. It is too small in the arms and across the back. This is not a USA plus size 4X."
3.0,"I am currently in the hospital on bed rest for my pregnancy, and I was getting so sick of the ill-fitting hospital socks. I asked my mom to look at Target but they only had one pair, so I went to Amazon... Found these and ordered them immediately. I love them! They fit very well and I like that they're tighter around the arch, which helps them stay put. They're thick without being too warm, and they came in a nice little plastic bag that I can use again. My only complaint is that one of the socks had a tiny hole on the top of my foot when I put it on for the first time. Not worth complaining much though!<br /><br />Also, I am a size 9 and these could totally fit up to a size 11 (women's).<br /><br />Edited: Unfortunately, the quality of these socks doesn't seem to be as great as I thought. After washing them one time, one more pair developed two holes, on the toe of one of the socks. The rubber on the bottom cracked, which isn't surprising since the socks are so stretchy, but on the heels of a couple of them, little pieces have fallen off. I wish they were better quality, because I was about to order another set of them. :-/"
3.0,"Fabric is soft & beautiful.  I'd read reviews about the armholes being snug, but didn't realize they'd be quite this snug; unwearable as is, but I'm good with alterations, so I can make it work.  Ordered a size larger, as recommended, but still slightly smaller than I'd expected.  I'll also have to add a hook to the neckline, as it doesn't hold well on its own.<br />There were comments about the slip/under dress being short, which I found to be untrue; I believe the length is perfect, but I'm short anyway."
3.0,The bands are extremely comfortable. The only issue is that the pattern on the bands is different than what is shown. The bands I received have a vertical pattern instead of the horizontal pattern shown.
3.0,These were very uncomfortable. Not enough support. I returned them.
3.0,"I have bought several pairs of Timberland wedges/sandals over the past 8-10 years, and I have to say this pair was the poorest performing purchase to date. They are super comfortable and I was able to wear them all day the first day. BUT the shoe bed is a cloth/canvas? material and did NOT hold up at all. They rubbed and caused a friction callus after a week of off/on wearing. The foot-bed also became discolored/dirty very quickly - and I purchased the black. I do work in an office and don't walk around much except maybe out to lunch a block away occasionally. So I was surprised how fast the foot-bed deteriorated after 2 months of wear. I didn't go to a rodeo or anything crazy for them to be so dirty so quick. I did wear them during summer months?  But again, not like I walked all over Atlanta during the day. Oh well."
3.0,"Not expected quality and color. Fit exactly, but it’s looks on pic much better"
3.0,"The top of this romper is pretty but for someone 5'3 the bottoms are horrible. They are wide and baggy and too long. 34C, 124 lbs, I believe I ordered the small and I am not impressed. I do really like the top and the pattern is pretty but the style at the bottom is blah. Also I do not like that the sash is not attached because it looks hideous without the sash. Will most likely be returning."
3.0,they are not as fitted as I would like.  also a little thin but we can work with them and they fit all the different performers hand sizes.  Also easy to clean
3.0,Got this for my 2 year old baby cousin. he was coming out of size 5 into 6. so decided to get him the 6.5 it fit him just perfect but wont last him too long. i guess he has a little bit of broad feet to. so it completely fill out the shoe. but for the length fit him exact.
3.0,It said it was a sweater disappointing
3.0,"Good, but the sock is thinner than expected."
3.0,Cute shirt. Size runs big
3.0,Love it but it broke after 2 months. I now wear it as a necklace piece.
3.0,Color was not red. More of a burnt orange. Cut a lot larger than sized.
3.0,Too long fits like a dress.
3.0,"I received 5 pairs of the style A9 socks. These are cozy socks without being too heavy and bulky, and I like wearing them for the cool mornings and evenings we’ve been having in So Cal. They feel soft enough (though I have softer socks), the color assortment is good and the socks look reasonably well made with few stray threads. The patterns are basic and kind of masculine and could easily be worn by men. These are a crew sock height on me.<br /><br />The A9 socks run really big. The stated range is a women’s shoe size 5-9.  I wear a women’s 10 in open toe shoes and 10.5 or 42 Euro in closed toe shoes, yet these border on being too roomy for me. And while they fit okay at first, these stretch out a lot and also slide down. These seem better sized for women in the 9-12 shoe size range (or for men). These are fairly good socks, but they run big and  stretch out bigger. And the directions say to hand wash when these are just basic socks. All things considered, these are just okay. 3 stars."
3.0,"It was just as described, and looked to be very satisfying.  I was able to fit a number of cards into the various slots and an ID card into the windowed section. However, as soon as I pulled the zipper, the zipper pull pulled off. The zipper itself has a  hook, which cannot be closed further,  for the pull to be attached to the zipper. So it's going back, because a zipper without a zipper pull doesn't work for me."
3.0,"This bag is cute, but it is extremely flimsy and not very big. I was wanting to use this as my work bag for my laptop/notebook, but I ended up having to give it away to a friend. I wouldn't consider this to be a ""large"" bag, but more of a medium sized tote."
3.0,Nice when it arrived. I've been gentle but the elastic is cheap and falling apart.
3.0,Very cute but pricey
3.0,"These look pretty from a distance, but the glue is blobbed out around the fasteners, and the metal used seems cheap - probably something that has metallic paint on it.  I will wear them as long as I can, but they have a junk jewelry feel and won't last long."
3.0,Fit a little snug but overall good shorts!
3.0,"I bought this for my tiny 11 year old daughter, and it barely fits her.  The sizing is off significantly.  She complains that it is all one piece also.  The gloves and boot portion are all attached limiting your movement.  We are going to keep it for Halloween but I thought I should warn adult women who try to buy this."
3.0,I like the comfort of this dress and the ease of washing and wearing this often.  What I did not like was that I expected a deeper yellow/mustard color like in the picture and got more of a bright yellow dress.  I also have to be careful about wearing a flesh tone bra because it shows through.
3.0,I bought it  for my wife she's big into wolfs and Celtic things but get rid of the string and put it on a chain if you are like my wife and wear it none stop the black paint will wear of and I wish it was made of better metal other then pewter this is second one I bought for her the first lasted about year and a half
3.0,"I'm sure these will work great if you want them for working out and sweating in the gym, but nothing else. I am purchasing for everyday wear and the quality falls a bit short"
3.0,Good product does what is designed to do.
3.0,Quality is not the best
3.0,"A stone fell out in the first week. I really loved that ring too, it was so pretty"
3.0,"I originally purchased a large in this and it was very small.  Re-ordered the XL and it was not that much bigger.  The look is exactly what I was looking for, but its what you should expect from an imported jacket from Asia.  It will get some use and I just will be afraid to wash it as it will definitely shrink and could lose form.  Happy with purchase for the price, but will be cautious on over-wearing the jacket."
3.0,My child loved the soft fuzzy fabric and bright colors. She normally wears a 6-7 but these 6x pajama pants were about 4 inches too long.
3.0,Cute dress but it does not look or fall like the pictured dress.
3.0,Kind of think. Returned it.
3.0,These are cute but they were tight at the waist.
3.0,"Returned due to the top being too large around the chest area. No support for breasts at all, but very cute top, just not right for me."
3.0,"But the bottoms were smaller, and I wanted so bad for it to look right because it is soooo cute, looks even better than the photos, but the bottoms looked weird and fit weird."
3.0,My daughter really likes this dress! The crinoline layer did shrink after washing so it does look a little awkward now but she still asks to wear it. It’s a cute little dress.
3.0,"This is well made and high quality but the type of fabric traps sand in it, and it does not come out."
3.0,"I thought the sandals were very comfort, just too small.  I’ve returned them & plan on ordering a size larger."
3.0,The fabric is cheap and not quality. The bodice gaps all the way to the waist if you're busty and will require tape or a pin.
3.0,"This is a beautiful coat, very stylish, with great style details, and the faux leather fabric is soft and feels amazing.  It is well made & I love the way it looks. I was really excited to see that it came in my size, 3XL, since so often stylish, cute clothing doesn't exist in my size. So naturally this was an item I was stoked to get and it is as great looking in person as I had hoped.<br /><br />However, it is not at all sized accurately.  A 3XL is the same as a size 22. I put the jacket on & there was zero chance of me being able to zip it up. It is also a bit short, which I suspect is due to the fact that it is much smaller than it should be. I took the jacket off and checked the tag for the size - 16. It's 3 sizes smaller than a 3XL actually is. Size 16 is a L, not a 3XL. So I am very bummed that this is not a jacket I can actually wear bc the actual jacket itself is very very nice.<br /><br />Size way way up if you buy this."
3.0,Love the print- black top with a white flower print bottom. Pockets make dress skirt look a little bigger than i would like. I ordered a large. I am 5'6 and weigh 170lbs.
3.0,"When I received these glasses, there was a small crack on one of the arms but these are still the bomb dot com."
3.0,"The fabric is a little thin, and you can see through,  but overall the dress is ok for be at home"
3.0,"Aesthetically, the watch looks nice. Adjusting the size of the band was extremely challenging. Attempted in multiple locations to remove the pins, but they were jammed in so tight that it felt as if the band would break."
3.0,Wished it had a hand strap but other than that it is working great
3.0,There was glitter all over and it’s not well made but I guess you get what you pay for
3.0,This product doesn't fit like a dress it fits like a night gown.... So expect to alter it like I have to grrrrr
3.0,"I love the look, material & quality but as soon as I went to put it on, the straps & small plastic buckle fell off :("
3.0,Great cut. The. Fabric has little to no stretch and runs small in size
3.0,definitely 3 stars<br />It could improve by 2 telescope handle to add stability to drag/roller option.
3.0,Shirt is skin tight... pants are tight also but too long... she could’ve worn the pants had some growing room but the shirt looked like it had been painted on it was so tight so I returned... but quality seemed good... and outfit is cute... leggings are a slick material
3.0,Too heavy and sits way to far off the ear. Not what i was expecting.
3.0,"Beautiful bra !! But not the support I had hoped for ..every time I leaned forward unfortunately my boobs fell out in front where the cleavage is open for a push up look ..this I didn't need ..I really needed the support for large breast , but when the straps were adjusted for a good fit , my breast just stood out in front lifted up too high and stuck out and up to much for my taste and style ..I returned ..it didn't work for me ...but it was lovely"
3.0,These were too small. Other than that I loved the design.
3.0,"These seem to be okay quality just a step up from like claire’s costume type jewelry but not quite as nice as betsey Johnson jewelry.<br />Overall my thoughts are mediocre. I was unimpressed with the way it was packaged in the box as you can see from the picture they were just loose in the box flying around.<br />I also wore them for about 2-3 hours and noticing my ears start to itch around the 2nd hour slightly.<br />The heart itself is sterling but I doubt the stalk that misters into your ear is, the boy is likely made out of some type of enamel or resin.<br />It has a cute-ish look which is why overall I wanted to give these a try.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope this review helped your decision!"
3.0,"It was too large for me... 40dd. Typically wears size large tops, 5'4 170 . It was very pretty though!  Easy return"
3.0,Very thin material. See through need to wear something under it. Also the print is a little pixelated.
3.0,"They didn't stop my headaches, but that might not be due to the quality of the lenses. They give everything an ever so slightly amber tint. The clip on sunglasses are poor quality, and don't fit properly. The picture makes it look like the picture makes it look like the tips are green, but that's just a misleading photoshop."
3.0,If they’re true to the size and I love the material
3.0,but hat was too small
3.0,"It does the job, but the fabric is so thin you can see the pads through it. If you're looking for support, this will not provide any"
3.0,It really isn't what the picture shows. It's like the other pictures from customers. It's still cute but I really wanted a darker and longer shirt. It fits well but the sleeves are kinda tight and fitting at the bottom.
3.0,"I like the discrete coloring, but like others have mentioned the Go'tcha can pop out of it.<br /><br />I've only have the Go'tcha pop out of this wristband when I tightened it to the tightest I could around my wrist and then flexed my wrist putting pressure on it.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy again due to this issue, but if you know not to tighten it too much, it shouldn't be an issue. Just be aware!"
3.0,This dress is ok...normally I would have returned it but because it’s so cheap I decided to keep it. It’s very bright colors which I like. Fabric is shiny so it looks on the cheap end. I ordered a small. The fabric stretches so it’s not as fitted as I would like. I would give it a 3.
3.0,I really like this time but it gets things very easily meaning and is splash of water will definitely leave a mark on it and let’s say you are putting on your shirt and you have on lipstick is the lipstick plus the shirt that Stephen will be on here for the rest of the day as well as perfume so as long as you don’t get any wet stain on it it should be good for the rest of your day
3.0,It was disappointed in this product. It was a little too big and it just wasn't a good look for me but it's so comfortable I'm going to keep it.
3.0,"i love the material. it is thick, heavy, stretchy.<br /><br />i am 5'2"", 36B, 160 lbs -- i received a medium. i usually wear a medium. this fits like a medium.<br /><br />my problem with this design is the V neckline is a bit narrow. narrow v necks makes me feel really fat around the shoulders, like i have such broad fat shoulders. i wish the v opens up a little bit so that it shows i a little collar bone.<br /><br />if you are skinny though, you might like this. it's just not for people who are on the chunky side. it can make us look even chunkier!"
3.0,"Very thin lace material. Stretchy, but not much support! Comfy at least. I will wear if I needed to for the right dress."
3.0,works fine overall for preventing me to breath saw dust when sanding. However the upper seal is not good and glass is very easily fogged.
3.0,The outfit was not bad overall but much taller than I expected.  I was also not crazy about the material.
3.0,"I needed something like this for my wrists since I do play FPS games and the keyboard I'm currently using is a Logitech G610.<br /><br />At first, I loved it for its quality and cost! I've never previously owned a keyboard pad, only for the mouse. It definitely helps with the comfort of use with the keyboard. It also helps me type much faster as well, sometimes too fast!<br /><br />During the first couple of months, this made my wrists feel great even after long sessions. Now the pad has reduced down and starting to feel wrist pains when I place my wrists on this thing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pad for gaming purposes, spend a bit more money for a better quality version, I'd definitely recommend it to an average computer daily user."
3.0,"The product isn't as the picture shows, at all! Ok cotton but no shape"
3.0,"Very difficult to resize this bracelet and easy to damage the thin bar inside the clasp during resizing due to the brute force required to close the resizing clasp.  Maybe the bracelet is just a hair to thick for the clasp which causes the difficult closing of the clasp.  Bracelet itself is pretty nice, clasp is only issue.  Bracelet is pretty long, I have a lot of excess bracelet that wraps inside when wearing."
3.0,They look comfortable however super small. The color is good
3.0,Great style but kind of flimsy. Had a pair I bought from hot topic years ago that looked exactly like it but more sturdy. Thought this was the same kind since they looked exactly alike but I doubt this pair will last as long as the previous one.
3.0,"This dress is a copy of a designer dress. The style is very pretty and it was well sewn but, as usual with copies, the material is a cheap nylon or polyester, and just not what it should be. There was also no inside bra, as stated in the description. I was disappointed with the quality and returned mine."
3.0,Color a bit off
3.0,"Picture was much prettier than the actual item received.  Bought as a gift and was disappointed enough to buy another gift in lieu of this.  She's my best friend so I'll show it her and if she likes it, its all hers but all said and done, I wouldn't buy again"
3.0,"It turned my finger very green... but I have put a coat of clear polish on it, so hopefully won't happen again because it is super cute, looks very cute on and lots of people have complimented it. I can wear it on any finger as it adjusts easily. For the price-- it is worth it because it is very solid and not like some of the cheap looking stuff from mall stores and things."
3.0,"Very pretty kinda large up too but short, I'm a 38dd and had plenty of room in the chest but barely came to my waist band"
3.0,These sunglasses have reflective blue lenses. I was expecting blue tint not blue mirror shades. Fortunately like most SPY sunglasses the quaulity is solid so I'll probably keep them.
3.0,"My daughter is 11 weeks and 12+lbs, I'm pretty sure she's 50th % for head and the bands aren't fitting her yet. They are quite cute and I will update once she is able to wear them."
3.0,"Overall, I was able to use it for what I needed. However, the fabric feels very cheap. The snaps shifted constantly and the edges where the snaps are would rub against my thigh. The snaps were strong so I didn’t have to worry about that and the over all look was fine, just felt cheap and snap area is not friendly."
3.0,"It’s a really nice band and I’ve gotten many compliments on it - the magnet is strong and I love how adjustable it is. It’s become a pain to wear, though, because it catches on softer fabrics. I have tons of pulls in my clothes because of it."
3.0,they are what I was looking for but the fit is extremely tight
3.0,"Not ugly, but color did not match pic. Shown..., I received more of a salmon color watch"
3.0,"I bought the large but I am an in-between I think.  It seems large, like the visor is longer than expected yet the hat part is small.  It doesn't cover the bottoms of my ears."
3.0,Looks great in the picture but when it arrived as a Christmas gift for my father-in-law it looks a little cheap. The shirt is decent quality but the logo looks far from authentic. Highly disappointed. It's hard to get Aston Martin shirt so it served its purpose but not what I expected.
3.0,I ordered a 2xl and is wayyyyy to small.
3.0,"These are well made, good looking shoes. However, they were too tight across the top of the foot. I ordered them up one size because other reviews mentioned the same problem. Unfortunately I am returning them."
3.0,"nice, but it sheds so I wear it only at home"
3.0,I like them but I ordered to large
3.0,These glasses are GREAT except for the logo on the frames which my hair gets stuck in and then ripped out - I hope they can fix this!
3.0,"If you don't want a shiny coat go with the matt black finish as I did. It's perfect. A great buy.<br />Now an update!<br />I've warn it only 4 times, just to and from work. The leather is of poor quality, it actually looks fake with how it reacts to wearing.<br />I'm temped to cut the seams to check if in fact it's real. I will update again if it continues to wear poorly and then I will cut the seam to check.<br />Bottom line, you get what you pay for."
3.0,I could barely get the bands into the first hole to put it on. Aside from the length issue its a great value for the money.
3.0,"These earrings look beautiful, but these have a definite problem. The post came out of the pearl and I had to glue it back in place."
3.0,"A really nice piece of jewellery, but the printing of such a wonderful written code is very small."
3.0,My concern is about the size. Somewhat small.
3.0,"Somewhat thin, doesn't feel like plush cotton"
3.0,One of the post was bent when I received them scared to try & straighten them back out in fear it will break
3.0,"I really like the shirt, but I ordered a XXL and it's a little small."
3.0,This was just ok.  The sleeves are short so I have to wear them pushed up.  The body is larger so kind of a strange fit.  Surprise.............  it has pockets hidden in it.  Which is a bonus.
3.0,"This is a very attractive stainless steel bracelet in an electric blue. It is designed for men but it works well for women as long as the links are adjusted. It is adjustable in the sense that links can be removed with the link adjuster. That is not an easy task but there are online videos to assist, There are NO instructions provided instructions in the box. The magnets are on the underside of the bracelet in every link.<br /><br />The magnets are supposed to confer health benefits such as pain relief, arthritis relief, body balancing, improve blood pressure, etc. I do not subscribe to such hocus pocus and, after having worn bracelets like this previously and tried this one, I have experienced no health benefit. However, wearing a piece of jewelry that is attractive is certainly mood enhancing. The current price of $18.99 is excellent for this. The only reason I rated this 3 stars is because of the health benefit claims that I do not see; otherwise it is a 5-star bracelet at a good price. If some health benefits are achieved for a select few individuals, then I consider that a bonus. It is definitely a recommended buy as jewelry.<br /><br />NOTE: Anyone with a pacemaker should not wear magnetic bracelets.  "
3.0,"These shipped very fast and got to me in perfect condition, and they work just fine, but the colors are MUCH darker than pictured.  Instead of tortoiseshell and teal, mine are black and navy blue.  The red ones are the same.  Black with more of a dark burgundy.  I bought them because of the color, so I'm disappointed."
3.0,Quality was just OK
3.0,Love that the skirt has pockets. It’s awkward that the built-in slip hits above the knee.
3.0,I was looking for a tank with a bra in it.  When reviewing the questions and answers it stated that there was a bra in it.  I have pasted below:<br />Question: Do you need a sports bra with this?<br />Answer: It has a built in sports bra.<br /><br />However this is not correct.  there is no built in sport bra.  The tank is okay just not what I wanted to purchase.
3.0,The print is on backwards and the material on the shirts are tearing at the seams
3.0,"These are nice socks, but I did not know that they have the toes in them.  My daughter will love them, but my husband didn't.  I received these at a discount price for an honest review."
3.0,"Meh. Cheap material. Color is way off. Supposed to be light grey and floral and definitely looks purple, not grey. Sized up per fitting chart and could have possibly sized down. Not the best."
3.0,"The glove ran smaller than the chart measurements supplied.  Therefore, they were too small for a women's hand who wears XL,<br /><br />However, my husband has smaller hands and likes them"
3.0,"Pretty sure I received someone’s used return. The bracelet came in an open/broken crinkled bag and was stretched out and definitely doesn’t look new. The bracelet is flimsy and floppy feeling-not solid construction that you can bend and it will stay, if that’s what you are looking for. Disappointing! I feel like a lot of Amazon vendors are sending out used returns that should not be resold. I say this based on my own experience as well as having read the same in other reviews. Having to package them up and drive them to a return location to send them back is a pain and that’s put on the customer. Same goes for items that are not properly packaged and arrive broken. If you send me somebody else’s worn return, you should not put it on me to have to go through that hassle. Just sayin’…<br /><br />There are a lot of good reviews so, maybe I was just the unlucky person who got a bad one that was returned. The one I received is so loose and bendy, it would fall off in a stiff breeze."
3.0,"Attached is an image of how I pulled it out of the USPS packaging. If this was bought for any other reason than a 7-year-old asking for a “Boogie Bomb” for Christmas, I guess it wouldn’t have mattered that much. 3 Stars because I now have to think of a creative way to repackage it to wrap and put under the tree."
3.0,Not true to size. Too small. Can not fit. Can not wear.
3.0,Nice dress but too long for my wife.  She is 5’4”.
3.0,Magnet on band snags wrist hairs. It's really annoying. Otherwise it's comfortable. Looks nice.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. It was worth $14, but not a heavy enough belt to use for OWB conceal carry."
3.0,I am 5ft 5 inches weigh 137<br />Usually size 10 but this size 10 is too<br />Toght
3.0,the owl and other items are really small. the photo is obviously shopped but its misleading.<br /><br />the braclet however is actually pretty large. my gf will love it anyways.
3.0,Love the support and look of this but it's not as stretchy as I need. Very difficult to get on and off with my chest.
3.0,"They are super tight and the design stretches out so it distorts the villains,"
3.0,Looks cheap but overall satisfied for the price.
3.0,I liked it at first bit it tears very easily
3.0,"Bought 3 xl tank tops but for some reason the white shirt was longer and a little bit wider. Im 6'4"" 230 so the white fits perfectly but the black and gray is a little too short."
3.0,"Light weight, durable, fits well. Lenses are too dark."
3.0,Cute bracelet but disappointed that it has broke already. It's not fixable. Shame...
3.0,"Its an ok product, it looks nice and looks exactly how the picture looks like, but you do get what you pay for. The first time i tried it on, the glass fell off and broke in two pieces."
3.0,"These gloves are clearly meant for people with tiny hands. For what I intend to use them for, they'll do fine. Along with that, a seam where the lace attaches to the fabric came undone, so I have to sew that up."
3.0,They were a little too tight. But they're pretty low quality. The pocket already has a hole in it. The stitching came apart. I bought two. I haven't even opened up the second package because of this.
3.0,I thought based upon the description that it would have 3 pockets between the sides. I zoomed into the image to confirm this.  The third pocket is actually behind the credit card slots on one side.  There are only two pockets that are accordion style pockets.
3.0,Not as bright in person as they are pictured but close. Very cute statement earrings. Great for the summer.
3.0,Pretty but not what I was expecting
3.0,"A tiny bit on the large size for me.  I wear a straight (6), so kinda  slips on me when I walk.  I'll gdet you if I fall and break my neck.  Just kidding.<br /><br />Cub"
3.0,"Beautiful shirt but like my wife's mustache, its kinda thick. The heavy cotton is not a good look for hot weather."
3.0,"Fits as expected, but just too short for my preference"
3.0,"Cute but way too long for someone who is 5&#34;4, well past the knee"
3.0,I expected a thicker material like the ones that were sold from &#34;As seen on TV&#34;. These are nice but I wanted a material that acted more like a compression shirt not an &#34;dry fit&#34; undershirt.
3.0,Ok bought for my 6th grader to use in pe. Hard to use. Should be easier
3.0,"These pants are well constructed, but would be better suited to a shorter person. I am 5'7 and they were too short for me. That said, I like a lot of products from this brand."
3.0,So much smaller than expected. Having bought Oilily bags for the past few years .. this is small.
3.0,"Although it fits, it doesn't stay fastened, and it is a far reach to attach. So I have had it come undone in public!!! The rest of the suit held in place, but it was still embarrassing. I do like the long sleeves though. Overall it is a cute suit that I am comfortable in, until it opens while using."
3.0,The dress is very cute and comfortable however it is not true to size. I ordered a large so that it would fit loosely but it is very form fitting. I’d recommend ordering 2 sizes up if you want it to fit like the picture. The inside fabric feels like a soft sweater lining. 3 stars only because of fit other than that I like it.
3.0,"100% cotton but very ‘short’ ordered a large, width is more like a medium, length is more like a small."
3.0,"It's OK. I looked at the reviews to figure out what size to get and I was very excited to see that many who had issues with gapping between the buttons didn't have that problem. However, when I got it, it fit everywhere except the chest, and it definitely gapped. Also, the fabric is very thin."
3.0,"The coat is very warm and comfortable. However, the hood flaps do not fit properly. Either they stick out like Pippi Longstockings, or when you fasten them together with the velcro, it's way too tight."
3.0,"My daughter loved it. It was a beautiful sweater. However, the emblem started to peal after multiple trips to the dryer. I presume it would have helped if we hung dried it only."
3.0,"When reading the reviews, I thought sizing up would be smart. But when this arrived, it was huge on me! The stitching is actually pretty good, and the piece has a nice shape. But it's certainly oversized. I'm usually a size small in most clothing, and ordered a medium. It's more of a tunic than a dress."
3.0,Sleeves are a little short.  Otherwise a nice jacket.  Feel it would leak in a big downpour
3.0,really cute but very fragile and way to small for my ankle.  put it in a white elephant Christmas gift
3.0,One necklace is the one that is advertised here ... (the darker one) the other is a mother daughter necklace ... I liked the locket a lot just thought it’s be cool if they offered to size the picture up for you before purchasing or after because I have yet to do it
3.0,Smaller than what I expected. I ordered my size. Need to go a size larger.....if there was a size other than “ one size”. Like the fabric and colors
3.0,"For the price, it wasnt bad. But the material for me was rather scratchy."
3.0,"I get so many compliments on this shirt. But honestly, I hate the t shirt it's printed on. It's cheap and really boxy."
3.0,Just not an attractive fit because the fabric is very thin
3.0,"The size is fine, but the neckline is much higher than pictured."
3.0,"Seems to run large.  Material is alright,  expected better.  Not comfy cotton."
3.0,I did not like them - they were too wide and if you adjusted belts it looked stupid
3.0,Definitely not seamless!!!
3.0,The pants and the fit are just weird... a lot of excess material although I loved the concept.<br /> Maybe I need to try another size.
3.0,This dress is very nice and came in the color as described.<br /><br />It is extremely small. This ended up fitting my daughter who usually wears a small. We had a large. Order two sizes up and you will be happy with this purchase.
3.0,Was not as great as I thought it was going to be. The lacing hangs weird. I've worn it twice just don't really like it
3.0,The headbands serve the purpose of holding back my hair. They are lightweight and stretchy.
3.0,Did not really help tummy control
3.0,"These masks are colorful and appear to be well made, but the fit is loose and the material becomes moist quickly."
3.0,"I had high hopes, but ultimately the small was too large for my flat-ish 34B chest. I couldn't even come close to filling out the cups on these. They're pretty, but won't work for smaller chested women."
3.0,The arms were super short need 3” more to fit properly<br />I wish I could find an XL with a little longer arms but that wasn’t an option
3.0,"These shoes are very pretty. However, the fit is not good. The embroidery is very stiff and presses down on my toes. I can wear them for short periods at a time. It becomes too uncomfortable and painful. I wear them only at home and kept them because I intend to give them away to someone who has a much smaller foot and can probably use them all the time. I don't recommend these shoes at all."
3.0,"Pretty but ran a good size smaller than was marked.  I ordered up a size and ended up giving it to a ""smaller"" friend.  In fairness: she loved it."
3.0,Way to small for stated size
3.0,I suggest you order one to two sizes bigger than you think you need.
3.0,"I like how it looked in pictures... but when I got it, the material looked cheap..."
3.0,These run at least a half size small.
3.0,I managed to lose these earrings after taking them out of box.  Looked cute but never got to try them on.
3.0,It's a little small and it's hard to get the buttons snapped yourself but otherwise I love how it feels.
3.0,It's a cute dress but the top portion under my arms is way too big and had to be pinned to wear it. The slip underneath is way too short for the dress and doesn't cover my booty so I have to wear leggings or use this ONLY as a beach cover up.
3.0,Revels all your curves.  I have never used it.  I am a little up in age... After I purchased it I realized I should have left it alone.  I kept it and will give it away. I am not saying that it is bad or anything. I just feel it might more suit young people.
3.0,"I love these bold and huge earrings, but they don't stay on my ears. The backs fall off. I'll see if I can find a work around."
3.0,When u need cheap panties here it is.
3.0,It does what it says.
3.0,"The cuffs on the pants are very tight, not like the way they look in the picture. Very misleading. To late for me, I washed the two pair I bought. My own fault for not checking hard enough. Otherwise they fit great, love the belt loops"
3.0,"The color of the jacket (Ponderosa Green) is perfect, but the flimsy material is not.  Decided to give it a whirl today, for part of the  description states “100% wind proof”.  Gusting at 36 mph, cold, with a snowstorm on the horizon... layered appropriately for an errand jaunt into town.  The jacket was adequate, nothing out the ordinary."
3.0,"Definitely not African material, but the dress is super cute!!"
3.0,"I love the design and I only bought it to wear every now and then, but its cheaply made and turns my finger green, not as adjustable as advertized, still love it though."
3.0,They are very pretty earrings... however the backs/balls are very large.  They would look better if they were smaller.
3.0,"These are very cute and comfy, but after having them only a month, they're starting to fall apart on the inside/sole."
3.0,"Good fitting socks.  Comfortable but, no odor resistant as a regular wool sock."
3.0,"The bottoms fit just fine, but the cups in the top are preeeeetty tight for a large. I have to wear it strategically in order to not have the &#34;Renaissance cleavage&#34; up top - not a good look (for me) in a bathing suit."
3.0,"Cute, but had to return. If you have any muscle or fat at all. I mean at all, it will be to tight for you. The rest of the shirt fit fine, it's just the sleeves."
3.0,Order a size down… I’m usually a large and it looks like I’m wearing a 2X.. would be cute if it fit
3.0,Probably would have worked great but my heal was hanging off- and the fact that I had to pay to return the shoes I decided not to reorder.
3.0,"Very comfortable and cute. Be sure to wash it before wearing, because I didn’t and my undergarments were BLACK, as was my entire body where it touched. Took some scrubbing to get me back to normal. I’m 5’4” and it was slightly too short on me, so I’d say it’s not for taller women. For sure not a maxi to be worn with heels/wedges."
3.0,Pants are good quality but size is way too small. I'm a 32 and bought the size M = 33. Barely fit me but I had no choice since there wasn't enough time to replace it for a larger size.
3.0,"They fit well, the colors are nice, but the material they are made of isn't ideal for women's health. It's important to wear a gentler, more breathable material. Cotton is ideal to avoid moisture and.. scary stuff like infection. Do research! Consider finding cotton for your lady bits."
3.0,Actually not grey color. Grey mix with dusty rose color. Already got couple stains like soda that not washing out. Won’t be buying again.
3.0,Fabric too thin so extremely clingy.  Nice otherwise.
3.0,The visors get the job done.<br />Flimsy but they work.
3.0,"It fits great and is comfortable but I'm very upset, worn each one about 2 or 3 times. Washed them and the bra pads dont hold up, they are falling apart. Very disappointed."
3.0,It actually came with a defect. The bottom of the shirt was sewn to itself. Luckily my aunt was able to fix the stitching and correct the hem. Cheaply made and super itchy but it will be fine for what I need it for.
3.0,"I'm not impressed with these at all.  They are VERY cheaply made, flex and bend quite easily, and the lenses are far too translucent.  They look neat from really far away and have a stylish appearance, but from even a moderate distance you can see how poor the quality is.  Even the case they come in is incredibly flimsy and cheap looking.<br /><br />Avoid the waste- buy something else..."
3.0,Loved this dress and had been looking at it for a while so I was pretty bummed when I got it and it zipped all the way up except around my breast because I have big boobs so if you are on the larger chested side it may not work for you
3.0,"I normally wore the silver ones and people thought i had put real screws through my ears, it was a good gag, the paint on the black ones does start to chip after a while though"
3.0,I love this top. Unfortunately it rubs black off onto my under arms after wearing it.
3.0,"This is for the black scoop neck dress. The cut and fit are great, also love that it has pockets. I'm pretty tall and it is about 4"" below my knee, which I personally like. Easy to pull on. I haven't washed it yet so I'll update that later.<br />Oh, the material...major deal breaker. This is NOT ""breathable"" and feels like a 1970 lounge wear/track suit and shows every little mark. Its hot and encourages sweat which you definitely don't want in a dress thats style more suited for warmer months."
3.0,Adorable but shrunk up the second I washed it and I didn’t even get to wear it out yet :/
3.0,Not made to last.....
3.0,"Rather long but if you wear with heels, this should be okay! I am 5'6&#34;"
3.0,Nice inexpensive for now.
3.0,Great item and fits the description that has been provided by seller.
3.0,"Very pretty, the sparkle doesn't last in it. They have a good amount of weight behind them, they're heavy. I had to take it out of my 2 yearn Olds ears because they were so heavy and stretching her piercing."
3.0,Not sure these made any difference
3.0,Had originally given this a 5 star for being really comfortable and a good fit. Which is still true. But I had to lower my review to a 3 star because it completely faded to off black/brown after the first wash. It now looks nothing like the picture
3.0,"Fit is great, but style was not as expected. The black bottom part came up really high so the pattern is reslly short. Looks a little off considering I have a large chest, but that being said, still is a flattering dress."
3.0,It’s a cute sweater but the cut is nothing like the pic. It’s just a plain neck sweater that’s cheap material. It’ll be fine over a tank top
3.0,Not bad top. I wish it was longer.  Nice for casual dress.
3.0,"Ordered a large  (I'm 5'8"", 130 lbs). These shirts run short and ride up when arms are raised.  Not for tall / long torso people."
3.0,Frayed very easily and material is thin and itchy
3.0,"Pros:<br />Very pretty color<br />Chain is a good, average length<br /><br />Cons:<br />The gem is Much smaller than it looks in the picture... You can Just tell that it is a heart if you were looking at the person wearing it.<br /><br />Would I purchase again? Not for this price. One might find something very similar at a Clair's or other store for half the price."
3.0,The pockets are great. I wish these came in “short”. My only real complaint is that these slide down when I’m running.
3.0,"I like these but the high iaist is a bit annoying.  Also, I had to order an XL to not have the pockets open up.  The design is nice but if the waistband would be lower I would have bought more than one...."
3.0,"They run a bit small, so gave them to someone that they would better fir."
3.0,Really tight. And it's not really made of good material for a hoodie.
3.0,metal is a darker color than it looks in the pic
3.0,"So...not the color shown by a long shot, they are quite an atrocious color green and not anywhere near the nice color shown.Normally my grandson wears a 5t. I took the advice of others to order up in size, I ordered a 7 and am glad I did. They fit great without being snug. All of that said even though we dont like the color, will keep them."
3.0,"Liked the garmet, but bought in my normal size and it didn't even pretend to fit!  Disappointed."
3.0,Clearly it shows as a greenish color on Amazon but it is blue when it arrived
3.0,the product scale is off. it runs larger.
3.0,"This is a really nice tie, for the price I can't ask for more. The only complaint I have is that the pocket square was missing, even though the package was sealed. Really a bummer. Other than that really nice for a modern look or for a young man."
3.0,the piece by the ear is tooooo thick and give me a head ache
3.0,Decent. Clip is flimsy. Case is good quality. I ended up cutting slots on backside and attaching to molle on plate carrier. No fraying as of yet.
3.0,"SUPER old lady jacket! Looks heavier in the picture. It's really thin and not waterproof, but what resistant. I look kind of dumb in it, but it's better than nothing! I think I'll spend some more time actually looking around and TRYING on jackets before I buy a new one. I''m still glad to have it with all of this rain lately!"
3.0,Very good looking. Problem is that the &#34;stone&#34; didn't last a week.
3.0,It’s really beautiful ‘I like it alot’ small fit for me
3.0,"If you  have small breasts and would like to look completely flat,  this would be a great suit for you.  I would say that this suit fit true to size, however something about the chest area looks like you have bandaged your breasts down.  like I said if,that's the look you are going for, please by all means, buy it.  On another note,  it might actually look better on those who are well endowed."
3.0,"beautiful ring, came in early,  diamond was not placed properly but still happy with it."
3.0,The dress didn't fit me correctly. The black top was shorter on me than expected. It looked better with a wide black belt but the style just didn't work for me.
3.0,Socks are ok. They are much thinner than I expected and the feet on them are way too long for me.
3.0,Could not make these into prescription glasses...
3.0,The band is beautiful and simple to use. BUT it catches on everything and pull the fabric. Becareful or it might damage to a nice blouse or sweater.
3.0,"This fit ok, but the sleeves are a bit short. I am 5'5 127lbs and I got a small. The skirt has a really high &#34;swing&#34; on one side revealing a lot of thigh. Otherwise it could be a dress."
3.0,racket protector is to small for the todays modern rackets. The rest is excellent.
3.0,"This was just whatever. It was very short, only came to the hip, and I am long in the torso, so it definitely wasn't long enough to cover my bottom. The sweater was well constructed but just simple, not very soft, and nothing exciting, the wool or yarn just felt like it could have been bought at the hobby lobby. It was sort of a boring, boxy fit for me so I returned, just didn't give me the cute Valentine's vibe I was looking for."
3.0,"This item fit poorly for me so I'm returning it.<br /><br />For anyone who wants to know more about the fabrication, it's poly/lycra much like a yoga pant might be made of, only slightly thinner. I'm not a fan.<br />On the plus side, the color o the lace sleeves matched the pink of the polyester perfectly. Well done on that"
3.0,"I went by my measurements and chose a size according to the chart. I bought this dress for a wedding, but was disappointed when the dress was very large on me. Ended up having to wear a very heavily padded bra, just for it to stay up, and even that did not help completely."
3.0,Strap should be a little longer.
3.0,"They're nice and work well for nurses, but I don't like how tight they get behind the knees. I usually have to roll them down throughout my shift."
3.0,They turned out being way too wide.
3.0,It's a shirt not a dress. Kept it in hopes if I lose weight it'll be more flattering with my jeans/ jean shorts because it looks cool.
3.0,I love the style but I wish the chain was real silver.  I would’ve kept it
3.0,"I ordered purple and the dress is a maroon color. Some of the stitching is loose and showing however, it is comfortable and fits well."
3.0,"Love the bracelet, but it has tarnish spots on it. Not going to return it because a percentage goes too children being the main reason I chose this particular bracelet."
3.0,These were not at all the manly blue that they appear to be there more of a girly teal when they arrived I felt bad they were a gift for my husband and he was like what the hell did you buy me?!  Other than that they are nice socks
3.0,For me it personally dug into my wrist. I also wear the watch just under my wrist and relatively tight. What took away from the rating was the fact the material on one of the bands broke within 2 weeks. That happened to me personally but could just superglue or stitch it back on if anything.
3.0,"I liked the dress and material but returned it as the bust area was too big. I'm 5'6, 165 lbs and a 36C and ordered a large. The waist of the dress fit fine it was just too large in the bust area."
3.0,After checking the size chart I ordered what I expected to be a good fit. Turns out it fit more like a L than a XXL. I ended up go it it to my sister.
3.0,"The whistles don’t work very well, but the compass does. I only bought these because it is required to have a whistle on a Kayak or Stand-Up Paddle Board in Colorado. Still worth the price."
3.0,Nice quality. Size too small
3.0,This bouffant cap is ok. I think maybe my head is too big for it as it didn’t give me the stretch I was looking for and I actually ended up with a slight headache after wearing it to work.
3.0,"Decent replacement band at a good price, but... The little ""tooth"" in the keeper is too small to effectively keep the tail end of the band in place and it ends up coming loose fairly regularly. Unfortunately for me, the keeper is what broke on my original band, so reusing the old one is not an option."
3.0,Bummed that these are too small for me. They stretch quite a bit but I don't like how they look all stretched out. They will make a great re-gift though. :)
3.0,"Will be returning. The small was too tight in waist (I'm 5'0, 117 lbs). I saw a review complaining about lint and I can already tell that these would have the same problem as they arrived with shreds of lint all over them."
3.0,They were a lot smaller than I thought. My bad.
3.0,They are nice but not for me. They are too low cut and definitely run small.
3.0,"The pearls are absolutely gorgeous, but I lost one of the earring backs on the second day I wore them. Thankfully I noticed before I lost the actual pearl earring. You'll need to buy replacement earring backs or you will lose an earring."
3.0,Ring is pretty bulky. Much bigger than I expected but it pretty overall. Reminds me of a class ring lol fits a little loose too.
3.0,"Like other reviewers said, the print is smaller than the picture shows"
3.0,"They fit great, but after first wash they will slip on you during workouts. Was super annoyed."
3.0,The band came bent and split but they sent me a new one right away. It is much stiffer than the original one but I don't mind that.  Better than the original.
3.0,Very cheap looking material; was very excited for this spring dress but had to return.
3.0,"Product received is not what pictured. Leather is darker and it has a change pocket on one side. Pictures nor description say anything about a change pocket. Also the stamped emblem is not on the outside front, it is on the inside where the snap closure is. Seems to be of nice quality, but my husband is not a fan of the ""coin purse"" on the back."
3.0,Very thin and not a legging fit. Using as pj pant. Cute design
3.0,Super cute but sizing is WAY off. She fit after the 3rd pair just snug into a size 9 when shes a size 11 and it was a HUGE difference between 10 and 9.
3.0,This cami got as expected. The only thing that upset me was one of the tanks had a rip when it opened the package. I was already swamped with other things to do so I missed the deadline to return it.
3.0,I could've got a bigger size
3.0,A bit itchy and threads seemed bare/sparse in places.  Returned.
3.0,Love the look but these boots fit a little snug in the toes.  They will probably stretch out as I wear them.
3.0,"Loved them, but they broke after wearing them for a week."
3.0,Camo version as expected but the others in the multi pack are loose and flimsy and of different material
3.0,"I accidentally ordered this in my normal size, small, but the recommendation is to order up a size. I think if I had, I would have liked the fit a lot better. As a small, it still fit, but the sleeves look better rolled up at the wrist and with a size small the sleeves were way too short to do that. The elbows also seemed to billow out when holding my arms straight, for whatever reason. I am 5'9"" and lanky, and I think for the sweater to fit like the picture I would have needed a large, maybe an extra large for the length.<br />The sweater was very soft and warm but did make me kind of sweaty, the same as the other shirt I tried from this brand, which had 30% microfiber. Both of them started pilling after maybe two hours of me wearing them. The first one I wore for two days and then returned it because it was a MESS. This one I gave two hours and could see the writing on the wall so returned it as well. I will not order from this brand again. If the prices were lower, it could be good for lounging around the house. Seems like a waste of cashmere to me though. What is the point of making a cheaper cashmere sweater if it is going to fall apart immediately?"
3.0,"They weren’t nearly as long as expected. I was able use them for something else though, so not a total loss."
3.0,Bought these a year ago. They work petty good. The wires started pulling away from the batteries so I had to fix them. What I don't like about them is the fact that the battery pack is so big and the gloves that I wear over top of these barely fit. The battery pack is so big that it won't fit under my jacket so I have a space for air to get to my skin. The heat on them work good though and better then not having any heat. The batteries last a long time. I am currently looking at replacing these with a different style heated glove. I work in Alaska and as the temp gets colder it's nice to have something to help me stay warm while working outside.
3.0,These earrings arrived so tangled and knitted up together it was a 2 hour nightmare to untangle.  I don't appreciate the last packaging.Never again to buy from this seller!!!!
3.0,"The quality over was what to be expected coming from China, actually better than expected. Cokors were pretty and bright. Looked as advertised. You can see every dimple. Really have to dress this ""outfit"" up!"
3.0,The chain is rather flimsy but other than that I like it.
3.0,I bought it for its shape and cut - the way it looks in the picture. It turned out to be shaped different - has a straight loose fit. Doesn't look like the picture. Not impressed.
3.0,I had to have several links removed and it still feels a bit heavy and bulky for my taste.
3.0,"I bought this since it had rave reviews. The material is cheap, the fit is way too big and the sleeves are too long and baggy. Not a fan!"
3.0,Disappointd the D was not white.
3.0,"This shirt was very cute,  liked nice.. there's just one catch.  The seams at the arms allow for no movement.  So.. if you're going somewhere where you need to keep your and down at your sides,  you'll be good to go.  If you need to lift a kid,  grasp the steering wheel of your car, or pick anything up during the day,  I wouldn't buy this shirt."
3.0,They’re great quality pants. Not doubt about it. But they’re huge. I recommend sizing down.
3.0,The clip is shiny gold and a little tacky. Lenses are fine.
3.0,DONT WASH IT
3.0,"These were a great fabric and I think I would have liked them had they not been too small, thankful for easy returns, I will probably try the next size."
3.0,Lasted one night before latch broke.
3.0,One of the straps in the front was not in tact when it arrived and I could not create ruching on the shirt. Disappointed as I love the shirt otherwise
3.0,I am 6 feet tall and the length was perfect.
3.0,This belt was exactly like the real deal without the price tag but beware of the sizing. Size description is not at all accurate. It’s definitely Asian size chart not US or European. I normally wear a size 30 waist in most designer jeans so I purchased a size 34 to be safe and it won’t even go around my waist! You’ll have to purchase 3 sizes up to make this work.
3.0,expected more
3.0,Seems they took down my review - the front is way too low and hits my belly button. Nothing like the picture shown on the model. Material is like a soft satin and very nice feel to it. But the bottom is not as pictured either it’s a straight hem see pics  showing difference
3.0,Cute but the legs roll up
3.0,Changed color very quickly
3.0,"It fits in very small fingers only, not mines"
3.0,Shorter than I thought. I have 2 others that are longer. Color is perfect.
3.0,"As other reviewers have stated, the sleeve lengths are so long that they cover your hands.  So, you walk around looking like you have no hands OR you look like a little kid that stole your dad's jacket.  I take 34.5&#34; sleeve lengths for my dress shirts, and the medium size jacket I purchased was way too long.  I think the body of jacket is about a half size larger than normal.  You can't say the manufacturer didn't cheap out on material...since they used so much of it to make the sleeves.  I like Mountain Hardwear products, so I'm just going to give this jacket a 3 star rating out of respect for the brand."
3.0,hat fit quality of item was good color was very very muted not nearly as bright as pictured
3.0,Bottoms fit perfect but top didn’t work for bigger boobs. I would be afraid they would spill out. Had to return.
3.0,"The pants are way too big in the waist and hips. Based on their size chart and a recent taking of my measurements, I should have just fit into the XL. However the pants are just falling off of me.<br /><br />The costume also was missing the two longer black belts. I’ve messaged the seller and am awaiting a response, but I want others to be aware if they buy this. Because of the material of this costume, I can’t just go buy replacement belts from the store (& shouldn’t have to, as the costume is advertised with them)."
3.0,If dropped or miss handled the pearl triangle top will break off.  It has on mine which I gave to girl friend.
3.0,Beautiful just extremely tiny design
3.0,"I usually wear a size medium shirt, but I feel I could have gotten away with a size small.  The lettering on my shirt is placed lower than it should actually be.  The blue sleave is barely blue.  But I'm still glad I bought it.  I'll have to make a few adjustments to cosplay Harley Q."
3.0,"The dress itself is nice looking and has a high empire waist.  Seems to generate static due to material.  Got the XL hoping it would fit since no size chart specified for reference.  The dress runs really small so the XL size is really more of a medium in regular women's size so be aware.  You would need to go up at least 2 sizes for this to fit properly so I was out of luck.  The white color selection is not black and white but is white, black, and brown so picture is misleading."
3.0,Thicker fabric than I expected.
3.0,"Neckline is poor elasticity, too wide."
3.0,I would have preferred a more pink hue. These were so light pink the appear to be white. The rest of the item was good.
3.0,"I need to stop buying stuff from China.  It's actually soft, and a great fit ON TOP... this is a crop top though.  That aside, it's pretty cute."
3.0,"This could be a decent hoodie, but I don't think it's worth the $30 I paid for it. The quality isn't that great; there were already small holes at the seams of the shirt. And there's not even a front pocket. If you can get this for a good deal, go for it. It does run large, in my opinion. I'm 5'5"" 115 lbs and usually order a size small for a looser fit, but this was pretty big; a size extra small would have fit better."
3.0,"My son loves these headphones! They work well, are adjustable, and are so comfy! He uses noise canceling headphones in school to help keep him from being too distracted and to help with sensory issues with noise and these are so much more comfortable and less bulky than the pair the school provided him. Highly recommend for any kiddos who use headphones regularly for noise reduction. The only issue we’ve had is one side keeps popping out, but I think that may just be due to how my son is handling them, not the product itself. And it’s super easy to pop it right back in when that does happen.<br /><br />Edit: 7/23/19 We still have these. We originally bought both the red and neon green color. I’ve updated to 3 stars because it turns out only the red pair has the issue of one side popping off. It did not end up being operator error as I initially thought. Our son used both pair and only the red ones kept coming apart. Still fairly easy to pop back in but does seem to be a defect or design flaw."
3.0,Nice shorts but a little short.
3.0,They feel light and cheap so only using as backup for when a regular pair can't be found.
3.0,"This is a soft, warm scarf. I like how they have the pom pom on one end that slides through an opening on the other end, securing the scarf. It's not terribly long but it doesn't need to be because of the fastener. No need to wind it around your neck. One thing, and it's a small thing, bugs me about this scarf. The wide end (the one without the pom pom) is cut to look like cat ears. A cat face with whiskers is embroidered into it. But the face is upside down. The nose is closer to the ears than the eyes are. Most people don't notice it and it doesn't make the scarf less comfortable or warm but I must admit, it bothers me."
3.0,Why oh why do they feel like they need to make the shirts so frickin’ short. It barely covers the top of my high waist pants. I didn’t realize it was going to be a belly shirt….
3.0,"I ordered the 7-10t size, which was the smallest size, and it is way too large for my kiddos to wear. Both in width and the ear pieces. They are ages 8 and 11. I actually tried them on also and I was able to wear them but they were still a bit large on me. So these definitely are not child sized.<br /><br />The designs were very cute. The material was okay, just felt like regular cotton, not rough but not super soft either. I would say value for the money is not worth it in my opinion."
3.0,I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!
3.0,"I can only see out of one eye. Good news there is these are sorta a ""two-fer"" deal for me. I used them in cycling / safety glasses so I could see my little bike computer without stopping. Gives me more options for glasses types I can use which I appreciate. I've been using safety glasses with a built in diopter which work fine but lack some features I want (like a ""goggle type"" headband.) These are super answer to that. Unfortunately, I've lost both lenses as they've fallen out of the glasses. Given the ""one good eye"" bit, I had this happen twice. I switched to the other, slightly more expensive brand and those seem to be holding tight after a few weeks.  A suggestion I'd make; leave them the size they come. I cut mine down and that turned out to make it harder for me to see using them. When that one fell out and I went for round two, I left it be. I thought it would obstruct my distance vision but I've actually had zero issues with that happening."
3.0,Ordered a small. Way to big for my son. Was a birthday gift
3.0,"The band is GREAT - for a few months.  The only problems is that the thin leather laminate started to peel off after two months.  I just bought a new one becasue the price is so good, but I'm nit going to keep doing that every few months."
3.0,"Cheaply made, funny smell"
3.0,"This runs super big! I purchased a small and it was huge on me. I'm 5'6"" and 130, so not petite. I've no idea if an XS would have fit, I just didn't want to try. I realize that it's supposed to be flowy but it looked like I was wearing something 3 sizes to big."
3.0,"I ended up giving this to my daughter as it fits her just fine...she wears a Medium to Large... However, it is a beautiful sweater and I loved the color, just wish it had fit."
3.0,"The knitted hat itself was nice, but the light up part for me didn't work (not sure if the battery wasn't charging or some kind of bad wiring?) will be returning because of that but the wanted to say if it lit up I would have gave 5 stars."
3.0,The band itself is fine but getting it fastened on the wrist is next to impossible because of the way the clasp works.  Returning.
3.0,sizes run small but good
3.0,My son has worn them a few times and the toe has already started to come apart.  I bought new pair with a different brand for a few $ more that are sturdier.
3.0,It comes apart from the joints
3.0,You get what you pay for I didn't care for these nose rings they were comfortable but just didn't like them.
3.0,I liked the colour and the style. However the inner piece to cover the breast is very short and is very visible when on that it stops in the middle of my breasts. I will have to consider removing to wear.
3.0,"Fits as expected, but very see through. Only going to use as a swim suit cover up."
3.0,"Dress fits true to the size chart, I am 5'11&quot; with long legs and slim build usually 6/8 and medium fit me well. Length was great on me so if you have short legs it will probably fall below the knee. Bodice is beautiful, the cap sleeves and lovely. It is a natural waist which I like, except this fell a lil short on me. I am a little long waisted though so if you are not it will be a true natural waist on you. The deal breaker on this dress, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the zipper! It's terrible, really clunky and gets seriously stuck all the way if you can even move it. I ordered this dress in two colors and both of them I could barely unzip the thing just to try it on. The blue one got stuck at the waistband and would zip up no further, it wasn't tight on me it was just sitting there at the waist and wouldn't budge. I included a photo of that. And then I got stuck in the red one because although I did get it zipped up I then couldn't unzip it and had to get it off by pulling it over my head. I almost wish I could chop this thing off at the waist and make it a shirt, I really love the bodice/ top. But the zipper and sorta kinda waist killed it for me."
3.0,Wish it was tread instead of print
3.0,Great looking.  Unfastens several times a day.
3.0,"LOVE that it's Cotton, but, as big around as it is, I could've used a smaller size; But then, the sleeves would be too tight. From the pic, I thought that the sleeves were &#34;old-school&#34; (not cut @ an angle, but straight across.)  But I was Wrong. Women cannot get a REAL short-sleeve, only short-short, (or long.) Just above my elbow would be nice, but I know I'll never see that again.  Think of all the material they get to use elsewhere!  Seems that unless I want to spend $$$, I can't FIND a COTTON nightgown w/ ACTUAL sleeves, & just below the knee in length. DON'T NEED LACE, either! (itchy) Nor do I like &#34;one size fits all.&#34;  Tie-dye/India-Indian patterns R best-  Just in case designers read this..."
3.0,The picture looks nicer than it is in person. The head band is way to tight and poorly sewn in my opinion. The sequence is not as pretty but it still is a very cute dress.
3.0,"I actually prefer the foot-looping shirt stays to the sock-clipping, and these were fantastic shirt stays for as long as they lasted. The clips themselves aren't the most sturdy, and the metal bends very easily (can bend the metal of the clips without much effort with my bare hands), so you need to be careful when using these because they will break very easily. I was able to get about 3 months of regular use out of these before one of the clips broke (also during the course of normal use) and fell apart."
3.0,"Too tight around waist. I ordered this skirt in white same size, XL and it fits perfectly. Seems like they are made from two different materials, white is a more stretchy light weight material, red/wine color is not. Yet, I am motivated to loose atleast 5pounds now."
3.0,Boots were more little kidish then I expected and they were huge. I normally wear a size 6 in women's. They were extremely comfy and warm just from trying them on though. I was disappointed I had to return them. This was also the smallest size that I could order in the big kids so there were not other options.
3.0,"They are a good material, but let's just say that they are a bit too revealing."
3.0,Much smaller than the picture shows. Looks nice though.
3.0,"I like this top for the most part though I wish it were a little longer to completely cover my stomach.  If you have a muffin top it will show.  The material is soft and it's very well sewn.  The top dips down lower than I like too and I have to wear a spaghetti strap top to keep my boobs and lower chest safely covered.  The red and white is lovely and is great to wear on hot, sultry summer days."
3.0,nice metal but it hurt extremely bad to clasp and kept falling out
3.0,Was super cute at first. Quality is decent but started to fall apart. My chest is a little bigger so it sat funny no matter what. The strings are so long that I had to cut them.
3.0,Daughter said they were very uncomfortable; returned.
3.0,"I wear three necklaces as my daily wear, this one and another beaded necklace with smiley faces and a paper clip chain necklace. I receive compliments at least twice every time I go out with them which is amazing. The problem with this necklace though is that the wire inside broke from I guess sweat (daily, nothing excessive) so I had to fix it myself buying cord from Michaels. Other than that the necklace is great, just don’t sweat a lot I guess ?"
3.0,In 90 degree temperature the vest gives you cooling relief for 45 minutes or so.
3.0,These a very soft and comfortable. I just didn't quite like the top of the pants. There is a lot of ruched material and it droops. I opted to return them.
3.0,"Nice belt, nice color but alas it was too short or I am too stout."
3.0,The tights are Hot pink and don't match the cat costume they said to purchase it with.  The picture looks like they match perfectly....and the cat costume is more of a purple.  My daughter doesn't seem to mind though.
3.0,"After 2 kids, I put on some weight and my old cycling shorts no longer fit so I was excited to get these.  I pulled them out of the attractive packaging and immediately saw the inside and my first thought was Baboon Butt!  The inside padding is hot pink.  Now, its a very attractive pink ... but rather bright for the inside crotch area of shorts!  The padding is also EXTREMELY thick in the back and rather wide.  I also noted a rather unfortunate crease due to how the shorts were folded and thought ... 'uh oh, this is right were I DON'T want a crease in cycling shorts'.<br />The graphics on the shorts are attractive IMO.  I have no issue wearing them.<br /><br />When I tried them on, the shorts themselves are ok.  They might run a smidge small but are as expected size wise.  The padding is bulky and uncomfortable.  It is far too thick in the rear portion and goes up too high.  In the front where women need more padding, the padding is thinner so not as protective and yet its still too wide.  That crease was definitely felt on a 5mi ride.<br /><br />These are true cycling shorts - one should not expect to get them to do anything but cycling.  The walk from my house to the bike was uncomfortable due to the thickness and position of the gel.  Like an overfilled diaper ... or perhaps those post childbirth sanitary napkins.<br /><br />After a 2nd ride on a different bike, I figured out the issue.  If I'm using a cruising type bike where I sit up more, these shorts do feel fine.  On a road bike or more conventional bike where I'm in a more typical cycling position, the padding up front is insufficient while the thickness of the back got caught every time I got into the saddle.<br /><br />Using these shorts is definitely better than riding in jeans or regular pants.  The price is reasonable and they come in plus sizes.  But I have used much better fitting shorts. Potential buyers may want to consider their riding positions to decide if they will like these.<br /><br />Of course, your mileage may vary!"
3.0,"I really like the looks, lens', however, the fit is not sitting comfortably on my face."
3.0,"Young people like this type of pieces, mature women."
3.0,Ordered a 9/10<br />But had to return because they are too big.<br />Outside package was marked correct but inside shoe was lmarked arger size.
3.0,They are small and I purchased 2 different colors XL is more a US woman's 14 The Back has some Loose Stings that concerns me that it will fall apart with lace damaged . Most defiantly needs to be handled gently Wont last very long . maybe 5 hand washings but be very gentle.<br /><br />I purchased these with discount for unbiased review
3.0,Ordered Size US Medium got Large …luckily this time the product quality is better  last time the t shirted were very poor quality
3.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; and 113lbs. I bought a small, and they fit really well. I know they're 22&#34; but they are a bit longer than my old capri. I still love them!<br />*<br />It's now been a few months and I still love this capri. Unfortunately, I've found that they are not as squat proof as I was hoping. Indoors, they are great. But outdoors in the sunlight, and any sort of bending shows everything. Just keep that in mind."
3.0,I think they are super duper cute! Easily adjustable! A little uncomfortable after awhile but not to bad!!
3.0,The large fits like a small
3.0,"Looks great, but smells like cat piss."
3.0,This runs very small. I have several sports bras in size small and I cannot even get this on. I would think a size 2 would be able to wear this. The fabric is durable and colors are nice but I cannot review the function since it is so small.
3.0,"Here's the deal:<br />I bought a Small and a Medium, which is my normal size.<br />The body fits true to size, especially after machine washing and drying. The arms are voluminous to say the least. Don't size down. The body will end up too tight and the sleeves will still be too loose. So Small goes back. Those of you who wanted to wear this as athletic wear...why? There are better options like wicking poly fleece's. For those of you who wanted a casual piece of sportswear (this does have the classic v-inset at the neck), take it to a seamstress, tailor, your Mom, or fire up the sewing machine and slim the sleeves down, after you wash and dry it. It'll work just fine for your needs."
3.0,Not very sturdy. Feels like these could fall apart at any moment.  Definitely more cheaply made than others of similar style.
3.0,Got the item on time. Fabric quality  was good and color was looking perfect.  But didn't fit me well.
3.0,shorter than i thought it would be  im 5’4 and the small was above my ankles. but nice material and color is as shown
3.0,Colors are bright and pretty. Printed pentacle design is much larger than pictures and hard to tell what it is when wearing.
3.0,"This shirt dress is cut very small in arms and chest, I wear an xxl in 99% of brands, sometimes I wear an xl. This was too small on my arms and chest. I'm 5'7"" and a sz. 18 in jeans. If your chest size is a D or larger this may not fit you. Cute dress, wish it fit!"
3.0,"Didn’t fit the glasses, returned it"
3.0,I wear everyday so it's tarnished.
3.0,Too small for my ankles.
3.0,"My sister is 5’2 and 135 pounds, normally wears size medium, but for this pant she needs size S. I ordered my sister size M at 1st time, then she called me to tell me that it was big on her, so I ordered her the 2nd pair in S. Now, the waist fits but the legs are still loose. The fiber is very soft and comfortable, good stretchy, shaping is fine but the legs are still baggy in weird areas.<br />My sister was going to keep the pants because the fiber is kind of comfortable, but then she changed her mind because  she discovered a lot of white dots on the pants after she tried it on. She thinks it might be because of poor material so the fiber is falling apart? We don’t know, but she doesn’t feel comfortable wearing it any more. I returned the pants."
3.0,The package says L/XL. Don't believe it. They are way too small.
3.0,Bought for a gift and was like any normal long sleeve t-shirt.
3.0,They served their purpose and seem to be sewn well.  Material is just okay.  There's also VERY little size difference between adult and children apron.
3.0,"This shirt looks cute on the model, but not as cute on a normal person. It is an odd shape - very wide and it's quite see through. I recommend wearing an undershirt. Cute shirt for lazing around in the summer, wouldn't wear it out. I got it in a deal and only paid a few dollars for it, I wouldn't buy it for full price."
3.0,"Shorts are a good length, but are so wide they look like parachute pants. They also wrinkle really quickly. Been trying to make them work, but I think they're a loss."
3.0,it was okay. not bad but nothing spectacular. wrinkles easy
3.0,"I am 5'9'' and was disappointed in how short this dress was.  It also did not come with a tag or anything and was really difficult to tell which side was the front or back.  Color and pattern were pretty.  Luckily I had a friend who was a little shorter than me and she looked great in it.  One present off the list.  lol.  Not bad for the price, but don't get it if you are tall and want it to hit your ankles."
3.0,Worked for what I needed them for. Few blemishes in the finishing I had to correct. Also had to use needle nose pliers to tighten the eye hook on several.
3.0,Gave it as a gift.. thought it might be a little bigger...
3.0,"Ok, Not very elastic at top, so tend to slide down"
3.0,Seams were already coming apart but you get what you pay for. Other than that it's really cute and fits well.
3.0,"I would only purchase these if you are buying them for children. I ordered them for a photo project, I just needed cliche teeth, but they are really small. They do not fit college teeth, I can tell you that. Maybe kindergarten teeth. I'd still recommend them for people with young kids."
3.0,"I was really excited when I ordered these earrings, they just looked so pretty and shiny and I loved the design. I couldn’t wait for them to arrive. Then the disappointment set in when I opened the package…ugh. They honestly look very dull and cheaply made. Hardly anything like the ad picture. They came in a plastic bag inside of a cheap cardboard box and that was in a small burlap bag. The cardboard box and plastic bag was literally just like what you would get at that store that begins with a W and ends in mart. My husband said if he had paid that kind of money to give these as a gift to me and this is what came and in the cheap packaging? He’d be so angry. So, moving right along…<br />There is no shine, no sparkle at all. I put one in just fine. When I put the other in I had just a bit of trouble getting the back on. I tried again and nothing. I took it out and the post was bent! Hardly any pressure, just from trying to put the back on and the post bent, not good. I easily bent it back in place but at this point I thought it was going to break off. I finally got it back in and all was good. They haven’t hurt my ears at all and I’ve worn them for 3 days.<br />It’s a nice design and they are not ugly; they are just very overpriced to me and not at all what you think you’re getting."
3.0,"great buy, very sturdy and looks very well, would buy more if there was a bigger selection of colors and styles. I love hats."
3.0,"lens height, dimensions, too small"
3.0,"It's ok. The color is very pretty, but the back is boring and the front is jsut not very flattering."
3.0,Didn't care for the fit.
3.0,T-shirts are very thin material and run very small I ordered it to Rex and it feels like a large.
3.0,"The torso area is a little short, would buy a size up to avoid camel toe"
3.0,"You get pretty much what you pay for. It looks kinda cheap, it feels kinda cheap, but hey it is kinda cheap. Although its still pretty cute and I'm defiantly gonna wear it."
3.0,Good straps for the price not the best leather but not bad for what you pay they look good at least but shipping took longer than estimated my advice if you order these be patient if it doesn’t get to you on time I gave them an extra week past the two day late it said to wait and they arrived halfway through that week
3.0,"I assumed shoes would be black, as they look black and are named midnight.<br />They are actually a dark purple."
3.0,"you can fit alot ,but it did rip at the end of my trip"
3.0,Hat is ok.  Small and fits weird on my head.
3.0,Super nice material and well made. Unfortunately the sizing was completely off!! Like daughter couldn't even get over shoulders.
3.0,Smaller than I thought. And it does take 2 people to put ashes into it
3.0,"Cheap, thin costume hat. No more, no less. Too big for my head though, so I’ll be returning."
3.0,"Dress is cute, flowers are pretty along the bottom.  the fabric is thin and has a slick feel to it.  I am small chested and felt it was bit big at top so am returning it."
3.0,The underwire was very uncomfortable 😣
3.0,Not American.  Long enough and I’m tall but runs about a size smaller than normal
3.0,You may need to wear something underneath this sweater to not worry about flashing everyone when it gaps in the Brest area
3.0,"Just remember the models are meant to make this product look sleek and stylish, but ultimately I felt I looked a little frumpy in this.  I'm 5'3&#34; and 150 pounds (so admittedly a little chubby).  I got this hoping it would cover up some undesirable areas which it did, but it almost added pounds because of its loose fit."
3.0,"It has a PINK plastic-like lining. Awful! Other than the lining, not bad. It is longer than I like but I am short (5""2, 145lbs). I got a medium. It hit right above my knees. Shoulders were a little tight.  I'd size up 1 or 2 sizes if you can handle the pink lining."
3.0,Was really cute fit great but only lasted for about two weeks and the stone fell out
3.0,I bought this with perhaps the wrong expectations of the fabric. It’s high maintenance to get presentable for wearing and that’s just not me. I like to be able to wash and wear.
3.0,This swimsuit was very cute but runs extremely small order up at least 2 sizes
3.0,Something came break
3.0,They are pretty but not very masculine and gig.
3.0,Appears to do what I want but materials are not as quality as I thought they would be. Same as Walmart type wallets.
3.0,"This dress is as pretty in person as it is in the picture but it was not fitted as expected. It’s loose and not flattering on me. I don’t know if it’s where the dress has pockets so it makes it kind of wider fitting or if it’s just made that way. I’m exchanging for a smaller size to see if that helps. if not, then I would prefer a dress without pockets."
3.0,I got this helmet to use it with my electric scooter... it is definitely too big for a scooter user and I had to return it. it is very comfy and protective otherwise
3.0,"The purse was a little bit small and the straps didn't quite lay right, so it went back.  It is genuine leather supposedly so that is nice and I really liked the pockets on the outside.  The metal is actually gold in the pics and was the reason it went back.  The gold gave the purse an &#34;older&#34; look"
3.0,The baby girl dress was so huge it’s almost a year after purchase and it’s too big for my daughter. I had to have the bottom cut and hemmed to have a dress look instead of the snap and the big girl dress looked perfect in front but the entire back is out
3.0,"I thought I was going to get the super dark locs that you'd find in a liquor store.  These were not as dark and they should have been, and the shape was a bit different than what i was expecting."
3.0,"I was hoping it would be floppy off the back like in the picture, but it just sits right on my head.<br />Maybe my head is too big?<br />Good hat for the price, but not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,"These leggings aren’t super comfortable, but they look decent. Better than Walmart leggings but not as good as name brand ones, like gymshark! Not squat proof! I might buy another pair in another size."
3.0,The robe is beautiful. I love the colors. The problem is that there is only one tie on the inside of the right side of the robe. There in it a tie on the inside of the left side. I did receive the sash to tie around me on the outside. But no way to tie the inside.
3.0,"This dress is cute. Except the belted area. There is not enough of the wide fabric where the belt ties to completely cover the front, as shown in the picture. So, I would say it runs small. I think I much prefer the unbelted dress in the same fabric."
3.0,"It's ok, I'll have to see how it holds up. I'm disappointed at how many loose threads it came with, and that there are no neck sizing markings on the adjustment area."
3.0,I wear a medium to large and ordered a  XL. It's to short for a dress. Maybe a bathing suite coverup but not a dress.
3.0,Too small for a 10 year old but he loves them lol
3.0,The size 8 is more like a 10. They're cute but too big.
3.0,Nice top but thought it would be a little longer
3.0,For a men’s medium shirt it’s very tight
3.0,Over time band becomes very shiny. That being said it has lasted longer than any band I've had.  Including the original Samsung band the watch came with.
3.0,Does not maintain the proper adjustment. Always loose.
3.0,Item returned. Much smaller than expected
3.0,"Mixed feelings on this product, the class does not stay closed. The price was adequate."
3.0,cheap ass gold watch. I should have just gotten a decent GOOD watch.
3.0,5‘2 115<br />Thin material and tight and loose in the wrong places. Tight around thighs and lose around the back. And a little too long on me. Ordered a size S
3.0,I use it when hubby not home to help me
3.0,"These are a little too small in the front.  I wish they were about 2 inches longer in the crotch because these are too tight in a region you dont want to draw attention too.  I will probably just keep them and use them in the house only.  Maybe they will stretch but for now, be warned, if you are tall, long waisted with a booty, these will be too tight in the front."
3.0,"Love this bag and I actually get quite a few compliments on it, even though it isn't flashy at all.  However,  after a couple months the velcro just inside the outer flap started tearing the inner material to pieces.  I just make sure not to show off my ghetto-fix until I'm ready for a new one."
3.0,"Suit itself is super cute. Love the bright colors, no surprises because the pictures explain it well. Couldn't really say fits as expected because if you're large busted the top doesn't fit well. Comes with padding, which is easy to take out. Needed to take it out because it wouldn't fit otherwise. There's no support for the breasts, so have to tie the halter super tight to keep them supported. This leads to uncomfortable fit."
3.0,Bought for my 5 year old grandson. It barely fits on his head.
3.0,Too tight across the bust
3.0,too big but beautiful
3.0,Was cute but the stitching at the beck was bad and overstitched with lots of strands!
3.0,"I followed the instructions and got a few bubbles. I bought another one, it was better but still had a bubble. I would not buy it again."
3.0,"Comfortable, warm and fuzzy but I was sent the wrong colors. Instead of the confetti pattern, I received Christmas designs."
3.0,"The sewing job along the seem of the scarf was pretty sloppy in places - I felt too embarrassed to give the scarf as a gift. However, if it's just for yourself, it is worth it."
3.0,Están lindas pero la suela se le sale por en sima
3.0,Beautiful outfit but way too small in size.
3.0,"Love the badge, the clip is pretty sturdy. I really like the face and quality of the badge itself. No complaints on that. It's beautiful. The mechanism is also excellent as far as being retractable and durable for being used a lot every single day for my hospital work. However, the little twist mechanism that holds the cord never seems to retract back to the correct placement easily and I fiddle with it."
3.0,It is stiff and gets REALLY dirty quickly.
3.0,I gave these bras three stars because they fit and our great quality material look super cute and feel amazing they just don't give you any lift or support and for me that's what I'm looking for in a bra! Added bonuses are the straps come off so you can put them anyway you would like and they are comfortable with a thick back strap! Just not enough support for me
3.0,"Super cute joggers! Thin, super soft material...kiddo loves them! However, sizing is inconsistent. Ordered 3 more pairs after receiving the first. All 4 are marked M (8-10) but are different sizes. All are bigger than the first pair received, one pair at least an entire size. Washed them before checking and now I can't return. Would recommend as comfy lounge wear or pj's but make sure you check the size you receive first."
3.0,"I returned these after wearing them for 15 minutes. I'm used to strange fabrics because I buy a lot of technical clothing (quick dry or UV or swim) but this fabric was slightly itchy. The pants are darn cute and the workmanship is first class. The cut is almost the perfect capri. I loved where the hem hit. They fit around the hips but gaped at the waist. Then at the 15 minute mark, when the fabric warmed up those pants loosened up and stretched at the hip. I was just standing in my living room and the pants slid south. So if you want to try these, size down. I would love these in a different fabric."
3.0,Would be really cute if you order it 2 sizes smaller than normal
3.0,Ripped at the neck the first time daughter played with it and paint peeled off as well. Has a nice smell though
3.0,"Style is cute but so huge! The body is extremely big in a way that you need to have an over-over-overweight child to be able to fit well, even if I got the right size."
3.0,The skirt’s hook is missing and it is unable to tie. The cloth material is good.
3.0,"I’m 5.5, 135 pounds and medium was to big."
3.0,Very pretty for a much shorter person. I’m 5’11” the fringe stopped awkwardly at my crotch. Sent it back.
3.0,Loved how they looked but couldn't stand up in them all day as a teacher.  Too high of a platform for me.
3.0,"Very reasonably priced & I like the colors.  The only criticism would be in the back, the lining around the opening pops out when you put it on....not a problem if you've got someone around to tuck it back in but it hard to reach that V behind your back if you're alone."
3.0,I think they are made for Chinese heads.  A Bit tight.
3.0,"They're alright, not super pretty. Definitely not Jade, looks like maybe crushed Jade pieces mixed with mostly acrylic resin"
3.0,"For the price the price the purse is wonderful, just hated the tassel kept unraveling. Kept trying to super glue it to stay in place but had no success."
3.0,The t-shirt itself and the image are fairly low quality.
3.0,Product arrived quickly however this boot is cut short and wasn't to my liking.  Returned.
3.0,Too small that I expected
3.0,The straps for the leg wraps to attach could be made better. Also could be made a littler thicker. But overall it works for the money
3.0,it's a bit flimsy
3.0,"Like the top, however the material isn’t that great of quality and it’s very thin material as well."
3.0,Does not fit great due to the way the shirt is made.
3.0,"Wish the sweater was a little more baggy and roomy, but I'll still wear it. Wasn't a big fan of the slim fit design."
3.0,Wal-Mart quality or less.
3.0,Fit above ankle is comfortable no constricting.  Material is a little skimpy compared to other argyle socks
3.0,very little elasticity so I cannot pull them up high enough. I love how comfortable they are so this is a big disappointment.
3.0,It was cute my daughter loved it but it definitely fit more like a shirt then a dress. Still cute though!
3.0,"I do not like that the picture in the add is not the actual dress you get. The cut is slightly different and so is the material. It is still a cute dress, so I might keep it, but I do not like things being misrepresented. Actual dress not as “flowy.”"
3.0,The jacket is nice cut and style but I ordered a size up large and it was still to small. I gave it to my daughter and she loved it. But I ordered another one the next day another size bigger. Let’s see how this one fits.
3.0,Was to short for my husband to use. The snaps kept coming off his shirt as soon as he started walking. Sadly there was no snap on the bottom peace to clip to socks. As it was in the instructions.
3.0,"The bag is suede not leather, one of my co workers reminded me suede is a form of leather. Its a lovely color. It appears to be shedding on the inside, not sure. Only time will tell"
3.0,Faded quickly and also pilled. Not really happy.
3.0,Really nice swimsuit. I unfortunately won't be able to wear it with out it giving me a muffin top look since the bottoms were a little snug on me But the product itself is well made! I would recommend doing a size up! (For reference I'm 5'3 120lbs)
3.0,Feels great! But I had to wear it just as a sweater. Not a dress
3.0,"It is a nice material, but it is small. I wear a 4 usually and got a large, and it is still really short and tight. I'm 5'5&#34;, 125 pounds and it barely covers my butt. Would be cute if you were shorter and tiny."
3.0,"The zipper is constantly sticking, and popping open from the bottom. I purposely got a larger size but the zipper seems cheap"
3.0,"The dress was nice, especially the color. But it was too small. There was a zipper in the back and I did not realize when I purchased the dress the zipper was there. I don't like zippers.  And zippers do not like me. So I returned it"
3.0,They are very small which is ok but the clasp is very hard to open.  I’ve only worn one pair if the others are equally hard I may return them but do like them.
3.0,Comfy dress but zipper scrunches in the back. Not good for figure 8s
3.0,They look pretty cool but it also looks cheap made
3.0,The backs where bent when they came in but she was happy with them
3.0,I’m not sure that it is 100% cotton because after taking a shower it’s almost like putting on a cold bathrobe it does not absorb as I expected
3.0,Nice sunglasses but they didn't fit my 7 year old great grandson
3.0,Pretty earrings.  Look like diamond hoops.  Can’t wear them for long because the posts are so thick (see pics).
3.0,"Was disappointed in the lettering on it, sort of cheap looking"
3.0,"Nice shirt but, too small.  I wear a large and they are too tight."
3.0,They fit nice but you can see through them. Didn't realize this until I was out shopping and my daughter noticed the color panties I had on... Embarrassing! Can't wear them in public.
3.0,"Color as expected, length was okay. but I found the L to be a little bit snug. I usually wear a US12. The pockets also stick out a little more than I would like, so it just didn’t find it flattering on my particularly body type."
3.0,"Cute top, but i wish I had ordered a size bigger. It fit a little snug under the arms and chest area (am 40C)...but i managed to still use it for our Dells trip. In the process of losing more weight, so I am anticipating it will fit me better next time. The bottom of the shirt is nice, because it's a little flowy and does not cling to your tummy too much...unless you get wet...but I just pull it off my skin after getting wet and it was fine. The straps are adjustable as well. The bottoms that came with it fit fine. The coverage on the butt was good...no wedgies until I hit the waterslide! LOL...All in all...great suit for the price."
3.0,These earings are very cute but are very heavy and weren't able to stay up straight in my ears. They might be better if they had a more supportive backing.
3.0,"It's a nice top. I gave it to my mom, fits her perfectly. I'm on the small side and didn't anticipate it being cut larger. Very cute though. Feels lovely."
3.0,"The one on the bottom was missing the latch. Not going to return as it is more of an inconvenience,  than to just fix it myself.  I have these lobster claw latches. They are as pictured, just a tad disappointed that one was missnga key component."
3.0,"Looks good, but for a taller person, was a little short."
3.0,Love a lot this necklace but it stings I can't wear it for a long time
3.0,"This skirt is very pretty, but it is no way a one-size fits all! I was excited to get this skirt for a recent trip, but there is no way this is going to fit me. It has a pleated front with an elastic back. It does allow for some size variance, but not nearly enough to be classified as one size fits all! It is long, it would probably come down to just about my knees.<br />It is made very well. The material is soft and smooth and not easily snagged. It has tulle underneath so that it gives the look of it floating away from the body which is flattering for everyone. The design is timeless. It has a beautiful cherry blossom design set against a black background. It would be very easy to match this skirt to a variety of shirts and shoes.<br />Overall, I am disappointed in the sizing of the skirt. If it would have fit as portrayed, it would easily of been a 5 star review. But now, it will not ever get worn by me! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,It was a bit small for me but other then pretty necklace.
3.0,"way too short in front ,  too large and long in the back, returned it"
3.0,The watch was a little too manly for me. I have a small wrist so this was a little overwhelming and not very feminine.
3.0,"I do not like the material, must be 100% shiny spandex. I like the softer material so returned them"
3.0,"I love this dress but am a littke disappointed with how thin it is. I expected it to be thin however for a lady who enjoys wearing nothing under her cotton maxis, its is impossible with this dress (unless one doesnt care about modesty)."
3.0,Dress fabric feels nice.  I got the white and it is somewhat see-thru.  The dress had some dirty smudges on it.
3.0,Like the product but not what i want
3.0,"Good looking watch, but the latch is impossible.  Once the latch is closed you can't get it opened. I don't see many other complaints on the review list. Must just be my bad luck."
3.0,"Good material but it looks like a robe when it's on, its saving grace is its cute as a kimono if you un button it with a cute top with jeans"
3.0,Don’t quite fit my foot. I am a size 10. Just kinda “meh” product.
3.0,"This is a pretty bra but it felt a bit uncomfortable. It was too tight to be worn all day. I was very aware of the bra the whole day. It might be good for an evening out, date, but not for every day wear."
3.0,"I love the product, just upset I can't get a hold of anyone to find out why, my order was placed 3 times and I was charged for it twice, while only receiving one sweatshirt."
3.0,"very cheaply made, but it wasn't expensive so can't complain too much"
3.0,"I just ordered these because I thought they looked good. Indeed, they do. However, the measurements are incorrect. I ordered 0, the box is labeled 0, but they are more like size 2. So, I am worried that they will just slip out and get lost. I recommend going a size up."
3.0,Very cute but not sturdy. I’m not sure how long it will last. I will enjoy it until the inevitable happens.
3.0,Cute but it's not long like the description or picture. I bought it for the length so I had to send it back
3.0,"This dress was on clearance at Macy’s for half off. Don’t pay retail or anything over $40.<br /><br />While this dress is really cute and made with thick, high quality fabric , it’s not for the flat chested, it’s not a maxi on anyone with long legs, and the shoulder straps constantly fall off.<br />Fit- I am anywhere from a 4 to a 6 in Free People, and I am 5’8 and a 34D. I am always a 6 in anything with a zipper or non stretch, but I bought a size 4 because the 6 was sold out.<br /><br />This dress has a hidden zipper that goes to lower back, and it’s a little tight on me. It is also backless and the bust lacks any kind of support, so you WILL need a backless bra for support, and if you don’t have a perky chest, or you have a flat chest, pass on this dress. The shoulder straps are huge! So without your bust filling this, you’ll be flashing people all day.<br />Cons.<br />Shoulder straps are too long- The shoulder straps are a common complaint about this dress on Macys reviews, and it is 100% accurate. I have a long torso, and these straps still routinely fall off my shoulders through out the day. If you have a smaller bust, this potentially means flashing people.<br />Bust- I am a 34D, so average size, and my chest fills this dress. The bust has a thick piece of fabric underneath that makes it a gathered empire bust. It’s flattering for a larger bust, as long as they are perky. If not, you’re going to want to pass on this dress. On the flip side, if you have a small chest, because it’s gathered, it will look baggy or empty in the chest.<br />Length- I am 5’8. On me, this reaches my calves. It is not a maxi, it is a midi, and it’s an odd length.<br />Pros<br />Fabric- the fabric is thick and high quality.<br />Cute- it’s a cute dress, and I like the print"
3.0,a little snug on her.  made my wife's muffin top extremely protruding due to the high waistline.
3.0,Pictured it looks like a tunic but it's not really that long. It's a pretty pattern but I was just disappointed that it was more blousy than tunic-y.
3.0,"They weren't the greatest fit.  They ran big around the lower belly crouch area, it is baggy across the front."
3.0,The arm just broke right off in less than 3 months!
3.0,It's good just heavy to walk around.
3.0,"I ordered an XL.  While I do have a very long torso, and this shirt was far too short and didn't meet my waist, I gave it to a friend that usually wears a men's Medium, as he's a Cyberpunk fan, and he said it fit perfectly.  I initially washed it on cold, and did not wear it for more than a minute until it obviously did not fit me.  Pretty bummed that the cut is so short.<br /><br />The overall quality is nice.  Stitching is nice with no excess thread or marred lines.  A CDPR tag is patched on the outside of the lower front side of the shirt, and the silkscreen is thick, but pliable.  Overall, a nice shirt, but cut for a short torso."
3.0,"I bought these for Halloween. They do not look like picture, no seam design. Very very thin. Not hemmed. Almost like cheese cloth. Disappointing."
3.0,This onesie was for my 9 year old daughter. We knew it would probably be too large for her but there was no girl size available and she really wanted it.
3.0,They would be cute if they're so tiny. I can barely see what they are.
3.0,Very pretty but size runs a little large.
3.0,Scarf I received looked nothing like picture. Very flimsy fabric and print job. Picture looks knitted and actual scarf is blurry print on very thin fabric.
3.0,Cousin Eddie was an average sized looking man. This dickie was NOT made for a man. Maybe a child could wear it or a very small female. Also it does not cover the chest like Cousin Eddie in movie.<br /><br />Summary:  buy a cheap black turtleneck and cut it to size. Stay away from this product.
3.0,Sleeves way too large
3.0,Loved the necklace. Gorgeous on! But make sure to secure all of the loops holding it together; it arrived with several clasps loose and several clasps came apart the first night I tried to wear it.
3.0,❤️👍🏼
3.0,I wore it to my son's wedding reception but it wasn't the best quality.
3.0,"The shirt quality is very nice, however the lettering will not stand the test of time. They seem to be ironed or some similar adhesive. I have washed it twice, inside out and the edges of the lettering are beginning to lift already:0("
3.0,Could not give it a better review because of the quality of the tassel attached to the necklace; it was cheap and the threads where already coming out of the tassel when I received it; very disappointing!
3.0,This shirt has the biggest collar I done ever seen. The cuffs are just as big to match. Like holy heck. Kind of weird. Fits as expected. Good quality material.
3.0,I hate returning stuff. Glad I only bought one. Other than running a little small it seems ok
3.0,Hard to put on and heavy
3.0,These earrings are great for babies because they are so small.
3.0,"Sadly need to return because although the material is comfortable and they are a true black, they are see through 😪"
3.0,I am 5'6 ...size M and this dress is way too long.  I have to hold it up when I walk.  Meh.
3.0,"Dress is cheap quality, fits larger than the size I purchased. I ordered a 4 and it's way to big. Can't get the corset tight enough. It's not long enough to the ground.<br />It's a great style, but definitely not a quality dress.<br />I was unable to return this item, and am definitely not happy about it, the company won't answer back any of my messages."
3.0,Cool concept.  The glow part is nice.  However the shirt arrived folded with permanent creases on the design.  Even after running an iron across the back the creases are still unsightly.
3.0,I like these pants but I don’t think they’ll last long. I got them bc I’m pregnant and I wanted to get ski pants that gave a little for my growing bump. I got an XXL (thinking thered be plenty of space) and they fit more like an L. The pocket zippers also broke the first time I wore the pants. You get what you pay for! Hopefully I can ride them out until winter is over.
3.0,"This is a pretty gown but the measurements of the actual gown do not match with what is stated. My measurements are actually smaller than what is stated and the dress is still too small. I returned it. It is a pretty dress and if it would fit you, it is quite different in design and style and you would get compliments. Order at least one size up."
3.0,"Okay here's the thing with this bracelet. I wear it pretty much every day and for a week it was fine, then it started tarnishing. The charms didn't tarnish, just the chain. I make a lot of my own jewelry so I had some extra bracelet chains lying around that I replaced it with,  but it was a hassle and kind of inconvenient. That being said, I love the charms on thr bracelet. They are all well detailed and they look really great. I just wish I didnt have to replace the chain but then again it was pretty cheap so I'm not that upset"
3.0,"Seems like good quality. I bought it to go with the lightly lined floral bra by same company. Unfortunately, they did not match at all and they were also way too low in the back (not in a good way!)  Otherwise they are true to size."
3.0,"I can't totally hate on it, I kept it, but I cut the top part off and have been using the bottoms as a high waisted bottom. So it half-worked out. It was just too short (common issue for me)."
3.0,Great color but the material is a little shiny. Will get it altered and change the button to give it a more tailored look.
3.0,Cute and a lot of card space but flimsy and easily broken
3.0,"I will have to send the shirt back it’s too large at chest and waist.  I wear an extra small from US, I was told that I had to order two sizes up because the shirt was made in China.  The quality of the material wasn’t bad but the shirt is too large.  I will be returning the shirt."
3.0,I ordered to wear to work but it is way too small in the bust and I missed the return deadline since I had an accident requiring surgery. I won't order again
3.0,"literally smells so bad, i had to wash it 5 times with 3 tide pods and a bunch of other stuff in each wash PLUS fabric spray and it still barely got out lol but cute jacket once it’s out. runs small btw"
3.0,"I was so in love with this ring when I received it in the mail.  It is so cute and dainty and I got tons of compliments.  So I wore it every day and after about a week, the rose gold faded and the CZ stones started to fall out.  I have lost 3 stones already and the ring is no longer rose gold.  I wish the quality was better because I absolutely love this ring.  I will be looking for another one just like this one that is better quality- I am willing to pay more for one that I can actually wear on a daily basis."
3.0,"They are comfortable, soft, and warm but they are not what I expected, I thought they would fit like regular leggings and they dnt."
3.0,Hopefully the smells goes away soon - very much like rubber tires.  It is a nicely sewn bag though.
3.0,The sizing is wrong. The arms and back are really tight and too small. I'm 5'8 130 with 28 waist and ordered Small. The arms and back were way too tight but waist and everything else fit correctly. I then ordered a medium and arms and back still a little tight and waist area and rest of jacket is too big. The jacket is really nice and well made other than the arm and back sizing issue.
3.0,"Love pattern, cut and style of this dress but the material feels and looks cheap. Makes a crinkly sound when you move. Unfortunately I will be returning."
3.0,The quality is meh. It will work for a one season use. Don’t expect it to be a hand me down. The sizing is crazy small. The 2-3yr soze that I bought for my child that fits in 2t almost 3t clothing looks like a 12 month size swimsuit.<br />The design is as pictured and my little girl loves it. Too bad it doesn’t fit.
3.0,They seem somewhat thin under toe area..too soon to tell how they will hold up.
3.0,"Dislike the black bow, too “little house on the prairie”. I removed it from mine and added snaps to the sides so I can put the brim up... similar to a cowboy hat.<br />Like the sturdiness of the weave"
3.0,"I followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered up a size. (Usually I am a size XS or S.) I wish I had gone up two! This is SO small. However, it is a nice sports bra. Wore it on my run today, and it was great. Also, it is well-constructed and the fabric is pretty. Just wish it ran true to size!"
3.0,"Supposed to be one black pair, one navy pair, and one gray pair. I received one black pair and two gray pairs."
3.0,The dress was way too big and does<br />Nothing for your figure
3.0,"Fitbit stays in great!  Band leather holders too loose to hold, one of the screws came undone, after 2 weeks"
3.0,overall looks ok but too small. im normally a large so i orederd a xl but could not get pants past my knees or shirt over my shoulder without hulking thru it
3.0,"Based on the reviews got a size S for my 10 year old, 1.45m daughter. Turns out it wasn't long enough, I wanted it to the ankles. The quality is fine and it is not itchy."
3.0,I did not give 3 stars because they were bad at all. You get what you pay for. 10 tie clips with varying designs for like 9 bucks. They are decent and do the job. As far as stylish....I would go with something more expensive. There is nothing wrong its a great deal for what you pay for it. They are okay.
3.0,"Broke in 3 days. Cheap spring. I'll adjust to 3 stars given the receptive return policy, but I still don't believe the buckle is very well-built. Cool? Sure. But well-built? Very questionable."
3.0,Not too bad!!! Cute and adjustable...a little lighter than picture.
3.0,Scratchy not typical mud pie softness..  Fits perfect for 16lb baby
3.0,Ran a little small. Cheap material also.
3.0,it will serve the purpose but not exactly a great looking ear ring.  dosn't stay on to good unless you pinch your ear.
3.0,"Super thin, top area a bit fitted more than I would like (40D). Fits ok everywhere else.Cant wear it for what I wanted but will keep it. Nice cover up to run to lunch from the pool or beach while on vacation. Im sure it will dry quickly. Really comfy for summer errand/relaxing."
3.0,"I always get an &#34;angel&#34; for my daughters for Christmas and this looked like the perfect gift. The problem is not the necklace itself but the presentation. It is in a cheap little box with no notes of Swarovski crystal and box chain, etc. If I would present this as is, it looks like a dollar store special. Unfortunately, I need to keep looking for this years angel."
3.0,"It is a very difficult to attach the link to the watch, and it scratches very easily. Overall its okay. - my order was missing a connector."
3.0,"Sent these earrings back, as they look cheap & too long for me!!"
3.0,"The hat was of great quality and had a nice size brim for sun protection.  However, found that it was a little smaller than expected.  Although one size fits all, found that it was more of a ""medium"" size.  Unfortunately, had to send it back"
3.0,Super cute and loud but if the child doesn't wake up or at least hit snooze it doesn't go off again. Overall a good first alarm clock
3.0,They were too small for my son
3.0,"Is cute and right size for my kids, but not good quality and I dont have time to return it since I need it for school"
3.0,"I am a fairly short person, a little over 5ft tall with short legs, and this sadly barely comes to my ankles. It’s cute and flowy, but looks like it shrunk in the dryer and I haven’t even washed it yet."
3.0,It’s cute but the sizes run really small.
3.0,I ordered the set of 2T Kahkis and Blue pants. They were very reduced in size around the waist with little stretch. They fit more like 18 month pants.. I will say they are constructed well and length in the legs is accurate. I will be returning them because my son will probably outgrow them by the end of the week.
3.0,wasnt as long as I hoped
3.0,Soft but clingy on my muffin top.  Pretty brown color.  Length just right for me at 5ft 6.  Too small in my size.
3.0,"I did not buy these on Amazon but wanted to add that these are lightweight and easy to carry. However, that is where the benefit ends. With sandals, my test is how easy it is to put these on in the dark and these are not that easy. The simple webbing straps collapse flat. So everything from your toe, mid-foot, and heel needs to be sorted to put these on."
3.0,I love the sword. This is an adorable keychain. The only complaint I have is that the sword come out of the sheath too easily. I won't be able to use the keychain for fear of loosing the sword. I am going to have to make shift something to keep the pieces together. Perhaps a mini leash or something.
3.0,It ok wish it was bigger
3.0,I returned the dress because it was not flattering at all for my body. The quality of the material is not the greatest and is a bit stiff causing the dress to fluff out creating a weird silhouette.
3.0,"it's made okay,  but if you got a big head,  forget it,  will not work for you, tiny people only."
3.0,Recommend face paint mask bulky and doesn't breathe
3.0,The gloves are small with not fit an adult mans hands
3.0,they are really cute but they are way bigger than what i expected. i receive plenty compliments on them i just need to get use to how big they are.
3.0,"I wear a size 32 waist.  These were just too small.  The return process is easy and efficient, however."
3.0,"Material, color and style are great. I ordered a Med however it was way too small. I would purchase this again but would go up a size."
3.0,"Really cute shirt but small, I would size up"
3.0,I would love these if they were larger from the wrist.
3.0,"The size is too small, make sure you order a bigger size."
3.0,Larger than what i expected. Strong material. Will order a smaller size next time.
3.0,Seems like a good bra quality wise but simply does not fit. It really is too small in both cups and back size.
3.0,The color is very pretty but I did not like the cut of this AT ALL.  The seams in the bustline were almost embarrassing.  Would not buy this particular one again.
3.0,"I ordered these for my grandson's birthday.  He loved them and they fit great.  We charged them when we received them and he was able to wear them one day.  Now they will not recharge.  This seems to be the same problem from a lot of other customers.  I wasn't expecting them to last long, but thought I would get more than one day out of them."
3.0,"They are just a little small, even though when you get it lined up just right you can really see what you are looking at."
3.0,Size chart doesn't specify men or women's size.  So way to big for a women so gave away. Won't buy again
3.0,"Was a very nice product but, I noticed when I first put it on the clasp was loose. Thus. I was only able to enjoy it for a few hours. It apparently fell off and I didn't realize it..."
3.0,Looks much better on the picture.
3.0,"This is really tight, on my skinny calves, so women who don't have skinny calves may have a problem using this.  Also, one came with buttons, the other one was missing them.  Sure enough, I can find buttons to sew on it, but that seems to me a basic quality failing.  However, the price is nice on this, and they are cute, so I'll give 3 out of 5 stars."
3.0,I would still purchase again because they photograph well and look cute. Not the softest and the top is a bit eh. Could be a touch longer and definitely softer.
3.0,Pretty. Only lasted a day.
3.0,"The word TEAM is sewn into the neck! Quite embarrassing when this was planned as a gift. The leggings are cute! They do seem a little large for 24 mo, oh well, better than too small."
3.0,"This sweater is super cute. I was expecting to be able to wear it off the shoulder, but the neckline is too small. The sleeves are oversized and large, which is super cute. I am still going to keep it because I will definitely still wear it. Just not 100% considered oversized and I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I usually wear."
3.0,"The elastic is tight, which makes it uncomfortable."
3.0,"Use as an undergarment.  A little small.  Acording to the sizing chart, I was concerned it might be a little to large.  I can live with it!"
3.0,"never did get all of the hoops, I tried and finally gave up."
3.0,Shirt is soft and true to size. I am a little disappointed in the colors and images. It looks faded and out of focus.
3.0,Should not picture 3 bags when you only receive 1 bag..... extremely deceptive 🤯
3.0,Nice looking but it fit like a tent. Buy one to two sizes smaller than you would normally and it will fit
3.0,The material is soft and the quality was good.  It just looked like a bath robe.<br />We purchased the shorter one which looked so much better.  Thank you Amazon for the quick and easy return process..
3.0,"Although the fabric is tough enough to prevent bites and scratches, even the smallest size was much to large to be useful"
3.0,seems kinda small for the size ordered
3.0,"It is just ok. The quality isn’t as good as I expected. It is very thin and delicate. It just doesn’t appear to have the same shape as the picture. I wear it with yoga pants, but I wouldn’t buy it again."
3.0,fit too large in the chest area.  But other than that it was so pretty.
3.0,This item was too large for my wrist and the brushed silver color did not quite look right with the silver aluminum body on my apple watch 3.
3.0,The shirt is soft and comfortable I ordered a size up due to some of the comments but I would just order normal size next time. Unfortunately the words on the front crack after 1 time wearing the shirt.
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because it's not as then as description said and it's more for a man than a woman
3.0,"Need to order larger size , cut runs small.  Pockets set in a weird angle and way too small to put ones hand in."
3.0,"Super cute and flattering, thicker material so it hugs all the right places. It’s just a little constricting  on the tum when I sit so it makes it hard to wear too many places. So I would definitely recommend sizing up… if they have your size"
3.0,When I received these the little plastic box had broke open in the Amazon bag so all the plugs were just loose in there. One was missing a pair which I later found stuffed up inside the Amazon packing bag (I had almost thrown it away)! Also the black wood pain is just a cheaper wood that is painted and on mine small areas of paint were chipped off and I bought this set specifically for the wood plugs. Disappointed.
3.0,"These socks are a beautiful color.  However, they are not stretchy and seem tight at the top where the yarn is carried from one spot to another."
3.0,"really nice watch for the price, did look a little tarnished when arrived but I wiped it up and looks great."
3.0,"I bought a bigger size than I normally would, just to make sure it would fit well. It didn't. It's elastic yes, so it stretches, but it stretches tautly. Like you're just cinching a zip-tie around your waist. it doesn't fit right."
3.0,"The spinner sticks, but I liked the ring"
3.0,"Looks like the pic, too large"
3.0,"Purchased for my Wife to wear in the Office. Fabric is thin and not soft. It's a good value sweater, not expensive if you know what to expect. Looks great on her, Customers compliment her when she wears it."
3.0,"I bought this in large to wear to my SiL's wedding next month. I have a large chest (36F), so the Large size was a little too small, but it was really cute. I purchased the XL thinking it would be perfect. When I got he extra large, it was a whole different cardigan pattern. Definitely not a bolero."
3.0,My 5 year old is very tall and wears a 10/12. I bought the 12/14 and it was hard to get over her shoulders. Will not fit very long.
3.0,"I bought this to make a Mother's Day present. The quality of the necklace and charms is good, and this comes with a download link for the photo resizing software. However, the actual process isn't intuitive and the instructions don't help. I went to the manufacturer website and looked through their tutorials, but none of them specifically applied to this product, other than saying to &#34;Use the Seal-Itz.&#34; Uh, if I could figure out how to do that looking at it, I would have done it already. I think the problem is that the Seal-Itz did not easily come off its backing paper, and comes in one big sheet instead of the sizes that you would need for each charm. I managed to use them, but I think it was a messy job, and I had sticky fingers and frustration. I'm happy with the finished product, but wouldn't do it again. I was able to fit one square and two circles into the pendant. Though it was frustrating, it wasn't impossible. It might be harder for someone with bigger fingers.<br /><br />I don't have a printer at home, so I used the resizing software to make 8mm circles and squares, saved the PDF that it made, opened that PDF in Photoshop and created a JPG from that to send to CVS for printing. A tip that came in handy - even though I only needed three pictures, I printed as many as would fit on one 4x6 photo print. That way if I messed up, I could try again right away.<br /><br />My mom-in-law loved the gift, though, which is good!"
3.0,yes I would like  another pair for  50 %off and give this to a friend.
3.0,"My son loved these shoes, but they tore up on the second day he wore them to school on the play ground. I understand kids play rough sometimes but the elastic part just came loose; he has several pair of shoes similar in style but this has never happened. Cute shoes, but the quality isn't there...I don't think I paid that much, so you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"I liked the design and the material/fabric, but the sleeves were a little tight.  This is suppose to be a sweater coat and the sleeves were tight.<br />It's not comfortable to wear.  I won't return it because it's hard to find this exact stype and material.  I can still wear it if I wear short sleeves tees or<br />sleeveless tops."
3.0,"I purchased according to their sizing chart but when I received it, one of my coworkers had purchased another one and I no longer needed this one. When I went to do my return, they charged my refund almost $7 to ship it back. I have accounts with UPS that would have made it much less for me to ship it back so i would have at least liked the option to use my own accounts if i have to pay for it anyways."
3.0,A bit disappointed with this.  It has outside stitching and really couldn't tell that by the pictures.  Wish the seams were inside.
3.0,They are like leggings not what I thought I was getting .
3.0,Didn’t fit right!
3.0,Cutest jacket but zipper was broken.
3.0,A little long but  had it hemmed above the knee and looks great
3.0,The caddy is nice. The lids have tacky product branding I would rather do without. They work well and the adjustments to the courseness work ok. These replace an identical set that were defective; the collar where the grinder is held during grinding freely as it wasn't fixed to the internal plastic piece. We'll see if it happens with this set or not.
3.0,"These are nice sunglasses. That's all, just nice.<br />I broke my favorite pair of sunglasses a week before getting these. I usually buy inexpensive sunglass because I am pretty tough on them; active lifestyle. So if I break inexpensive sunglasses, I'm less likely to jave buyers remorse.<br />I needed high sun/glare protection for driving because my eyes dont recover from glare flashes as quickly as normal. So, when I found these, and read some rvws, I was hopeful.<br />My previous pair had amazing sun blocking; whereas these sunglasses are....average. (my prvs SG I never had to use my cars sun-visor, these SG- I do.)<br />As for the frame of these SG, very light weight; I barely feel them. This is very nice,  because after prolonged use- I have never gotten that ""top of the ear ache"". (If you've ever worn super cheap glasses, you know what I'm talking about).<br />The part that has me giving it 3 stars- is the downside to light frames. I am terrified that if pull them off to hard, they will just snap in half. The frame feels almost delicate. The longer I have them, I'm sure that fear will fade (especially once I feel I've gotten my monies worth.) But for now, I'm so worried I will break them, I'm ALMOST to scared to wear them.<br /><br />All that being said.... if you've never had that ""perfecr"" pair of sunglasses...or...if you're not worried about how delicate they feel, then you might be satisfied with these.<br />Overall they're pretty ok sunglasses."
3.0,The bottoms fit perfect. The top is a little wonky.  The center hole is not portioned right.
3.0,"I really like the look, but they do stick out a good amount when wearing heels. If you are looking for complete &#34;no shows&#34; then I wouldn't recommend. If you don't mind them peaking out a little then they are a great fit and great look."
3.0,"Cheaply made, visible flaws.  I got these to take with me on my cruise in Oct to the Bahamas... If I lose them I won't be disappointed.  At least one pair is lopsided/uneven.  My boyfriend who has a true pair of Aviators says these are heavier and tight on his face... His glasses are too big for my face so, I would assume these aren't for men because they fit me fine."
3.0,"Like another buyer who wrote a review, I ordered &#34;Floral 1&#34; and received &#34;Floral 2&#34;. It's not the end of the world, and at this price point, not worth the hour of time I would need to print a return label, box it back up, head to the post office, wait in line, and return the thing. Plus, there's no guarantee I'd get &#34;Floral 1&#34; if I re-ordered it. According to the seller's response to the first complaint, it's an issue on Amazon's end -- and let's face it - at this time of year they probably can't fix it. But the dress itself is cute. Comfy material like you'd find in a good t-shirt. There's a zipper inside the dress under the left arm that I can't figure out a purpose for for the life of me. The neckline plunges LOW -- so be careful. The fabric stretches to some degree (esp at the waist and bust), so based on your figure, you might want to order a size down; but since every figure is different, read the sizing details and order with caution."
3.0,returned as the pattern wasn't the same as it was in the pictures
3.0,pretty but super super small
3.0,Not bad but a little cheep feeling. Does the intended job. Looks good. Not expensive so I guess quality is commensurate.
3.0,much smaller than what showed on the picture. I'm a little confused why they are so tiny. why? why? why?
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:632feda17749388965f85bccd6dd557e]] I’m heartbroken, I opened the package about a week and a half ago  and immediately fell in love with the dress ! As I now pack for vacation I noticed it has 2 small holes on one of the sleeves !!! As I inspect the dress more carefully it looks like someone else had used it before ..the dress is beautiful and light material perfect for my vacation in Mexico except  it’s used and ripped . Otherwise this purchase would have been a 5 star"
3.0,Returned the product.. it didn't fitted properly..!
3.0,"If you are in the U.S and you intend to order medium, I would advice you to order Large instead. I ordered medium and it was too small for me, The seller was understanding."
3.0,Why is the bag small enough for a EWOK.
3.0,This top had potential - the cut is cute and flowery w a cute neckline. But..the fabric it’s very thin and definitely see-through for the white one the straps are not adjustable and that is kind of a dealbreaker because the under arms dig into my armpits because it needs to be lower and the airline where the elastic should be underneath the Breasts not across the middle of them returning
3.0,Crazy price!  Walmart carries the same ones for right at $10.  Just be careful.  They aren't the best quality this year.  The shirt gets shorter and wider every time you wash it.  Pants are thin.  Not the same quality as last years version.
3.0,"This dress was listed as a different ""color"" than another dress I bought previously - which I wanted because it had pockets. I was disappointed this one came with no pockets at all. It was a little big and some of the threads were hanging out."
3.0,If you have a small wrist they will run big
3.0,Just ok...not as shiny as I expected. I also think they sell &#34;seconds&#34; not quite perfect...stones not placed perfectly.  Was pricey and I expected better.  Also took forever...I have ordered things from out of the country...never took this long. Will prob not order again...
3.0,Really pretty color. I bought the burnt orange color in a Large. I’m 5’6 and it was so tight around my arms. Fit my waist and the rest of my body but I couldn't lift my arms up without feeling like I was going to rip the dress! Cute but returning it.
3.0,"Bracelette is super adorable however I have broken it twice now, I finally gave up. I was not expecting  much for what I paid for it and the fact that it lasted more then a day works for me."
3.0,"The band isn’t adjustable so it just slid around my arm all day, also the black cover made it hard for me to charge my watch so I ended up just taking it off."
3.0,"I bought this earring for my rook piercing.  The inner diameter of the crescent was too narrow and made my piercing swell up, so I had to take it out."
3.0,"They color is great. However, the silky tie for around the waist is not ideal. It comes untied with any activity. And having your child run to you to have it tied all day is not entertaining."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this outfit, it’s so adorable. But when I put it on my daughter it was too small! I was so upset!!"
3.0,"There is nothing to say badly about the appearance or quality of this necklace. The bird it self is detailed wonderfully, Its a nice heavy piece. The chain is nice and long as well and matches the color of the bird perfectly. Overall Im very pleased with my purchase, Well worth the price!<br />- Update 09/03/2015<br />I had the necklace for about 10 days abd the chain broke 😞"
3.0,"Bought these leather Reef sandals to replace another pair of leather Reef sandals I had owned for nearly 10 years.  Maybe it was the style of the new shoe, but this pair of Reefs isn't anywhere as comfortable as my old pair.  They look good, but  they're not comfy.  I bought a pair of black fabric ones with a cushy foam sole for bumming around instead."
3.0,Mala calidad y es más pequeño de la talla
3.0,"This watch is well made from high quality materials but utterly fails as a watch. It is almost impossible to read the time because the black thin hour and minute hands almost disappear within the black background. There is no illumination from the hands to read the time in a dark surrounding.<br />In short, this watch is no good and should be avoided - not bought!"
3.0,"Okay, on one hand this as a regular t shirt is super thick and good quality. On the other, It’s pretty big for being a size 8 (XL).  I figured since it was a cotton blend it might shrink a little anyways. Don’t order a size up and be dumb like me lol. It’s prettt true to size. Since I work as an admin on a construction site I’m not too worried about it being baggy. Giving it a three bc really, it’s just a thick t shirt with cuffed sleeves. Nothing fancy but it’s ok.. just doesn’t fit well and it’s a bit frumpy bc it’s the wrong size"
3.0,I ordered two necklaces in the same transaction to give as gifts. Product is as shown but I was not thrilled about getting two significantly different sized necklaces. The larger of the two necklaces had flaws in the metal on the backside of the mountain. The smaller one I got was perfect and exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,"I'm 5'3 115, this is way too small. Its like a kids bathing suit or a pre-teen. I wouldn't say I have a long torso, but it runs short. Looks cute, will have to give to my 15 yr old sister."
3.0,"Just not anything to write home about. Too short, texture not great."
3.0,They are not very long
3.0,"At first I thought it was leather, but after a closer inspection I decided this is actually not genuine leather and definitely not high quality cowhide leather. In fact the outer layer is completely synthetic. I was able to pick away some of the outer part with my nails at a not so visible place so don't accidentally ruin the bag and it looked and burned like plastic. The inner layer feels like leather as well but after picking away some parts it actually looks like fiber. The bag does not have any of the leather odor I'm used to. It's very good quality and very much like leather bag but that's all it is. If you look at the images, there's a distinct separation between the outer synthetic and the inner fiber like leatherette. And the pattern of the leatherette is very uniform. The inside pouch with zipper is obviously all synthetic. It's cute and keeps your stuff in. I still like the bag and will keep using it. It looks like it's sturdy and can last a good while. I removed 2 stars for false advertisement, other wise it's a nice tote."
3.0,"I purchased the dress in black, sz medium and worn it for my baby shower two weeks ago. The floral print is gorgeous. However, the fitting as it is a maxi dress was huge. Overall, it was just too big for my frame. I'm 5'1 post pregnancy- 138-140 lbs, 38C. Currently, at 31 wks. I'm at 150 lbs. The length is extremely long especially for shorter ladies. Even with heels, the dress was still touching the floor. The v neck is pretty deep and provides more than enough room. I had to wear a thin sports bra underneath. The waist part was a bit weird even with the belt. It was sewn too low. The material is pretty good since it's not too thin or thick. I think, it could work if the dress was a bit more fitted and hemmed. It would make it more flattering for petite and shorter frame ladies. Personally, I don't think it's worth a trip to the tailor's for a $24 dress. I would go with a shorter length dress since this one really requires a tailor to get it just right. Def would not recommend this for warmer temperatures since the dress material can be too hot."
3.0,Way too big at the front of the slipper...
3.0,"Smaller than I expected.  Almost child size.  However, I like the lightweightness and the flexibility.  They are cute if you want to go a bit funky."
3.0,"I have this same dress in many colors. This one fits differently, I think it is actually a petite size or perhaps a miscut/or irregular item. The waist and hem are significantly shorter than all of my others. I'll be gifting or donating this one to someone at least 4&#34; shorter than my 5'9&#34; self. Part of what I love about the rest I own, and was expecting in this one, is not just the flattering ruching at the waist, which this does not have since the cut is off, is the work-appropriate length for someone of my height. Which this also does not have for me :/. Oh well."
3.0,"I really love the pattern and the length (it is almost to my ankle and I am 5'8&#34;). However, the fit is a little weird on me. It is bigger in the waist and the armpit, then gets quite small around the hip area. The fabric is really nice and the pattern is unique. I can only wear it as a long vest or buttoned to the waist with tights. The belt loops are in an odd place right under the bust but can be easily moved or omitted. I think it would work if you have a larger bust and narrow hips."
3.0,Did not fit some glasses
3.0,The hat is gorgeous but it's really small. The fuzzy ball doesn't hang low enough and looks kind of stupid. It would probably look better on a child sized head (I wouldn't want my child wearing this hat lol) I just don't think it's worth $20.
3.0,My absolute favorite clothing item of my daughters! Super light weight and sooo cute. Just runs about a size small so she didn't get to wear it long and the tassles kept getting in her mouth
3.0,Really cute but not crazy about the fit
3.0,Great quality but runs small. Order a size up.
3.0,I am 5' 10&#34; tall and usually wear a 10 or 12 in dresses.  I have very large breasts so I ordered this in a size 12 because other reviewers suggested ordering up.  The fit is good on top but the bottom part is too big.  I have a somewhat straight shape with little or no hips or rear end and the hips on this dress are at least 1 size too big for me.  The dress itself is good quality and very cute.
3.0,my boy is 11m old - 18m old size was too small
3.0,"I love this blouse!! But, I wear a 3x and this was much too tight around my middle. I let a friend try it on, who wears a smaller size than I, but it was also too tight on her. But this is one of the best feeling, most beautiful blouses I've ever seen. The sizing is just not accurate. Guess it's time to lose weight. :)"
3.0,I bout this coat for the winter.  I like it hut the hood is too small amd the zipper is on the wrong side and I wish if had an inside pocket....  So far its nice!!!!!
3.0,This product was extremely tiny.
3.0,Ordered a larger size yhan I thought and it still came in smaller than expected.<br /><br />First thing that happened aftet taking out of the bag was three buttons fell of while trying to unbutton it to try on.
3.0,It to TIGHT around shoulders 😒 other then that it’s warm and soft.
3.0,These earrings are pretty....however they slide out of your ear....there was not anything to hold them in your ear.
3.0,Tight fit but it is a slim for. Sleeves length just right!
3.0,I did not like the quality of this item.
3.0,Beautiful blouse but it definitely runs 2 sizes smaller than normal.
3.0,i didn;t like the earring backs.the backs keep come off i have too buy new ones.i am not get the right items.
3.0,Most of the plugs are good. The dangle ones I could never get in my ears and dropped on my floor and it broke so I threw it away. And I threw away the screw ones because I’ve had them stuck in my ears before and I don’t want to risk it ever again and I advise everyone to take caution with screw gauges. Otherwise they are all cute and I like that I don’t have to use my fiancé’s gauges anymore I have some girly ones :)
3.0,"I like the top, but it’s more of a Salmon pink than hot pink. Not the color I wanted, so will return."
3.0,Super cute but has some scratches on the front.
3.0,"I am small, so I ordered a small.  They are too tight.  I would suggest ordering a size bigger.  Thankfully I can give them to my XS daughter."
3.0,"I love the security of the buckle closure, however the size is too large for me. I have the original band in the Small size, and this band I have to fasten on almost the last hole, which leaves a long tail on the band. That ends up looking sloppy."
3.0,"This is not a helmet as advertised, it's more of a rubber/latex mask, so keep that in mind."
3.0,Liked the color but the top was kind of small in size.
3.0,Cool watch but its has a small band. I'm 6'04&#34;....I'm no monster but this watch barley fits on the last hole on my wrist. Buy this watch if your a normal sized human
3.0,I purchased this jacket for a trip to Ireland. I was disappointed with the level of water resistance that the jacket provided. I ended up purchasing a raincoat on my trip because this one did not cut the mustard.
3.0,"Good, but the sides hurt."
3.0,Order two size up if from USA. I went with the suggested size chart and was still too small.
3.0,Just did not care for the material nor how it looks once I tried it.
3.0,The sleeves is not as puffy/bell like and the material of the top isn't what I expected but ok.
3.0,I like the great toe protection and open airiness of these shoes.  However I ordered size Women's size 7 which is a 39 and received a size 40 instead which is a little too big so my feet kind of swim in them.
3.0,"It is a decent ring, but it looks a little cheap. I ordered an NFL team ring, it looks like it was made for children."
3.0,This top is cute but wide. It is comfortable and soft. It has a very “boxy” cut and I don’t feel it look flattering on. Cute enough but not a favorite. Wear for comfort.
3.0,Color matches & the scarf is pretty it's just rather small compared to the photo
3.0,look great do not ware as well as expected
3.0,"This is absolutely gorgeous, but I gave it three stars because it runs super small. I even ordered up two sizes because of other reviews, and when I tried it on, it was still just a tad tight. I'm going to order another, though, because it's really cute with either skirts or jeans.<br /><br />Ironing it is difficult around the tie-front part, and it truly needs to be ironed because it arrives a bit wrinkled. But the rest of it is super easy to iron, and once done, it really is very pretty.<br /><br />Just be prepared to order three sizes above what you would normally do, and it should work."
3.0,Color faded brand new out of the box. I wish the color was as vibrant as pictured but fits as expected. I see why this was priced so low.
3.0,"This dress fits everywhere but in the bust. If you are well endowed, this dress is not going to fit well. The design and rest of the dress is nice. The fabric is comfortable."
3.0,"Very blah faded black color boring but my 15 yr old daughter is 5""8 and it was good in length and made it work for Halloween"
3.0,"They are acceptable quality glasses, but I'm quite dissapointed with the color. I ordered the pink frame with pink lenses. The lense color isn't the pink that's pictured. It's very green. One could potentially say its rainbow,  but I believe green is a more acurate description. I'll see if I can post a photo in a minute. I bought these for a X men Jubilee cosplay for this weekend and I wanted to save somebody from making the same choice. They're okay glasses, but not if you need accurate pink."
3.0,"Thin and looks good, but very cold to the touch. Also the texture is too similar to nylon.<br />There is no way this could be 100% wool. It is probably a mix of material, and maybe it has some wool in it, but not much"
3.0,"Its not pink!! Its like a tan. The design is pretty, the quality is not that great, the cups inside are literally made out of foam. I am petite so the size M worked for me."
3.0,The strap broke on the first usage
3.0,"Was constricting around the arms, otherwise the rest of the dress fit ok"
3.0,"This is dull/matte gold finish. I’m keeping it, but not at all what I expected. Ugh"
3.0,Cute shirt but the size is off by about 3 sizes.  Runs small
3.0,Fabric in nylon/scarf material. Better if in cotton.
3.0,Very nice overall but I had to return it coz one of the strap broke. Do not know how. Looked really sturdy but my son came home with just one strap in place ... Teachers note ... &#34;Metal part that goes around the button broke&#34; ... :( ... Was my favorite one before this happened. But I still give it three stars because of the neat stitching  and great material.
3.0,nice looking shoe
3.0,I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and got it 4 days ago. He loves it but was just taking it off like normal to charge it and the elastic string that holds it together already broke. I would invest in a thicker or stronger material.
3.0,Length is not suitable for me. But the pants are pretty nice. Wish they had more size optIons
3.0,Cute fit but runs small especially the top.
3.0,Loved the design of this swim suit but the material is a little see through so I was worried it would be super see through when wet. Wish there were doffeeent colors or it was lined because I really liked it. Had to return though.
3.0,"Kinda disappointed. Not really sweatshirt material. It's thin and shiny. Was going for oversized, and instead it fits tightly. So these run small. Cool pattern though."
3.0,was so excited to get this beach coverup dress.  It is not a dress as stated in the product information more like a top. it just comes below the waist.<br />The product itself is made well and is a nice fabric.  It will be ok to wear as a top just not dress or coverup as stated. The picture is not what the product is.  I was given a discount for my product review.
3.0,"The pants are nice. I wanted some joggers for work to dress them up. They weren't as comfortable as I wanted them to be. A little itchy. That would have bugged me at work. The fabric is also very thin and poor quality. They look nice, and I like the fit, but I will not pay $30 for them. I would have kept them if I had paid maybe $12."
3.0,"Not a good fit for men. They are not great quality, but will work for teenage girls."
3.0,"This is a very handsome watch.  It seems to keep accurate time.  It fits my wrist just right.  However, the clasp on the band has a tendency to pop open, and I cannot get the date function to sync correctly with the day, no matter when in the 12 hour cycle I adjust it."
3.0,See how skinny the legs are here in this picture?  If your legs don't look like that then expect these leg warmers not fit.  And the string is not attached it's just thrown in so you can tie them as you like.
3.0,I like the pin. I bought it as a secret Santa gift but it’s really small. I wasn’t expecting it to be huge since it is only an inch but I bought another Michael Scott pin for another coworker that is 1.2 inches and it’s way bigger than this pin. Cute but not worth 10 dollars..
3.0,"I really want to like this dress, and I will make it work, but the fabric is super thin and doesn’t keep you warm, and it has absolutely no give to it, so much so that I feel like the arms may tear when I take it off… if there were even a little stretch in the fabric I would love it so much more.<br />The cut itself is cute and looks nice on, definitely looks great with boots and a cute cardi, but the fabric just doesn’t do it for me."
3.0,Love the band but the watch cover is plastic and the screen is cloudy.  Not impressed.
3.0,"I think dress is cute but very, very small. I am 5.7 and 135 pounds and ordered a large and cannot wear it because it will not zip up.  If I had ordered and XXL it would've probably got fit."
3.0,"I got exactly what I paid for in this item! Item was as described, I am not displeased and would purchase this again!"
3.0,I returned it due to really big. It looked nice though and for the price seemed heavy material.
3.0,"Super cute! The words were a little rubbed off and cracking. The material is thin, definitely not designed to be worn multiple times. Good thing it’s such a specific outfit 😂🦃 It fit my 11month old pretty well. He was about 3ft 2inch tall and about 26lbs"
3.0,The leather is synthetic at best. Feels cheap. There's no way this is top grain leather. I question the durability of the buckle.
3.0,Very cute but broke right away
3.0,runs small not great quality
3.0,The band does not stay closed.
3.0,Good quality but wrong size. They're all too small.
3.0,Three stars because the shirt itself is soft. The transfer of the image was not great. The image is almost transparent. All three Hocus Pocus characters are the same color as the shirt. If the sizing was off or the material terrible I would have dropped it to a 1 star rating. Just beware.
3.0,I read the comment and ordered a large even though I normally were a small. Some of the boxers fit perfectly while others are a bit too small/large. The portion control isn't very good.
3.0,"Now I understand why the reviews was saying this, it’s a nice bracelet, but it scratches the skin like crazy, underneath were they put their beads, I had to place it over my clothes, luckily my dress was long sleeve……"
3.0,Cute glasses but too large for my face so returned them.
3.0,run very small
3.0,"I am a size Medium but got a size Large just in case.  The buttons on the Large were no where near closing. Again, I am a Medium and this Large seemed more like a Small. I returned it and will have to consider that if i buy it again I would have to get the XL. And that might not be enough either...<br /><br />Gave it 3 starts because it is cute but the sizing is WAY off."
3.0,Pro: the material of the bra is sturdy and comfortable to wear<br /><br />Con: the fitting is too small. I'm a 36B  and my mom is 34D. I thought that I could order L but it was way too small. it looked like it could've been a small. I ordered xxL  for my mom the bra was too tight.<br /><br />Tip: order 2 -3 sizes up .
3.0,works fair
3.0,"The dress is adorable. However, the previous recommendations regarding ordering up a size are very correct.<br /> I normally wear a size 6 to 8 and ordered up to the large size. The dress is just a bit too small (pulls at button closures) in the bust area just enough so that you get a slight glimpse of my bra beneath, and I haven't even washed it yet. So, I will try to find someone else who might want to wear it. I don't think I would have ordered it any larger; I just don't think it is made for thin, busty women. Also, the dress arrived very wrinkled, but said wrinkles also come out quite easily. I would recommend wearing either a camisole or slip, as this dress has the potential to be slightly see-through. It is a very cute summer dress, and I only wish it fit me better!"
3.0,"Returning because it is not long enough, just almost. I am 5”1 and it does not cover my butt for leggings. Fabric is nice. I just keep buying from Levaca, much better quality and designs for leggings"
3.0,"Loose, cool fit blouse with  thin material and it is not lined. The quality of material could have been better. I'm 5'10, long torso with a 36 B-cup and 147 lbs. a Lg fit me fine, ( although, it could had fit a little smaller across the bustline)  it hits me just below the hips,"
3.0,"Bought a size that fits me in all other hats, and, a size that fit me with another Decky hat, but this one fits larger and is a taller hat than I am used to so it actually slides down to where my ears attach to my head, which, I'm not a fan of. Like Decky as a brand, think that this may be mis-labeled as to size and/or they changed the height of the cap. It's the trouble with not being able to try them on before buying."
3.0,Clinging fit but nice length!
3.0,It's okay. As advertised.
3.0,The hat portion of this product fits well. The face shield portion would function better if it had a Velcro attachment to the hat. The hat’s tie on face shield does not stay in place on the hat.
3.0,"Very nice blouse but it is not long enough or my bust is too big. I am 5'2"" size 185 and 38 DDD cup size."
3.0,It barely covers the chin
3.0,I thought I ordered the correct size. But it was somewhat small on my hips.
3.0,Just silkscreen
3.0,"Flimsy, very small. Not really useful for a laptop at all as a messenger bag."
3.0,"I loved the color, fit, and feel of this lightweight hoodie. However, after two washes it began to get a hole at the corner of the pocket, which led me to send it back. Wish it had been more durable."
3.0,Not real satisfied with the quality of this t-shirt. When I pulled it out of the envelope there was a threat coming from the sleeve which basically pulled out of the sleeve leaving part of the sleeve uncuffed. The print on the front is starting to peel away already and I haven't even washed it. Very poor quality.
3.0,"Fits great and the the quality is really good, but the color is way darker than the blue color in the picture."
3.0,It feels real but it looks pretty fake I've been asked if I got it off a costume set or something so if you buy it be warned its real metal but looks fake.
3.0,Does not come with pins so it is unusable
3.0,...the color is off. It’s purple on the inside but more burgundy brownish on the outside of the case. I wanted the pretty purple that is pictured.<br /><br />Otherwise nice case.
3.0,"The bag is a nice bag.  It's perfect for what I need. The bag is not too large and not too small. It has a lot of nice zipper compartments and its very comfortable to carry.  HOWEVER, when I opened the bag there were blue marks on it like another color had accidentally run onto it.  I am not sure if I am going to return it or keep and look for another bag.  I want to like it but am afraid that whatever is changing the color of the bag will also color my clothes."
3.0,I loved the color but dress not true to size it ran small.
3.0,This bracelet is very well made. It has a strong magnets. The big negative is the smell of the leather. It gave me a headache and had to return.
3.0,Shirt was fine but runs very small and had to be returned.  I ordered an XL the and that was too big.  So I had to return both and paid over $5 in shipping to return and have no shirts.
3.0,"I’ve had the band for 2 days..the pattern is coming off and a small rip..I almost lost the pebble<br />I sent back, no refund"
3.0,X large run small
3.0,Super cute but lengths were inconsistent and shrinks very easily in the wash! I originally bought the light beige dress and loved it so much after it shrunk in the wash I wanted to repurchase so I replaced it and added a black one in. The black was way shorter than the new light beige dress. Strange. But I still love the dress especially adding a cute belt on the waist makes it that much cuter. Don't out it through the dryer though because it will shrunk for sure!
3.0,Cute thin hoops
3.0,For the price you can't beat it it's definitely a cheap material I am a 40 triple D the dress is a dark blue before you put it on but once it goes across your breasts and turns into a light sky blue because of the stretching overall nice dress for the price fits well though
3.0,Only designed on one side. Now I have a left earring and a right earring!
3.0,"These are very pretty. They didn't appear cheap. However, mine are two different lengths and one fell apart. I was able to fix it, but overall not the greatest quality. I would definitely not recommend as a gift."
3.0,Cute swim suit but the bottoms were way to small and the top was to big. I return it sad face
3.0,Great with my necklace and doesn't irritate my ears.
3.0,"This blouse is very cute but runs on the small side. I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try :-) the gathering aside the buttons is very flattering but again, it's on the small side. I would definitely size up especially if you have a large bust (which I don't!)"
3.0,Not liking the fabric; feels cheap
3.0,Said it comes with detachable strap.  It did not.
3.0,Zipper broke first day. Keeps separating when you bend. Metal end on zipper came off.
3.0,"Nice looking.  The chrono is a joke, does not work at all.  Only 60 seconds!  Don't buy if that matters."
3.0,Great product but it did not come with inner vest.
3.0,"I purchased the pink tee in a size large.  My measurements are 39 bust and 37 waist and 42 hip.  It fit good as shown in photo.  The material was not see through.  It was very soft and well made.  However, it is a thinner very drapey knit that clinged too much to things I would rather hide.  Also the pink leans a little more towards a peachy pink...especially the roses."
3.0,"Just like many people, I've been on the search for the ""perfect mask"" to fit my smaller face. Saw this and ordered them , hoping they will be the one.<br /><br />I like the fact that it was individually wrapped, unfortunately the fit on the mask was still not snugged enough, and they don't entirely look like the product photos.  Will be returning them."
3.0,"These are not the Spider-Man glasses you're probably looking for. As you can see from the pictures from others, they have a white vinyl on the inside. And the lens size is too small compared to the real one. Also these lens are just black, NOT tinted gold like the real thing.<br /><br />The real Amazing Spider-Man sunglasses has a bigger lens and the honeycomb pattern is built-in the gold colored glass itself! Also, the real ones say &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; in black text on one side. These fakes do not.<br /><br />On a positive note: you can use the honeycomb vinyl on the outside to make your glasses white like Spider-Man!"
3.0,"I like it , not as good as it could be , but it still rocks !!!!"
3.0,"The material is cheap- thin, doesn’t always lay flat (curls) and will definitely break with a little roughness ;)"
3.0,I like it. I wish it had more pockets in the zipper part. But it works for what I need it for!
3.0,"I purchased two and send them both back. The printing is pretty small, hat itself is ok, however, the back closure is not hook and loop as advertised/described, it is a plastic snap-back closure. Definitely not worth the price!"
3.0,"I love ants, and I loved this pin. Although, the pin would keep coming undone and poking me, or falling off. I eventually lost my ant and it was very sad."
3.0,"Dress is nice, but wear or look doesn't look like a high/low dress when on, somewhat awkward"
3.0,It's very difficult to see the LED display.<br />If it were larger and the face of the watch was white instead of black it would b e much easier to see.
3.0,"Beautiful dress! I ordered XL just because I'm 7 months pregnant and want to use it for my maternity pictures, but as soon as opened the package I noticed that both sides of the arms had a small hole like if someone had worn it before and got ripped! Another thing is the inside lining is stiched inside out so you can see it thorough the seer top layer! Don't know if I'm gonna return it or fix it myself! But it's a beautiful dress!"
3.0,I had been searching for a green turtle neck. Was wider then I was looking so I had to return. Is a beautiful baggy sweater but I was looking for more form fitted.
3.0,"Light weight but nothing protective over mouth or nose area.  Very cheap material, no trimming at all.  But, seller was very accommodating in trying to work with me on replacement."
3.0,"Just came with tail, headband and top not included in my package:("
3.0,"It is fine for training, I can see how the armholes might chafe a larger person, I ordered a small and I am a 130 lb person. Good material."
3.0,the glue keeps coming off rubber piece that holds the to the quest 2 but other than that its OK i guess
3.0,"I see other people who have received the same shit in other sizes have rated it too loose.<br /><br />For me, it's the exact opposite. I received size 2XL and for me, it's a tad too small. If I'm standing up, it's fine but if I sit down or lay down in it, then it feels way too small, which makes it difficult to keep on.<br /><br />The material is really thin polyester that has a nice silk feel to it. but it's just too small for me."
3.0,Only wanted the black one but had to buy all 12 in the packet. Smaller and tighter around the head than expected. Nice quality and durability. Very soft and nicely crafted. Just small for our use.
3.0,"I loved this outfit and the onsie was true to size but the overalls were very big...So we ended up using jeans instead, also after one washing the colors on the onesies are noticeably faded...Overall , good and cute for the price but probably wouldn't purchase again..."
3.0,"This is a cute jumpsuit/romper. My 18 year old daughter is 5'7"" and weighs about 150 pounds. She wears a size 6/8 or medium and a 34D. The medium jumpsuit was a little large on her, especially in the chest area. The bottom half was a little baggy. The length is good. It didn't look bad on her, but a better fitting one would probably look much better."
3.0,Sleeves and bottom not hemmed.
3.0,I’ve worn these goggles 3 times since I received them three weeks ago and they are fogging up in the water already.
3.0,Initially I was very happy with this 'find'.. it provided great support to my 17 month old's tender growing feet.. I am uploading a photo here to show how the sandal has started to wear off after using it just over a month.. this is not nice... not not nice!
3.0,I ordered too large a size based on the reviews
3.0,Way to big for what it is
3.0,had to return the hat because it would not fit.  Was purchased for an older lady going through cancer treatments and doesn't have a very big head.  Not sure if it really is a women's more than a teen size.
3.0,Strap broke used only 3 times
3.0,NOT squat proof
3.0,"Functional bag that does seem to resist water (though not thoroughly tested), but the draw strings are not properly secured and pull through the holes. This is because the material around the holes is not reinforced. I had to rig it with washers."
3.0,"It fits a lil small,  but I can handle it"
3.0,It's ok for the price. After a few weeks the lens coating started to flake/chip. Otherwise the design is durability of the frame is very good.
3.0,"I normally wear size 12, 5'6 145ish. I ordered the Large and it's very tight in the arms and bust area(36c). Order a size or 2 up for a comfortable fit. Other than that it's a nicely made dress. Princess waistline. Length is nice, below the knee. Buttons are for show but it has pockets which is a must for me."
3.0,"This product is a heavy flannel which is great. However the sizing is extremely small. I am 5'4&#34; 120 lbs and usually wear a small or medium shirt. They sent me a large (thankfully!) and it is almost too small in the shoulders and bust to wear (I'm an A cup so it's hard to be too small in the bust on me!), but leaves plenty of hip room. It is also quite long, so would work well with leggings. Just and FYI to order at least two sizes up for a comfortable, slightly loose fit."
3.0,"Decent quality for the price, arrived in 2 days which was great since my wife was looking for an oversized belt for a play"
3.0,The zipper and fly make the front more bulky than preferred. I wouldn’t expect a zipper fly in a baggy pant. The material is thin in places and rough to the touch. I thought the quality of materials would be better. This will be an occasional costume pant instead of a regular active wear piece. Sad.
3.0,There super cute and quality made. I have to send back because there too small. But I’m definitely getting more for other seasons
3.0,"Purchased as part of a birthday gift.  While the bracelets were an assortment, as described, they are in varied patterns that are hard to pair with existing clothing colors."
3.0,"Chain nice length, not too short, but nothing to write home about."
3.0,El cuello debe ser más estrecho para que el polo tome forma
3.0,I ripped it from carrying a lot of stuff in it and ordered another one.
3.0,Great quality! Unsure how to get one of the ten packs in the set replaced? Onr set has 2 phillips vs flat and phillips. Thanks
3.0,They are stunning. My issue is one of the earrings is much larger on the part you put in your ear. So it's stretching my ear lobe and hurts really bad when I put that one in. If that part was identical to the other and a normal width I would have given it a 5 star. But it is quite painful to put in and take out.
3.0,"These Fitatti compressional seamless leggings are interesting, but may not be what you are looking for.<br /><br />-I love the color green<br />-The material is smooth and very stretchy with ribbed textures throughout<br />-I like the little distressed patchy holes at the bottoms sides of the legs- it’s different<br />-Comes with a reusable tote bag for some reason. Not really sure that was necessary, but it is fine.<br />-Overall comfortable once you get them on. They feel compressive without feeling like they are too tight.<br /><br />Okay, so now some things that may be an issue for someone. I know some other reviewers have mentioned this as weIl.<br /><br />They arrive looking like pants for a young child. I suppose you could say they look like extremely thick pantyhose. This is fine. I get that they are supposed to be compressional; however, I doubt most people expected it to be like this. The company should add a picture of the leggings alone without the mannequin so that people can understand. They could also mention this in the description by saying that they will appear extremely small, but stretch out to the appropriate size. I took a picture of these next to some cropped leggings I have.<br /><br />That being said, these aren’t something you can quickly hop in and out of. Are they insanely hard to put on? I don’t think so, but it will definitely seem that way if you try putting them on like regular pants. If you just try to place you leg in and slide like normal, you will be annoyed and if not careful, probably get your foot caught in the distressed holes. My advice? You need to scrunch everything up together and place your feet all the way through the holes first. Then pull up starting from the bottom and working your way up until they are on all the way. Adjust as needed.<br /><br />Also, I don’t know why they call these seamless. There are definitely seams as you can see in my pictures. This is fine except the seam at the crotch is fairly annoying.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue with these is that the back is partially see through. I can see underwear lines, and the color of them from the outside- not cool. I ordered a medium like I usually do. They feel like they fit fine, but maybe sizing up would help with the see through issue? I’m 5’6” and currently about 145lbs for reference. I think it is safe to say that you can size up without issues.<br /><br />Overall, these leggings aren’t bad, just different. I would be much happier if the back wasn’t partially see through. Besides that, they look really cute on and are surprising comfortable overall. I would definitely wear these with a long shirt or dress to cover my bottom.<br /><br />I would recommend these if you like the way I described it and understand the potential issues, but like I said, you would probably need to wear something long to cover the back.<br /><br />Only time will tell if these hold up well with regular washing. They recommend not putting these in the dryer to avoid damage to the fabric. I’ll be sure to update this review if any other issues arise.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!"
3.0,Disappointed in the quality and color of the leather.
3.0,"Thought for a moment that they sent a xl but it was in fact a 2xl, no where near a 2xl. Runs a little small is putting it lightly. Nice shirt but at least a full size off."
3.0,"5’4 130 lbs. Ordered medium in grey. Love the color. Fits well, cute style, but has No lining, very poor quality sewing with loose threads everywhere."
3.0,"This is very cute, but we had to remove the unicorn due to looking like something inappropriate. My niece’s dad did not think it was a good idea to have his daughter wearing it to school with the unicorn looking like that. Once the unicorn was removed, it looked lovely. I thought hard before submitting this review, but I figured that other parents may find it helpful. Honestly, I had not seen anything wrong with the unicorn, until all the family mentioned the same thing about it being inappropriate looking. They said it was how it was knitted and the color."
3.0,The glasses were not as pictured.  Ordered the silver lens and they were dark sunglasses.  Quality good; but not what I wanted
3.0,"I usually buy XL and I ordered this in XL. Maybe I should have ordered a L but I like things to be loose and not hug the mid section in my middle years. I have to say this was my least favorite of the shirts I ordered, mostly because the neckline was really frumpy. It is a thicker band, which causes the fabric to pucker a bit, and is too high. It should have dropped at least an inch if not 2. I also felt the blouse was too wide at the armpits/chest area, which looks more moo-moo-ish."
3.0,"Just okay, the ribbon for the corset was useless for a plus size costone. Not nearly as much detail as the picture. And the fabric was not as nice as the picture. I did wear this for halloween, cuz I didn't feel like looking for another costume."
3.0,The pants fit ok but too short. I love her jeans but first time I’ve tried this type of fabric. Not my favorite.
3.0,Not very flattering as I thought. But still a pretty wear.  Style not for me.
3.0,"They are pretty but NOT 9mm, I found a pair of 10mm for 7.99 and they are much prettier and way bigger than these."
3.0,"Everything looks nice and my wife like it, but it looks like the tail fell off.  Otherwise things are fine."
3.0,"The Rhino boots, size fits as expected. The positives are that it seems like a really tough boot and is fairly light. The negatives are that it takes a long time to break them in. I mean, I wear boots all day at work and I had to alternate boots for a few weeks because the boot was as stiff as a board for the first few weeks. After it finally bent easily when walking, they became somewhat comfortable. i had to put inserts from the get go because the arches are nothing to right home about. For the price though, if they last half the year it'll will be worth it."
3.0,Doesnt look like the pic ...Runs small and Short ...like  the sthle though ...might order in larger size
3.0,"Lightweight shoes at good price, but my son has only had them for a month and a half and they're already falling apart"
3.0,"Funky it is. It's designed to hang down on either side of your boobs. It doesn't close. Nor is there enough fabric that it would. The front parts are only about 3&#34; on either side. Had I known it was not one that could even wrap around, i'd have likely bought something else."
3.0,"I really like the color and look. It is not as big as I'd hoped for and seem a little cheap, but for the price its a good wallet."
3.0,I really liked the wallet but had to return it as one of the Springs was sprung on the shoulder strap and it could not be attached.
3.0,I have gotten lots of compliments and the material is great.  Soft and comfortable. It’s perfect to wear over a medical mask for double protection.  The only reason I didn’t give full ratings is because the color is misleading.  The shirt I received is full on Halloween orange.  I’m ok with it and it looks cute paired with the right outfits.
3.0,Fabric is polyester; feels cheap & not a look or feel kids like. Also runs quite small. Disappointed. :(
3.0,The print was light
3.0,"They were way to small. I recommend at least size 45 mm far as the lens size goes.  They are cute, but the size is just way off. And i have a small head . Shame they just didn't fit good. I will keep mind and try to stretch/adjust to fit. They are tinted."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:42c411b3665534f446e85ec78892b198]] Very disappointed with the minor defect, yes, it’s minor but it makes the bag unusable. My husband uses it for quick errands with our baby daughter and only carries 4 diapers, wipes, powder, spit rag and his wallet. The plastic holder that holds the strap must be defective, it keeps popping off and my husband isn’t able to use it. Other than that, the quality of the material is great. We’d LOVE the bag if it weren’t for the defect."
3.0,"They don't exactly fit my wrists and look all baggy, plus they don't have that intense wet look. Im fine with them for now since all i need to do is sew them up. If i had to describe the material its like a non textured  leather."
3.0,The large is a bit loose. It stretches easily upon wearing. I like tighter bike shorts. Not sure if would purchase again
3.0,Item fit right and was hard to slip over head. Loved the color.
3.0,"My first day wearing it, there were wholes in the pockets.  But it is warm and I live in chicago."
3.0,"Got the white top, black bottom. Fit is ok, not the best but ok esp for the price. Two problems though. One: it's way too long for a petite person. Two: the zipper used for the dress (on the side) is white and you can see it on the side when you wear the dress!<br />Returned"
3.0,They were a bit smaller than size I ordered. To late to return since wife got them a bit dirty working in the garden.
3.0,"The face of the watch I received was not black as shown in the picture. The instructions were not included as indicated in the order, but simple enough to program the hour and minutes. I did receive it earlier than I thought I would. The watch is slightly heavy."
3.0,"The fabric is too thin, does not glance the figure well, not enough weight. However, kudos for saturated color. Fits well. Design is ho-hum."
3.0,Only problem is the material falls apart at the seams after a few washes :-(
3.0,Took awhile to receive. The clasp fell off when I opened the package. For the price it a good deal if you plan on using the bracelet in pieces to make new ones.
3.0,"It is very pretty, but the fabric is weird and itchy, and you can see right through it."
3.0,"I didn't rate this hat very highly for several reasons.  While it is a good price for what it is, it lacks some design features that I would have paid more for.  The good things:  It is lightweight, breathable fabric that is water repellant, you can wear with or without the mask and side flaps... and I like the lavender color I ordered.  The not-so-good things:  the bill is not moldable like most ball caps and it feels like it has a plastic form instead of heavy cardboard (I don't want to look like a homie), the neck protection really needs a snap where the fabric divides in the back to give the wearer the option to leave it open or closed, and the sliky material does not stay in place in the headband adjuster hardware. . Not the maker's fault, but I did not like having my view closed in on the sides which the side flaps do.  I have worn it while mowing (riding mower) and I didn't realize how much I depend on my peripheral vision to avoid being bushwhacked by shrubs and low tree branches while focusing on the ground in front of the mower.  Some (lazy) people complained that it came packaged all wrinkled, which is true, but ironing it once took care of the wrinkles."
3.0,"These chokers were super cute, but when they arrived they were all shoved into a tiny drawstring bag which in turn made all of the chokers bent and unable to wear immediately. I had to iron them all to straighten them out... Anyways, good product but the seller should look into a different packaging style because it (temporarily) messed up the product..."
3.0,"It is cute and I love the feathers (slight natural greenish tint in them). It says it is adjustable by sliding along the headband. Mine seems to be stuck. Also the felt circles that are hot glued to the headband and decorative part were not completely glued together making the decorative part wobbly on the headband. I have a hot glue gun and will just finish the gluing process. After seeing the product, I would have rather paid less, but I really want to wear this to a wedding to try and make Fascinators a thing the US, so I will keep it and make the repairs myself."
3.0,It would be difficult to move with ease unless you have a small frame.
3.0,Gave the skirt away right out of the box to my daughter who loved it and it was My mistake for only looking at first picture and not ALL OF THE PHOTOS!  That's why I gave it at least 3 stars.  This skirt is not nearly as long or flowing as the first picture appears..... Please look at customer photos cause that is what you are purchasing..... Elastic black waist band is pretty tight fitting too.  Not my style at all!
3.0,"Good quality, but was much smaller than I expected."
3.0,Very pretty but way too small for the money.
3.0,Item is smaller than a regular shower curtain so I'm not able to use it.
3.0,"This work boots are too soft for heavy duty work ,the leather is too soft ,good  durble sole but doesn't feel like work boots<br />If you're walking around all day get them  if not look for something else .<br />I do construction work roofing,framing"
3.0,"Purchased turquoise top XL. I'm 5'4&#34; and 44&#34; bust. XL is very very roomy. However, Top doesn't match photo. Impossible to wear off shoulder.  It's just a crew neck, see thru top with 3/4 sleeves. I still like it so I won't return, but I won't buy again and don't recommend it if your looking for top to wear off the shoulder."
3.0,"I expected more from this item, but it is nice"
3.0,It’s extremely small for a grown man to wear. The image doesn’t accurately show its size.
3.0,"I purchased two of these for my granddaughters to wear for a dance performance. They served the purpose but were not very well made and came apart in several places. They were easy to fix and held up through the performance. So I suppose for the price they were adequate as they may never be used again. So, for long term durability or repeated use, I would spend some extra money and purchase something that is made a little better."
3.0,Zipper always breaks
3.0,"Item runs small, but otherwise as expected."
3.0,Returned it the neck was very tight and small inside
3.0,Sleeves are super tight. Maybe from all that working out I've been doing :/
3.0,Bag was beautiful side straps broke within two months get for fashion but not for work purposes. The inner zipper broke the same day I used it.
3.0,"The hat is a little shorter than I'm used to but fits well. Made well. The smell however makes me gag. I have washed twice and soaked over night in vinegar and I can still smell it, makes me embarrassed to try and wear it until I get the stench out. I just don't get it?? How can it smell soooo bad???"
3.0,Very pretty but heavy.  Will have to wear them when I don't have to have them in too long.
3.0,"Too was okay, a little stiff, but the bottom was too stiff and made it difficult to roll"
3.0,"Lightweight, cute and easy summer dress worth the lightning deal price. However, it's def cheaply made...the pockets in mine weren't stitched so they're not really pockets (just holes you can slide into and scratch your leg LOL) & the gathers at the bustline are irregular so it puckers a lil weird in places. I'm keeping it for the price though. Honestly, might buy a floral one too...it's cheap and comfy but you get pay you pay for."
3.0,"Ordered a black skirt and got a green one. Not bad quality, but it was bought for a costume, and isn't something I can wear to work."
3.0,One leg was longer that the other - we had to have it fixed
3.0,Didn't care for the quality of this suit ! Had an old fashioned polyester feel and look. Not for me
3.0,It was a bit small for me
3.0,"I love the color and the cut but I have a long torso, it's too short for my body"
3.0,"Can see through must wear with underwear on  or with short or pants, not by itself"
3.0,Legs are very flimsy
3.0,Ordered this dress in a different color and fit perfect but when ordered the black it was way too small
3.0,"It is a gorgeous shirt but not the best quality, Actually, kinda itchy material. Also, the belt attached for the bow is SO long the bow is impossible to tie. I can't make a pretty bow since the belt is SO LONG. Otherwise, not really worth how much it was. Should be about $10 for quality."
3.0,Socks fit well below the knee and not what I expected. Great fabric but I needed longer socks. Just barely above the ankle
3.0,Nice but Very small for the price plus the shipping charge. Reconsider purchase.
3.0,"After reading reviews I thought a small would be a good fit for me. I'm 5'6, 125 pounds and  definitely should've got a medium or even a large. This could pass as a thong bathing suit on me."
3.0,"Not as described- only two shirts are moisture wicking, the other two are cotton t shirts. Run small"
3.0,"I am 5' 3"" and weigh about 175lbs.- I carry my weight around the middle: arms chest, back, and stomach, but don't have much of a butt or thighs.  I liked the material of this dress- it is thicker and doesn't cling to me, although it has some stretch in it, it is not shiny.  I am short, but this was about a foot and a half too long, so I hemmed it.  Also, in the picture, the dress is v-neck, but mine was a round neck, with a v in the back and a strap across the top.  Also, for me, the sleeves were kind of tight and a weird length- just an inch or two from my elbow.  I made a few adjustments and now I really like it... I opened the sleeves up on the underside and rolled them up twice and sewed them in place, now it looks more like the way they look in the picture.  Also, I cut the strap off of the back and removed a little tiny XXL tag and turned the dress around so the V is in the front now.  I am top heavy and my shoulders are broad for my size, so if I wouldn't have made these few adjustments, I wouldn't have liked the way it looked on me up top.  As far as the fit through the body (chest, stomach, butt, etc.)- it has plenty of room and isn't clingy at all.  It is very comfortable and even though the material is a little thicker, it is not heavy or hot.  I really like dress a lot, but be aware that it doesn't fit exactly like the picture makes it look.  A lot of people wouldn't have to make the adjustments to this dress like I did, I guess it just depends on your size and how you carry your weight."
3.0,"I like these earrings, but the backs are impossible unless you have the fingers of a five-year-old. I immediately changed them for other backings that I already had, so I think they'll be fine now."
3.0,Soft and comfortable but I frequently need to adjust for proper coverage.
3.0,I am 5’6 and 138 lbs. I ordered a small .It fit in the chest and butt but the forgiving stomach created a stomach that I don’t actually have.
3.0,"I purchased these Adult Unisex's Bow Tie & Suspender Sets Brown since I was in need of a brown set of suspenders. Overall they have met my needs but they do tend to unclasp a few times during the day, luckily I wear a jacket over them or else I would probably hit someone or get  hit myself. The bowtie I did not wear since it is really low quality."
3.0,"I really liked it, but the pendants are all together on top of each other and that's not good"
3.0,Material is noisy and didn’t fit as expected
3.0,I liked the fabric but when I ordered my exact size it was too tight. I am therefore returning this item.
3.0,I bought this as a present but the leather started looking wrinkled after a short while. It didn't hold up well.
3.0,Cute nose ring. Just  the balls are bigger than I thought.
3.0,Inside soles of boots are not secured down so I will have to glue them in. Boots smell very strong of some kind of chemicals. To the point I had to put them outside because my whole laundry room smells like the boots.
3.0,The fabric was not as expected and a little long. Did like the pockets.
3.0,"Would probably work great, but cannot get earrings in my ears with sleeves on.  Holes in my ears not big enough."
3.0,Not to happy with the ears. It SNAPPED in the middle of a photo prop.. Disappointed!! The outfit it self..I'm saving for my daughter's birthday party.. it looks okay.. but it's a big fit.
3.0,"Very cute, but was a little big & wished it was more white."
3.0,It was well made...just way too heavy and bulky.I ended up giving it to my brother who RE_GIFTED it ...you guessed it BACK to ME...I think you should display this watch in the BOATING DEPARTMENT...it would make a fine anchor since its water tight to 3 inches.
3.0,These are definitely not XL mens t-shirts. I normally wear a medium in unisex T-shirts and these XL are tight on me.<br /><br />Sublimation works beautifully though! I’ve used both Cricut brand infusible ink and a dye sublimation printer and both turned out well.
3.0,I ordered a size 7 and I'm a 6 1/2 and these are super small. My foot barley fits so it's a little disappointing.  U want ur slippers to be just rite and super comfy and now these are uncomfortable.  So if u order 2 sizes up u should be alright.
3.0,"Cute design, matches the picture. The awkward seams, button down middle and side slits make it hard to wear. Plus it didnt seem suited for big hips."
3.0,It's ok doesn't fit like I want it to don't like the material I wish it was cotton it would be better
3.0,"Love the hat but the shield gives good coverage however the shield makes you see waves, and is horrible!!"
3.0,This is a great idea but it snags VERY easily and isn’t holding up.
3.0,"For about a week the hat was great, then the inner band began to wrinkle,  now when I wear it the wrinkles in the band leave marks (impressions) on my forehead. Can this be fixed ?"
3.0,"I just received this necklace. The silver color is good, but the material had all kinds of  bubbles and was not polish. Does not look like on the screen.I waited a long time and i was expecting a nice necklace .Too much trouble to send back."
3.0,very complicated to put on.  Also very small; I usually wear size 18 and I bought a size 2XL.  I couldn't even get the dress on easily and it was too tight to wear comfortably. I returned it.
3.0,"bought this in Camel for my wife.  She really loved it until she came home less than 60 days after receiving it, only to tell me that the inside zipper pull broke off.  I am very disappointed in this and even more disappointed now that I see that it's too late to do anything about it."
3.0,"I normal wear US size L, knowing I need to size up, I ordered XXL and it fit. Material is good, but the lace top seem unfinished. Mine isn't off shoulder like the model, just around shoulder so the lace a bit too close to the neck."
3.0,I’ve never had men’s tanks with this narrow armholes with no stretching.<br />The ratio of the size of the rest of the shirt and that of the armholes doesn’t make sense to me.<br />Loved the design but donated them right away because of the uncomfortable feeling that doesn’t go away.
3.0,"So beautiful,  only very disappointed pq it took so long to arrive!!"
3.0,"The item is lovely, but the fake fur sheds!  Must be tossed in dryer with dryer sheet to remove the smell. Then I let it hang alone for a week! Combed out the fur, too."
3.0,Somewhat did the job. It didn't do as expected or meet the expectations I had but it still works.
3.0,"We covered the exposed metal hinge as hubby has some allergies to stop his rash from it, otherwise comfortable fit and works as advertised"
3.0,"This is a super cute hat. It has the puff ball you can attach and detach. I walk a few blocks to work in the morning time. I decided to try it out. It is great for semi cold weather but that day, the cold wind blew right through it. I was a little disappointed in the warmth aspect of it. Otherwise, it is still a good soft material and it is cute."
3.0,Longer and bigger than expected I tied the side so it was still a good look and fit not a short dress
3.0,"it didn’t come with a chain, seems to be real would be 4 star if it had a chain"
3.0,"The inside of the rings that I got do not look like the rings shown in the photos. It does not say""Ikonfitness"", instead it is grooved and traps water."
3.0,The hair ties slip off easily
3.0,Clip is a little unwieldy. Wish strap was a little longer.
3.0,Unfortunately too small. These were too loose around my feet and ankles and then too tight around my calves. I understand that compression socks are supposed to be tight but not to where they're cutting off circulation. They're great quality material but I'm afraid this even if I did get a bigger size they wouldnt fit right due to the bagginess in the foot/ankle area.
3.0,The neckline was higher then I like and it's shorter then I thought it was going to be
3.0,"Bought from ""TimeZone123"".<br />Nice design and style, but you can definitely get a cheap feel.<br />Light weighted and it's battery died after 2 years of use, without using any of it's other features.<br />While i have an old Seiko, that its battery is still going strong for 8 years now."
3.0,Purchased as a gift for an exchange.  Well constructed and a lot of fun.
3.0,This product runs really small. So make sure you size up. Definitely better options out there other than these. Not very stretchy.
3.0,"These moccasin slippers slip into some netherworld very quickly.  They don't hold up very well, but they're better than some others."
3.0,"The edges are a little sharp, but not a bad ring"
3.0,"Came scratched up and words were in an ugly brownish color, but Ima keep em"
3.0,I'm usually size sm/med and I ordered an XL which was just a little too big.
3.0,"Was pretty, but extremely large."
3.0,"It looks from the picture like you could keep your phone in there and still access the screen and camera without having to take it out. Not the case, sadly. But it's a nice wallet and fits everything you need."
3.0,Size was my fault. I didn’t think it would be that type of material. I got so many  complements on it people loved it. I’m 5’0-5’1 145 lbs I should have gotten a medium. There was a white spot in the top of he dress but in the dark who could tell
3.0,Way bigger than pictured.
3.0,"Smart looking cap, white gloves and metal flight wings.  Quickly shipped."
3.0,I was going to wear this hat on my wedding day but it is off white and my dress is white. I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it or not
3.0,"DONT love these. I ordered three pairs, more so for lounging and the occasional grocery trip if need be. I’m a cross between a Large and XL & went with a size large. I’m glad I did because the XL would be a whole different type of look and not a flattering one. The large fit OKAY. They’re semi snug in the waist, would have been too big a size up. The knees are awful and loose and calves tight. They’re not flattering nor would I ever wear them any where but home. I’m keeping for the sake<br />Of bum pants and don’t want to go through the returning hassle."
3.0,Really thin stretchy gauze like fabric.  Doubtful it will hold up in wash.  Cute enough for the one or two wears I'll get out of it.
3.0,I love two tone jewelry and especially liked this bracelet but after a year the gold tone started coming off. I didn't wear this everyday and have other two tone jewelry that the color is still like new.
3.0,"I ordered a 10-12 because I have a high waisted bikini from cocoship and it fits. Boy was I wrong lol. I returned it the same day and ordered another, two sizes up.<br /><br />Update: it doesn't support my boobs at all. The cups are too low."
3.0,"I was REALLY excited about this when I opened it... lovely packaging, beautiful color... nice width... THEN I put it on.  Firstly, I have small wrists.  I have already returned it, and wish I had taken a picture of it on to better explain.  It was just SO TIGHT.  I didn't need lotion or anything to get it off, but I was expecting it to fit more like a fun bangle as described.  Like... I thought it would at least move some when I moved my arm, but it was STUCK.  If this is what you want, go for it. I mean, I didn't want something that would just slip off, but this things wasn't going ANYWHERE unless I pulled HARD and it did not feel good.  It is also HEAVY.  I just don't like tight heavy bracelets. If you have thick wrists or bigger hands in ANY WAY, you will NOT be able to put this on/take this off."
3.0,I love elastic watch bands and these are fine but the catch or buckle slides easily so I’m tightening it regularly
3.0,"The case sits on my dashboard and doesn't budge while I'm driving.  It is well constructed and velvet lined.  The reason behind the three stars instead of five is that it just barely fits the baroque swirl sunglasses I got in New Orleans.  I love them and want to keep them nice so having to make sure they are perfectly placed so that I can get the case closed (not even quite) all the way is a pain.  The only consolation is that I know they won't be rattling around in the case.  That said, the case could be rubbing the clear coat off of them.<br /><br />The case was also blemished with some sort of rubber cement like glue when it arrived.  It isn't visible enough to significantly detract from the design, but it is noticeable.<br /><br />All in all, it works well enough but wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for in size or aesthetics."
3.0,"These are super cute earrings, but one of them broke before I even got it out of the package. I’m not returning them since they were cheap, I will just fix it myself."
3.0,Fit Large on the stomach area but just right on the top. weird fitting.
3.0,too hard to close
3.0,"The picture shows a multi colored ring, but I received a white ring. Also the ring says 8, but I have a ring size and it says 7.. Its cute, just not what I ordered."
3.0,button fell off too soon
3.0,Sleeves are Tight with bad stitching connecting to the lining.
3.0,I was expecting a little sturdier material but that's okay it serves the purpose.  I got this for my son-in-law as a gift since he does all the house cleaning while my daughter is in school.  I love the phone pocket so he can keep up with the phone while cleaning.
3.0,"Smaller than you’d think, but it’s very cute. Pockets are not as spacious as they should be considering it’s an apron."
3.0,Not that bad.
3.0,"I bought this dress according to the size chart they provide, and it was big on me. The fabric is good, not the best quality, but good enough. I'm 5'9 and weight 160 and according to the size chart I was XL. So, I hope I give you and idea."
3.0,"Runs large and is one size, so unable to adjust band."
3.0,"I’m not completely mad at this, but I just figured for $20 I can get something a lot better quality. So I am returning it. I am 6’ (so it was a bit short) 280lbs and I have 40DDD breasts. I ordered XXL which is my normal size. Since I’m so tall I don’t really have much of a stomach, just large bust and thighs. The dress was extremely tight and see through in the bust but was fine everywhere else. The only other thing is that it was very cheap fabric."
3.0,the t-shirts arrived dirty with hair and bad smell
3.0,Better than the single tooth caps but easily snap in half when fitting
3.0,Fits really funny. Feels like it's on the wrong foot. Returning
3.0,"Great material, feel and thickness, but little smaller than expected. I just stretched it out because I think going one size up would be too big."
3.0,"Thought it was a good price for 40pcs, but you should think of it as the price for only 20pcs because half of them does not light up at all."
3.0,Order item twice USA size chart is difficult to analyst don't know until buy i you should select USA size up or size down
3.0,There OK look nice
3.0,"Great dress for the right person...I found it difficult to get in and out of so I had to return...I'm a Large to XL in most clothing so I ordered the XL and found it a bit small...if ordering, size up one"
3.0,"I ordered it. Came in about two days. I got the unicorn one as my stepdaughter loves unicorns. And jewelry and loses it frequently. It's half unicorns ,half mermaids and I'd say everyone is duplicated and sometimes triplicated. I prolly wouldn't have ordered if it wasn't all unicorn just an fyi"
3.0,"This item is see through, I was not expecting that."
3.0,These masks are super small. My 8 year old couldn’t even wear them because of how tiny they were. I would Imagine they’re more of a toddler size then a child size. They’re nice other than that!
3.0,"Beautiful! However, the jacket is completely laced and does not have the middle like the photos show. I ordered 1 size bigger then normal and it’s snug/tight in the arms."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this skirt, but unfortunately the inner shorts are just way too short. The inseam is only 4”, so no prevention of the chub rub. I will be returning this."
3.0,"I like the idea, but I can't find any shirts that will work with it. It's a choker so it has to be work with a really high neckline, I just don't have anything to wear it with, but other than that it's fine and came faster than I expected."
3.0,"It is a little large and also is a bit warm. I'm using it, but it is not my prefered."
3.0,This is a super cute shirt but unfortunately is way too small bi went by the reviews when I chose my size when really I should have went with my gut feeling and ordered a few sizes up. I’m very sad that I won’t get to wear it this summer. UPDATE: since I’ve lost weight this now fits and fits perfectly. So super cute!!
3.0,Fit and looks great.<br />The only issue I have is the ankle seam rubs my ankle and I have to fold it up.
3.0,"These 2 shirts I bought from same company don't look as nice in person as in the pictures. I washed before wearing, to remove wrinkles.  They didn't look very nice after that."
3.0,These caps are comfortable and easy to wear but the description says they are 100% cotton but the tag on them says 100% polyester.
3.0,"Really good deal but the first pair I wore fell apart after a few hours. I was able to put it back together, but just be aware if you buy them!"
3.0,"This is not red, it is more of a coral color."
3.0,"Material is good, but quite short in the leg. I got an Xtra large to compensate for lengrh & they sit slightly above my ankle, sigh.  The waistband has a very wide elastic strip inside, which over time will turn (I sew & not an optimum choice for a waistband)"
3.0,They are sorta thick so they dont look real at all. I tried to use them as ear peircings but they hurt too much. Overall they are pretty much useless till me now. Not what i expected
3.0,"Unfortunately too small for my face, but overall would have been a nice accessory."
3.0,"runs small, very thin material"
3.0,"Feels tight in the goods department  and am I am not that large, maybe in time pouch will streatch out.  There is no fly so peeing is a bit more cumbersome, especially the way it is designed to keep ones goods perched out. If I were to try again would get extra large (I am 34 waist)"
3.0,"I wear a men's size 10.5-11, so I ordered an XL. The product info states XL should fit mens 9-11. I couldn't even get my foot all the way in. I don't mean it was a little snug, but that I don't know if a size 10 could even fit. They're cute but the sizing is enough off to warrant a low rating."
3.0,"I'm a 6.3, 195 lbs guy.<br />I use trim/fit clothing<br />This runs ExtraFit...so, if you buy it, go an extra size ahead<br />Beyond that, is elegant, looks nice, good fabric<br />And no, it does not look cheap. You will like it"
3.0,They are beautiful but the rubber rings fell off but still like them
3.0,Good quality but its made for someone with large wrists.  I couldn't adjust it down so it didn't roll up to my middle arm.  Too bad.  Looked nice.
3.0,It fits just well but too thight on my thighs and butt
3.0,I love this but it runs small and needs to be returned.
3.0,Purchased for my 6 year old. Threads started coming out the first day she wore it. But super cute ! Well worth the price
3.0,I like the dress and cut. It has a rich deep green color. Fabric was a little lighter/thinner than I would’ve preferred and would have to wear spandex. I typically wear a 12/14 and I ordered an XL which to me was a bit snug
3.0,"These fit well and the material is decent enough. But, as others have stated, the thumb hole is very tiny and obviously just snipped in with scissors. There is a hasty stitch around the edge of the hole, I assume to keep it from fraying, but I'm going to have to enlarge the hole anyway, so that stitch isn't going to help at all (not that it would help for long even if I left it as is... ). 99% certain these started as a forearm sleeves. They will do the job, and they were inexpensive, but I am not impressed."
3.0,"These are what they are - very cheap novelty toys.  Expect some to arrive broken and for all of them to break pretty quickly after being put in use.  The kids LOVED them though, so given they were so inexpensive, I count it a win overall."
3.0,Order up two sizes!! I fluctuate between a M and L and the XL was small. I was able to zip the skirt but had a &#34;muffin top&#34; at the top of my waist. Fit snug and there isn't any stretch. Very beautiful though! Will be returning soon.
3.0,"I really like the band and wear it most of the time. The band sturdy and mostly comfortable albeit a bit overly stiff. The problem I have had is that because the band is so stiff when I put it through the second loop it gives too much and is now ripped almost halfway down. I am going to have to order a different band as this isn't going to last too much longer. I feel like the second loop should have been the same tough material as the band is. You can see the tear in the left side of the loop in the picture.<br /><br />I have to say the customer support is pretty awesome. V-Moro has contacted me several times to try and fix the situation.  I received the updated band from them, and have tried it for a few days. While I like the way the band looks (and it is a bit shorter) the band is still very rigid so I will see what happens with the loop on this one. I am working with them on receiving a different band to see how that fits/feels. If nothing else they aim to please and it shows."
3.0,Smart idea but it’s extremely hard to get sanitizer into the wristband.
3.0,It’s only been washed twice and it looks about ten years old. The colors were also much prettier online than in person. They look kinda cheap and a little off. Fits as expected but shorter than I was hoping. Couple in. above my ankle. Will keep it but definately disappointed.
3.0,It started corroding but I love the lapis itself my bride took it off the necklace and we use it as a regular crystal gemstone works
3.0,These did not work for me.  They were too long and see thru.  Loved the pattern and wish they would have worked.  Probably best suited for very tall with small limbs.
3.0,Large fit and a little stiff fabric where the designs are but very cute and holds up in washer/dryer.
3.0,"When I took them out of the package and tried them on, they fit beautifully.  I wasn't sure whether to get XL or 2XL; the XL seems perfect. The waistband is snug without binding (I have a very small waist for a woman of my size; most jeans flap in the back).  I'm 4'11&#34; and the legs come to within 2 inches of my ankles, black leggings with black socks will look very clean.<br /><br />A bit baggy around the back of the knees and groin crease, which will probably get worse after a wash or two.<br /><br />Even under a (thin) tunic I've got slightly visible panty lines; not a garment for the shy.<br /><br />After 2 wears there is noticeable pilling at the crease of the inner thigh (panty area).  Concerned about durability."
3.0,"only reason why I gave it a 3 stars is because it is advertised as a womans purse, but the strap is on the smaller size, it is perfect for my daughter who is 8 yrs old. the quality of the purse it isn't bad at all, specially for what you pay for it, you do have to figure out how to tie the straps on it and the front doesn't clip or zip, you have to loop it though, so if you put something on the heavier side if you tilt your purse you run the risk of it just flying out. so I wouldn't recommend this for an adult, but it is perfect for a young girl."
3.0,I was a little skeptical being that I only paid 3 and change for the ring but when I received it I was amazed. The band is a little thinner than I would like but I'm satisfied. I've received several compliments and I only had the ring for 3 days. My skin is very sensitive to fake jewelry but with this ring I have no reaction. I've wore it non stop for 3 days. It's fits lose so I could of gotten away with a size 7 ( I purchased a size 8) (I'm usually a size 7) but it's fine.  It even sparkles when it's in light or the sun. I'm pretty impressed.
3.0,I could not adjust these to make a good seal.<br />Spend the money and get yourself a better quality pair.
3.0,I sent it to my ex partner a long time ago and they seemed to enjoy it so I call it a win!
3.0,Ordered two sets of earrings and only received one. Otherwise pretty!
3.0,The blue color was beautiful and the fabric was not bad. But the fit was not tailored for a woman's figure.
3.0,"They were a little stretchy (not tight) so they fall to the bottom of your neck, but cute if you layer i guess?"
3.0,Too large for my liking.  I sent it back
3.0,Not tight enough.... or warm enough.  I would say ok for weather like 45 to 65.
3.0,"This dress looked and fit great, but I noticed it ripping a little on the back the second time I wore it. Wasn’t tight or anything at all for it to rip like that. Great for a one or two time wear though!"
3.0,"good goggles, BUT THEY ARE NOT OTG.  there was no &#34;notch&#34; for glasses and were not wide enough to accomodate glasses, therefore could not wear them.  You should remove the OTG, as that is inaccurate."
3.0,"Nice quality and style, pink color not as pictured. Baggy fit."
3.0,Should be smaller I am skinny and the  chain is on mi hips instead around my waist I have to fix it because es cute but I can't wear it
3.0,"Pretty dress, but was definitely light grey. Not at all “lilac grey” whatever that means.<br />Sent it back and got a full refund."
3.0,Love the color n design but smaller that ln expected
3.0,My husband measured how wrist and made sure everything would be good and this band was still way too long :(
3.0,The product works as intended. My complaint is that after just a few uses the material that covers the padding that goes over your head is splitting at the seams. I will be contacting the seller to get this taken care of.
3.0,"Love the look, love the color, love the length (I held them up against me), because I wouldn't have to wear heels...BUT, they were WAY TOO SMALL!!!!!!!  I wear a US size 8, and most of my pants are 29.  I ordered a 29x30, and they wouldn't even go past my hips!!!!  I feel even if I ordered the 30, they wouldn't fit.  I'M SENDING THEM BACK.  Sad, because I liked them"
3.0,"Not a 100% cotton, Runs small but my daughter likes them since they are cute. Do not have any intention to buy again these product! Quite disapointing!"
3.0,It worked ok. However I didn't read closely and showered with the watch and found out that it is NOT waterproof. Face of watch filled with water. No longer functioning. Bummer!
3.0,At the waist line the dress was pleated all around the waist. So it made it poof out more. I felt like I was wearing a lampshade. 🤷‍♀️ it just didnt lay nice. Beautiful dress though. Material was good too. I am 5'8 and 150 lbs. Dress was Knee length.
3.0,The release on the belt is very difficult to operate. One should be able to release the belt easily for both left and right handed wearers. Have to struggle and sometime slide pants off as the release does not release when trying to remove belt.
3.0,"Had the bubble in it, but I think it maybe is supposed to be that way.  On the picture it looks like a glare but my daughter loved it."
3.0,I love this except for the fact that when you wear it all the time like I have with the two I ordered the rope bracelet wears out and eventually will break. Unfortunately it is after just a few months.<br />I am looking for a durable replacement for the rope part.
3.0,Not as opaque as I Would like and more like hosiery than socks. Fine for the price.
3.0,you pay what you get.
3.0,Nice but much smaller than expected
3.0,The design of this costume is great and as usual made with great materials that will hold up for a long time. The only issue I had this this suit is that the pants were extremely large especially in comparison to the jacket. Being a size 31 waist the jacket fir properly but the pants were so big I could almost fir a hula hoop around my waist with the pants covering it and look like a clown. If you're handy with a sewing kit or a machine you can easily trim them down a little bit and make them the proper size. Just be cautious and know what you're buying as the pants are really big.
3.0,The clips are in my field of view more than I would like. The darkness is right on
3.0,"The color is gorgeous but the straps on this are set wayyyyyy too wide and the finishing on the garment is of mediocre quality.  I asked a tailor about it and he said there wasn't anything he could do because moving the straps in would make the arms hang funny, and shortening the straps wouldn't keep them from falling off my shoulders.  If they were longer,  I could X them in the back but alas...  I can't wear it."
3.0,very cute. although I bought for my 4 year old daughter and they were too small.. these are small for new borns or month olds.
3.0,"If you wash it, it will bleed all over everything else in the load.<br />This is true for the red and the green.<br />It also shrank in the wash.<br /><br />I like the fit and it is very comfortable.<br />Just wish my clothes were all the colors they started at."
3.0,"I liked the item and it fit. However, it reeked so of mildew that I probably wear it for the occasion that I bought it for."
3.0,Umm this top has potential but it's weird its too tight and the bottom is very odd and tight.
3.0,"Based on the description, I thought this was going to be a nice sturdy, waterPROOF material.  The length and the fit are nice, but that's not why I wanted a RAINcoat.  It's kind of ridiculous how most people rate these raincoats based on color and fit, and it's hard to find out if they are even waterproof.<br /><br />This one is, like all the rest of the Chinese raincoats in this price range, made of some thin water RESISTANT material.  I have nothing against Chinese products--I buy many of them and appreciate (usually) comparable quality at a lower price.  But in the case of raincoats, it seems their aim is simply to be lightweight and packable.  Actually keeping you dry doesn't seem to have a high priority.  And it's frustrating to spend literally HOURS and HOURS going through search results for WATERPROOF and rain PROOF, scouring through the reviews, and finding hundreds of cheap products that don't do the job.  You pretty much have to search for a reputable name brand to get through the glut of Chinese products.  Don't just search for 'waterproof' because all these cheap raincoats claim to be that, but apparently (according to reviews) are not.<br /><br />That being said, it is hard to even find a waterproof raincoat for less than $50.  But if you will spend your time more fruitfully, search a name brand and look at the jackets you like.  There are usually a number of size and color options, and usually several of them are marked down substantially in  price.  You'll just have to take the time to select different colors you like in the size you want, and see what price comes up.<br /><br />After spending a couple of hours doing that, I returned this and bought a Charles River Apparel, waterproof New Englander jacket.  It is pretty simple--no inner pockets.  But at least it seems like it will be rainPROOF.  It goes past the hips.  There were about 20 color options and prices ranged from $47 to $57.  It seems to be well-made.  I am about 5'5"", 150 lbs.  I bought a large and it fits as expected with room for a microfiber jacket underneath.  I have long arms, but the sleeves are just long enough."
3.0,Cute leggings. Nicely made but no compression.
3.0,Returning for a smaller size. Love this dress but it definitely fits a little bigger than I expected. Usually a medium but having to go  down a size to a small.
3.0,"They were not as long as I expected. They barely go above my knee, and the picture indicates they come 2-3 inches above the knee."
3.0,I am a US 12 and this looks like a US 6.
3.0,Not the best product. It is an okay t-shirt. I would not repurchase it​.
3.0,I ended up returning this skirt. It looked like a bag Halloween costume skirt. Very wrinkled and crushed when it got it and not very flowy. The company was very nice about the return.
3.0,Not well made and snug fit
3.0,"Dress is very cute but was a little small, so I ordered a large and that was even smaller than the medium!"
3.0,"Clicker was way too short. Cute ring, I wish I could have worn it. Silver did not look authentic, returned."
3.0,"So let me clarify. 5 stars for how this works on silver! Used it on jewelry and it worked pretty well. HOWEVER, be aware that you aren't supposed to use this on porous stones. &#34;Like: pearls, opals, coral, lapis, malachite and other soft stones&#34; that's a direct quote from the paper that came with the cloth.<br />I'm a little peeved because it doesn't say this ANYWHERE in the description. Just double checked!! Almost all the jewelry I was going to use this on has lapis. A set my husband got me, all with lapis inlay. I wouldn't have bought this if I'd seen that."
3.0,Very toyish looking.
3.0,"Would be so much better if it was 100% cotton terry.  I was looking for a ""wearable towel"" which this really isn't."
3.0,"Garment is not as pictured and is too small, disappointed."
3.0,Liked the look but it was still too big for my wrist.
3.0,"Good quality, comfortable for moderate time periods. Keeping it."
3.0,SMALL....but cute.
3.0,"It's cheaply made compared to the belts the Army uses; wouldn't trust it with my life. Still, it works; can be cut to length."
3.0,good wallet....when i first received it and tried to put in 6+credit cards+insurance cards+receipts so this point everything is good so far & I can fold it!! BUT when I put 15$cash in!! it will NOT fold together and I tried several different ways it will not fold when I put cash in!!==&#62; so I returned it.  Noland
3.0,This dress is gorgeous! I gave it 3 stars because it is tight in the chest for me. I have to wear a cami with it.
3.0,looks very cheap on. i sent it back . the cut was unflattering
3.0,Hurts to put on or take off but once its on its ok just feels weird
3.0,"Nice belt, but my waist was a little larger."
3.0,seems a bit large for the average wrist size
3.0,It's ok. The dress looks faded when stretched.
3.0,I bought one size up and it fits good.
3.0,"Very cute, but too small! My daughter’s foot measures 160mm, so I bought a 10 (165mm) to give a little room to grow, but I could barely get these on her feet. Returning for an even larger size."
3.0,Love the concept but still haven’t figured out how to easily use it. I end up just doing it the old way...
3.0,"This top is loose and billowy so I wanted to return it and size down. The smaller top fit OK but one sleeve was sown in incorrectly. This top is also very sheer. Even if you wear a nude camisole underneath, it can be clearly seen."
3.0,the compress shorts underneath were to loose.
3.0,"It fits fine, although I am disappointed it doesn't heat up as much in terms of surface area (the only places it will heat up at are at the collar bone area and the upper back and neck.) I guess you can't expect as much when it is only running on 7 volts. For around the same price, I am regretting I didn't buy a heated Dewalt jacket that gives out better heat longer at 20 volts."
3.0,"I have several pair of Bandolino jeans, all the same size. This the first pair that were way too tight."
3.0,"Works for the costume I need them for, but if you have large calves like I do, expect a tight fit as unlike the rest of it, the fir trim is NOT elastic and does not stretch!If it did, these would be perfecto!"
3.0,The material was quite scratchy; I returned it.
3.0,these look fine but they are too big.
3.0,Somewhat small....
3.0,We used these for soccer. Ok for the price but not very thick or will not last
3.0,They are beautiful but smallish.
3.0,I love how soft and comfortable it is. But I’m deducting stars because the crotch and one shoulder came ripped; as if someone too tall tried it on and returned it.
3.0,If you carry weight in your belly this won’t be good for you
3.0,"Nice, but... for what I wanted its a little clunky"
3.0,"True to size.<br />Did not last very long before they started to show serious signs of wear. Good if you want something to last the summer, but that's about all you will get out of them."
3.0,"The dress didn’t look like it did on the model which was fine, but the fit was not flattering.  I took a pic of me in it to show my friend.  She said I look pregnant.  I am 5’5, small framed and it way short, I would’ve had to wear leggings.  I found a better fitting one for less and got in 3 colors."
3.0,"Needs a slip! Very see-through. It’s cute, but on my body type I just don’t think it’s *it*. Besides that, it’s a cute dress.<br /><br />The buttons are a tad bit weird to work with at first, and the wrists on the sleeves were a little bit tight. I ordered a medium (bust: 38, waist: 29, hips: 40) and it fit alright."
3.0,A little disappointed because there is not much purple color to them. They are mostly clear. I will wear them anyway but got them to go with a rough amethyst necklace and they don't match too well.
3.0,"I didn't like how transparent it is, wish the material was better i liked the design"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this shoe and hoped that it came perfect with no issues because I absolutely love the design. However I got a size 6, and the right sandal fit perfectly no problems at all. The left shoe strap that curves was alot tighter than the one on the right sandal? To add to that, the rose design on the bottom of that sandal was made so thick that everytime I make a step it feels like something thick like gum is stuck to the bottom of the  shoe located where the big toe is. The shoe itself is so adorable but I have to admit the quality is cheap. However, I'm going to try to look past everything and hope that the shoe lasts, because I just love the design of the shoe so much."
3.0,They don’t work for what I purchased them for. The lenses are too dark to wear when driving at night.
3.0,It's to tight around the crotch area if you have big thighs. Im about 5'8 195lbs. I normally wear a 16 and I ordered an XL according to the size chart. Need to get a XXL.
3.0,"So I ordered this to have something to wear in the hot seasons, Spring and Summer! I thought that the material would be cool and I would enjoy lounging around in this little Summer Dress. It came and I was so happy with the material. It is nice and cool as I expected! The thing that is not something that I anticipated is that this dress is made sort of small. It has a lot of give and is very stretchy, so even though it is made kind of smaller for the size, it will work. I really wish this company would offer larger sizes as I would make for a more comfortable fit, however I am going to make this thing work. I love the design and just the overall look of this Summer dress. If you are larger sized like me, order a larger size so that you will have a more comfortable fit. This dress fits just above my knee and I am 5ft 4inches tall. If you are shorter then this is of course going to come down a little bit further than right above the knee.<br />I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"Very cute sandals, but the back straps started falling apart after having them for only 2 weeks. My toddler has worn them approximately 6 times and normal wear/ activities. Very cute.. wish they help up a little better!"
3.0,"returned this product as it did not have a nose wire. Other than that. Found them comfortable, but it was my mistake as they do not mention having a nose wire."
3.0,It looks nice in the picture but I was looking for one like I had from when I was in the military. This one feels good but it was made in China and some of the strings are already coming out.
3.0,"These are cute, and very soft.  However I don’t think they’re well made. When I put them on they seem to fit well, but if I stretch my fingers apart at all there are big gaps in the stitching so my skin shows."
3.0,"It was okay up until it broke not to long after I got it, which wasn't that long."
3.0,Not reinforced at the draw string top.  I got out my needle and thread and did it myself.  Time will tell if the bag hold up - I hope so - I like the flag design.
3.0,Cute but I am smaller side with wife hips the pockets make me feel like I am even wider there :( not where I want to be wider I guess and the material is hot heavy it would be super cute as a fall dress but not as summer
3.0,They look kinda cheap up close.
3.0,Not too practical.
3.0,I purchased this shirt for Christmas for my 10 year old cousin who likes Buzz Lightyear. I liked that the design wasn't too kiddie for him. The only drawback was that there was some stray ink on the bottom of the shirt. Not a big deal. I just didn't have the time to take it to be returned and purchase another one before I needed it.
3.0,The size runs small and the seams came apart quickly.  Loved the dress though.  Tried to order a bigger size for my granddaughter as this was a Christmas present but no longer available.
3.0,Love the top but do not like the bottoms.
3.0,"This is certainly a comfortable tank top, but mine looks nothing like that photo.  Yes, it's a coral colored racerback, but there are no pleats or waves in the front at all.  Instead, it's just kind of a huge, flat tent of a shirt.  And it is HUGE.  I ordered a size up because I wanted to be comfy and I wanted those pleats to really stand out, but since there are none, it did no good.<br /><br />If you order this top just expecting a flat, loose racerback tank, you won't be let down.  It's super comfortable and I'll keep mine, but I do wish it looked more like the photo, since that's the whole reason I purchased it."
3.0,Colors looked too dull for the price. It was vintage looking but not in a good way.
3.0,It's a soft shirt which makes it comfortable but it's long.  Perfect for tall skinny people but not so much for short people with a few extra pounds...
3.0,"Not as thick as I would have liked, but definitely worth the money"
3.0,"This sweatshirt looks really thick and warm, but it's not. There's no lining inside, so while it's quilted and seems thick, it's actually pretty thin. I ordered a Medium (I'm 5'4"" and 113 lbs), and it fits well. I'm glad I sized up as a Small would have been tighter than I wanted. The pull tab ends look like cardboard and really make the sweatshirt look crappy, so I cut them off.<br /><br />Overall, this is just ok. I feel like $28.99 (as of this review) is more than this is worth, but if you love the look, then go for it. It isn'tt terrible, but if I had paid for this, I would be returning it."
3.0,The sleeves and ruffles and bottom aren't hemmed. Raw edges but won't unravel.
3.0,"Great quality 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽....however, this dress is not for a plus size diva like myself. I weigh 210lbs and bought XXL...the dress fit above the knees and very tight around my hips and butt. It will ride up when you walk if it's not the right size. Really wished you had a bigger size."
3.0,"Is just ok, nothing special, but when I bought it I expected it to look like the picture, maybe it looks like that on some ppl but not everyone."
3.0,"I'm 160pds, 5&#34;2 and I ordered a large, it was way too big. The material was great and it flowed perfectly but a friend of mine could wear it and she's over 300pds"
3.0,This top looks ok but is way too small. I didn't even try it on. I usually wear a 36 D and ordered a 38D figuring I wanted more coverage. The under bust measurement was actually 31 stretched!!! I will be returning this top
3.0,These earnings are cut but the yarn stick together (static)
3.0,This is cute but I wish you could order seperately I order an xl the bottom fit the top was small but I still<br />Rocked it.<br />@msfashionmyworld
3.0,"The fit is fine. I just don't like the stiff texture. It feels like the print, which is very nice, was thickly painted on the fabric. It does not feel soft or drape well because of that and did not soften with washing."
3.0,"plain, still reviewing the item........still may return item..........Aloha"
3.0,So cute in concept but it is snug and awkward to put on.
3.0,"Pedí M pero corrió grande, debi pedir S."
3.0,"Fabric is fragile, but I'm going to Egypt so at least it will be breezy. Made for much shorter people than my 6'0 seeing as the pockets are next to my boobs."
3.0,"I like the pants overall, but I found that they did fall down during a run. I now use them to wear for walking, yoga or just running errands. I find that this happens to me a lot, so it may be my body shape or something that makes it happen more."
3.0,"But it's beautiful and I think I'm gonna buy another one, one size up!"
3.0,The skirt material looks cheap
3.0,"Very cute, comfortable and fits me well (""small"" for 5'4, 120) but thin material. It's not totally black anymore (can see through it) on the places it stretches more (thighs). Very cute otherwise! Too tight to put tights under."
3.0,Too thin not enough protection
3.0,"I am 5’7”<br />230lbs<br />40 DD prefer tops 3-4X<br />Pants 19 Jr or women’s 20<br />(For size reference.)<br />The string like material to lace up the front and back openings was way too short, so I cut the flaps from the sides so it wouldn’t need to be tied in back. Then combined the two string like things so it fit the front perfect.<br /><br />I dyed the chemise but since it was made from varying materials it didn’t come out uniform in color, also instead of coming out green as intended, it came out aqua blue. (Polyester mostly)<br /><br />Other than that it was pretty sturdy and lightweight.<br />I’ve included two pics of what it looked like out of the package and what the final look came out to be.<br />I highly recommend a hoop skirt or pretty thick petticoat to go under this outfit.<br />I had a thin petticoat that didn’t poof it out enough so I rigged up a 3 hoop skirt into the chemise.<br />That gave it enough umfh to be able to walk without tripping on the ends.<br />It was for our office Halloween costume contest. Nothing spectacular.<br />I was happy with the end results."
3.0,"Meh. The pants are cute but when I washed the top the bow part came undone and idk how to put it back lol so that’s disappointing. It is also wrinkly now. Looks weird on her, and part of the top stays lifted it up. But that’s not the sellers fault. Idk if I was supposed to dry it or not, I didn’t dry the pants. I aired dried it. I should have air dried the top too, but I forgot it was amongst the clothes lol and it’s hard to see since it’s black. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ Only I would forget that it was in there"
3.0,adorable dress! It's just too thin material. Like nylon. Can't really wear it on a breezy day because it will fly up or mold to your crotch/butt.
3.0,"I did not like it a lot, like I thought I would. Maybe I picked the wrong color. Fit a little on the small side"
3.0,loose thread on thumb opening. Other than that they are fair.
3.0,The pair of leggings I received look nothing like the photo.
3.0,This thing will strangle you!
3.0,"If you're blessed up top ladies, go a size larger. I read the reviews and everyone my size was able to fit the XL but it wouldn't even go over my top portion. I loved the color and the dress and had to do last minute for my brother's wedding"
3.0,Have to wear it with a skirt underneath
3.0,Received these as a Father's Day gift.  Shipping was quick and they arrived well packed.  Construction is solid and the lenses fitered the sun very well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the lens color was NOT cognac like displayed in the picture.  They were more gray-ish.  Debating on whether to keep or return as I was expecting the same color as worn on the show
3.0,"The idea is nice but I agree with other reviewers, it’s cheaply made so the top separates too much. Would’ve returned it but was away during the return window."
3.0,"Fits like a 3x, but nice quality."
3.0,Ok shoe but not as well built as ones I've had in the past.  Very lightweight which is good and bad.  Next time will go for a heavier sole.
3.0,It's ok... fits tighter than what I normally wear and so I will be giving them away.
3.0,"Love the shirt, but was disappointed that the neck did not fit correctly.  One side did not lay flat and stood out from neck."
3.0,The pink is more skin toned so people though I had growths on the back of my ears.
3.0,"The bottom fits fine, a thong for sure but the top would only fit an A or B cup, very skimpy. Can’t use it and missed the return window."
3.0,"The gloves are incredibly warm. However, the inner lining is real tight and sometimes makes it difficult to get the gloves on. The tightness of the liner restricts hand movement a bit and since I bought these for riding a motorcycle it is a bit clumsy. The touchscreen portion of the gloves does not work so I have to remove the gloves to use a touchscreen. If you get these gloves I would recommend getting one size bigger than you normally wear."
3.0,Despite the fact that they are clip ons they don't hurt and are SUPER light....my mom loves them! and they are super sparkly
3.0,"These glasses fit very large. I don't mean on the face, since the style is sort of meant to fit that way, but on the head. They were so wide they wouldn't sit anywhere near my ears let alone stay on my face, and I'd say I have a smaller to average head size. Without being able to properly wear them, it's hard to give a thorough review. However, the colors were nice -- classic. They probably wouldn't hold up well to being tossed in a bag as they are prone to scratching and don't have the strongest frame, but hey they're stylish and affordable."
3.0,"Color pattern is great. Wish the straps could have a removable option. Cups are about a half size too small for my bust. I'm a 34C. The torso length is slightly too short for me, even though I'm already short. I'm 5ft."
3.0,Even though i got my correct size. The cup size runs small
3.0,I bought this for my 5 year old grand daughter for PreK graduation. Based on reviews I thought it would fit her little wrist. Way too big. We were both disappointed. It is a cute (a bit heavy) bracelet but not for little people.
3.0,"Just ""ok"" product. Sizing runs larger than average"
3.0,"This earring is gorgeous, but I could not get it into my cartlidge. And fortunately it doesn't fit anywhere for body piercing jewelry for me. Which is really sad because I wanted it to work!"
3.0,So I bought 2 pairs same size same everything. One pair fits perfect the other is too short I can pull them and stretch them to the length I need but they should be the same length.
3.0,This is a good start but a more robust band(s) solution is needed.  It is only... &#34;meh&#34;
3.0,The hat was as described and fits well.  The problem is that the button on the crown of the hat was missing leaving a metal pin tip exposed.
3.0,i almost always get a medium should have got smaller and that is rare for me to wear a small i am 5foot7 135lbs and 36c and i feel like there is to much fabric  on the bottom and the arms are long and broad i am going to hem it up put a snap on the back to make it smaller because it is still a cute dress i should have whent for the smaller size
3.0,Fine fabric cute dress. I thought the product will be full length and was therefore disappointed in the length but overall nice dress
3.0,"The phone fits perfect, but the spine needs to be wider to allow storage of the stylus that comes with it and more than 2 cards!  If you use more than 2 cards it will not close, because the spine is too narrow."
3.0,Got a lot of compliments however I wasn’t a fan of the length and flow. I wanted it longer and hoped the material flowed nicer 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,Cute but some fall apart quickly.
3.0,It was cute but zipper broke the second time wearing it
3.0,"The size is not accurate, everything else is spot on."
3.0,Nice cotton pj’s. Love cotton.
3.0,"The quality is good enough for the price. The ties are okay for effect. They come folded, so there is a horizontal crease every 6 inches which needs to be ironed out. Ironing did not completely flatten the creases."
3.0,"They seem to be nicely enough made, but they just feel awkward to me. I can't really get into these at all."
3.0,Seems a bit big. Hoping it will shrink some
3.0,"The top was small even though I went with the largest size, I have to wear a sports bra under the top because of my size and I purchased longer spandex swim shorts separately for my own modest reasons. Would have chosen more aquatic colors but suits for larger women seem to reflect the same boring colors. The suit itself seems fine so far. Because of the above mentioned alterations I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,Not very sturdy. Flimsy.
3.0,I am broad shoulder and have bigger breasts. I am usually a size 10. I got a medium. It fits. BUT - I looker extremely HUGE on top. If I had gone a size larger - the bottom part of the dress would have been too big. I wear it w/ a decorative scarf and it looks great. PS - I bought this mostly because I need a few long sleeved casual dresses. This works.
3.0,Very well made but while they were more snug than regular socks they didn't really feel like compression socks. I will keep wearing them as nice knee high socks.
3.0,Should have ordered a bigger size as I carry weight in my stomach and have broad shoulders/bigger chest
3.0,This is not accurate to the true akatsuki pattern. The fabric is backwards. Had they just turned it when manufactured I would have been right. Also the neck part is just fabric and does not stay up at all. The length is shorter than expected  and is missing some clouds on one side. But if you arent picky it should do the job. Accessories are fine . Overall cloak is not uncomfortable and ok. Just not accurate.
3.0,So I have used stuff like these before but these ones are kinds of weak. The snap held my mailbox/apartment key and it fell off at some point when I wasn't paying attention. No idea where they are and I will have to pay for new ones now. I guess that's what I get for buying a cheaper version than before.
3.0,The body of the shirt was way too wide and the sleeves were a bit too short. I’m not a long armed person but luckily I’m in Florida so I just scrunched they sleeves up and did a 1/2 tuck. Also the sleeve fabrics was weird and felt like woven plastic. It was very strange. The image on the front faded with 1 wash so that was a bummer but it was cheap so you get what you pay for. This is great if you need a cute shirt for 1 event.
3.0,"I’m super impressed that a watch of this *possibility* is even available at this price point, but I have to be honest in my review. In other words you’re so close but you have to catch your mistakes before sending them out. I don’t know how a watch I received can get past quality control w/ as simple a function as turning the bezel unless you don’t have a QC department. I just got it a few days ago & it seems fairly accurate but I always figured math played into the equation when balancing & putting these time pieces together. My bezel is so far off center that it either moves quite easily or I have to muscle it when it’s going around the corner where it’s touching the crystal…I hope that makes sense?<br /><br />I have a $1200 Carrera I recently received & the bezel doesn’t even turn! I can’t tell you my displeasure opening that one. At that price point don’t you just assume it turns & is real w/o having to check specs? This is why I feel I don’t have too much right to complain bc this watch checks most of the important boxes (minus a screw-down crown maybe). I almost spent the extra $100 on the Pagani BB homage but liked the thicker case on this one so I gambled. If this were a $250+ watch I would’ve given 1-2 stars but I was also so pleasantly surprised by other things on this time piece.<br /><br />Sloppy back play sucks alone & leaves a bad first impression but extreme lateral play to the point of being humorously off-center makes me think the last guy touching the watch is “eye-balling” the bezel placement w/ zero quality control. I haven’t decided whether to swap it out but I should…I’m one of the few that uses it for many tasks. Would I recommend it? I totally would IF you knew you’d be getting a good unit that wasn’t w/ defects."
3.0,"Somewhat small but, I've been looking for Komesichi for quite awhile to go with my Yukata."
3.0,"solid on hand , light and shiny look.<br /><br />it had a not working buttons which is the only negative thing in many watches , I don&#34;t know why ?!<br /><br />but like the shape not the functionality"
3.0,Cute novelty ring.  Don't wear it daily.  It turns your finger colors I. A short time.
3.0,"Have another exact one like this, returned and ordered from same page same size ran 5"" shorter than the other one I have...Sizes are all over the place."
3.0,"Once you open it, be careful! The pieces can easily shift to other size section and fall out entirely.<br /><br />Good amount of pieces for the price though. Bad box design"
3.0,"I got this bagame in hot brown color. The color and the size of the bag looked good in the picture. However, the color is more on the tan side and size is more rectangular side ways than length wise as shown in the picture. Also, handles also kept slipping off my shoulders. The leather seems to be a good quality. If you are ok with the bad being rectangular side ways and a lighter brown color or tan bag, you will probably like this. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"Do not believe the picture.  The picture show the skirt as being very full of greenery this is not the case.  In order to duplicate the &#34;grassyness&#34;/fullness of this skirt you will need to wear 4+ skirts layered over each other.  Its not too bad but you will need to wear something underneath (or not hehehe!) as it is skimpy with the greenery, the length is about right in the photo."
3.0,The sleeves is too short and too small
3.0,"One mask did not survive its first washing, before any wearing use at all...came out of the dryer with a big  2-inch hole in the main seam.<br />The other four survived and are very comfortable. I like the extra under-chin piece, makes for a good  fit."
3.0,"Nice sweaters sizing was off in my opinion normally a XXL is a little big which I like for over dress shirts but these were little snug, maybe a slim fit cut."
3.0,Packaging was impressive. Cost more than the product.
3.0,The color was not what I expected.  I wished it had actually been turquoise and NOT blue.
3.0,The overall design is cute. But the bloomers are huge. The top seems to fit loosely but it fits. The material is extremely soft and appears to be durable. I just wish the fit was a little tighter.
3.0,"Thie product looks great on the model. But for those of us who need some help looking a little slimmer and less blocky, well, this doesn't work so well. I found the wires to be in the wrong place (too low and digging in), the removeable cups were all over the place (really, why would anyone remove the cups?), and the inner bra was not supportive enough. I got some tummy control, but the way my body filled it, I looked like a block instead of showing off a little bum. Bottom seams were disappointingly unfinished - meaning the swimsuit will maybe last a season. I just expect a little better after having two swimdress style suits from this brand. I really need that empire waist and A line."
3.0,Large and they would not return without you paying shipping cost.
3.0,"No tag in the back of the collar, so it is difficult to figure out front from back.  They shrunk in the wash quite a bit."
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife):<br /><br />This maxi dress is elegant with a square neck and flattering fit.  The material is stretchy polyester with a bit of spandex so it is very ""forgiving"" of any ""problem areas.""  The dress is not lined, but for the fantastic price ($37.99 at the time of this review), you get what you pay for.  The navy blue color is stunning.<br /><br />My only criticism is the length.  I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size 10 or medium in dresses.  I got the medium in this dress and it is WAY too long.  Even high heels could not cure this problem.  I will need to decide whether I want to pay to have a $38 dress hemmed.  I suspect that it will cost more for alterations than I paid for the dress."
3.0,"Super cute dress, but the fabric is very thin. I just wore a black slip under and it was fine."
3.0,"Just what I was looking for. They are very light weight and super comfortable. Enough support through out the show. Just love them. Unfortunately the seller FORPIT, sent the wrong size. I order size 8, and they sent size 8.5."
3.0,Only good for one time use in my opinion which is okay for me because I lose my earrings. If you want something that’s great quality and that will last this is not it. They also rust quick.
3.0,"This is not as long as stated.  As a taller woman, it is not good.  It hits at my knees and is not below my knees.  Material is nice.  Machine wash and line dry."
3.0,Too shiny and too short
3.0,"I love this purse & that it has my favorite bible verse on it. I only gave three stars because the description says it's black, but it's not. It's actually brown with a gold shimmer over it."
3.0,"Nice dress, but not custom made.  Not the best.  So it's not a perfect fit, but it works. Size runs a bit small comparing to American size.  The chest area is not perfectly sewed in measure/made.  Sleeves are shorert than I expected."
3.0,"After reading all the reviews , and the seller saying order up a size, still too big. I wear a 10 jean, so I order a XL . I threw them in a hot washer and dyer , hardly changed. I will use them for gardening , but way to baggy for going out in public."
3.0,"I had to return this, but like other commenters, it's good for more top heavy, women. Otherwise, it was really cute"
3.0,I assumed these would grip the back of my heels but no. They have that loose flip flop fit that I do not care for walking in.
3.0,If you wear a large you may want to order the next size up.
3.0,"PJ's were way to big, so I had to return them!!"
3.0,"One earring was about a half inch longer than the other. I got them for a friend and she was a trooper and wore them anyway. No one noticed, but probably because everyone at the disco party was drunk."
3.0,This is not a knitted dress it’s a very heavy thick material but it is not knitted. The green color is much much darker than appears in photos. It is a nice dress but not as described
3.0,They are very small and fall out easily
3.0,Smell sucks.
3.0,The handle on watch was shaky. But was pretty style
3.0,Sholder straps are too long. Cups are too low!
3.0,This sweater runs very big.  The color was beautiful.
3.0,"Very good quality pocketbook. The leather is better than I imagined. It is advertised as medium, but is larger than I like to carry."
3.0,A lot smaller than I expected but it's a cute bag!
3.0,"I thought I was ordering a turtleneck ,but received a v neck . Cute top though ."
3.0,I should have paid more attention.  It’s a nice item but when you attach it on each side of your garment it leaves a gap so it does not close like a button would.
3.0,It is good but it is better price to get all rings for twenty dollars then one for twelve dollars
3.0,"Dress is cute, thinner material, extremely long. I am 5'3&#34; and it goes to the floor"
3.0,No stretch runs small ordered extra size did not help. Will not recommend.
3.0,"I loved the idea of the outfit, however , the fringe comes off easily making it a choking hazard ."
3.0,It’s a little tight for bigger arms but as far as protection works very well.
3.0,Colors are not as vibrant as in picture. Has a silky feel to it. Will keep as have nothing else to wear blouse.
3.0,it wasn't what i was expecting. quality not the best
3.0,"I believe I ordered a large pair and I received Extra large, which are too long. Also, these don’t have a band to hold the extra length of the straps in place. When wearing these the straps just get in the way. Otherwise, these are good quality material."
3.0,"My son loved the jacket fit and style, but was disappointed that the wording was not in a foreign language like advertised but in English and misspelled."
3.0,"it’s beautiful and nice to have but dont last long. the screw in the top is weak, and if now careful will fall apart."
3.0,"This is really cute and my 3 year old loves it. I purchased the M 3/4 size for our trip to FL in February (along with a Minnie-styled one). The kiddo has outgrown 3T and is steadily in a 4T size so I thought this would be perfect. However, while the bottom is actually a little snug (and probably will be too small come summer in NY), the top is WAY TOO BIG (I can fit 4[!] fingers between her spine and the loose fabric). I'll have to figure out how to stitch it without ruining it because I can't go a size smaller due to the snug bottoms. I've knocked off two stars for this inconvenience because the suit wasn't that pricey, I'm handy with a needle and thread, and my daughter loves it. Honestly I'd probably return it if my daughter hadn't fallen in love with it."
3.0,"Color is awesome, but I didn't think the fit was too flattering. The crotch if kind of low and the back makes my but look like a grandma butt haha<br />You can see the pocket line too. It is super comfy though. I am 5' 6"" and 135lbs ordered a medium."
3.0,"I had such hopes for these shirts, but they are just too tight.  Also after a couple of washings the stitching started to come undone."
3.0,Adorable shoes. But they fit small so order up ladies. I ended up not wearing because of a comfort issue with my left shoe. However it may have been an issue with my foot not the shoe itself.
3.0,Order a size up if you have little ones. I don’t know if the larger size would fit an older child. I have a 4 and 6 year old and I had to order the 7-12 to get it over their heads.<br />The mermaid print is silky and soft. The sugar skull is a little rough but they love it.
3.0,Too HUGE!!! BUT wallet would fit better if it wasn't so  big it's like a Pitcher's MIT
3.0,"This skirt was a bit snug in the elastic waistband. However, the color matched what I expected, the material is nice and the length is good, just a tight waistband."
3.0,came with  dent in the toe and some discoloration on the left shoe.  they fit okay for 10 dollars.  wore with jeggins and tunic.
3.0,It tends to bunch up on both side. It digs into your skin so you might as well have wire. Very pretty bra.
3.0,Didn't wash well.  Ok for the price though.
3.0,It is a beautiful necklace looking at her. But it's not original.
3.0,just ok. fit is a bit loose and not a lot of support. Not very flattering but if you are just about comfort they are fine.<br />I prefer a yoga pant to add shape and define curves. These are old lady comfy pants
3.0,"Cute, true to size, comfy. Did shrink quite a bit after wash/dry. The neckline is not as low as the pic shows. I’d recommend hanging dry after cold water wash."
3.0,"Loved the style of the dress. When I received it. the shoulder and chest area were extremely small, then the rest of the dress was alright. The material has absolutely no give, so if you have a larger chest or butt do not purchase this dress. Cute dress too bad it doesn't fit right."
3.0,"The color is bright & pretty for a mask, but it's huge & the ear loops come out too far.  For an average-sized adult-female face it doesn't seal securely enough around the face to be protective."
3.0,They are pretty slim fitting from waist to ankle.  They have good stretch so still<br />Comfortable.  But they get hot when it's warm out and feel uncomfortable.
3.0,"Cute and comfortable , the colors are pretty, material is thin. Great spring shirt"
3.0,Great while they lasted. Not for rough-housing. Didn’t last 9 months. Potentially a distraction for school.
3.0,Tight on my cheeks and it broke towards the end of the night.
3.0,To small for be M !!!
3.0,"Ordered the L - I'm 5'10"" and 150lbs. Might have been my broader shoulders, but the should seams and arms seemed to fit weird. The hip width is also a little large on me, so I'll have to get that altered. Better suited for women with curves and not so much with an athletic build. Length was great. I've worn it twice to work/professional functions."
3.0,"Light weight, should pack well.  Bought for cruise.  We will see if it really wrinkles."
3.0,"Shoes are cute, but the bottoms are very soft and bend easily. Made it hard for my one year old new walker to walk in them. We used them once for pictures and she never wore them again"
3.0,Me gusto la tela muy comodo y fresco.
3.0,"thin material, sort of see through and fits like a large and not an xl"
3.0,"The earrings are very pretty and a nice size, and I understand from past experience that aquamarine shades can vary but the ones I received are nearly white. You have to look really close to see there is any aqua color at all. The ones pictured are much more blue/aqua.  I expected better. I will keep, as they were a gift from my husband, but...."
3.0,I don't like the dress
3.0,"cannot get zipper to come up in back, the arch in my back does not allow for this. pants fit perfectly, zipper sucks."
3.0,"the print is nice, bright and sparkling. unfortunately the material is too thin, even see through. runs a bit small, so feels snug"
3.0,"The best I have found for the purpose, but I still cannot get them to stay on all day."
3.0,"Runs small, order one size up if available. Print isn't as crisp white as description photos show more 'pink' so I'm not sure how many washings it'll survive. Cute and funny regardless."
3.0,"The bracelet is bulkier than I would like, but it came 2 weeks ahead of time. That is amazing!"
3.0,Fraying before one year of use. Never been in a dryer. No pockets.
3.0,"Meh. Fit is ok, a little short in the crotch, stretch is good. Fabric is thin and not very comfortable. I ordered another package - same brand and size - and they were way too small. I sent them back."
3.0,"I ordered this for a Sunday morning event. It was supposed to arrive on Saturday but didn’t come until Sunday night.  Nevertheless less, the quality of the skirt is above par. The fabric is gorgeous but with that being said, there is a lot of it.  I started to alter it but decided not to. I am shorter but wear tall heels. I ended up returning it."
3.0,Cheap band. Definitely get a new band and this is a nice watch
3.0,"Cheaply made, after a couple washes will fall apart and logo will come off"
3.0,"This would have been perfect, but I am busty and the buttons were gaping open.  That is the only reason why I have to return it."
3.0,The stones are wonderful and over all look of the bracelet but the thread (or whatever it was) that it was strung on was very weak and broke almost immediately.  Had to have it restrung.  Need to have a stronger elastic thread.  Otherwise fine.
3.0,Since avoiding sun is a very big issue for me I'm always looking for less ugly sun protection. This hat will be fine and foldable etc. But it looks nothing like the photo<br />Very floppy and brim holds no shape
3.0,"I like the shirt, material is nice, my complaint is the shirt is tight in the arm and shoulder area and the shirt is very long in the back. Its a odd fitting shirt."
3.0,The coat arrived without the belt! Please how can I have it? I need it
3.0,Arrived as promised and described except I ended up giving it to my daughter in law because it was way to small for me. Looked darling on her though!
3.0,"Cheaply made, and the design is so thick that is' kind of hard to see through them.<br />But they work well in a pinch when you're going to a white trash party or a country music festival.<br />I wouldn't recommend them unless you reeeeaaally NEED them and don't have the money for a sturdier-made pair.<br />They're just meh."
3.0,Shrinks to very short when washed and dried
3.0,Too small will reorder a larger one
3.0,These socks are nice but run small
3.0,"I ordered the size I normally would have gotten for my granddaughter, but this outfit was way too small, had to return it."
3.0,I bought these for husband  who has Parkinson's and elimination issues.  These didn't workout as I had expected.
3.0,"bag smells musty...if I can't get the smell out, i'm returning..."
3.0,Very snug! Order a size (maybe even 2) up
3.0,"I ordered this white shirt as a layer for under sweaters. For that purpose it is good. This shirt would have been great but for two things. One, it is slightly small in all dimensions. Two, the shirt is very see-thru. If you wore this shirt alone you would definitely get some looks at you can see right through it!  Nothing left to the imagination here. I kept the shirt because it worked for the purpose I bought it for and it is warm!"
3.0,"This was way too small. Ordered a large because that's what I usually wear. In the description it's says that large would be my size, but it wasn't. I couldn't even get it up last my thighs. Should of known when it's says made in China. Sizing runs small in China. Material under lace was also very thin when I held it up. Lace was kind of thick."
3.0,"The cloth is fine, the fit is fine, but the elbow patch is strangely way above where any average elbow would be. I used a seam ripper to remove the pads on mine."
3.0,Well I like tha quality of material used. Texture was nice too and loved the color combination which was the main reason for ordering this. But I had to return it because it has animal face print and in given pictures it doesn't show clearly what is the exact print. So. .  otherwise it was a nice scarf
3.0,I liked the color & the pic on front. True cut small & very thin
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, which is what I ordered the first time.  It was too snug so I returned it and ordered a large.  It was huge.  It also was so long it was more like a dress.  Returning it also.<br />There seems to be a disconnect in their sizing; one size up should not make a huge difference.<br />And the length is ridiculous.  Too bad, because I thought this would be perfect for an upcoming trip."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter for Chritmas but the shirt was too small for a large size.
3.0,"The bracelet is well made; however, there is only one crystal. The description and picture are somewhat misleading, as it describes Swarovski crystals,but  there's is just the one large crystal.<br />The picture also shows earrings, which insinuates that this is a set, which would make the $89 dollar price tag more reasonable. However, you are only getting the bracelet.<br />Buyers make note that if you are large boned, this may not work as a bracelet if you wish to wrap it 3 times around. It will work if you wrap it twice or as a necklace.<br />I have small wrists and to wrap it 3 times, I have to use the last link (the loosest link)."
3.0,It’s nice but the crop top is just shorter than expected. My daughter is small framed . The pants were decent length but they were big in the waist. She obviously loves the set so that makes me happy as long as she’s good!
3.0,I read all the reviews before purchasing. I came to the conclusion that I should buy a large. Big mistake! They fit me like a regular tank top. Did not do anything for me. I should have bought a medium. My sister who is about 20 lbs heavier then me however benefit from them so I let her have them. I however will not buy them again. I’m 5’ 7” and 166 lbs.
3.0,I couldn't get them in my ears once they were on the posts.  Just didn't work for me.
3.0,"Ordered these for my elderly mother.  She does like them; however, they do tend to slip off her heel even with the strap.  She is unable to wear anything tight on her feet so anyone else might be alright with a snugger pair."
3.0,"I like the shirt other than where the white area's are, they feel different. The shirt is thick so it will keep you warm. The shirt also runs small so I look like a rolled up sausage, not a great look.  I would order 1 size up if you are buying this shirt."
3.0,These are ok.  I found them to be a bit short for being 6'2'' and they rode up when active.  Not bad for the price though.
3.0,Less than ideal fit. Barely stays on face even with adjusting
3.0,"This ring is the same ring as all the other sellers are selling and i suggest buying this one for 1/3 of the price. That being said the blue does not shine at all, its a dark blue and you can hardly see it in the light. I own all the colors of these rings from multiple sellers and noticed they are all from the same manufacturer and the red shines the most. So if you want one that actually looks like the picture then buy the red one."
3.0,Picture did not depict actual product. The item was really small compared to the picture of it. These are the smallest set of cuff links I own!
3.0,"I really wanted to like the dress, but it was very shear."
3.0,They shrink after a few washes
3.0,some of the stones were missing when I received. Otherwise fine.
3.0,better off getting crocs. support and fit was horrible. We kept them as bedroom slippers.
3.0,Love the color and graphic! The material is not what I expected and may not have bought it.
3.0,Metal finish is wearing off but they're still cute.
3.0,"Thicker than expected, but a nice fit"
3.0,I ordered an XL and it was still too small.  It was returned.
3.0,like the hat but the were large
3.0,It does look elegant but keep in mind it is much smaller than the headband in the picture with the girl.  I feel that they should have included a model wearing the actual headband so there's a more acturate illustration of the proportions of the headband.
3.0,"These are ok, after washing the lace curled up and is very hard to make lay flat. I don't think anyone could wear this as a bra, I wear over my regular bra."
3.0,Got dirty with normal wear and impossible to clean.. Very unhappy and not worth the money
3.0,"I thought it was bigger but it's usable,I actually want to put change in it ."
3.0,Like others have commented...it is a little odd to have the single 'bling' at the neckline but it was easily removed. The shirt is very thin but great under a sweater or jacket.
3.0,"Way to small in the bust area, and I'm not even very busty....."
3.0,"It is cute.  It's well constructed.  It feels sturdy.  If you're looking for a case for chunky sunglasses, you might like this one.<br /><br />It's way too big for regularly sized women's glasses.  Mine rattled around on the inside.  It's three times the size it needed to be.  It's also heavy and took up too much room in my purse.<br /><br />It also smelled weird.  The smell would probably wear off after awhile.  In the mean time, it was kinda a plastic-y fart smell.  It could have been the warehouse it was kept in, rather than the item itself, and another order wouldn't have the same smell.  You may not have the same problem."
3.0,Very pretty but a little too small.
3.0,The material was a little cheap but still good 👌
3.0,"Too big, itchy material"
3.0,"It is a polyester type material, which feels cheap.  It runs small.  I even ordered the next size up and it was still too small."
3.0,Pretty suit but one to two sizes larger than I expected. I read that a 46 was equivalent to a 10/12. Not! It was at least a size 14!
3.0,"Its a cute bag but it smells like fish. I have aired it out for a month, sprayed perfume, and stuffed it with newspaper. It still smells. If you arent sensative to smells it will be a good purchase"
3.0,"It fits well, I like the material,  but I don't like the plastic rings attaching the straps to the bra. They dig into my back and itch."
3.0,Returned. Leather quality seemed excellent.
3.0,The tag on these shirts (side seam) is incredibly itchy and uncomfortable. Removing the tag by cutting it near to the seam only adds to the itchiness. Trying to rip the tag out only rips the seam of the shirt. Not that these are very expensive but I honestly did expect a little more out of the price. Colors are fine and they don't get stretched out too quickly while wearing them. Probably would try another brand before buying these again however.
3.0,"My daughter wears a size 10, so I ordered the size 10-12. The writing on the inside of the shirt has an “M” for medium. The shirt is more like a size 7 or 8, which would correspond with a youth medium. It is too small for my daughter, so I’ll just save it for her younger sister."
3.0,"Nice material, but collors not bright"
3.0,Good value for the number....cannot be used if openning of the loop on the pendant is a smal opening.
3.0,Compre un large y salió pequeño
3.0,The beads are too large.  Looks cheap
3.0,I bought these and did not like the way they look on me.  so I did away with them.
3.0,This top runs small.  I would recommend sizing up a size or even two depending on how you want it to fit.
3.0,I like how this is the first corset and it's wonderful. Only downside was the plastic sticks fell out because the stitches around it weren't super secure. I'm a 36G in bra size and I got the biggest size. Also had to adjust the waist with a sewing kit thou. Worked out.
3.0,these were to small so I returned 5them ups # 1z754y4v9012379611 thank you<br />maria
3.0,I really liked the dress
3.0,Very pretty but not what I expected
3.0,Back light is useless at night as it is only on one edge. Prefer smaller watches like this but band is rather short. Casio dependability is expected but only two months use.
3.0,Great print qaulity and sewn well but not the buttery soft fabric I was looking for.
3.0,Not a warm jacket. Fashion purposes only. Can’t be worn outside without layers of clothing.
3.0,I had to hem I am 5 ft 6 and took it up 2 inches it was super long
3.0,"For the $ it's a good deal. They are a good quality stainless steel. The clasp is a little loose so it comes unhooked. It's fixable, so other than that I'm happy with them."
3.0,Item work fine the only problem was it started to come apart the first day I used it.
3.0,The fabric wasn't the  one I expectec...
3.0,Love the material just too long
3.0,Very pretty. I normally where a U.S. women's large. Ordered a 4xl which fits my daughter like a women's small.
3.0,Not as nice as i thought it would be but pretty cool frames
3.0,"This is cute, but for some reason I thought it would be made of silk since it says &#34;ice silk&#34; in the description (I should have known from the price that it wasn't).  It's a silky-feeling material but is 100% polyester.  I'm 5'3&#34; and usually wear a U.S. size 8 dress and it fits fine, a little loose,  and is long enough (since I'm short) to wear some leggings with.  Also, it ships from Shanghai, which I didn't realize.  Overall I'm OK with it for the price but next time I will read descriptions closer."
3.0,"I've had these for 18 months ago - they were my pandemic,  stay at home, live-in slippers.  My feet are wide, and these fit great on width but were a bit long and would flop on my heals. Fits more like a man's shoe.  I added a set of foam insoles to snug them up. Over time the fabric has slacked and now I use two sets of insoles.  The overall materials & stitching have held up well over time.  Sole is still great, though they have daily inside wear, and sometimes use on cement floor (patio, garage, basement).  Have spot cleaned and let air dry a couple times and they've held up well.  Never used in washer/dryer due to red color and fuzz.  Would buy again, but probably in next smaller size."
3.0,The metal is pretty although a little flimsy but that's actually great as I have small wrists and I was able to make it fit better.  It's very pretty and delicate and I received many compliments on it throughout the evening.  No one would've guessed it was under $20!
3.0,They immediately tore where the tag was attached. But they are still cute and fit perfectly...
3.0,The color is duller than pictured. Otherwise they’re fine.
3.0,Looks cheap but ok for a child
3.0,"Cute skirt. I like the flare and it's got a little stretch so it's comfy. Definitely runs small, size up. Smells funny when you first take it out of the bag. The smell lingers after the first few washes....button hole wasn't open. It's an $8 skirt."
3.0,Earrings and necklace is great but ring is not.
3.0,"Material not what I thought, looks very polyester."
3.0,I normally wear 8.5 but these were too small.
3.0,"Dress was all heavy cotton and just laid with no movement. Belt was flimsy, cheap, and wouldn’t stay in place. The dress looked better in the picture than in person. The fit was perfect and to be expected. I wish I would have gone with something a little more fancy for a wedding guest but it got the job done I guess."
3.0,Writing is just printed on the earing not engraved so it rubs off...
3.0,cute gift for my teen. she really liked it but it came apart/broke at the star within 2 weeks of normal wear.
3.0,Love top fit good but shorts to tight uncomfortable but will keep and wear different bottoms
3.0,"Great for the price I guess, except that I will never wear it.  If the dragonfly were small it would be precious,  but it's way too big. The other pins are not so huge, but I bought this  for the dragonfly.  Maybe I can decorate a box with it or something."
3.0,They break pretty easily and get caught on things.
3.0,They were really good a little big tho
3.0,If you like big you might like this.  It was too big for me but almost not worth sending back.
3.0,"I like the material and the style, but they are short and not as flowy as I would have liked. They are ok though."
3.0,The products distressed look in pic with variance of shades is not up to par....it is just completely light wash and I read that ran small so I ordered a med. And I would say it is more true to size. ..but overall the quality and delivery was good just not gonna be the fav. Shirt I expected it to be
3.0,I purchased this for my granddaughter and I have to say upfront that she loves it.  The case came packaged well and looked great.  My only complaint is that it's fabric over compressed fiberboard with hardware that's ok but not spectacular.  Now all of this would be fine if the price was more in the $40 - 50 range.  But what I paid was twice that. My concern is will it hold up to heavy use?
3.0,i loved the color. i love the style. it was a bit bigger than i would have liked but i went up in size because my bust is bigger and i tend to need to go up a size for that area.<br />unfortunatly i wore it to try it on and noticed it was unraveling at the lace bottom side that connects to the shirt. i havent had a chance to see if i can return it and get another one. i hop i can even though it has been so long.  i really super like this shirt.  i am short and the arms went all the way to my wrist but like another review i just rolled it up once and i had the wrist showing like in the pic. was still very cute.  i would give 5 stars if it wasnt unraveling and/or i can return and get another one because i do love this shirt and am hoping i just got a bad one!
3.0,Definitely size up! Super cute BUT also very thin. Thin enough you can see the pattern on a tshirt under it..
3.0,short band good for kid
3.0,We had ordered these before and they could be worn over our glasses fine but these were a little to small and didn’t fit over the glasses.😕
3.0,"I really wanted to like this swimsuit.  The material is very soft and beautiful, but if you are petite and have no boobs, (like me) then this swimsuit is not for you.  I ordered the small size and the cups were way to large and wide.  I even tried adding extra padding and altering the straps, but I was unable to fill out the top.  If you have the boobs, I would recommend this swimsuit.  Otherwise, I wouldn't order this suit."
3.0,"Not my favorite.. In my opinion my normal size ended up being an oversized cardigan. I don't like the placement of the sleeve line, and the sleeves ride up QUITE a bit. But it is pretty comfortable and has some weight to it which I like."
3.0,"I loved the look of this dress and really wanted it to work. The material is very soft. The length is classy. This would work great for pear shaped ladies: broad shoulders and /or larger bust and a tiny waist to make this dress fit. The fit did not work for my build, the straps fell down my shoulders and the side cinch was not flattering."
3.0,"Bought large, went by chart and reviews but it was smaller & shorter than I wanted, will be returning. I’m 160lbs 5’4”. I though I was buying tanks that’s cover my rear and wear under sweaters. Hits at top of hips like a normal tank would."
3.0,"Cute but very short (the side slits make it impossible for me to wear as a dress) and so thin, it's see through! I'll wear it as a tunic with a tank top and tights underneath and it will be cute but definitely not a stand alone dress..."
3.0,They are so cute but give my son blisters every time he wears them without socks.
3.0,Not as good as the Speedo
3.0,"Very sexy, quality suit a little on the small size .... however, if you move in any way whether it be as small as turning your shoulders or moving your arms YOUR NIPPLES WILL POP OUT. If you bend over, it’s quite literally over, mise well find a pole to hop on to."
3.0,I wish they had the pin in the center of the design because they hang down lower than the lobe and makes it harder to see the detail and design.
3.0,will not last
3.0,My daughter liked them. However they are not as thick as I expected and are see through. So unfortunately she won't be wearing them in public.
3.0,"decent, but too big for my fingers"
3.0,"Really pretty, but a bit lose!"
3.0,"Well made item at a great price. I have a large head so the fit was fine. However, the cap has no volumn so it rides very high on top of my head. I'll use it for display."
3.0,Fixed strap on the bottom is nearly impossible to get over my head and when I did it was very tight.  The top strap is fine.  I'm going to have to engineer some sort of new strap for the bottom for this to be of any use.
3.0,Fit was ok but the material had a sheen that I wasn’t expecting after seeing the pictures and reading about it. Bummed but I had to return.
3.0,It kind of worked.
3.0,Very large!!!!!
3.0,"The toe pieces kind of bug you, but overall good shoe"
3.0,missing lock on middle suitcase
3.0,These were great at first and were a HUGE hit with my son who is 6 and has a dream of becoming a Pokemon master when he grows up.lol. However the backs of the pins won't stay on. So they won't stay on the black insert.
3.0,I guess this is OK.  Small size was just what I was looking for but it didn't work for me.
3.0,"I bought this for a masquarade party. The mask fit as I expected. However the design was not very clean. Several of the edges had not been cut and were not even. From far off the mask was cool looking in pictures, however up close you could see all of the imperfections."
3.0,Fits great to my Sword
3.0,Did not come with tool or instructions to change band
3.0,"It's not as nice as the photo. Not as polished, and not as clean sculpt/casting...."
3.0,The hook seems to be a little broader than normal earings. You gotta have a bigger hole to poke it thru.
3.0,"Stunning. And here within 5 days.<br />However it may be stamped 925 but only is only plated, the plating is peeling off and  its copper colored metal underneath, my finger had a green ring on it after 10 hrs.<br />You get what you pay for i guess."
3.0,The daughter purchased these years ago. They were an ok fit
3.0,"Very pretty dress. Length is wrong. I’m 5’5” and ordered a medium. Top fits beautifully and I’m ample chested :-s ...DDD...but the length of the ruffle part hits me under the knee - not midi, not maxi, just meh. Wish it were either a little shorter or a little longer. Can’t wear keds or sneaks with this or it looks like a short house dress LOL"
3.0,This product was ok.
3.0,It's ok.  I thought it was supposed to be insulated like one I have and it is feels like thicker felt instead.  I also didn't like that it zippers back words like a womens.
3.0,"Beautiful case, fits credit and debit cards well, but the elastics break so easily.  They started coming out after a few days, and finally completely broke in a few months.  The clip that was supposed to keep the case closed broke after a few weeks, and the case had to be held closed with an elastic -- not exactly aesthetically pleasing."
3.0,"They are alright. You get a variety sent to you. It's a surprise. I liked a few, but most were colors I hardly wear. The ones shown in picture would have been awesome."
3.0,"Fit is good, however has a cheap feel to it. Certain metal parts bend easily."
3.0,The color is more of a peach color.  The fabric is satin-y. Both of these things were a disappointment.
3.0,Size was too small. Mask was for a child.
3.0,Very pretty but it should state that it DOES NOT come with a bottom.  When the description stated 'ONE PIECE&#34; I thought it was the one total piece needed to use it.
3.0,"I ordered the smallest size in these shoes when my baby was just a couple months old. She is now 5+ months old, and they are still too big. However, they're super cute. I'm excited for her to wear them eventually!"
3.0,"This is a rather preliminary review since I Just received the units. I did not read the Amazon reviews first which was probably a mistake. Pros: four extra batteries, and I thought the alarm was really loud. Maybe not as loud as advertised, but loud enough for the purpose. Cons: Not one word of instruction as to how to use or change the batteries, or even to let you know that it comes with a battery already in. I had to search on the net for the above information and it was not on a site of theirs but in comments by purchasers. If I had just brought this as a gift for my daughter that would have been a real pain.To be determined: Since I haven't carried it with me yet, will see if it goes off on its own. Also, a number of people said that this group has a scam where they put ongoing charges on your credit card by having something in fine print on your confirmation. Glad to be warned and will watch for this and nip it in the bud if I see another charge come through."
3.0,"These were so beautiful when I got them, but they didn't last at all. I had them for about 3 hours before they broke in half. All I did was put them on my head and out of nowhere they broke in half. Look elsewhere if you want cute glasses."
3.0,It is gorgeous and every time I wore it I got compliments. But it i can no longer wear it because it is falling apart. I always washed it on a delicate wash and never dried it but it still came apart. I was very disappointed.
3.0,It was ok... it’s jist like the picture .  I’m not sure what I expected but it is on the cheapy side.
3.0,While I love the cut and shirt in theory it did not live up your my expectations.  I ordered it really large (3 sizes larger) as I wanted it to be flowy and fun but it was almost to tight and its really short in front!!  If your taller than 5'6 expect this to hit you about pubic region!
3.0,These are gloves I bought to wear when forced to interact with other people. They keep me from having to wash my hands as often as I do.
3.0,Unless a size 1-6 maybe… NOT flattering
3.0,"These were a hit at a birthday party, however some kids complained of headache with use in a car."
3.0,Not as sturdy as the picture looks.
3.0,"The bezel insert fell off the very first day I wore this. I was walking and heard it fall on the street. I was horrified that it would be scratched and unsalavageable. But I picked it up and it looked ok. Took it home and applied a dab of superglue to it. It's nothing spectacular but at least it hasn't fallen off again. For the price, it's a pretty good deal."
3.0,Unakle to sufficiently adjust. Loops don't hold
3.0,The color is beautiful they come exactly as pictured nice little box too but when you get them they will not open and you could probably bend them if you're careful but just know that it's going to take some work to get them right if they don't break first I was actually shocked at how bad the post and latch mechanism were defective!
3.0,"Since others say that the sizing ran small, I ordered a 2x. The bodice is so tight! But, I also have DD boobs. The chiffon skirt portion is too big and poofs out like a poodle skirt. I’m wearing this to a wedding, so I don’t mind the issues with the dress since I’ll be wearing it once."
3.0,"When worn with the right thing these are adorable. There are some little issues with the way it was it was machined or manufactured. There are some little blemishes and imperfections, but only seen close up. For the price its a great deal!"
3.0,Not a good quality. A few of them were torn after using twice only.
3.0,"Other than softness, this is a good product as far as quality goes."
3.0,"The description on this item states ""long leopard sweater"" it is not long the quality of the sweater is good. However, it doesn't fit loose or long.. If you want it to fit like in the photo. I recommend choosing a bigger size than what you normally wear."
3.0,The band is rough.
3.0,might have been ok if i could feel my toes. if u need compression daily then not too bad for thin legs if the price is still lower than others
3.0,"Nice, comfie pants in a fun pattern. The material is more of a poly feel than I expected, but will make good summer pj's."
3.0,"the customer service is definitely very good. i actually ended up returning the dress and they gave me a full refund with no hassle. the design is beautiful and it's not mentioned in the description, but it doess come with pockets (which is always a bonus.) would've been perfect if the fabric were better."
3.0,Overall dislike
3.0,These are super cute shorts soft and comfy. I am 5'10 and 145 lb these were tiny and fit me like an x-small. Will most likely order in an X-Large
3.0,Can't stand position can't stay on slides off my nose
3.0,Was a little tight but it’s stretchy
3.0,"They were wonderful at first, but after using a few times one of the claws came off.  It was not being used to really dig. I was only putting new dirt in a pot and digging a hole for the plant.  Disappointed they didn't hold up."
3.0,"I read some of the reviews before ordering this set and a couple of reviews mentioned ordering a size up in order for the set to be comfortable. I would advise against this since that is what I did and it doesn't fit me at all. I am usually small but I worried that the pants would feel too tight so I ordered a medium, well now neither the pants nor the shirt fits well. They are both too large. Even if they would fit though I don't think I would be a big fan because the waistband on the pants feels like compression material and not very stretchy at all, I imagine they would dif into my body if they were my right size. I prefer stretchy material that is comfortable to work out in, son't want to just look good, comfort is more important to me."
3.0,Holes.
3.0,"I liked the feel and color of these socks. I wear an 8.5 shoe and these were just too tight. More at the ankle than the toe though. They were uncomfortable. Perhaps if my legs were skinnier it would be less of an issue, but wearing these made my ankles sore, they just didn't stretch enough, and this was after I washed them."
3.0,"Looks good, works ok, just wish it was a bit bigger as it won't fit a normal size challenge coin. Bummer, but I'll keep it & use with a different coin"
3.0,Love them very pretty
3.0,I think the watch is fine but it is NOT lime!  The color is what threw me.  Like a pea green or mint.  The picture shows more lime than it really is.
3.0,"I just needed some shoes that I could easily take on and off that would work for snowy days in the Midwest. These fit the bill, but they are also lacking. In a way, they are both too big and too small all at once. If I wear really thick socks, they’re not as easy to get on a I’d like, but once they are on, I have more room than I’d like. Also, I don’t find them particularly comfortable. They aren’t uncomfortable (though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time yet), but they aren’t very cushiony, and I find he rubber bit enclosing the foot to be a bit harsh and stiff. It feels like my foot is encased in a hard, and not particularly warm and insulated, rubber shell. In addition, I’m not very impressed by the tread on these. Overall, they’ll do what I need the to do, but my needs are pretty limited. If I was going to spend a lot of time outside, particularly in the snow, I would want something different. To put it bluntly, these feel pretty cheap, and not in a good way."
3.0,This bracelet is really cute. I measured my wrist and I just a little over 6”. I ordered a 38/40/41 M. When I received it I put it on and it was really snug. I have to take it off periodically during the day to relieve the pressure from the band. It’s not comfortable enough for me to wear the entire day. I’m not sure if going a size up would make a difference I feel it would be a tad big and my watch wouldn’t stay in place. Unfortunately for me I don’t think there is a middle ground.
3.0,"These are great no-show socks; however, I did have one sock separate at the upper stitching the first wearing. I know the obvious culprit may be that I pulled too firmly on the sock, but that was not the case. Regardless, I think it's a fluke as the others have held up after multiple uses and washing. The no-slip heal is a nice feature and it keeps the sock from drifting into my show. I can't say if the Deodorant part is meaningful as foot odor wasn't an issue for me."
3.0,Start to tear after a couple washes.
3.0,Costume size fit my 5 year old well. The face mask was cheaper than I expected.<br />It accomplished the job for Halloween and he was happy!
3.0,"It really didn't fit like the picture, but I'm not shaped like the model either. Mine is large and boxy on the torso, but the sleeves are a little tighter than I would like- I couldn't go a size down without cutting them off a la The Goonies. It also wasn't as long as pictured- hit me at the hip and I am 67 inches. Overall though it wasn't horrid just not what I expected. The material was thick enough to not see through and soft."
3.0,It was too small. I went by your suggestion!!
3.0,It was not as good quality as I expected. More Halloween costume type of garment.
3.0,"This is the exact same cardigan as the Biadani I received. I ordered this BILY and a Biadani in what I thought different shades of teal. I received the exact same Celio cardigan for both orders, same color, same brand, and all. Other than receiving the wrong brand, the seems to be a nice cardigan."
3.0,"I found these to be cute, and have a smooth seamless look to them. I don't feel like you can see them under your cloths. I have tried 3 different styles/cuts of these. This particular cut however, I am meh about. The reason for this is I found they kept riding up places you don't want them too. Could just be my body shape but I haven't had this problem with the other cuts like this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />fit well<br />are cut properly<br />Thin material, so it sits nice<br />Almost seamless<br />no random strings anywhere<br />Has cotton lining in important area<br />Has slight stretch<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sizing to me was accurate but slightly confusing. Thought I received the wrong size because of tag but they were not wrong.<br />these tended to move and shift in areas that I didn't love.<br />Just so you know:<br />I received for an honest review."
3.0,Have no issues other than they are too short and i have to wear them pulled up as capris . Which is ok but i bought for cooler weather ...
3.0,"Fabric not super soft, although heavier and will definitely keep you warm. Not loving the tighter rib knot at the bottom...doesn't hug the body well since baggier everywhere else."
3.0,"Nice shoe, however the sizing seems to run large. My son wears a 4 in other brands and that is what we ordered. When he tried the shoes on they are almost a full size too big so we returned for a smaller size."
3.0,Beautiful design. Very cheap material and stitching. Will not last through many washes. I hand washed gently and the little mirrors on the flowers all came off because they are made of some kind of cheap plastic.
3.0,"Nice looking but no instructions to set sub dials, it appears they are only for looks and it would be nice to know up front before selection. This does not look good on Amazons part."
3.0,"Cute, but kinda cheap looking. I bought a different one for cheaper and it was a much better quality. Not worth $10, maybe $4-$5"
3.0,"Love the large bag but it's a bit heavy and the inside middle pocket is a pain.  Going to try to remove that and I think it'll work just fine.  Love the look, love the length of the cross body strap."
3.0,"This purse goes with my Halloween outfit, otherwise I would send it back.  It was worth<br />the 14.99 for the purse but NOT the $9 for postage. It is made of foam and the handle<br />is very short.  I can say I like the fringe on the bottom but overall it is a $6-10 purse."
3.0,It’s honestly small address a little prerogative so I’m keeping it because I love it in that sense if you are a plus size girl I would recommend you get extra large because they do make the large on the small small side
3.0,"Completely agree with all the advice to &#34;size up&#34;.  But for us larger ladies who might be a bit &#34;bottom heavy&#34; let me offer one other piece of advice.  Skip this one.<br /><br />I had seen a review or two that detailed an odd shaping that seemed to happen when wearing this bra, but the overall the reviews were great and I have been looking for something with lift that didn't include an underwire.  The heavier the ladies are, the less and less comfortable that bra gets over the course of the day.  I loved the idea of more material and elastic in places of the terrible wire, and other reviews had my hopes up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, since I am attempting to move more &#34;meat&#34; up from the bottom into the cup, it most certainly does result in an unusual shape once you get into it.  It gets very conical that, if worn in public might be comical.  Madonna would be jealous, for those of us who remember.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was everything I'd hoped.  Fit was great, material was soft and super supportive.  I'm sad I will not be keeping it, but it really does look funny on me.<br /><br />Consider carefully and definitely size up!"
3.0,"(I use this for Downhill MTBing) So it's super comfy, moisture wicking and looks great on the trail but, it just doesn't seem to have the same overall quality I've grown accustomed to from the Fox brand. I've owned many Fox jersey's for MTBing but this one doesn't feel super ""intact"" after a sweaty ride. It does it's job well though and fits as expected (size wise) but I just think my past jerseys from Fox were much better made. Go with Troy Lee, they make great stuff 🤘"
3.0,Pretty good if you have very short arms. A couple of inches would make them much more useful.
3.0,These fit great but feel like you are wearing insulation.  They feel like you are being cut and the itching is unbearable.
3.0,Not exactly what I expected. The material wasn't very comfortable or stretchy. I am returning and will continue looking.
3.0,I brought this watch because of its automatic feature. The watch arrived and looked great but upon wearing it for three days I found that it was inaccurate and lost between 1-2 hours over a 24 hour period . I contacted the company but as of 8/1/2017 I Have not heard back I feel that this watch is defective  but  a great premise . I Loved the look and feel but it is not accurate and I will return it
3.0,Not an expert but there where some parts that look like it might be painted on red. haven't tried taking it off.
3.0,They were nice and I got a lot of compliments on them. However they are not made to last or made to be worn more than once. I hand washed them and hung them to dry and the one pair ripped while placing them one. I will not be buying these again.
3.0,The color was not the same as the picture. It looked to be a royal blue but was navy blue.
3.0,"Strange fabric.  Heavy and stretchy like spandex made into a dress. Fit was not good.  Wore it as a stage costume because it fit the era,  then gave it away."
3.0,"The voice-changing helmet is fun, but it has a couple issues you don't learn about until you've bought it.<br /><br />One, to activate the voice-changing you must continuously press a button located on the front of the helmet. You cannot just turn it on and have everything you say sound like a Cyberman. You have to hold your hand to your face the entire time.<br /><br />Two, there's almost no backside to the helmet. The helmet would be more properly described as a voice-changing mask. The back of the mask contains an adjustable plastic band for keeping the mask on your head. There is a top and curvature to the product making is sort of like a helmet, but it's only impressive when viewed from the front. From the back it looks like a mask."
3.0,"It is not roomy enough for any glasses where the arms don't lie flat.  If there is any depth to the glasses, 2 pair won't fit."
3.0,It's a cute bracelet but I'm a little disappointed to see that the size of the stones are a lot smaller than the picture. I ordered the 8mm/6.5 inches size. I used a peanut in this picture for comparison.
3.0,"Very nice, but run way small.  Had to return them."
3.0,"I got the green. The lace is a weird pink color and just not two shades I would have paired together, but not too awful.<br />Pros:<br />Cute (minus the weirdish color combo)<br />Comfortable<br />Fit as expected<br />Cons:<br />The fabric bleeds even after multiple hand washes.<br />The one side is so short it doesn't cover what it's meant to. (Shorter than the image. I'm 5'8"")<br />It arrived with very faint black marks all over it. I can't get them out."
3.0,"Unfortunately, I washed it just a few times and there was a hole in it! Had to toss"
3.0,"I thought this would be a cloth belt that you could cinch at a given waistline or tightness, but it’s not.  Essentially it’s a giant flat bungee cord that you buckle at the ends.  Yes, there’s some length adjustment by shortening or lengthening the belt at a loop in the belt but that’s it.  Disappointing.,"
3.0,"This top is super super thin, but at least does not have spandex in it.  I wanted it to wear in place of a bra (elastic allergy) and under tee shirts.  The problem is when you put a tee shirt over it the straps and neckline slide unevenly.  This will not keep anyone warm.  I will say it has great lines by itself."
3.0,"Very nice pic, but bracelet was cheaply made. Bracelet actually broke just a few days after wearing it."
3.0,We ordered these for party favors and I have to say that these glasses are cute! BUT...unfortunately when I tried them on it was not great. I thought the lens were just dirty or maybe It had a plastic film that needed to be removed but it didn’t.  The lens aren’t good.  I checked all the glasses and only one was good and you can see clearly while the other 29 weren’t. I guess I’ll be giving these out to the kids rather than the teens.
3.0,"Nice quality vest for basic safety needs. However, the sizes run small. I ordered a 4x and it fits like a 2x."
3.0,Very light weight fabric that doesn't feel like quality fabric. I hope it lasts.
3.0,I bought this to wear due to Covid. It's to thin and needs a secondary mask under it. That is to much of a hassle for me. Also the eyes don't really like up with your own you have to fold the top over. I was considering doing that and sewing a mask in but I don't have the time right now for extra projects.
3.0,"I purchased this same boot years ago at Macy's.  Lucky Brand Hibiscus.  I loved them because they are a great, comfortable fit and fit my calves that are on the narrow side.  I ordered 2 different colors here on Amazon and was completely surprised that they came with a hang tag stating they are made for wide calves.  Nowhere on the description does it say these are for wide calves.  They looked ridiculous and slouchy.  Riding boots are NOT slouchy.  Had to return both pairs.<br /><br />***Edit: This review shows that I purchased the toffee color, which is not true.  I purchased the honey and bourbon, both pebbled leather.  The toffee color is available from a different seller and could, in fact, be the regular width.  The two I purchased were wide-leg.  My calves are 14&#34; at their widest, 14.5&#34;, as the description states, should be perfect."
3.0,"I bought this bracelet to give away as a gift but, my friend can only wear solid gold or silver because of high acid content in her skin. the roses are ok and it looks antique in a way, but I have reservations on the metal or alloy it is made of. I decided to keep because it was a good price. I will wear it with gloves or a costume."
3.0,the seams are iffy
3.0,"Did not fit well, gave away."
3.0,no size fits all
3.0,"This was an okay dress, but a little thin for my liking. I did not like the rouching in the middle, it just didn't look right and drew attention where I didn't want it."
3.0,Brought a large as a gift. It looks like a smaller size.. will not purchase again..
3.0,Nice gimmick
3.0,"it will get better, had a couple of bubbles, my first try."
3.0,"I don't see how they qualify as high impact. A small jump standing in my bathroom and there's a lot of &#34;movement.&#34; But, they'll suffice for what I need them for.<br />UPDATE: One month of owning these and one of them is already falling apart. The back strap is separated from the band. Luckily it didn't blow out on me while wearing it! And I don't wear one more than the others so it's not from over use. I also hang them to dry; no dryer."
3.0,Super cute and comfortable but not very dark and that’s kind of my #1 reason for sunglasses.
3.0,Great feel and comfortable but should be made thicker. Barely lasted a month before holes started.
3.0,"Fits small for an XXL.  Also, longer than I expected."
3.0,"ok, the high ratings are for<br />1) quality of the fabric. Durable and attractive.<br />2) The dress arrived same day which was astonishing!<br />3) Ruching is nicely placed<br /><br />Now the low rating:<br />1) The bow material paled in comparison<br />2) there is a very weird bell shape at the top of the thigh. Bells work great when the line is at the knee but this one lies weird.<br />3) Armpit/bust ratio could be better."
3.0,Its almost see through! I like it other then that. I'll give it to my kids to wear to the pool with bathing suits under it.
3.0,"I have a 33"" inseam and the pants were easily 3 inches to long. Other than that they were great."
3.0,I like the style & size of the purse but it has a terrible smell that I have been unable to get rid of. I have left it outside to air plus put fabric softener sheets in it & still smells. Bought it cause I needed a smaller purse as I just had my 3rd back surgery & was advised to carry no more than 3 lbs for a loaded purse. Would like to return it but I am out commission for awhile & not sure if I will be able to.
3.0,Good value for the money.  Don't expect the best but overall very fair
3.0,Cute on my daughter. The bows come off VERY easy. Would recommend sticking them on with a hot glue gun.
3.0,"Colors are OK, but kinda short and kinda tight!"
3.0,"This cover up fits well. It fits like a shirt. It measures 38 inches around the bust area, 23 inches in length on the front and back of the top, the side was shorter 20 inches from shoulder to waist area which was not specified in the item description so if you are bustier/thicker/taller take that into consideration.<br />If i did know the proper measurements I would have ordered two with no doubt but their sizing &#34;XS/M&#34; was to vague, I hope my measurements which i included helps other customers with their purchase.<br />It is cut in a V shaped at the bottom so it is longer in the front and back region, shorter at the side hip region, great for a day at the beach over a swimsuit.<br />Material is as expected.<br />Colour is like a cream colour which I like.<br />[[ASIN:B00ZZ2IYSS Bestyou Women's Fashion Swimwear Cover-ups Crochet Cover up Tunic Beach Dress (Beige),One Size Fits Most]]"
3.0,Stop working some time
3.0,It says it is a over size shirt. I received a large . And it was a large. No over size to it. Nothing like the Photo
3.0,This band sweat when wearing. The sweat on thee part of the band next to your skin started to lose in coating and cause me skin to itch.
3.0,These are nice shoes. The size is way off though. She grew out of her old shoes which were a size 9 so we ordered these in a 10 but they were way to big so we returned them and got a size 9 which are still to big but we kept them. She loves the color and wants to wear them everywhere but they have already worn thin in the toe and probably won’t last more than a few months. They were inexpensive so I’m not to worried out the length of use just wouldn’t liked them to fit better so they don’t fall off when she runs.
3.0,"great quality I ordered a small one the top fit great but unfortunately, the bottoms look like an XXS. i couldn't even dare to try them on,"
3.0,It’s like a paper cutout
3.0,"colors were not as pictured, sent all white socks instead of pastel stripes, but will still use them"
3.0,Overall nice quality but I have skinny ankles compared to my size L body.  The part around my ankle is too large/has extra loose fabric.
3.0,"Okay, I REALLY love the blue and black plaid pattern. It's very stylish and I wish this dress would have worked out for me because this could be worn for so many different occasions/events/etc.I am 5'5, 154 lbs (mostly in my belly area) 36D/38C depending, I wear 30/31 pants or size 10 usually. The Pros - Great Pattern, Modest Length, Can definitely be worn with a petticoat, has a bit of stretch in the bust area. Sadly, the Cons - If you have bigger arms, the holes will fit a bit tightly, because of the extra room allowed for the bust, the upper back zipper area pops out some in an unattractive way, Fabric is a bit stiff (that might change if it's put in the wash first), no lining, no loops/string to keep belt in place, belt pops out and looks sloppy.<br /><br />Personally, I still think this is an &#34;okay&#34; dress (still returning it, though). But I wouldn't want to wear a sweater each and every time to cover up the loose back area or to hide the fact that my arms look like stuffed sausages trying to escape their casing. Nor do I want to try and safety pin the belt every time, either. These are my own hang ups (which Is why I'm returning) but other than that, it's not a horrible garment for the price."
3.0,"Top fits perfect- bottom leg holes are HUGE. Mquality of top seems great! (Which is mostly what we got this for) bottoms are a waste, but for $12 it's worth it for the top!"
3.0,"Three stars--it's OK.  Two stars--I don't like it.  I'd say 2.5.  It's cute, but I think it has what's known as a &#34;modern fit.&#34;  It is broad in the shoulders and the armhole is roomy enough, but the body seems closer cut than I expected or hoped it would be.  It's kind of snug in the chest. I like the border terrier--I don't much like the fit."
3.0,Loved these until the strap broke 2 months later! I think they should have lasted longer
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to my 25th wedding vow renewal, thought it was a classic look, white lace & black.  I ordered this dress in 2 sizes, 1 per the manufacturer sizing (based on my msmts) & the next size up because alot of reviews said it ran small. The size that was based on my msmts was too small, returned. The next size up, fit, &#34;BUT&#34; the bust was suppose to be for 40&#34;.  My bra size is a 38DDD, this dress was better suited for someone who wore a bra size 40Acup. It smashed across the bodice.  The other thing I should mention is on the 1st one, the white zipper was only as long as the white bodice, making it a little harder to get in. The 2nd one, had a very long white zipper that went from the bodice to approx 12&#34; into the black skirt, making it very easy to get on & off. But, the white zipper was very noticeable on the black skirt.  With all this said, the dress was very well made & is beautiful, just did not fit my body. Sadly, I had to return both sizes."
3.0,The dress fits nice but has a cheap look overall.  I did end up returning it.
3.0,"This is not the same as the picture, the colors are different. Also the material is kinda thin and cheap looking."
3.0,The moldevite fell out after a month of wearing. Which kind of defeats the purpose. Loved the ring otherwise. Just isn’t very secure.<br /><br />It’s sad because I love silver insanity and have never had issues with their product until now.
3.0,Nice dress but the fit is way off. It's really short and I'm only 5'4
3.0,"I got this for Christmas, and found it in the buy again section when I was doing some reviewing just now..(the gifter knows I am writing this and is completely fine with it lol) but this is pretty cheaply made, and very thin. Not horrible, it would be great if the shipping was free… the price of the actual product is great alone, I still wear this hoodie and is not bad just very thin! 😁"
3.0,This navy is not the color in the picture.  This is just another shade of black.  I ordered these for a formal event tomorrow and specifically for the navy to go with my dress.
3.0,I really believe Carter's runs very thin.  I have to squeeze my 2 yr old into 3t but they seem comfortable and she doesn't complain
3.0,"My dad passed away and he was creamated , so I ordered these for all of my nieces, so a total of 8. 1 arrived broken, and two of them already broke. So they are cute but not made to last."
3.0,"It was okay. Very cute, just like the picture but was a little cheaply made as you can expect. The clasp broke on mine after a few times of wear. Easily fixed but you have to be gentle with it."
3.0,"I'm busty... This ended up being a tunic not s vdress, in the front the material stops at my crotch, I imagine ordering a size up would help, I did keep the item but again I wear it as a shirt."
3.0,"True to color shown, but made a little cheaply.  Biggest issue is that the notches in the plastic ring that secures the swivel do not match up with the pegs on the pole.  I lowered my rating this morning when opening the umbrella I had to get on a ladder to line up the final piece under the canopy to engage and secure the actual umbrella.  I would not buy this brand and model again.  I chose this one for the color I needed."
3.0,First day of the coin pocket zipper broke other than that it's fine
3.0,The boots are very uncomfortable an they have very little ankle support. I went to the bootless waders .  Just say something to think about before you buy is the rocks you'll be walking on .  These should work ok for the beach .
3.0,This SySea women's babydoll peplum blouse shows my bust profoundly! The seam under my bustline is fairly tight which draws your eye to that area as everywhere else is loose. I'm not sure I'll ever wear this blouse in public but perhaps around the house. This normally would be a return from me as this blouse needs to be re-tweeked. The proportion seems off for large breasted women like myself.  When I was younger I would of been happy to have a large bustline but as a grandmother it doesn't work for me.
3.0,Very cute. Good quality. Incredibly heavy.
3.0,"I love this dress and I think its stunning!<br />I am only giving 3 stars for a few reasons: I ordered the mid length dress with 3/4 length sleeves and received a mid length (goes to mid calf) with long sleeves (keepingit cause its still pretty).  Also the material is very cheap. I like that it's nice and stretchy but its very thin and I'm a little worried its going to snag on something and tear; for the quality of the materialI feel like the dress should be more like $20 rather than $40. The shoulders are a little tight but not unbearable.  The slit is very high! I can't really walk in this without someone being able to see my bits so I sowed it to make the slit a bit lower (but this is just my personal preference).<br />Its a gorgeous dress though and I'm very happy with it.<br />I am 165# 5'11"" and ordered a medium."
3.0,"So I received my 2 shorts. Both size 34. One black and the other green. The label says size 34 for both. The green fit fine and comfortable, the black is way to tight and is definitely not a 34 even though the label says 34. Also the black is shorter on length above my knees. As the green are perfect slightly below my knees. Wierd."
3.0,They are easy to use. They look good bc the clip is so low but they are very chinch. Like dollar store plastic chincy.
3.0,"More of a crop top but as expected not really worth the price, material was a bit cheap but wearable"
3.0,"I like the bag in general, but I did not receive the one pictured. If you’re looking for the blue/purple one, this isn’t it. This is just black. I will keep it though, because it isn’t awful, it’s just not what I ordered."
3.0,I like the shorts but I wish I would’ve ordered a larger size
3.0,"I had to return this.  I am 5 ft and 120lbs.  I ordered the small.  The arms were too tight. The rest of it was overly huge and roomy.  But it does not give any shape, you look like  a block.  Too bad, because the top part of the jacket has cool design."
3.0,Bought as a gift. She liked it.
3.0,"These shorts are made out of a great material but are somewhere between too large and too small. The actual leg and butt area is a little too big and long, it looks like I'm wearing way too much fabric. But on the other hand, the elastic inside the waistband rolled itself up after the first wear and absolutely won't unroll, resulting in it being uncomfortably tight around my waist. IF you don't mind big shorts and a tight waistband, go ahead, but these aren't exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,wore them twice and one of them broke.
3.0,I bought white and it is see-through. You can’t wear anything aside from a white tee under it.
3.0,"These are decent and they fit well.  Can't beat the price.  They would be better looking with a gold or brass tone frame instead of the black but for eight bucks, I can afford to leave these on the car seat and squash them later."
3.0,These are the perfect little size and I love all the colors but the threads on these hurt my septum piercing hole when putting in and removing. They are just a bit to sharp so I had to deduct a couple stars.
3.0,I love the Brooch! But Some of the Rhinestone have fallen out and I've only worn it once. I would love to have another one. Sent to me
3.0,Likely it will not hold up long as it seems to be a fragile one time costume use hat instead of for what we ordered them for which is to keep sun off our head & faces while weeding our farm crops. But time will tell.
3.0,okay quality
3.0,"The unicorn charm is pretty, but very small. My great niece liked the necklace. She’s eleven."
3.0,"It’s too tight, doesn’t fit to size"
3.0,"The screen printing looks obvious and cheap. The material of the hat itself is kinda rough and scratchy. On top of that, it took almost 3 weeks of shipping before I got it.<br /><br />I can't say I'd recommend my friends and family to buy this hat."
3.0,Looks just like picture just a bit bigger than I expected
3.0,"The lenses are great, the frame material could use some work as it cracked above the right lens within the first 10 days of use. Will not purchase this product again."
3.0,They were too big... extremely stretch and not in the right places.
3.0,small but soo cute
3.0,This was a good buy but wasn’t the most flattering on my chest. It made me seem really flat chested. Good material and one of my fav colors!
3.0,The shirt was so cute and came how I thought it would. The pants were..... weird. Too big but also not what I expected I thought they would be a jean denim material but they are cloth pants.
3.0,"I like the coat itself, it has nice long sleeves (though I wish the body was a little longer) but the sizing is definitely off. I ordered two sizes bigger and it’s still snugger than I wanted but fits well enough. Definitely measure yourself before you order so you get a coat that fits."
3.0,"This shirt doesn't fit....quite....right. It's a little too long, too big in the shoulders...and just doesn't quite....flatter. That being said, it's very comfortable so I wear it around the house. I would say it is true to size, but almost fits more like a short dress than a shirt. I like it but I'm not totally in love with it."
3.0,"The overalls were nice, but they run super small.  My daughter is 10 years old, slim and tiny and the size 10 fit her too tight and the shorts were really short. I hate going through the trouble of returning so I will probably donate them."
3.0,"Does not come with any instructions, just 3 straps in a bag.<br />I guess it works ok but it rides up and needs to be readjusted periodically."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Much cheaper version of the real thing, the neckline doesn't even reach my collarbone but it was still comfortable and cute. The chest pads are very uncomfortable and move around the entire chest pocket so you have to readjust."
3.0,GREAT quality but run big  Ordered a medium and fit more like a large
3.0,I liked the material. The lining inside runs half length.The skirt is small around waist even after i ordered 2 sizes up.<br />I have to wear it from my head.
3.0,"I am sending it back due to the band on my stomach. I love the fit of them but the top of them are just so tight. I would recommend the ""butterysoft colorfulkoala"""
3.0,They are nice but too big
3.0,"Does the job, but it's bulky and may move around on you.  Don't size up - it's just extra fabric that's not needed."
3.0,"Seem like the items run small or made for a certain ethnic group after the purchase of 2 different items. Each item was small & tight, inspite of my regular size. Cute but too small"
3.0,"They're a nice size, and they're not heavy.  They do hang weird so it'd be nice if the back had a design as well.  Not bad overall, though."
3.0,it runs large for the size
3.0,ITS OK NOT GREAT FOR ME ANYWAYS
3.0,"I like it and I don't. In the picture it looks more like a sweat shirt material, it's not. Lots of stitching issues, but so far they are manageable. The sleeves show in the picture as being snug all the way down, but they are snug only to just below the elbow. Then it looks like they thought the sleeves were too short and added an extension that isn't snug. Shirt is not as long as in the picture and slits go very high up. Would recommend a cami for underneath unless you don't care about your belly showing. Overall, it is a very cute top and I've gotten lots of compliments on it, but it is not exactly what is shown."
3.0,"I followed the other recommendations and ordered a size bigger and I am glad I did. They fit great. My only complaint is that the material is very thick and I am afraid they may feel too confining for me. The quality is very good and if you like a thicker panty, you will love these."
3.0,I got medium and they are tight. Get 1 size up than usual. skirt looks kind of cheap.
3.0,"Size isn’t accurate. Order a bigger size. Overall, great print on shirt."
3.0,"I ordered a small and another reviewer was right. Even a small is too big for my not so small female arms (I am 5' tall and weigh 110 lbs). I think it would be perfect for a man with medium sized arms. Anyway, the material is nice but unfortunately, it's a little too big that it keeps sliding down. Not worth returning for the price, maybe someone else I know can use it later on.<br />Although, I do have to give props to the seller for the quick delivery!"
3.0,XL fits like Med
3.0,"I bought these house slippers for my husband for Xmas.  He loves how comfortable they are and wears they while working from home.  After only 4 months, the left slipper split at the seam directly below the toe area.  He’s very disappointed that this has occurred in his favorite houseslipper. He wants me to get another pair hoping it will not happen again with the next pair,"
3.0,I never received the bracelet. I kept forgetting to inform you all. and the Necklace turn dark..Tarnished..
3.0,"This Jollycode Women's V Neck Tank Tops had so much potential in my opinion. The photo I put up is after 1 hand wash and wear of a couple of hours. The material reminds me of the cheap .99 yarn that I buy my little to play with. Soft but rough and doesn't hold shape while wearing.<br /><br />It'd really cute and I like the idea, if you do, and you are the type to take the time needed for delicate items, go for it.<br /><br />For reference I'm a 38D and it fits perfect with a size Large"
3.0,"I guess NYLON is the word. I used this bag for items that I would like to carry with me every day. It will hold up for a few months, but after about 2 months of continuous use, the bottom stitching has come a loose.... completely ! Now I carry it like a &#34;TUBE', so that nothing falls out !.<br />Not good for heavy items."
3.0,"This isn't what the product actually looks like, still nice but the colors shown are much nicer"
3.0,You get what you pay for on this one. Runs a bit small. Im always a small/extra small. Ordered a small and its too snug. Cute and material is decent.
3.0,"too large, will exchange if possible"
3.0,I gave it away to my friends daughter.
3.0,The front and back are sewn equally so the back doesn't fit well unless you have no butt at all.
3.0,These socks are very comfortable on my feet. But I have diabetes and the tops of these are tight on my legs. Is there a style with loose fitting top?
3.0,"Looks good overall, but its not smooth/finished properly. Its a bit abrasive when i tried wearing it and had a big scratch on my finger."
3.0,For house shoes I want something very comfortable. The top part of the shoe I could feel stress on the o my foot I could only wear it is if I wore two thick socks . unfortunately also they do not have half sizes just was too big for me..
3.0,Mal empacada
3.0,The messenger bag came as exprected. What is shown in the pic is how the item looks.
3.0,The bust are fit prefect but the body area was 2 sizes too big! Upset I had to return. The quality was great but the size was off....
3.0,"Comfortable silicon, fast shipping, rose gold painted clasp is durable. Cheap price! Extra watch band is able to be hidden. Color of the band isn't as pictured, more of Robin's egg blue/pastel rather than teal."
3.0,Got them for my daughter and she loves them. They fit great and are so beautiful. The only problem is the first time she used them the bottom liner fell out of one of them but she also had diving flippers on and she tried to get them and the shoes off at one time still I wouldn’t think they would have came apart that’s easy.<br />Over all I think they are worth the money.
3.0,Not a bad skirt overall. just a bit tighter around the stomach than expected. I am a size 6-8 and I got a medium and felt somewhat comfortable. it is a bit short. the quality is pretty poor but it looks okay. kind of see through
3.0,"Looks good from the front. It’s loose fitting and comfy, but since the back is loose fitting too, from the side view, it makes your belly look huge. Would be a great maternity shirt!"
3.0,I made one necklace with one pendant and hung it for sale. Nobody wore it. It was on display. The pendant was discolored and looked stained in two days
3.0,"I like its design, but its fabric looks too cheap."
3.0,Very large.  Was way too big.
3.0,The picture looks better than the actual product.
3.0,"The elastic bands worked well, but one snapped after about 2 months use.  Still can use it as a single band.  But no longer as a double resistance band."
3.0,"Not my favorite piece. Too short for the sleeves and too big around the mid area. Also, it just feel like there too much material and stuff going on that doesn't need to be there. The color and quality is good though."
3.0,The description never mentioned this zippered on the left. All my jackets and sweaters zip from the right.  This is very difficult to get used to.
3.0,"This is only ok, design is not exactly like the picture. Material is cheap and the seam on the shoulder started coming apart after one wear. the sewing also does not seem even."
3.0,very sheer and see throw
3.0,Soft cotton just like the photo the only thing was mine came damaged
3.0,This shirt is a lightweight material. Colors are vibrant. It is loose everywhere except in the arms.
3.0,Inexpensive but very dark lenses.  Not very vivid.
3.0,Boots shipped out great and got here earlier than expected. They look exactly like the picture. However the first pair we received my 4 year old son wore them for less than 10 minutes and the snake skin part was already peeling off. However the company was very quick to ship us a replacement pair my son is just afraid to act himself in the boots for fear they will mess up again.
3.0,"I ordered “black” shorts, got some plaid shorts instead. Good quality shorts, but not very attractive. I really needed all black shorts, not plaid, so that sucked but, I kept them anyway."
3.0,My wife likes them she said they are very pretty but they tarnish too fast. I guess I can say you pay for what you get. Would not want to buy this item again or anything like it.
3.0,"2-4 stars for charm (depending on frequency of wear), 5 stars for customer service<br /><br />Update 5/14/18 - I have now lost five blue pieces from this charm. I was contacted quickly by Nina Queen after posting my initial review, offering to send a replacement, and they recommended two different blue charms. I responded that my first choice, if they thought I wouldn’t have the same problem, was to send the same charm, but I also sent a backup choice. I just received my backup choice in the mail this weekend. While I’m sad that I’ll soon be removing my favorite charm from my bracelet, I greatly appreciate the company’s efforts to make things right. My rating reflects five starts for customer service. If you wear your bracelet daily, like I do, I give this particular charm 2 stars. However, if you only wear it occasionally, you’ll have greater longevity with this charm, making it more in the three to four star range.<br /><br />Original: This has been my favorite charm since I bought it 10 1/2 months ago. I love the blue, and the pattern makes me think of dahlias. It fits nicely on my Pandora bracelet and it gets worn daily.<br /><br />Several days ago I noticed that I had lost two patches of blue, and today I see a third one is pulling up. Needless to say, I am quite disappointed."
3.0,Liked the styling and colors but beware it fits small
3.0,"The shirt material quality seemed to be good, but this shirt is not a normal tee shape..it’s more square shaped, but not as short to be a crop also, the sleeves are longer than a normal tee..Not a terrible purchase, just not what I was looking for."
3.0,Yes loved it
3.0,This is a good shirt but not great
3.0,I usually wear size small & fits good. These were a little tight....even for spandex.
3.0,"…NOT like other reviewers post. Be mindful that not EVERY bag will have the “logo”, “Marc Jacobs” I was kinda sad when I saw more reviews come up with no “logo”. After I had already placed my order. Not sure why, even when the post mark out the name. The shipping did take quite awhile. None the less, it is very cute and spacious! Zipper and strap are good quality as well! The color was also on point."
3.0,This was supposed to come with a headband but it did not. ☹
3.0,They break easily at the weakest of accidental yanks.
3.0,"The listed sizes are pretty true to US sizes.  As other reviews said, it's not the most amazing material, but it's still nice enough that I feel comfortable wearing it to work.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the color.  It's really pretty, but not what's shown in the picture.  Instead of a kelly green, it's more of a seafoam green.  As along as you're not looking for a specific color, this is great!"
3.0,For the price I can't complain. They are a bit small but they served their purpose.
3.0,Ok did the job
3.0,Very cute dress but I felt the pockets made it look very wide. Made me look 10 pounds heavier. Looks great on the others pictured but just wasn't for me.
3.0,I really liked these to add to a pair of croc slides but most of the pieces came broken so I could only use half of them
3.0,"Not bad, but not as well made as some I've bought in this price range"
3.0,i like these and i would say that they are just way too dark. changes the colors of outside completely different. was really good for fall because it made the colors more vibrant but it is really hard to drive with them as they are very dark. but i still like them.
3.0,like the colour and make
3.0,"I agree with the first review.  The quality of this strap is excellent but the overall design is flawed,  It has adjustable length straps on both sides of the pad.  The problem is they are the same length.  The strap that goes over the shoulder needs to be a lot shorter than the strap that goes towards the hip.  If you shorten the shoulder strap to the minimum the shoulder pad still dosen't reach the shoulder.<br />I was able to fix the strap by folding about 2 inches of the shoulder strap and sewing it together.  This shortened shoulder strap enough that it then moves the shoulder pad to where it fits on my shoulder.  If you don't mind modifying the strap its a great value."
3.0,"3.5 stars - I purchased this as a gift for my partner who loves the Dark Souls games. As other reviewers mentioned, the material of this hoodie is slick, NOT fleecy like a traditional hoodie, but I knew that going into it and it works well for my partner, who actively prefers that feeling. It is still thicker than some printed hoodies of this material and is well-made. The print is actually quite high quality and true to the listing photo.<br /><br />However, my only qualm - and the reason I'm not rating higher - is in the sizing! I noted before buying where other reviewers mentioned sizing up, so I did, and the product that arrived is amply wide (would not want to go wider) but really, really short for a hoodie, skimming the tops of his pants at best. Like, if you lift your arms slightly, your belly will show. This reduces its warmth and comfort, so keep that in mind. Thankfully, my partner is relatively short, so I do NOT recommend this item for taller people unless you really enjoy your hoodies crop-top style."
3.0,Said official US Army but there were no tags in the hat that stated that.  My original that this replaced said US Army on the tag inside.  I think the quality is the same but seller should not misrepresent the US Army.
3.0,"The material is not the material I expected, and it fit a little too small. It wasn't the best I had high hopes"
3.0,"I was surprised at how thick the fabric was on the clip part of the visor.  I definitely prefer less material and a finer look.  It'll be ok in a pinch, but won't be my favorite."
3.0,"Not as expected, disappointed."
3.0,"I was nervous about ordering pants off of amazon especially white ones. I must say I was really surprised with these! They were really cute and stretchy and the material is a good thickness. The only thing I had a problem with is that they were way too big. I am a true medium. I wear everything medium because of my hips, but these were way too big. I returned them and I was happy I could, however, I went to order them in a small and they are not prime eligible anymore. I am disappointed with this. How is it that a medium is prime but the small is not? I need these for a trip coming up and could not wait a month to receive them. I am going to look elsewhere."
3.0,These earrings are gorgeous BUT they lay on my collarbone. I am 5 ft.8 in and am large boned and slim. I love them but I have to return them. They are just too long!
3.0,"I was very excited about the glasses, I got them in the mail today they are ok but are not the same as in the picture, the part in the middle is metal and not black like in the picture."
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but very small
3.0,"These gloves are super cool, but I would consider them kids size. They only went up to my forearm and fit tight!<br />They done have stretch, but I think that’s best with costume gloves so they’re not stretching out through the day."
3.0,"The model in the photo must be very tall. The photo shows that the poncho is only as long as her finger tips. I'm 5'7"" and it went down to my knees! It is one size fits all; I'm sure it will fit many sizes because I was swimming in it! Still gave 3 stars because otherwise it looks just like the photo: pattern is clear, fabric is good quality, not too thin, it could keep you warm for sure."
3.0,"Beautiful but way to wide and short to wear with a dress or top.  Had it cut down and merged and sewn together so I could wear it,"
3.0,It doesn't exactly hold the girls inplace. I wouldn't exactly call it a high impact sports bra.
3.0,"These are chinese sizes & wihle I followed the sizing chart, it was just a little snug.  The fabric was heavy but not too heavy & would look cute with jeans but just didn't care for the fit"
3.0,they do the job. but the metal parts are cheap metal. the tip will fall off eventually.
3.0,"I just can't get past the weird feeling of this fabric.  It says 74 percent content, but I just can't see how.  It is not soft at all and does not breath.  The style is beautiful but the fabric or coating on the fabric makes it a no for me."
3.0,I don't like it.  The stones are too small.
3.0,assorted colors may include black and gray which can be purchased for less money
3.0,Not as easy to put on as I'd hoped.
3.0,"I is a little too loose and you can't really adjust it, but it really cool looking.  It's worth the price though."
3.0,The slippers have a very soft comfy lining that feels good to the foot.  The outer sole is very well built and won't slip when you walk.
3.0,"These are cut, but are small.  They are meant to stretch to fit.  When you get them, they look like a child's size.  They aren't super comfortable because they have to stretch so much to fit over your foot."
3.0,"These were a lovely soft velvet, Spanx leggings, but they didn’t have any built-in support for tummy control or size, and therefore, unlike regular leggings that have built-in tummy control and top of leg shaping, these had none of that, so without that sculpting, they can tend to make shapely woman look pudgy, also when I tried the medium, the sizing is incredibly odd as I could barely get one of the medium over my lower calf, the other fit very differently, but the waste control wasn’t good so if I’d gone up a size it would’ve ended up not being very tight on the waist. Pretty disappointing considering they’re asking between 150, $170 for these items, I think spanks company issued add tummy and leg support for the price"
3.0,Runs a bit small.<br />Material is good<br />Shipping was great
3.0,"Its okay- not great, not bad"
3.0,My grandson loved it but felt it too big for him and it is quite dangerous he thought with large spikes.
3.0,Wife didn't like the fit
3.0,The stone was smaller than the photo makes it appear and I have not seen it change color once. I am disappointed. I do like the design of the knotwork though.
3.0,"These are lovely, but the purples, yellow and green are not nearly as dark as they appear here.  The lighter purple looks nearly clear, and the darker purple looks as the lighter looks in the picture.  The red is slightly darker and the blue is much much darker.  As I said, lovely, but not exactly what I was expecting.  The stones are nice, and well set, the metal has not tarnished or flaked in the six months I've owned them.<br /><br />The 4mm is the same, so if you get them also, they will match these."
3.0,I usually wear a large/xl shirt. I ordered a xl and fit larger than expected. Shells were missing some of the glitter so I added glitter glue to shells. Inexpensive so great for mermaid costume.
3.0,The bottom of the zipper is sewn improperly. There is a gather of the two fabrics causing it not to lay flat.  Looks terrible ☹️ Wish I would have tried it on sooner. Unable to wear
3.0,"A very flattering color and shape, but the fabric is a bit delicate and thin for my taste."
3.0,The jacket is pretty but it’s sized very small. I normally where a 2x but bought the 4x and it’s was very tight. Wish it was true to size.
3.0,Odd fit (short and wide) but overall good shirt. Caught on a deal otherwise would not have purchased.
3.0,"update 6.22.19: within a week or so of wearing daily, i noticed the silver finish has worn off of the back at the edges of the circle, and has begun to turn dark on the inside of the pendant. the chain caught my hair at the clasp, so i switched that out. seems to be only silver plated, but hasn’t turned my skin green yet. will update in a couple more months.<br /><br />••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br /><br />This pendant is beautiful. I am truly impressed, as this exceeded my expectations. I was merely hoping to get what I paid for, and I definitely did. Nice shiny finish, good weight indicating dense metal and not a plated plastic. The chain is so-so, but I feel it’s just too simple for a nice pendant like this. The only complaint I have seems to be a tiny defect in manufacturing; facing the front of the pendant, at the bottom right of the circle, that section seems to have been slightly stressed while being cast/molded, as it isn’t as smooth or perfectly curved as the other sections. However, it isn’t quite noticeable and especially wouldn’t be if you didn’t already know it was there.<br /><br />I am so glad to have received such a beautiful pendant, as I now have a classy way of showing my personal beliefs without looking too much like a novelty gimmicky necklace from a mall store or the like. Thank you again!"
3.0,I like the shoes but they fit a little snug.
3.0,"This mask runs small for an adult.  Fits very tight to the face, even after adjusting the ear loops.  Maybe make just 1/2 inch bigger"
3.0,"I purchased a medium in this product (I’m 5’9”, 140lbs, 36C). I was hopeful based on the cute style and awesome reviews, but when I tried it on, it felt cheap and scratchy. My husband thought it was the least flattering of the four brands I tried. The red was also a bit orange and not so much a true brilliant red like the picture showed. It was easy to return and the package was easy to reseal. I think this could work great for someone else, but it didn’t serve my purpose of a comfortable and sexy nightgown"
3.0,Cute vest but was a little tight.
3.0,"Beautiful shoes, I wear a 6 1/2 ordered a 7 1/2. They said it they ran small. I suggest stay with your size."
3.0,"These run a little tight, I was able to stretch them a bit, to at least make them wearable."
3.0,"I absolutely loved the cover and how it felt on my first time wearing it but even tho I didn't wash or dry it, it starting unraveling. I found different places with holes that I had to sew."
3.0,The ring is sturdy but it chips after a cple weeks of wear n tear..
3.0,After losing countless pairs of sunglasses -- I bought a less expensive DVF pair.  They actually look nice -- but beware that it's a real challenge to fold up and place in the case.
3.0,I’ve should’ve up a size it was cute it was just the fact that it was so thin and see through make sure you wear something underneath
3.0,"This dress fits well, but the collar on the dress is HORRIBLE. It's very sloppy and makes the dress look somewhat sloppy, but the dress looks great on after you look pass the collar."
3.0,cute dress but runs small
3.0,Just ok<br />Not compression. Roll up a lot. Really hot to use under another shirt. Really like the racer back.
3.0,The waist was the correct size however the length is not what I expected.. Haven't washed them yet so don't know how much they will shrink. I would recommend ordering one size longer on the inseam and 1 &#34;  wider on the waist.
3.0,Tangles like crazy
3.0,"A little chunky, not very shiny. Wouldn’t buy if price was higher because it looks cheap."
3.0,"In my opinion this wouldn’t work as a rash guard for lap swimming. The cut is way too blousy with strange fit, arms that droop several inches below your armpit. I’m a 10/12 in street clothes and ordered a large. I don’t think going smaller would have helped due to overall boxy cut, not like a form fitting rash guard for swimming. Where it would be nice is for hiking or hanging out at the beach where you want very lightweight sun protection that keeps you cool. Even if you’re just floating around in water it would be fine, if you don’t mind it billowing around you once in the water.  It just wasn’t going to work for my purposes and as described, as a rash guard."
3.0,Beautiful dress I just had no idea it was completely see through! I ordered a Large and I'm 5'3&#34; 126 pounds and it fit okay it was a bit big I usually order medium.
3.0,"inexpensive cheap light, go figure. The back of the necklace that adjusts broke off. The construction is boy scout, summer campish."
3.0,Why? Don’t like to expose myself
3.0,"Image shows more of a mauve color, but it's actually baby pink."
3.0,"Fit ok, but it was supposed to be purple and it's VERY burgandy. Kind of a bummer, whole point was to buy my girlfriend's favorite color for her."
3.0,"These were too small, even though I normally wear an XL, and ordered 3X."
3.0,I love the look of the back but the front is small. It is not comfortable for anyone that is bigger on top because of the small size up front. Aesthetically pleasing but your def not buying for comfort.
3.0,The material is very thin and looks cheap
3.0,"The beads are nice, but the clasps are small and one broke while I was trying to attach it to my face mask."
3.0,"The colors are great, the top is a little small for a medium, but still fit decently. shipping was surprisingly fast. Major down fall, the bottoms are really small, and completely see through. I ended up buying some black swim bottoms locally to wear with the top"
3.0,To loose to big which makes it to sloppy looking but the color and design of sweater are beautiful I prefer a tighter knit so it's warm when wearing it
3.0,Synthetic.. feels v itchy. Not very warm - not as warm as advertised.<br />Thick cotton leggings work better for me
3.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend as a Christmas present and he loved them when he opened them, but they were a lot smaller than I anticipated. They looked tiny on his ear lobes. I almost returned them because I found out the posts bend really, really easily on them. I just bent it back with a needle nose pliers and they were good as new. (Just dont bend them back too many times, they feel like they could snap easily too..)"
3.0,These shorts look great. The waste fits great the thigh area is just a little tight. I got an extra large. I’m 5’ 8’’ 165lbs and 5 months pregnant.
3.0,Love it. But the length is shorter then it appears in the picture and arms are a little big.
3.0,"The material and overall look is what I was looking for. I appreciate the thick borders on the pockets, lots of cargo shorts have thinner stitching and contents can slip out when exiting vehicles and such. These ones have a thicker more durable stitching. Only downside was the thread used for the buttons was rather weak. Button fell off, easy repair, nothing a needle and thread couldn’t fix."
3.0,"This dress was super cute the first time I wore it. Worked well for breast feeding. But after first wash, as instructed, it shrunk into the size of a small child’s dress. Won’t be able to wear again."
3.0,Rather thin and cheap
3.0,One heel scrapes a little. The other is perfect.
3.0,I don’t like the way it fits. Too high up around the neck area.
3.0,I really love the bracelet but the clasp just broke after wearing it only 3 times :( Unfortunately my time limit to return it was expired.
3.0,Wish the money compartment were larger.
3.0,The OZEROWaterproof Winter Gloves Men Women -30 ℉ Cold Proof Touchscreen Anti Slip Silicon Palm are very tough to use touch screen especially typing. The gloves are a bit bulky. These are decent winter gloves keeping hands warm.
3.0,These were more white than pink :/
3.0,Cute skirt but runs small and too short for my liking.  Returned.
3.0,I loved the blouse quality. I wear a extra large. I got a extra small. Help
3.0,"Too small. More size options needed. Hard, chew push material. Still, it gets the job done."
3.0,The material is shiny polyester not cotton will be returning as they are comfortable and do not absorb sweat. My husband uses them for his head and they were itchy and super thin. 12 for the price was a good deal but maybe for  decoration not regular wear or use.
3.0,Product runs really really smart
3.0,They are rather long.  I don't have a short leg or foot so they run longer than necessary.  Also by end of day they cut into the area rt. below the back of knee area badly.  That area was actually bruised looking the next day.  My feet didn't swell but they sure were uncomfortable by end of day.  They do stop the swelling but maybe they don't need to be worn for anything over about 8 hours total each day.
3.0,"They look great on, but after a few uses they got really big and just fall off my nose...so disappointing"
3.0,"I recently purchased this compression top for my son and it fits perfectly. It is a quality shirt that is a bit heavy as far as material. The material is a heavier elastic t-shirt material.<br /><br />I would have preferred it in black but they only sold white. I would like for the shirt to be more breathable. The first day I put the shirt on, after a few hours he was sweating more than usual."
3.0,"It was not really what I expected, but it was still a nice swimsuit cover.  I wished it had been a little more true to the size I was buying, but otherwise not too bad.  Just remember to order it a little bigger than you really want to have, and it should fit fine."
3.0,Quality of product was great but ask for fit it was really small and I got a medium that’s what I normally take and I should’ve got next size up. Would still recommend just order next size up from your regular size.
3.0,"They look and feel good but unless we start getting some sun in Michigan, will not be wearing them often!"
3.0,Daughter likes it.  Big loop snapped but we fixed.
3.0,"While most of my pieces are fine and I’ve used them for jewelry making, three sets are incorrectly spelled and the saying on the back is either mispelled or in a different language other than English.  I am reaching out to the seller and would like to get replacements as I paid for a whole set."
3.0,you can see trough it and its bigger than expect
3.0,Cheap made but still served a purpose
3.0,"I ordered up 2 sizes and it is still a little small. The color is not a pretty yellow, but is more a mustard yellow."
3.0,I ordered the XL and it was still too tight. Cute shirt though.
3.0,They clip onto just the edge of your earlobes.
3.0,"Great colors and delivery was swift, but a couple of the bows had brown tape/adhesive/bandaid (?) on the inner floweret. Had to trim before use."
3.0,Again I will be giving these to my two year old granddaughter. I like big jewelry and has mistaken these to be at least meduim but was highly dissappointed to discovered that they were not.
3.0,"Nicely made, beautiful pattern but very thin. Doesn’t stay put under a coat. Needs to be made of a thicker material. I have other silk scarves that aren’t so flimsy."
3.0,"Looked great but the 2nd time I wore it, it started to peal. Washed it by hand and laid it out to dry. Still pealed, now all that is left is most of the eyes."
3.0,"I think it's not a bad item for the look, but it felt a little cheap for the price. If the key ring and attachment points were a more substantial metal I would have rated higher"
3.0,Shirt was small
3.0,Can’t beat the price. I am really happy with this purchase and the earrings are my style. The vintage style hides how cheaply made these earrings are but for someone who constant loses earrings these are perfect for me.
3.0,My wife liked this suit alot but it was way to short and she is very petite 4' 11&#34; 98 lbs. Great for the price but recommend one size up!
3.0,"If you’re a little bit bigger, or your boobs are larger than a C don’t bother, it’s too small"
3.0,"It's okay. Not impressive. Not quite as large or functional as I had hoped. Has a weird chemical smell to it. And the canvas looks faded. Handles are great though, but doesn't quite meet my needs for a large travel purse/bag"
3.0,"The socks were like compression socks on the legs and much to large in the toe's,but wearable."
3.0,Got this for my wife's phone.  She loves the graphic on the case even if it is a bit grainy. The material scratches a bit too easily and the fit is a little strange with the buttons.
3.0,Not for me. Looks very nice. Daughter in law wanted these.
3.0,This swimsuit is Adorable! BUT the sizing is all off. The bottoms run big and the top runs small. The quality is nice. It is such a shame that it has all gone to waste due to sizing issues. * I normally wear a 7 with a 36c and got a large. I reviewed this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,One of the spikes was missing on one of the Epaulet's. I can't even fix it either.
3.0,I love it but it was oversized
3.0,"The delivery took very long,but the product is nice"
3.0,"I ordered two of these, both size small. They're really good quality but I do not recommend sizing down. They run true to size. One came as an XS but the tag stated it was a S, just disappointing but I would still recommend this product."
3.0,Great daily watch! The customer service from this  merchant was outstanding addressing my issue. For the money it's a beautiful watch and based on the customer service I would  most definitely buy again.
3.0,Cup inserts were not very comfortable. The top was secure on top but pinched the skin by my armpits. The fabric is nice quality. The teal dots are very vibrant. The bottoms are high wasted.
3.0,I feel like I'm wearing a tablecloth in this thing.  I don't like that the sides are open on both sides up to the waist. It's cute but not for me.
3.0,"I am 5'6 and I weigh 175 I ordered an extra large. It fit snug but cute bc of the stretch in the material. I didn't get the print I ordered and I didn't expect the material to be what It was but it worked out. The stitching was not so great, but then you get what you pay for. I've order other things and I've been totally satisfied."
3.0,"Nearly dislocate my shoulder trying to hook the hooks!  The material is really comfortable though, but the lower band tends to roll up."
3.0,"Hat is nice and it looks good and comfortable. It is only semi warm. Not that good in temps below 30. The back of the hat<br /> is to short, it does not cover any of the back of your neck. The face mask is bad, it's basically just a piece of cloth with snaps, it rides up in front of your eyes. Great hat if you want something comfortable and kinda warm. Poor hat if you want a really warm hat."
3.0,Earrings broken
3.0,"Overall the quantity of this band is nice. The silicone is a little stiffer than the bands that come with the Gear Fit 2. And it's smooth instead of textured, which is fine. It feels pleasant on the wrist, but not quite as &#34;forget it's on&#34; as the Samsung bands. The clasp feels more secure being a buckle. But the attachment to the Gear Fit 2 is slightly loose, but had never fallen off or detached of its own acord. It's easy to remove. My biggest complaint is the piece that covers the extra flap after the band is buckled on your wrist does not stay in place. I end up with the flap sticking out and annoying me. I continually have to put it back in place."
3.0,"These slippers look nice, but run VERY small.  My son wears a size 2 in street shoes and I ordered the 3/4.  They are way too small, we would need a 5/6!"
3.0,"The gloves fit perfectly around my hand, but the fingers are too long by about ½"". Probably for women with long nails, but if you keep your nails short it's quite annoying.<br /><br />Seems to work fine on touchscreens, but I wasn't able to test it much due to the poor fit, it was impossible to accurately tap on anything."
3.0,Material was a little thinner than expected but looks great.
3.0,"Meh, these weren't as &#34;vibrant&#34;as I expected them to be. Just ok"
3.0,"I took the wire out on these and still had fit issues. I got one band size larger and I wish I hadn't. I'm usually a 36C/B and got a 38C. I think it would work better if I had a 38D since really my issue is that the cup size is not large enough so it doesn't stay on right.<br /><br />This is probably partially my fault for not just getting a different size because otherwise I really like the design and they are super cute, I just hate the feeling of having to adjust them constantly."
3.0,Not the best quality (already stretching a bit at the seams) but common you get what you pay for! Solid suit for $10..<br /><br />These bathing suits are notorious for being weirdly sized so I always order a small and medium. $20 is still a bargain for a suit and you get the perfect size!
3.0,"Ordered this thinking it was a sweater based on review. Ran a bit large on me and the twist doesn't lay flat on me making me look pregnant. It's ok, just not what I was looking for"
3.0,The leather quality is inferior. The needlework is also a little different from the picture. I found this band based on the code of my watch and it is much inferior than the original. Maybe it was just my expectation and that is ehat we get for this price range.
3.0,The first time I put these on my son the pull handle just snapped. I'm truly concerned how long before the rest of the boot cracks.
3.0,This was a great suit when I first purchased it. I swam 2x per week in the spring for 8 weeks and then signed up for the fall session and figured it would last the entire 8 weeks. Unfortunately it has already become baggy and loose around the legs.
3.0,They’re not really pink but they’re cute.
3.0,"Its Ok, but not what i was looking for.  It was much wider than I thought it would be and didn't work for a small purse.  I had to return it."
3.0,hard to see the l I the word plant
3.0,"First it came in late had to get a replacement sent and the emblem is off center, wasn't happy with it."
3.0,slightly bigger and too wide
3.0,I normally fit and XL and I purchased an XXL that fits tightly.
3.0,To short for grown men
3.0,They’re Okay. They don’t clip together that nicely. Kind of rough and gets stuck. Not smooth operation.
3.0,Nice glasses but very wide.
3.0,"This is a pretty necklace and seems well made, but it is just too short for me.  I think this is more for a teenager."
3.0,"The print on the shirts wasn't high quality, its a little blurry. I ordered a large and its pretty big. I should have gone a size smaller."
3.0,"Ordered size small.  Package, and top both labeled small, but actual fit is more toward medium, or even large. Like the fabric, & the length.  Tried to shrink it with really hot water, and high dryer heat, it would not shrink!  So, I would say that the fabric is shrink resistant.  I'm sure that my top was sized wrong, and I will be buying another top."
3.0,The stretch is not as much as I had hoped for!
3.0,"The material was like paper. I literally was able to rip it with my thumbs & index fingers. It didn’t unwrinkle no matter what, so it looked like a tacky, ill fitting dress that just got pulled out of the packaging"
3.0,"Fine for the price, but with these dresses you're really getting what you're paying for. Didn't dislike it enough to return it, but probably wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Love the way it looks difficulty staying in my ear
3.0,For the price it was ok no wow factor.
3.0,"I bought this item in hopes that it would be similar to an eye-liner a friend got when she traveled to Turkey.  The one she got me was similar in shape to the Shahnaz eye liner, but much softer making it easy to apply, especially to the waterline.  The Shaeyes is ok (easy to use), I just wish it was softer.<br />The bangles are really, really tiny."
3.0,"These glasses look definetely cute in pictures, but not so much in person."
3.0,"It's comfy, but the front seems longer than the back, and one of the pockets on the short part is sewn on upside down!  I wish the fabric wasn't so shiny, but love the long shorts."
3.0,"The dress print and fabric were great, fit wise it could have been longer. I found t wear the belt because I’m tall and it made the dress fall way above my knee. Also, it would be nice if the designer added straps underneath the armpits to keep it falling off your shoulders. I wore to my cousins wedding and the off the shoulder part rode up all day which in turn causes the dress to be too short on me and had me pulling it down all day. I rated 3 stars because it is a nice dress and I got lots of compliments but tall girls beware! (I’m 5’9” and bought the XL just for reference)"
3.0,I first ordered a size medium as that is usually the size I get in almost everything but the bottoms were SO small! I returned it and got a Large instead. The top fit nicely but the bottoms are still tight! I decided to keep it just because I like the top so much and just wear a different black bikini bottom with it instead.
3.0,they are super cute and good quality for the price tho! iverall im happy with this purchase
3.0,Just to big for me.
3.0,"This charm is lovely and everything they say it true. However, what they do not list is that unlike other similar charms this bead is one sided. The opposite side is plain silver. If, like me, you intended to put this on a bracelet or necklace chain as a small, unobtrusive alert please look elsewhere. It is top heavy (as many beads are) and so it flips. I am going to see if putting it on the bracelet backwards helps ( so that when it flips it will be showing the picture upside down) but it is not to be relied on as an alert. It very well may be flipped when you need it most."
3.0,This brand of tap shoes run small. Always size up
3.0,The Y was missing!
3.0,I am 5'2 145 pounds. Thick in the thighs. Measured 40 in the thigh ordered size Large in Black. perfect for my size. I wlll be ordering again. Make sure to measure by the thighs.<br />********Ordered a second pair in another color. Night and Day. Second pair no wear near the same material thin and not cut right. Then there is a fee to return the item and they deduct from the return.  I am returning anuways so UNHAPPY*******
3.0,i liked them but half of them the balls wont come off and i didnt get the ones i wanted soo kind of a waste
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes larger and it still doesn't fit.  And due to COVID and all sorts of reasons I missed the return window.  BOOOO.<br /><br />A 3x is about a 10-12 in this cardigan. Order accordingly.  I have bought Larace draped shirts in the past, so I did not have concerns about this or try it on right away either..."
3.0,"Quality's really scuffed. The print is pretty bad and all pixel-y, and the seams on the inside are large and uncomfortable. The fabric itself kind of feels like a type of really cheap silk, but it's obvious that it's polyester. Drawstrings are really long, and it stinks when it comes in, but that's kind of expected. Bought it as a way to cheaply make a Mando costume, but I have other resources luckily. I would recommend if you're really desperate to have a cheap Mando hoodie, but if not, I'd wait until fans make better ones."
3.0,Great look and quality although my lobes got infected twice
3.0,I love the feel of this shirt but I need a tight neck when wearing it. This collar is to loose.
3.0,"This was a beautiful wrap bracelet.  However, It didn't offer enough versatility for me.  It was somewhat subdued and I wear other of these bracelets for weekends and special occasions.  For everyday, if you wear black, this is the one for you."
3.0,Really nice looking shoes but within a couple of weeks they were already starting to look worn down I was really hoping they’d last longer
3.0,"Good material, love the texture. Just wish it was long in the back for more of a oversized comfy look."
3.0,On the picture looks perfect product<br />But wen a recive it looks ship from the flea market product
3.0,"The hat fit, but the brim is so outsized that my son looks clownish in this."
3.0,Very comfortable but the padding is too far back.
3.0,"This leo was much smaller than other brands.  The quality was great, but disappointed it was too tight."
3.0,The waist line was too big the drawstring was really long
3.0,The materials make the bag itself heavier than I anticipated.
3.0,"The handle broke ,I love them so much but the weak handle ,need to contact seller"
3.0,"The fit was just all right. I wear about an 8-10 on top, a 12 on bottom, and I ordered the large. Because I have a narrow rib cage, the top was a little big. I got the black and white 3/4 sleeve with wide stripes as in the picture. The skirt seemed to be a little too high and gave me too much volume in the bottom, which I don't need. I will be returning this."
3.0,Kind of cheap material.
3.0,"They're fine, just not the best solution probably."
3.0,"I really want to love these gloves. They're comfortable, look nice, warm, work great with a phone and seem to be durable. Unfortunately if your hands sweat at all they take DAYS to dry if you don't have a glove dryer. I live in the Colorado mountains and ski a lot. If I ski hard I have to wait up to 5 days until I can wear these again. They also tend to smell as a result."
3.0,"Bought as a Christmas present.  Recipient always wears this brand and always wears a medium. Surprised it ran small, had to order a large.  There was no problem in exchanging."
3.0,I ordered L but the tshirt fits more like M
3.0,"Good, soft, durable, but it shrank in the wash! Knew that it would, but at least I can still wear it."
3.0,The fabric is not as lightweight as it seems
3.0,The back of the shirt is solid white but it's a bit see through:(
3.0,"I absolutely love this bag, but the bottom ripped out of one side after just a few months of use."
3.0,"The material is light and flowy, the bust and sleeves are perfect, but if you’re an Apple shape leave this dress behind. It’s cut so small in the bodice I almost ripped the seam."
3.0,Cute on me.
3.0,"One of my support rods broke at the first big wind.  I'll have to throw it away now after only a few weeks.  I liked it very much up till then though.  It fit onto my narrow deck, and that is a hard thing to find."
3.0,"Does the job,  not super fashionable."
3.0,Sizes are a Little smaller than said.
3.0,"very nice material, and fits as expected.  would have been a 5 star rating, but after the first wash, inside out of course, the tongue is already starting to fray, and pull away from the shirt itself!  really too bad, nice wearing shirt."
3.0,Product arrived quickly but was very small in size. Colors were fine.
3.0,Did not like this. Looked long in picture but was way too short. Returned it.
3.0,tight on ankle and uncomfortable but super cute
3.0,These are adorable and so soft! They run very small though I have to return them.
3.0,"The workmanship was shoddy with the fishline sticking out in many places. The hook/chain in the back is cheap and looks like it was put there as an afterthought ( you can change this, I did).<br />Overall it looks cheap the way it arrived."
3.0,"Ordered an XL since it is coming from Asian market, couldnt get it across my shoulders much less to button it.  XL fit like a small medium."
3.0,"These are cute, but run a bit small. I also ended up ripping the little loop that you use to put on the boots during my first try-on, so I guess they're lacking a bit of quality there. The actual shoe itself seems good quality and offers good support, though. I will probably still wear them, just with thin socks."
3.0,"Cute, nice material, but very small and not stretchy in the top. XL doesn't fit over my DDD's."
3.0,El final 🥰
3.0,my iPhone 6 does not fit in it.
3.0,"Nice fit, but the 100% acrylic thing just didn't work for me. Too me, it looked cheap. Returned."
3.0,Okay.  Don't know if it works though.
3.0,"Not as much support as I had hoped, but very comfortable."
3.0,"Looks like a really nice watch. However after a few wears, it begins to fade. I recommend buying a few just to have"
3.0,Cute exterior. Tight interior.
3.0,"The material is comfortable, but thin. Makes a nice layering piece, but is a bit transparent to wear alone."
3.0,Broken :(
3.0,The buttons were hard to fit through the hole and it was a bit too long for me but the quality was good
3.0,5’2/145lbs/36C. So form fitting and very snug arms and top. May use a shawl or sheer long top to hide the way it fits. Feels like it weighs 5 lbs need to pack for a flight. Ordered a large. Still deciding if I should return for a xlarge
3.0,"Good fit. I am 5 5, 160 lb, and typically wear a size 8 or size medium in dresses. I purchased a small, and it fit perfectly. The dress runs a little big. Nice color. Material was delivered with a hole in it. The material is pretty thin and the quality is not that great."
3.0,You have to hand wash it or send it to the dry cleaners....
3.0,They stretch out pretty fast and I only wore them twice.
3.0,"El material es bien sencillo, lo compre rojo y con la sorpresa de que suelta color y me daño una blusa blanca que me había puesto junto con la chaqueta"
3.0,I love this dress.  However it was way too long.  Sadly I had to return
3.0,Liked the shirt design however it fit too small and sewn funky around the upper arm and chest. Sadly returned it because I wasnt confident a larger size would be the answer due to the pattern it was sewn with.
3.0,"The nose clip was outside of the mask, so we had to cut a tiny hole into the back of the mask to squeeze it in. Otherwise, the material was comfortable and cute."
3.0,Chain is big and maybe plastic or aluminum it’s super light like it’s gonna break and you’ll be on the floor
3.0,Too small for men fingers. The right size for little girls.
3.0,"The fit was fine and they were comfortable.  My issue is that the straps are not sewn on, they are heat pressed together.  So the strap broke the first time I wore it."
3.0,"Pretty but is very short. I'm 5'8 and this came to like mid calves. Also, it is very thin material and see through so it needs layered."
3.0,Overall I do like this shirt. Nice and long. Color doesn't match the picture. Its more pink than purple. Also paw print doesn't line up with the back of my hand like in the picture. It would be better if paw print was actually a cat paw print too.
3.0,I travel a lot for work and bought this at a friends recommendation. It is great at keeping everything organized. The thing that is not so great is the weight of this item for me. It is .7 lbs which is too heavy for just keeping my stuff organized.
3.0,"The earring looks more three dimensional online, but the design is actually kind of flat. It is a good size though and comfortable to wear."
3.0,"When I tried this dress on, I was sure to return it cause I felt the tying bow thing in the front is not that flattering and their is an opening that would  should have been sewn in. Also that extra layer in the front is useless, it would have been a beautiful dress if not for that extra layer in the front. Also on the front chest it looks undone, plain and boring. At first I though it made my shape unflattering but I decided to give it a go and wear it and once I wore it, I liked the color and the dress.  So I  decided not to return it. That hole in the bow area I will need to definitely sew up."
3.0,Very nice suit. Might recommend a size up if you have a longer torso like myself.
3.0,"The bracelet was gorgeous but the packaging, one of the reasons for the purchase, was very disappointing. The boxed was visibly damaged and the tassel stuck on with a giant glob of glue."
3.0,"Fits great on bust and shoulders but fairly snug and hips for someone like me with an hourglass figure. I bought a large and wear 36DD. It is soft and thick with the t-shirt type cami built it, probably why it feels thick. The lace is soft and the blouse is well made."
3.0,The size was to big so I wash the product in hot water
3.0,"The heels of the shoes are folded in, very cheep materials..not happy"
3.0,its not bad.
3.0,I had to glue them in place because the little rubber ring is very weak and doesn't hold. The length is nice that's the only Plus.
3.0,Very pretty very thin
3.0,I am giving these three stars because they are so different from the original Cheeks of which I had four pair!  The tan ones were a total NO GO and the purple ones I can wear easily but they are cut much narrower than the original Cheeks athletic sandal.  What a total shame.  Tony Little had a really good thing going with the original ones as they were just an excellent shoe.  These are just ill fitting flip flops!  Will not recommend and will not buy another pair!
3.0,"They're cute, and just the right size. I've only had them in for a few weeks and lost 2 of them. The star shaped one really digs into the skin and makes them very irritating and unwearable. I wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,"This is very pretty but far too big, maybe OK for men but it's a good 2.5"" further up my arm, has bypassed my wrist! wish I'd read the reviews first. Think the one I ordered before was from Amazon UK, so my mistake as can't find an order from USA!!"
3.0,The sweater design looks good but looks like it was made in a rush. Some parts have string’s hanging but I cut them and it looks fine but could be better if not rushed.
3.0,Someone small but still wearable.
3.0,"What you see online is one thing, what is actual is another. Too flimsy for me but made a good gift for someone else"
3.0,Dress is cute but the sleeves make you look kinda bulky..
3.0,"Took to the water park, it was fine."
3.0,"Top was delivered on time. I'm returning the item because it's see through and more like  something you would wear over a swimming suit, not something you would wear to go out. I'm attaching some pictures so you can see how thin the material is. I feel it's too expensive for what it is, I can find something similar at a Ross store for less than half the price and around the same quality."
3.0,i do not feel stable in these shoes.
3.0,I give it three stars because it didn't fit me they were too small for my face and I have a oval face . But it fit perfectly on my 5 year old son. So he got to rock them. Other than been too small the condition and quality color was excellent.  Guess if you have a very small face it won't be a problem.  I'm a petite 5&#34;2 135 pounds. If that helps. Thanks
3.0,Not as stated...returning
3.0,Decent hat but colors fade quickly.
3.0,When I first tried these on I was in love. Super soft and stretchy. Very comfortable. Unfortunately they shrunk a TON when I washed them. They got shorter and the rise also shrunk. I’m so bummed!
3.0,"These shoes are definitely super cute and have a wide toe box for proper foot development which is great BUT within the first hour of wear , the rubber began pealing off (my daughter walks and doesn't crawl at all so it's not from dragging the foot). So I know these won't hold up well for long at all. At this price point I am very disappointed."
3.0,"I order the 2Pcs-18g 8mm-3mm Sapphire Crystal for my daughter and everything seemed fine until the other day, I gave it to her as a gift, she tried it on but one balls didn't fit correctly, like it didn’t fit, so it got lost as soon as she put it on ... This is frustrating because when I receive it, it looked fine and really pretty but how can it be that from the fist day of use it got broken and lost?... for this price I expect something better or a solution please."
3.0,They run small.  They fit my 9 year old granddaughter.  I can get them on our they are tight.  The quality isn’t the best.  But they are super cute.
3.0,"First, the good - I like the fabric a lot. It's a very traditional waffle knit. Super soft, super comfortable. The rose color is really lovely.<br /><br />The not so good - It is sized a solid 1-2 sizes down. The elastic waist is stitched kind of weird, and doesn't lay well.<br /><br />Bottom line - order at least 1 size larger, 2 if you want a looser fit. Be aware there is an elastic waist that is about 2 inches wide, and will twist when you wash it. This item really didn't work for me."
3.0,"The description says spaghetti straps, but if you look at them some have a wider strap. I made sure to choose the one with a wider strap. Sadly however I still recieved the slim spaghetti straps."
3.0,"This necklace is truly stunning and very earthy looking HOWEVER, even with an adjustable clasp, the length is much longer than the picture so it drapes over the bust. Still cute though...I just haven't found an outfit for it because I prefer shorter, collar length necklaces."
3.0,"The rings I was sent do not match exactly the photos on Amazon.  There are only 3 separate rings on each one, not four.  There are other small differences.  This is not fine jewelry.  I knew that and ordered them for my grandsons to play with.  I haven’t given them to them yet to see how much they’ll like them.  I can tell they’ll be too large to stay securely on their little fingers.  But they were inexpensive and come two to a package.  Would I buy this to wear myself?  No.  Would I buy them for other little boys who are into magic make-believe play?  Yes, I would."
3.0,"I received a grayish color camo tank. I ordered the green camo, but love the top and the flag pocket. The top is a little big and is long. There was also a hole by the shoulder but easy fix."
3.0,good quality but slip alot
3.0,Fits well in the hips but a little loose in the waist.. it is cute and def cannot complain for the sale price. The fabric is on the flimsier side.
3.0,Very nice But could be made a little bit better and quality
3.0,It did not make it here before Christmas and I ordered it almost 2 months before christmas. It was very small but fit him but wont fit for long.
3.0,"Earnings are very pretty, but not well made. The second time wearing the earring broke away from post and I lost the earring"
3.0,"Cute, small. It was a pin for my shadowbox and it serves the purpose. Not recommended for a &#34;pinning&#34; pin. But the colors are pretty."
3.0,I loved it for 2 days until the turtle came of somewhere :( never could wear it again and was past the return date by time I wore it.  I had saved it for our Hawaiian vacation!
3.0,Like the style and color.  The fit is a little snug. ( I wear size 7 shoe).  Also the toe part is rather small compared to other toe covers I have bought.  If it wasn't for the elastic band they would fall off very easily.  Still okay for the money.
3.0,"These are cute, but they are HUGE.  Like Elton John huge.  Not really wearable for everyday, IMO, but they are nice enough that I saved them for our costume and dress-up box.  It's really too bad, because the design is absolutely adorable."
3.0,"These stretch like no other hose I've worn before. The top part has very light if any control. The leg part stretches much less and feels fairly sturdy, but they don't shrink back after stretching out and end up looking baggy."
3.0,It's very pretty but had to return because one end wouldn't release from the watch.
3.0,My belly button rejected it for some reason? I thought this material was hypoallergenic..I've had mine pierced for six years and this is the first ring it rejected..and my acrylic was kind of bent and didn't sit straight In my belly button and tilted at a weird angle.
3.0,"These gloves are pretty much what I expected from a pair of simply black mens leather gloves. I did not try the touch screen features as I will be attempting to return these gloves as there is one aspect which for me is not what I want, and that is the cuff. As you can see in the pictures, the cuff on the new glove I very small and does not wrap around my arm, in fact it is loose. This is not what I want in a glove. If that is what you want, then it will work for you. the other gloves in the picture are older and in need of replacement."
3.0,Maybe I wanted this dress too bad. I should have checked the size chart. This dress is not plus size friendly. Thought it might have some stretch to it but the material isnt stretchy at all. It wouldnt even go past my hips. Will have to find another dress.
3.0,"Great fabric and color, but style not for me."
3.0,"I've had this watch for many years and have not had a problem with it.  Worked flawlessly for 4 years... just this past month, the compass, altimeter and light stopped working under normal use.  The watch is no long under warranty, so I think I'm out of luck.  Only the time part is still working. Casio only has a 1 year warranty.  Disappointed in the durability of the all the other functions."
3.0,An awkward fit for my body type.
3.0,Very cute runs super small I'm usually a large the pants didn't fit over my thighs sent back and ordered a xl. Crop top is kinda short
3.0,Nice looking glasses except for the size they are bigger than oversized and take up most of my face.
3.0,Very cute looks just like the pic but doesn't fit small ppl I'm the size of the girl in the pic and it's very loose falls off my shoulder so one size fits mostly bigger ppl lol
3.0,"The printed side has good color and contrast. But trying to wear the scarf in such a way that only that side shows is frustratingly difficult. The back side isn't ugly. Its just rather drab in comparison with the front.<br /><br />I am also disappointed that the scarf is not as soft as I hoped it would be. I wanted a scarf this size so I could use it as a wrap to cover my shoulders when needed. It will work for them. I just won't be as snuggly as I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />I'll keep it because I bought it for an upcoming trip, and it will serve my purposes for that trip. But I would not buy one as a gift."
3.0,Love the skirt but absolutely hate hate the way the back pockets are! They don’t lay flat on your backside. Have to wear a shirt that goes over it defeating the whole purpose of tucking in your shirt. Redesign it! It sucks!
3.0,is  ok not big deal
3.0,I Love this necklace I’ve purchased it in gold it’s so pretty.  I’ve worn it twice so far and the chain has already tarnished. I picked it up for the 3rd time to put it on and the chain was is discolored. It hasn’t even been a week yet. I’m so upset over it. It really is a beautiful peice.
3.0,Didn't like the material and the fit on me. Color is exactly as pictured.
3.0,its to big other than that i like it
3.0,Comfortable and soft shirt but material feels too thick and heavy for long distance running and running on hot summer days
3.0,"This shirt fits kind of long on my torso. It's tight enough, but too long to keep the front from bulging forward. Unfortunately, just doesn't look as good on me as it does in the picture. I'm 5'9 ,165lbs,  and medium build. I think this is best suited for someone who is taller, but more slender."
3.0,"Disclaimer: This product is not a shoe and does not provide support for your arches. Review form came with a questionnaire as if the item was a shoe.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Stylish, pretty good reflection.<br />-Nice to have for those moments you or your friends need to use a mirror<br />-Original order had scratches, seller told me to keep it and sent me a new one. Seller was quick to respond and to send a replacement. Unfortunately, the 2nd pair also had scratches on the lenses. I would have returned it, but I was just about to leave for vacation and had no time to address it.<br />-Won't cry if I lose it or damage it<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Price is a little too steep for the quality<br />-Cheap quality, not heavy duty plastic<br />-Product arrived pre-scratched...not too badly except the scratches were directly in my line of vision, replacement also had scratches<br />-Needs better packaging so it doesn't get scratched, a case or sleeve would be nice."
3.0,Good color. Fabric doesn't lay as well as I would like.
3.0,"I listened to all the reviews and bought a medium when I usually buy a small. Unfortunately, the medium fit more like a large. Unfortunately they don't seem to have any smalls in stock, so I'll be returning it.<br /><br />Quality is good. It's about as good as a $30 jacket could be. I wish I could comment on how it looks while wearing it, but it's far too large to give an accurate example.<br /><br />If I had bought the right size, it would have been a good buy. I'd recommend it"
3.0,"To big, looks fake"
3.0,"The material is incredibly thin, almost paper like. Although being lightweight is possibly more comfortable, it feels like there would be no protection at all from any kind of a hot spill."
3.0,Huge skirt<br />Cute but so poofy
3.0,They tear very easily. Like riding in the car to dance class and they are torn by the time we get there.
3.0,Great price for quality
3.0,"They are very pretty sunglasses, but the lenses are very delicate. I have worn them twice and I already have a pretty nasty scratch in one of the lenses. I was very careful in putting them down properly and put them in the case when not using them, but still ended up with a scratch. So, I will need a new pair. They are very pretty and the frames are made well. The lenses need some work."
3.0,Not form fitting like the hour-glass shape. It's really wide at the bottom.  Colors are faded from the picture before first wash. It's comfy.
3.0,Fits great love the color. I did have to sew the pocket together but I love this dress.
3.0,"Had hoped for better quality fabric and not thin, cheap-feeling shirt. Graphic was nice, but the t-shirt material was very low quality, not soft fabric at all. Sad that we spent so much on this shirt for the Firefly fan in our family."
3.0,"I started by buying XL as recommended, did not fit way too tight, so I ordered a XXL and that was too tight also.....XXXL is what I ended up with, everyone says they shrink, don't use dryer air dry if possible. Otherwise happy with it so far."
3.0,Nice jacket need a heavy lining looks nice
3.0,"Liked the material. Belt was too short, not long enough to wrap around."
3.0,Soft and comfortable fabric.
3.0,I’m kinda bummed. I was super excited about these because they took fantastic on the model. I’m 5’5 and 108 pounds. I ordered a size 1 since it’s the smallest size they offer. The pants fit perfect through the legs but the waist and bum area is just a little too big. I think if I wear a belt I can make them work but kinda lame that they still don’t fit even though I got the smallest size. But the color is beautiful fabric is quality and they are super soft.
3.0,"This product wasn't the right color, picked red, got a maroon color, the top front of night gown is not exactly as described, the bodice/breast area is farther apart then picture or description. It really doesn't fit right, I have tighten it as far as it will go and the bodice/breast area still doesn't sit where it should. It is either rising or I fall out the top sides or middle (gap between the breasts). It is comfortable other then that. The material is slightly silky and thin, I would be careful when washing it! I am guessing portions, size, fit will be different for others, however I feel the top part of this nightgown could have been designed and made/sewn better better."
3.0,The product is cute
3.0,"I loved the dino print and was pretty jazzed about the cut of the dress - it was flattering. But, I couldn't get passed the fabric - shiny spandex, like a thin bathing suit. I couldn't make it work. Back it went. Farewell, dinosaur dress. P.S. Someone should actually make a bathing suit out of this fabric - I would really dig a dino bikini."
3.0,My wife finds that it does not live up to the advertising of a fit for a 7&#34; wrist...can't use it may give it to a small child...at least is was only costume<br />piece!
3.0,"I recieved two pair, as i should have, unfortunately only one pair was the correct color. The other one was black frame with black lens. While it's ""ok"", im not a fan of the black pair on myself. The ""green"" pair is pretty cool."
3.0,Meh. These are cheap work gloves I keep in my truck. They feel really cheap and I can't believe they'll last long. I've used them to load some wood/etc and the fit is pretty good for that kind of quick work.
3.0,This is a pretty pendant. It's actually bigger than I thought it was going to be.
3.0,The chain is a bit short
3.0,I just opened this product . I have not had an opportunity  to use it yet ..I purchased  these to use for softball . I can say just by holding em that they seem a tad  flimsy  . Not sure how well they will hold up . Look great . Lense seems ok . First impression ..I got what I paid for . A cheap pair of sunglasses
3.0,Look cute.
3.0,she like it but very very small
3.0,Not sure why feedback says they dont slip coz they still do on me. I guess have to make a search again
3.0,But a size bigger. Snug around the chest
3.0,Would be a great product if they had a strip of sticky material at the opening to keep them on the foot. Slide off foot too easily. Disappointing.
3.0,I like the mask but it’s big enough to cover my entire face. Also the nose part is not very study so doesn’t stay molded to your face.
3.0,"The length of the links makes this chain a bit less flexible than I was hoping for. Bico makes a style with shorter links, which is more flexible, but that necklace didn't come in the overall length I wanted."
3.0,"The pants are really cute. The grey color bordered on tan and fit me really awkwardly. The waist band sat on my true waist as opposed to my hips where most pants fit me, and they're too long for me as well. I considered keeping them around for lounge wear but they're not comfortable enough for that. The legs have a huge flare at the end which would be ok if they werent so long. Overall, I dknt plan to keep these because of sizing issues."
3.0,It fits okay but the fabric is kinda pink everything else is acceptable for the price
3.0,Cute pattern but the length was awkwardly long. Would be perfect if they were a few inches shorter. Otherwise good quality.
3.0,Very cute dress but probably 2 sizes too small for me. I gave it to my daughter and it fit perfectly. Very cute on her!
3.0,Button not strong enough to hold mask
3.0,Material is not what I expected. It’s a heavy polyester & I though it would be more like a cotton jersey
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but the quality is not great. The bows came apart with in hours, the first time my daughter used it."
3.0,If to small you will hate it.
3.0,"Socks are very vibrant and funky and came beautifully packaged! My husband said they are real comfortable and fit nicely but the only problem is, one pair has already ripped within a day's worth of normal wear! I submitted my info to the company's warranty site which claims to have a 1 year replacement warranty, so I am hopeful. Will update with any further news. Seems like a great company, would like to give 5 stars!"
3.0,I love the color and it does fit. However there is no support for someone with a larger chest or even medium chest. Fits enough to not deal with returns
3.0,"I returned the first one because the stitching was bad.  I ordered a second one, it might have been a little better but stitching still wasn’t good."
3.0,"Cute pattern and style, super thin, runs very large."
3.0,"This nightgown is super flattering and I loved it so much I bought another color! That being said.... the color in the lace covering the breasts fades rather quickly. I might just need to take better with the wash & care instructions, but beware! They're old and dingy looking now and not sexy after only a couple of months of wear."
3.0,"Cool earrings. Cheaply made, but that was expected. The snake really makes the ear rings."
3.0,Nice style but not the material. :/<br />Only wore this for three days.
3.0,Cheap material and really short. To expensive. I will be lucky to get 1 wear out of it.
3.0,Ya it works. I got it just as a cute beach cover dress. Its a very thin and cheap.
3.0,Sizing is off runs really small
3.0,"Cute, but I don't think they're very comfortable. The rubber is made pretty cheap and a part of it digs into my daughters instep."
3.0,"This robe is very expensive for what it is. It is very soft and it feels nice, but I didn't get the belt. If you are looking for an absorbent robe, this is not it. It is soft, but more like a poly fleece. This robe doesn't have a feminine look to it, just a robe. I had a robe that finally gave out that had an attached belt that had gathers in the back, it was feminine and shapely. Wish I could find another like that."
3.0,WE DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ON THIS YET. WE ARE QUITE SURE IT WIULL BE OK. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW.<br /><br />THANKS
3.0,Fits large but cute
3.0,"The bulkier the jewelry, the cheaper it looked. The color wasn't as I imagined but a brighter, yellow color rather than real gold. Came in a yellow box and within the box is the chain and bracelet in a plastic."
3.0,Like the dress but the material was not the expected!
3.0,I thought the stress was adorable and I loved the style but it was too small for me. I also didn't care for the fabric which is very thin and slippery. I'm sure is perfect for someone else.
3.0,These were just ok.. I thought they were gonna be full size wands but they are very small made to be pendants on a necklace. Definitely Chinese made and packaging on the inside is very cheap. Was ok for my 7 year old.
3.0,"The id window is to small, otherwise it's good. Gonna keep it for a back up"
3.0,To big and don’t have smaller size!😞
3.0,"Ok jewelry for the price but honestly they look cheap. You get what you pay for. And on one, the large pearl in the center had a scratch so the &#34;faux&#34; pearl covering peeled back in the center. Will possibly order again but will have to find another option for my wedding jewelry."
3.0,Very shiny metal. I expected a brushed look based on the picture
3.0,"Comfortable robe, thought it would've been softer.."
3.0,"These masks are very hit and miss. Most are so small, the eye holes hardly fit right. The few that are a decent/good fit look really nice though. We needed them for a masquerade party where we went as vampires and we found some that fit well enough. They were so cheap though I can't complain too much."
3.0,"I bought a set of e-bags packing cubes ~5 years ago.<br /><br />They have worked for me very well. I, however, misplaced my largest packing cube. I bought this set to compiment my e-bags. While these cubes aren't as well made as the e-bags cubes, they are very sturdy and have durable zippers.<br /><br />My biggest problem is honestly the size of the cubes. The smallest cube from this set is 4x the size of my largest cube from e-bags. I never pack a full sized suitcase, so the amount of storage from these bags is overkill.<br /><br />If other packing cubes are too small for you, then these are the right packing cubes!"
3.0,"The print and dress itself is cute. However it does run smaller and is tight fit all the way around, especially in the stomach. If you're average weight, this dress will be prefect. If you're larger and have a belly, it'll show and make you look pregnant."
3.0,Unflattering on me. The ruffles around the neckline stand straight up. I have a long torso so I can have trouble with fit anyway.
3.0,"So handed these to my guy and he laughed for like 15 minutes while trying to put them on.  Being a women I am like really, your underwear options are that limited.  If you only knew half the things I have had to put on...<br /><br />Anyway, he tried these on.  He is 6ft 250 and the XL fits him very well.  He rated the following items for me:<br /><br />1. The ability to keep a shirt tucked in comfortably:  5 stars would give more<br />2. The comfortability of the shorts them selves: 4 stars.  (These sit higher on his thighs then he prefers)<br />3. The ability to “pee”: 2 Stars<br /><br />In order to go to the bathroom you have a few options.  One you have to pull up the leg hole an go out the leg hole.  Two you pull down your pants, untuck your shirt, then pull your underwear down to complete.  Three “make your own flap” by  cutting a hole in them.  I am guessing his reasoning behind this is that the tuck strap is like a jock strap attached to boxers and that will cover any hole you put in the boxers."
3.0,Arrived with missing screw!! Bummer...
3.0,Did not help as much as all copper
3.0,Prefer magnetic hold back compared to velcro that is on these gloves.
3.0,"The jacket is quite warm given its thickness and weight. Light and flexible enough for long jogs.<br />By the feel and durability of it, it is indeed good quality as expected in this price range.<br />What I don't like is that the pocket zippers have to be pulled COMPLETELY DOWN to open and use. Because the zipper starts near chest for some reason, this leaves a large window for cold air to move into the pocket making it way less effective. Pretty silly detail I didn't notice. (Either decrease length of zipper, or make it so one must pull up, that way the opening is adjustable)<br />Also, although flexible enough, the jacket is stiffer than expected, and kinda fits like a suit with its square shoulders and straight sides. Basically, It's not 'form-fitting' by any means."
3.0,Ordered XL package marked L
3.0,This shirt is more like a crop too except... not? So the shirt is too long to be a crop top but too short to be a tee shirt. Not a fan.
3.0,"This shoe has a lovely color, texture and style and I was pleased by all that.<br /><br />My girlfriend was very anxious to wear them and unfortunately after a couple hours her feet were very tired and sore. (She's extremely fussy about shoes) The style made the cut, but the comfort level didn't make the grade.<br /><br />She gave them a rest and has been trying to break them in slowly, but it's clear to me that the problem with these shoes is that they offer no support."
3.0,True to Picture but smaller in person.
3.0,"The cowl neckline wasn't as generous as it looks in the picture, and the sleeves are more like 3/4 length, so you'd want to push them up for sure. the strings were super thin width way. However, it was nice and long! Only 5% cotton. Mostly Poly. I wouldn't pay as much for it, I'd happily pay about half what I did for it."
3.0,Gloves are a bit bulky but very warm.  Touch screen works well.
3.0,"It would be nice if they adjusted so you could either lengthen the band or shorten the band.  They barely fit, so are a bit uncomfortable - but they will work.  For the price though, you would think they would adjust."
3.0,"Similar to other reviewers, I can see the reflection of my eyes inside the lenses. It's off, but I'm adjusting to it.<br /><br />On the front of the lenses, there is a logo which I thought was a sticker but is etched into the lens. It's distracting.<br /><br />The build seems fine and I like the look.<br /><br />If I'd paid more for these, if return them, but for the price, they'll do ok."
3.0,"It was ordered for a costume, so didn't expect much.  For a hooded robe, the price was great.  Turned out to be quite comfy ,but  terry threads started to come loose immediately. After a wash, more loose threads.  Still, soft and very comfy.  31/2 stars for comfort, 1 star for quality."
3.0,i m a 5.5 and followed the size guild before placing the order - it turned out a bit too small - more like a 6 - so the sizing is not that accurate - I wanted to return it but was too busy so I missed the deadline. The quality of the boots are not bad - quite study so I gave it to my niece who has smaller feet. They should revise their size guild
3.0,It is a great shape and soft material but it is crazy thin. I have yet to find anything to wear under it that gives a seamless look.
3.0,The shirt just fit my 6 yo. a little small.  The Tutu skirt was so LARGE!  about a kids size 12-14.  Had to put her in a different tutu to make it work.  didn't have time to return and order a replacement.
3.0,"I've bought over 10 things from Allegra K and unfortunately this was one of the 2 I was unhappy with. It's a bit large, and the bow is so thick that when it's tied it looks clown-ish. Unfortunately I don't recommend this one- although the material is okay."
3.0,"True to size. Sadly, the red is more pink."
3.0,"The fabric is very light Jersey, soft but not warm. Runs large and fits baggy, comfortable though."
3.0,I ordered the yellow two piece set. I am 5'6 and weigh 165lbs. I am a 36DD in the chest area. I ordered a large after reading others reviews. I think this is the right size however the material is not what I expected. Its shiny. African print usually is not shiny. The blue looks shiny so I def didnt want that one but this one looks like regular african cloth. So I am a little disappointed with that however the most disappointment is when I try to lift my arms and cannot. The cut is off and different under both arms. Weird. It has nothing to do with my chest size as I have plenty of room their. The cut is completely off. Since I like the overall look minus these things I am going to take it to a seamstress to see of they can fix these crazy underarms. I tried to show it in the pics.
3.0,"For the money, you can't beat this deal! But if you are a full size person, forget it. They are VERY small! We gave all of our away to kids in the neighborhood, and they love them!"
3.0,didn't work for my costume
3.0,Kind of flimsy. Had to adjust them when I got them. I love the purple camo arms. Just not a great pair of glasses overall. Would not buy again.
3.0,"Very pretty around the neck and arm,<br />but fasteners came apart on both itens"
3.0,The flower would have to be tacked down to wear this.
3.0,Product works as advertised and sellers great to work with.
3.0,A lot shorter and tighter than the picture.
3.0,"It's kind of telling when the box something arrives in is better made than the product inside.<br /><br />This item was not packaged with any care whatsoever, and it took a long time to untangle the wadded mess it was in without breaking the thin chain.<br /><br />The design is cute and does grab attention. The chain just feels very fragile, and I have questions about its longterm durability. I think it's a fine gift for, say, a young teen who's starting to get into jewelry and accessories, but you'll definitely want to teach them how to store it to keep it from becoming the tangled mess it was when we received it."
3.0,"The ball on the end is pretty much the same diameter as the product itself so it has no way to hold itself in; so it comes right out, in the shower, putting on clothes, pretty much any activity you do in your every day life. LOL"
3.0,"I really like this tshirt & have received many compliments! Similar to other reviews, unfortunately the lettering on mine has cracked. I’ve been selective about wearing & washing it but after 3-4 times it no longer looks good. I’m extremely disappointed because I’m meticulous about my laundry and I didn’t think it would happen to my tshirt. I was going to order another one but decided to write a review instead. I can honestly say it was DOPE until it wasn’t :("
3.0,"I received the bracelet and loved it the instant I laid eyes on it.<br />It is very beautiful and quite heavy (the right weight if you ask me).<br /><br />The only problem is that the kitten's necks are very thin, so after one day of use the blue charm broke off.<br />I contacted the seller, they gave me a prompt response, and they are replacing the blue charm.<br /><br />I will update the review after I've worn the bracelet more time and after I replace the broken charm."
3.0,The product is good quality but isn’t as long as I would of liked.
3.0,Very cute and comfortable. Only 3 stars because all of the fabric on the right shoe is a few centimeters shorter then the left shoe. So one fits perfectly and the other one is a little tighter. A little disappointed but for $15 it's not bad.
3.0,"I was disappointed with the fabric type and color.<br />As shown in attached photos, the color is darker than beige. Also, the fabric pattern has a checkered weave. Therefore, the material and color doesn’t have a smooth feel.<br />Material looks like bamboo fiber; instead of polyester, rayon and spandex blend.<br />I’m 5’4” and wear 6-8 regular or medium but the sleeves were too long and more loose.<br />Also, the front does not have a breast tuck (see photo). Fits mannish than feminine."
3.0,Was well made but was a bit bigger than what I measured for
3.0,Like the color and it looks neat but you have to tap on the watch several times to get it to show the time and date and that’s bad
3.0,Fit perfectly and the glasses had some weight to it<br />Only get 3 stars because I had to tighten the right arm.
3.0,Good for what it is. They don't really stay in place and get caught in my hair but they are cute and work for temporary wearing. Good price though.
3.0,"The dress is so sweet,comfort is important to my eight year old. She loves it.Thank you."
3.0,It’s medium to large not what I was hoping for
3.0,Pendant nice...chain very cheap quality...had to replace chain with a nicer one ....
3.0,"It is worm, but does not look so good."
3.0,Cute but a bit tight. Almost long enough sleeves for a 6' chic.
3.0,It was super cute but unfortunately broke after 1 week
3.0,"This is very pretty but runs very small by 2 sizes. I gave to my niece instead of keeping. The bust size is very small as well, and a slip is a must."
3.0,"Ran a little smaller than expected, and too short for my 5'9"" frame."
3.0,For the price I do not expect much. It looks good and expensive from afar. I just wish the strap could be more  polished so it would not feel rough on the skin.
3.0,Is not off the shoulders and the shorts (even though they are my size) ride up. I have to keep pulling them down. I use this set as a lounge wear outfit.
3.0,"Not great. Not soft, kind of thin material. Does absolutely nothing for tummy control."
3.0,"These earrings are super cute - but this specific pair I got, well I can never wear them because the back of the earring is deformed. It is not long enough to go through my ear piercing. It only sticks out of the material a tiny bit, not allowing me to wear the earring. I am super sad about it."
3.0,Very thin and see threw. I bend over and they roll down
3.0,"bought them for winter but got hee to close to spring so have used them yet ,,, they look good and come in a nice case."
3.0,Looks great! However I was sent a womens XL and it does not fit. Will be returning
3.0,The thin shoulder straps fall down easily.
3.0,"The socks are cute and fit before washing, but they shrank during washing and are now too small. I would recommend sizing up."
3.0,"The gem is HUGE and pretty heavy... otherwise, it is as described."
3.0,I didnot like it. This product looks like a old one just after 1 time use.
3.0,These were cute but had to return. The waist was too tight for me- I’m thick waisted so it’s a common problem for me. I wish that they had a tad more stretch and I would have kept them
3.0,"Bracelet was as expected in color, material, fit & style. But, I have it beaded up and I've noticed that the magnetic end now gaps. Don't know if magnet needs to be stronger.  Currently,  I'm looking for locking beads w/safety chain before I wear it again, because I am fearful of loss. Perhaps it should only have a few beads, instead of 15-20 on it in order to keep it secure, but that was not stated in description. Normal usage for this type of bracelet involves pulling it apart to place beads, and placing the beads, no matter how many, on & off, in order to suit personal style & design.  It was a good price.  Still debating on giving it a good recommendation.  ***** UPDATE:  June 2, lost screw end---I guess it must be checked & re-checked (tight?) when worn! Normal, not-every-day wear, no abuse.  Didn't realize screw end could come undone -- and I know it was secure last time I modified beads.  Sitting in drawer, perhaps I'll look in hardware store for replacement end;  nah!"
3.0,Loved fabric and print ran a little snug
3.0,I really like them but they're too small.
3.0,"Cute, but too lightweight for any prescription lenses!"
3.0,Tiene poca compresión pero estan buenas
3.0,"These are huge, not what I expected. Had to return them."
3.0,It is an adorable suit and I love it but unfortunately the top fits oddly with the straps that you have to pull and when I contacted them about returning it they are only offering me 30% back and I haven't heard from them since
3.0,"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings because the picture was very misleading.  Otherwise they are pretty, so If you like smaller earrings go for it."
3.0,A gem fell off and was in the envelope.
3.0,"runs big ordered a Md fits like a Lg, material thin not worth the price."
3.0,"I was wavering between 2 or 3 stars...I opt for 3 because it’s my body type that does not agree with the style.  The dress look very cheap and is sewn horribly but if is a super comfy dress that may look nice on someone else.  It’s the to size, cooling fabric with stretch so that is why I gave 3 stars."
3.0,I purchased this item for a shoe stretcher I had. The item was delivered promptly but it didn’t fit my shoe stretcher. The posts were too large for the hole on my shoe stretcher. I wished it had fit.
3.0,Just bit baggy for me
3.0,"omgosh anyone else ??? they smell horrible, havent tried on yet, washed them and they smell worse, some strong chemical, will air outside and check again and rewrite review at that time"
3.0,A little on the thin side and I don't have any idea what is meant by compression-fit. I have specific compression gloves that I wear for arthritis pain relief and these gloves are nothing like them. I see no reason to buy these gloves again.
3.0,It’s not as pictured . They stretched the image way too much so now it looks goofy when worn. Other than that the quality of the material used is pretty great. It’s nice and thick and very soft .
3.0,these just seem to run a little small
3.0,Pendant was very cute but sadly the chain broke first time I wore it and its gone.
3.0,Super cute and cheap compared to other sites with this swim piece.
3.0,"Beautiful earrings, but came with coating chipping off. Returning for a new pair that'll hopefully be better quality. They are marked .925 and appeared to be good quality otherwise, so I'm hoping this was a fluke."
3.0,"The socks are awesome BUT the wrong size was sent!! I ordered 2t-4t.... It says 2t-4t on the white sticker, but the original packaging says 12-24month, so the socks barely fit my 20 month old... Would definitely recommend the socks, but Amazon needs to correct, watch for this error, as I see someone else left a similar review...... The socks get a 5 star"
3.0,"This watch is very accurate, attractive looking but much too complicated to set. You really need a manual to set it."
3.0,I use them when cycling and gardening.
3.0,it was ok but the strap didn't hold up to the face of the watch so my son only wore it a few times
3.0,"Pretty, but not true to size at all"
3.0,A little snug...I am a big girl.  Going to give them to my daughter.  So not a complete loss.
3.0,"Packaging: Necklace comes in small plastic pouch.<br /><br />Usability: Like the clasps on most Regetta products (at least almost all of the ones that I have reviewed so far), this one has some issues with the clasp.  The lobster clasp sticks a little bit when you are trying to open it. I had to attempt it several times.<br /><br />Quality: The velvet choker is about 1/2 an inch high and about 12 inches long (measuring the velvet only not including the clasp and chain). The metal charm is securely attached.<br /><br />Effectiveness: Other than the issue with the lobster clasp sticking a bit when you are trying to use it, this is a nice choker necklace. It fit me very well and I like the look of the thinner choker versus a wider banded one.<br /><br />- Some issues with the clasp sticking/hard to use<br />- High price, quality not there to support it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. I'm not paid by the company or affiliated in any way. Any thoughts on this product are my own."
3.0,"I'm in between liking and not liking this t-shirt dress. It's way too short to wear this as a dress, however it looks good with leggings. The size fits as expected, I just wish it wasn't that in between length. I also like that it's not see through for a mostly white shirt."
3.0,"This dress doesnt actually wrap, it just appears to wrap and it has a waist sash. I was disappointed. Bc it's not s true wrap, it didnt fit my chest right and was essentially too shallow in the chest area, so it keeps slipping up over my boobs. I will keep the dress bc overall its nice looking, but not what I expected. It also has poorly fitting seams that dont line up well and make parts of the dress look off balance. Overall its comfy, and a nice blue color."
3.0,Wanted to use these as undershirts for a little extra warmth. Other reviewers said they run small and they sure do. I bought size XXL for that reason and still tight but very long. They also tend to roll up.<br />The quality is nice but sizing is off.
3.0,First off I love the size and material of the wallet. It's perfect to throw in a smaller purse and it also has the card separator which I need. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the color. I really wanted the light green pictured above and I recieved orange and a dark green.
3.0,I like the concept. Problem is the thin tiny bit of leather that holds the two parts together. Mine has worn about half way through.  I ordered a pocket watch.
3.0,Thin and shorter than expected.
3.0,"Not made for folks with hips. I really wanted it to work because I love a good skort, but no luck."
3.0,"I ordered this in a small (regular a women’s size xs) in the khaki color. The sizing seemed fine. It’s oversized, but not too oversized. The coloring of this hoodie was definitely off. Looks more nude/khaki in the image; however in real life it has more a green/grey/khaki look to it. I won’t return it, because I don’t want to be bothered with the hassle."
3.0,Eh! Wrinkles. Workout clothes should not wrinkle. Annoyed.
3.0,If you have an average or slim foot you will need an insert for the ball of your foot. Straps are long but functional. Haven't worn them for a work day yet. Hopefully they will work and for the price.... I am positive they will.
3.0,"I got this to add to my best friend's Christmas gift. She loves Egyptian things and wears sandals a lot, what a great combo. Right."
3.0,This product is cheap a little short and the tassels are very small. I'm 5'2&#34; and usually an xs in clothes
3.0,"I have purchased three of these. The first was a plain grey. The second was a plain red. Both of those fit great and were kind of soft and stretchy. I love them and wear them almost every night. The third one was a printed one on sale. It was scratchy, not very stretchy, and too small. Had to return it."
3.0,"I ordered the smallest size but unfortunately it's still too big on me, but I do suggest it for others! But if you're flat chested and skinny like me (5'4, 90 pounds) this won't fit like you hoped sadly! Beautiful dress otherwise"
3.0,"These are cute, but I wouldn't recommend them for a serious workout - the elastic on the waist is small, and they slip down somewhat.  I like them for wearing when walking or around the house."
3.0,"It doesn’t look exactly like the picture, but similar. It’s not as sparkly and glittery looking, it’s more a dull gray. Also I couldn’t tell which was the front or back of the top."
3.0,"I didn't like the fabric,or the band on the bottom"
3.0,"The dress itself is cute but, I am hippie so it was tight and short for my taste"
3.0,Definitely a &#34;one size fits all&#34; ring that is very large. basically didn't fit well on any of my fingers except my thumb
3.0,"I wound up returning it because I really didn't like the print on me. However, I feel like the shirt was a good quality and worth the price."
3.0,It’s a good size. But it’s hard to read the words.
3.0,I dropped it one time and it broke.
3.0,I reallly like the style and the chiffon but if you have wide hips good luck putting it on. Also it's really see through. It does have a skirt underneath that's supposed to cover your gibbly bits but it does rise up make sure you wear shorts underneath or youll end up flashing everyone :O
3.0,La talla XL es un poco grande
3.0,The material was a little thin.
3.0,"Great for the price! But didn’t realize they’ll come as XL size since there wasn’t sizing info on the description of the item. In a way, it works because it doesn’t fit too tight like a Medium would but still a bit on the lose end. But I sure hope it was at least a Large rather than an XL since I’m 5’2.5”, 112lbs, 32C."
3.0,You get the last photo of the camo print. The model is wearing a similar pattern that I’ve seen at Vicidolls Boutique. I thought I was getting that but this is a bit more generic. The draw string is cheap and the crotch is way too long. The neck is awkward... larger opening but not enough to pull down one shoulder.  Returning them.
3.0,"This shirt is a lot different than I expected it to be, I am a size medium and 5'5&#34; and the shirt is shorter than I thought it would be and very very tight around the bottom and middle. I still like the shirt but it does not fit like the picture shows."
3.0,This set is very beautiful however whenever I received in the mail a stone fell out of the necklace.
3.0,The quality was great!  The sizing just runs a bit small.
3.0,"Wife hates them, but as a guy shopping I thought they were nice, so I bought them for her.  I still think they are nice, but she never has or will wear them."
3.0,There's no give in the material. It is definitely Asian sizing. Still a cute shirt if you can fit it.
3.0,"The quality is good, not great. One of the snaps busted after only a week, but fortunately, its still usable. My boys really like them."
3.0,I'm not sure what kind of face these were made for...but they don't fit me...or my wife...or any of the family members we have tried to give them to. I left them at the pool. I hope whomever finds them finds a lifetime fit.
3.0,"Didn’t fit right, maybe it was the material? Too clingy? It looked horrible on me"
3.0,Runs smaller than usual. Great product though
3.0,Ran small. Not full coverage at all.
3.0,Fits well.  The material is what I would call “kid’s velvet.” Not great quality but looks okay. I just wear it around the house. It’s a teal/emerald combo green.
3.0,"not sure about this yet, might be returning it<br />it is pretty & a great design idea but really doesn't work well. have to keep your hand like the girl in the pic always up for it to look nice and any movement just looks like a pile on your wrist & hand down it slips right off. yes it is adjustable but if you make it too tight you won't have much hand movement because it is also attached to your finger lol<br />IT also takes someone else to put it on you, this is not a slip on you have to undo the clasp otherwise you are putting it on wrong & it will be too small."
3.0,No way an adult would wear this. It's small..  . Good thing I got it for a child.
3.0,"The earrings that come matching this keychain are both severely bent because the item was shipped inside a plastic bag with no form of protection around the earrings. Luckily I'm gifting the keychain to someone who doesn't have pierced ears, but I was going to keep the earrings for myself. Can't really do that now. Perhaps we should pack out items safely, but I'm just a consumer so what would I know? Lol"
3.0,"I’m allergic to silicone so I needed another band for my FitBit-I loved the look of it and still do.  But the band is already starting to deteriorate and one of the screws on the side came out only after a week of use.  I was able to fix it but worried next time it does that, it may fall off without my noticing.  I suppose the quality is decent enough for the price."
3.0,"There's no keeping these straight while walking. They just hang from the toe strap, and the heel flops around. So don't walk much, walk slowly.... sit and look pretty..... I sent mine down the line to the second hand consignment store. Pretty pretty, though."
3.0,"It's beautiful but it broke.  It snagged on something and t the chain part, which connects to the bar of stones, broke off. I have to have it soddered back on."
3.0,"I wanted a light weight sneaker and I thought these sneakers from Feetmat would be what I was looking for. They claim that they offer support for running, calling them a athletic sports shoe. These are no such thing. They are akin to a slipper or even a water shoe, not any sneaker for stability and speed as they claim.  They are nice looking and I think if they would not have been the wrong size I would have liked them for light walking. Certainly not running or long walks, nor would I let my daughter wear these for sports.<br /><br />Figuring out the size was difficult but they warned to be careful and measure your feet. I did that and my foot measured 10” from toe to heel. I ordered the size 9, like the chart told me to. The shoe that arrived, size 9, was 11 ½ ” from heel to toe. Believe me, that made a big difference. The shoe slipped on well but the non support on the top showed my toes wiggling around a few inches from the toe of the shoe when I took a step. Looking at the description again I see they have another size chart with different measurements lower down on the page.<br /><br />I did not see any arch support. They looked and felt very flat. The elastic tie was nearly impossible to tighten, I felt the elastic would break, and yes I was pressing the difficult to press release. I was able to loosen them, again it was difficult, but trying to tighten was near impossible. I could not see how the releases would come off so you could tie them, like they say you can, as you would a regular shoe.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this sample product at a free or discount rate in exchange for an honest appraisal of the item. I was asked to review it truthfully, no matter what star rating I gave. I hope that my review has helped in your decision to purchase this item or not. If you have any questions about this product, or any product I have reviewed, please do not hesitate to ask me."
3.0,"These felt loose in odd places, like in the knees."
3.0,Works well not as thick as I would like but will be good for spring hunting.  I wouldn't suggest really cold unless you have another hat under it.
3.0,"For the price and fit, its a great dress. The quality is that of a cheaper polyester (is that right? fake silk?) material. I wore it to school on Gingerbread day and nearly froze to death. It's thin and provides no warmth. If it's a Christmas dress, be prepared to seriously layer up, or hopefully you live in a warm climate.<br /><br />However, the other patterns would be fantastic for a spring, summer, or early autumn dress!"
3.0,The fit is a little small and skirt isn't as flared.
3.0,Pockets are awkwardly high. The one thing I really hated about it.
3.0,There was so much excess material in the back that it looked like I had wings. Really odd design.
3.0,rolls up and very short.
3.0,"High-quality materials, quality construction, but a bit over-priced in my opinion. I think $20-$25 would make a little more sense."
3.0,"Cool look, but flimsy, and doesn't stay shut well."
3.0,It broke really easily. It only last a few monthes
3.0,"Beautiful suit, but the size runs very small."
3.0,"The tag inside says &#34;split leather.&#34;  Feels plastic-y.  Mine came without a watch.  The gold tone was already scratched off the hardware in places. The top zipper hung out on both ends, although I tucked them in with a little work.  Overall I'm not surprised for the price, but still disappointed."
3.0,Runs small. Hate the material
3.0,"I'm a 5'7'' and 121lb, and S turns out a little loose to me. The material is somewhat stretchy but not really soft, which sometimes makes my arms feel itchy."
3.0,Quality of fabric is not so great. Some fabric started coming off on edges.
3.0,They are pretty but not  what I was hoping for.  The teardrop is flat and not rounded as expected or as it appeared.
3.0,"Product looks good, but the pins have fallen out of both belts that I purchased. Lasted only a couple months of use."
3.0,The item fit well... but print isn’t as flattering- felt like wearing a table cloth
3.0,The sizing chart is way off. The dress is cute but sizes are wrong. Had to return mine.
3.0,They arrived in a little plastic container. I had read reviews of the dinosaurs horn not being on and was worried so when I seen the container I was hopeful... But my Hope's were let down one of the horns are off (I'll just crazy glue it an see if that works) otherwise they are really cute an very light weight.
3.0,Runs very small.  The thumb whole are really small.  The material is nice so I kept it and gave it to my daughter.
3.0,"On the positive side I liked the colors and print even better in person.  However, the arm area has a huge hole that goes below where bra wraps around.  I had planned on wearing a strapless bra, but it shows under my arm.  I almost returned it, but decided to wear it with a cardigan and boots .  The cardigan will cover up the large arm holes.  You probably could tighten up the tie around the neck to not show such a large hole under arm, but when I did that the dress became so short as to not cover my bum.  This could have been a really cute dress, but I'll make it work."
3.0,It was very “scratchy “
3.0,It was OK. I have it as a gift and had to repackage as it came just in cellophane. Seemed cheap.  But my young teen friend loved it!
3.0,"I love the straps but the clips are cheap knockoffs. I have a worn out pair of real Perry suspenders and plan on switching the clips to the new straps. Shame on me for not reading the reviews and questions prior to buying them. Still, assuming that the straps will last they will be much better with the real clips."
3.0,"The dress is very nice. The print is beautiful. I love how soft the material is. I like the material and quality, I expected a thin cheap but it's great. The only thing is that it runs really big. I am 5'3 it was just below my knee. I wouldn't be able to get it trimmed because it will cut half of print. the sleeves were all very long. If you are tall this will look great."
3.0,bought for the charms.
3.0,"Bought this for my wife and ended up returning it.  Looks well enough made, but it was very tiny.  Too tiny."
3.0,rather large for a toddler
3.0,"Does run small, the fabric is thin but hangs nicely. Mine arrived with a seam that was not caught so it had a hole at the base of pocket area. I paid someone to repair it for me at an additional cost. I'm happy now."
3.0,I think this product is good for small chest. I bought 38c and it was too small on sides and front.  I wanted to like the product soft material and a nice push.
3.0,Watch is good but the price is too much.
3.0,I use these to make earings<br />I bought the gold AND silver ones and they are 2 completely different sizes...
3.0,"I had tried on an XL a friend of mine bought and it looked awesome, so I went to buy my own. This has happened to me before, I got a returned dress that had been washed. The fabric (I'm 99% sure) is rayon, and when washed it will shrink a size, sometimes more. If you stretch it out after you wash it, it's not a big deal, or even get it dry cleaned, but I didn't want to do all that work, I was planning on getting mine dry cleaned from the start. So annoying. But if you end up getting a new one, it is cute! But I'm not going to chance it again. I was planning on wearing this to my brothers casual summer, outside rehearsal dinner. Good thing I bought a few contingency dresses!"
3.0,"The fabric is nice and soft, the length is perfect (I'm 5'3&#34; and ordered a large based on the listed measurements), but the bust area on the sides is all baggy. I'll need to sew in some darts to make it wearable in public. For now I'll just use it as a nightgown."
3.0,"I got this Aphrodite Women's Bikini Set in Pink today. It says One Size but on the packaging it said size Medium and then the tag on the bikini itself says size 0/small. I'm 5'7 and about 130 lbs, I wear a size 3-5 jeans and size 34-C or B on top, this bikini fit me just barely. Anyone any bigger and it would probably be very small on them. The material is nice, it is very silky and smooth but incredibly thin. You can pretty much see everything that is underneath it. Otherwise the color is very pretty, nice and bright and shiny. It is very cute but has absolutely no padding in the top at all which i kind of like at least a little type of padding for the top just to hold things all together better. This bikini will be alright for me for tanning in my fenced in front yard but i probably would not wear this to the beach with it being so revealing. Maybe with some added padding for the top i would wear it out but not just the way it is. The one thing i do really love is the scrunch butt on the bottoms, it make your butt look really cute and the ties on the side are also very cute! Would recommend this product to someone looking for this type of swimsuit, that is thin and pretty but not so much functional for beach wear. Quality not worth $29.99, at most i would maybe pay around $10-$15 for a suit like this.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review! Hope it helps out others!!"
3.0,"The top is cute and fits fine, but the bottoms have such an odd fit. They are super low riding and don't stay on no matter how tight they are, so I had to pair the top with a different bottom. Also, be careful washing the top or the jewels will fall out"
3.0,"Unfortunately I am not 6ft 8in tall, otherwise I think the pants would work, but the crotch on the pants is sowed too low so there is limited mobility. Otherwise the jacket is nice, this is definitely summer wear and is not very thick, could be used as a shell in the summer."
3.0,"I tried these and several other brands based on the Wirecutter review. This was not my favorite. Although the socks were reasonably comfortable and effective, the argyle pattern remained printed on my legs for hours after wearing - not attractive!"
3.0,"Is not form fitting or slim fit.  Not very soft or comfortable.  Shame.  Not again from this company  Bought a large.  Often wear a medium in some shirts, or a large.  But I was swimming in this one."
3.0,"Earrings are very large - too comfortable to wear.  Definitely cute, though.  I wish they were smaller."
3.0,I did not like the color it looks cheap
3.0,"not sure, possibly will return it.  I wish it ran smaller or in a smaller size"
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but the clasp comes done occasionally.
3.0,"Fabric is not thin but still shows very visible panty line if you’re not wearing seamless ones. Super soft and cute color. Mine fit funny in the waist and was too wide for me there but fit me great in the hop and butt area. Also it feels pretty durable and not cheep I would wear with a longer cardigan and white tennis shoes. There was a small black thread in the back of the dress, I wouldn’t of minded if it wasn’t sewn in. That’s pretty much the only reason I think this dress deserves a 3. If you have a 23 or around that waist size it probably won’t fit you’re waist well either"
3.0,Frame is a little heavy and chunky.
3.0,Just bought these for a two week vacation. They looked good and fit well and were comfortable and lasted for the whole vacation.
3.0,I thought with a longer corset it would have more support with it going down lower on the waist but it is so uncomfortable I couldn’t bare it for even five minutes wearing it. It would cut into my ribs on both sides of my body. It’s not that it was too tight it would just poke in making like a V into my ribs on the sides and then the cups provided no support and we’re actually a little big.
3.0,"This is a good looking shirt but it is too small, you cannot have even one ounce of fat on you to wear this shirt. I bought this for my husband who wears a medium in a regular cut shirt, so I ordered a large thinking because of the cut upping the size by one size going from a medium to a large should of been good. But I should of probably ordered a XL instead. I'm disappointed."
3.0,"It runs small.  I usually use size Medium and it didn't fit right a bit snug and as you can see, that's not the style of the dress.."
3.0,The shrit runs a size small. Otherwise it's a cute shirt. Note the silver under shirt only covers your breast area.
3.0,"although I love the styling of this watch and the fact that I never have to buy a battery the precision is off just a tad, I have found after wearing the watch for quite some time now that it gains time, about a min per day so at the end of five days the watch is five min fast. at the end of ten days it's ten min fast, so I am constantly resetting the time on the watch and that is not a good thing. I do like the watch but because the precision of the time piece is off I am only giving it three star's."
3.0,The stars and the hearts easily fall from the bracelets.
3.0,"The bracelet is cute and the box is very nice, but it broke within a few hours of wearing it. The chain is very weak :("
3.0,it looks beautiful but the hook is not that smooth to open and close.
3.0,Not waterproof but stylish
3.0,The size and style......dislike the cheap leather and the sewing stitches that were not even checked to look a little better.
3.0,"They are super cute but definitely run a little small. My daughter is 8 months and wears a size 3. Based on reviews, I purchased a Size 4 and her toes were right at the top. Sent them back and ordered the next size up which was a 5 1/2, so they are a little big/wide (both in the toe box and in the heel) Hopefully she will grow into them better, but until then we will try to use thicker socks."
3.0,"The head was so small and had no stretch, my son could barely get his head through."
3.0,"La verdad no es lo que esperaba, es muy grande no creo que le sirva a mi futura bebe, los colores se ven bien, no se quizás no me fije bien en el producto, pero no me encantó tampoco el material."
3.0,Beautiful boot. Super comfortable. I bought them specifically because of the lace clasp system. One of them broke the second time I wore them. Company claims they have no replacement available.
3.0,"II wished it was a little larger, but when you want to carry the bare necessities and look fashionable, this works. You can tell it's PU that's for sure."
3.0,The. Material is of low quality.
3.0,Only bought them to stick in my pocket and use while reading labels at the grocery store.  Glad I didn't think I could use them as readers. Very uncomfortable and fall off easily.
3.0,"I've been searching for a little added umph... so to say... To go along with a body shaper I recently purchased and came across this. I'm a little on the taller side coming in a 5'8 and weighing roughly 135-137 lbs. I'm slender but not thin. My build is 34-36 D/27/35 with a cute butt but absolutely no hips. I've wanted rounder hips and a more heart shaped bottom. This lifter does add hip size and just a pinch of a more rounded bottom. The material is thin but doesn't show thru jeans or leggings much. It did have some threads unraveling and after figuring out how the padding fit into the shaper I noticed the pads do move around a bit so you may want to grab a sewing needle and thread to make sure they stay in place.<br /><br />While not being super great fabric, it's not itchy at all and does the length goes to almost mid thigh. I didn't experience any riding up in the thigh but did notice it riding lower in the back than the front but not so much as to make it a deal breaker. It's for sure an easy quick fix to help you fill out jeans and some semi-tight dresses. I wouldn't wear this with a tight sheer-er dress though. Another thing I noticed was that while wearing it with leggings and walking the padding made a kind of weird point towards the front of my hips. Again..sewing needle and thread lol. I ordered an extra large and it's fitting but not tight. It didn't really lift my butt or hip area any but for the price of the product I can't complain too much.<br /><br />All in all the product is...OK. I would advise hand washing and I'm not too sure how long this will last with the unraveling threads and thin fabric quality. I do wish the fabric/product was a little bit better quality and provided butt/hip lift along with the padding. I probably wouldn't reorder. Or maybe I would if I ever needed a quick fix. It seems like it's absolutely made for thinner more slender builds.<br /><br />I purchased this product of my own money with no discounts/coupons."
3.0,Cute and fits well but the green is way lighter than shown.  Its more moss colored then Forrest green.
3.0,Beautiful necklace however poor quality. The necklace broke for no apparent reason only after two days of wearing it.
3.0,"WAY TOO SMALL ! must be cut in Asia, kind of chintzy and though i ordered a large it does not fit  well on my size nine junior body! looks Gucci but ruined by the word QUEEN on both arms. good for a cover up but in no way is it a dress!"
3.0,Looks are what your buying....
3.0,I got this for my other half and it was made in China sooooooo it is too small.
3.0,It's huge. It hung down pretty far from my nose. I was hoping for it to be a little more low profile but it almost goes to the top of my lip.
3.0,Too Small for xxl
3.0,"Just received mines today, arrived sooner then expected.Its nice, small and cute. Only thing is the coin pocket is too small :( wished it was a little bigger."
3.0,"I wish it were thicker, with more cotton-- a little bit more sturdy would be nice."
3.0,Rusted and turned black when soaked in solution
3.0,"Cute, ok quality.  sent the wrong name tho."
3.0,fast shipping good quality BUT the design was off center. Was a little disappointed about that part. The material is good & fit great once I removed the pads. Ordered a large & I wear a 34DD. Bottoms are about a xs
3.0,The off shoulder part is a little awkward. Weird material- almost paper like?
3.0,It's a nice skirt. But when you look a little bit more closely you see that it's cheaply made.
3.0,"I gave this a three-star rating, because it is comfortable and it is soft.  That being said, I have cheap little $5 fleece lap blankets that are thicker than this is.  I think it should be half the price, and then I'd feel like I got something for my money.  I was really excited about this too :("
3.0,I ordered large ( I wear medium gloves for the mostly )  and for the most part they fit well. they are tight around the finger openings. However they should loosen up with use over time.
3.0,This chain is very lightweight. It is not good with a thick gold chain. I doubt it would stand my grandson pulling on it either. I returned this item as it was not heavy enough for my necklaces. I wanted a loop link so I could vary the length required but the links are too small for my lobster claw clasp.
3.0,It shrank after 1 washing.
3.0,While it looks like the photo the material hangs weird and snags easily.  The material also stained really easily and would not come out.  It did serve it's purpose for a Halloween costume but we will not be able to use it again.
3.0,"I'm 6.5 months pregnant, 150 lbs currently, 5'5&#34;.  This does not go up to the top of my belly.  While it's OK for now, I imagine it will become uncomfortable soon, as it falls just above my navel."
3.0,"They are a little thin for my liking, and rather small. Won't return because my sister can fit them, but just be wary on the sizing."
3.0,"Let me say that the bottoms on this are DARLING!!!! BUT, the top does not fit as expected. I ordered a 10, and usually order that in bathing suits whether they say it runs small or large. I ordered this suit, because it has underwire cups and being large chested, I wanted to see how that would work, but the cups are way too small and the straps are not supportive unless you have breast implants that are perky on their own LOL. The design of the suit is adorable and like I mentioned, the bottoms of the suit are SUPER CUTE.... I almost kept the suit just for the bottoms."
3.0,"The product is black but the elastic band is white, wondered why it wasn't black??"
3.0,"I like 'em, they're comfortable, and fit as expected."
3.0,"I gave these 3 stars as an average score of the two socks. Sock 1 is a solid five-star sock; comfy material, good fit, and proper picture alignment. I'm being kind to Sock 2 to call it a one-star sock. It is weirdly small and misshapen and the picture is out of line."
3.0,"Really nice looking bracelet, but so far, I am unsure if it really gives any relief for arthritis in my thumb."
3.0,"These really are readers, and not computer readers.  The 2.5 in the lower part of the glasses are great, but the lenses on the top aren't great quality at all.  I have to wear them on the middle of my nose and look up like you had to do with half glasses.  The quality of the frames is good for what you get,and they are cute, but as far as Anti-Glare, it doesn't make a difference because as readers you wouldn't look at the screen normally from the bifocal area..  It would be for the keyboard or notes that you have on  your desk.  I'm thinking about sending them back."
3.0,Not as fitted as I expected I could have went one size down med from my usual large
3.0,"Good value, though this suit wasn't for me. It fits loose in the chest area, and snug at the hips. It drew way too much attention to my mid-section, and wasn't supportive enough on top for me."
3.0,"Just was not what I expected, but will maybe give to someone."
3.0,"Nice weight of fabric and perfect fit.  I ordered an xl and I'm 5'7"" and 175.  The sweater gets 5 stars. BUT the color is not white. 2 stars for it is actually off white. You have been warned😮"
3.0,"Fun shirt the ruffles at the top just didn’t lay down and fit me correctly it might be that i am a little to broad for the top. I returned the item, However it was very cute nice material and as pictured."
3.0,Material does not look like it will be able to take alot of washing... it fits well though..
3.0,Was different than what was pictured. It felt more boxy than long like the picture. The color was spot on though. The fabric felt okay but I had imagined it to feel more like a softer sweater than a slighter thick shirt.
3.0,"There is a glare on the inside that makes them bothersome to look through. Also, they made us dizzy because of the reflection/glare moving while turning head, standing up or during other motion."
3.0,Purchased for a gift that I need for this weekend. This is a beautiful scarf but has several flaws. I have left a message for seller- if they respond favorably I will change my neutral review.
3.0,"does not have a women's fit, but still cute."
3.0,"I like them, but there is a lot of glare."
3.0,"So, this is just kindof an okay but odd sweater. I don’t hate it, but definitely don’t love it.<br /><br />Color: I got the brown, which on the screen has a rich fall flavor to it. I know screen color isn’t always true to product so I expect some variation and the true color falls within those expectations, but it’s just a let down. The true color feels dull and leans more towards orange, just not a pleasing color to me.<br /><br />Size: I wear between a large and x-large, I almost always go up on Amazon to an XL. For how much they describe this as oversized, I actually find it to run small. I’m a 12/14 and the XL just barely meets comfortably  in the front. For a big sweater I would expect it to wrap and overlap in front.<br /><br />Arms: the arms are big. Not big enough to be bat wing style, but big and droopy. The wrist openings are Huge. Like four of my wrists could fit. So if you like to push up your sleeves, no way.<br /><br />Belt: so we’ve come to my biggest dislike about this sweater. There are no belt loops. At all. Which maybe works in your favor if you like to adjust your belt height, if you have a longer or shorter torso. But it means that you have to keep it belted, when you untie the belt comes completely off. I tend to tie/untie during the day for temperature and comfort, so this kinda kills the sweater for me.<br /><br />Pros: the material is reasonably soft and comfortable, I like the cable knit pattern and find that the pattern is true to the description. It’s warm, and has a v cut along the back of your neck which allows the sweater to drape close along the sides of your neck and then straight down the front which is a different cut/style than your typical round neck sweater. Has nice big pockets which are always appreciated!<br /><br />Summary: I got this for super cheap as a flash sale during the holidays, and it’s a warm comfortable sweater that I can get some use out of so I’ll probably keep it. But the color, size, arm shape and belt are all a let down so I would pass on this item, especially at full price. I would not have bought it (even at the reduced price) if I had seen it first."
3.0,Hand wash
3.0,I wanted to love them but they just looked sloppy on my figure. Guess I'm not built for them. Also they're very polyester feeling which lends itself nicely to a far colder climate.
3.0,Nice shoes but too big
3.0,Very cute but kinda small
3.0,Like color but mask has a bird beak appearance.
3.0,"Fits nicely for the little , bit this is not the design in the primary picture - the print location of the design fails to match what is showed in the picture which greatly disappointed my sons expectations"
3.0,"They serve their purpose but take a good deal of time to put in and get placement right. I was trying to avoid taking out my sewing machine.  But if you don't have a machine, they work."
3.0,Product looked nice but I ordered an adult XL and it looks and fits more like a child's XL or adult M.
3.0,"Use care when handling, the arms come off easily.  Trying to put them on is an easy feat, but the arms become easier to come apart.  When you get them in bulk a small few of the glasses may not work."
3.0,It wasnt what expect it to be.
3.0,"This dress is definitely oversized. The measurements did not lie! Very big on its own and no shape. Looked better once I added a jacket, but not sure I will keep this one. Its also shorter then i would want it. Im 5'5"" and normally wear a 14/16."
3.0,"seem ok, just do not like the loop for the end of the band, it is not fixed in place and I constantly have to move back in place over the end of the band, sort of a pain."
3.0,"Good hiking sneaker, but it seemed to run a bit small.  My kid grew out of it before his other sneakers of the same size."
3.0,"Loved the placement and picture! Loved the fact that it was shirt sleeved and could be layered.  Didn't like the fact that it fit like a Spanx. I had a long sleeve top under it size XL Isacc Mizrahi , which doesn't fit tight at all. I had ordered the tee shirt in XXL so that it would be loose and comfortable. Fit like a large, makes me sad but I will keep it."
3.0,Beautiful chain!  Unfortunately the little clasp was destroyed when I simply closed it!  The circle clasp is never a good idea!
3.0,I ordered a size larger (large) as I am 9 months pregnant and reviews say it runs small. I'm 5'4 169 pounds and it hit my knees. It is see thru as I ordered pink. Order a dark color if you don't want to have to wear a slip underneath.
3.0,Looks as if the product was salvaged rather than store quality
3.0,Not as pretty as the picture but I like it.
3.0,The jacket is water resistant.
3.0,"First of all, let me just reiterate, this is literally 1/10 of the price of the official Apple Ocean Band.  But it is also an inferior product.  Whether it's 1/10th as good is likely in the eye of the beholder.  I have an official Ocean Band that came with my Ultra, and I definitely prefer it.  But here are my views of how this Sontms version compares.<br /><br />1. Band material: it has a similar feel to Apple's.  That is, it's stretchy and comfortable and feels soft against the wrist.<br /><br />2. Attachment to watch: it's definitely not as perfectly fitted to the watch as the Apple version, which is easy to slip on and off the watch and has a precision feel when attaching to the lugs.  I noticed that I really had to try to line it up carefully and the edges of the apple watch shaved away at a bit of the plastic band material.  Also, the watch was catching on a little piece of metal on the band's attachment point.<br /><br />3. Precision fit on the watch lugs: this unit definitely falls down on this.  It doesn't look as perfectly aligned with the shape of the Apple Watch lugs and has some flat surfaces where it should curve to meet the lugs.  Now you would have to look closely to see this, but that sort of precision is certainly what you are paying for in the Apple version.<br /><br />4. The band hardware: This is probably the worst part of the band.  The Ultra is a raw titanium and the Apple Ocean Band's hardware matches with the same material.  This Sontms version uses a shinier steel look that isn't really a proper match.  The hardware itself also has a less refined feel.  Most importantly, the Apple version has a retention loop that you can position on the band where needed to then slip the end of the band through to not have it flop around.  The retention clip on this cheap version is already seated in a hole close to the clasp itself, and so if you have a smaller wrist, the end of the strap is going extend well beyond the retention clip and flop around and look less refined and probably be annoying.  This, to me, is the fatal flaw of this strap.  Unless you have a large wrist, you are likely to have that end dangling around.<br /><br />For me, it's that last issue that's a deal killer.  If you don't care about that (or the finish of the hardware) and you don't intend to change straps frequently, you may find it's a pretty good deal for you at ~$10 (currently).  I ended up a 3 stars because it is hard to overlook what you get for your money (relative to the official Apple solution)."
3.0,"I love the belt buckle, although it seems very cheap or plastic like. However the belt is pretty cool and it came with a belt hole puncher that was cool!"
3.0,"Arms too tight. I guess I saw incorrectly that the top part was not black lace. I was expecting a black and purple dress. It is very Barney purple, but if you are going for that look it's ok. Skirt was nice material- am somewhat slender but with the skirt structure, no matter what angle it looked like I had a baby bump! Slim waist, large chest do not mix with this dress. Overall well made but was not my cup of tea. May return."
3.0,Super cute style.  Sadly material is very clingy and unforgiving.  Additionally it runs small!  Size chart said I should order M - L.  I ordered L hoping it would be a bit loose and it was too tight! Sadly I returned it.
3.0,As soon as I opened the package and pulled out the earrings the beads started falling off. I know they didn’t cost a lot but.  Returned
3.0,Gave it as a gift to my daughter and the xlarge was smaller than expected.
3.0,Looks much more sparkly and cool in the picture
3.0,"A bit larger than I would have liked, and the color is a tiny bit different. But- quality product. I hope they last."
3.0,"This is definitely cut for an hourglass figure, which I don't have.  I have small hips & it curves out on the sides & looks strange.  However, it was very good quality & style for the price, so I'm still giving it 3 stars@"
3.0,"The material and design were nice, but the pants didn't fit me right. The hip and legs fit and length was great, but the high waist was too big around so the pants sagged and constantly needed pulling up. For reference I ordered a small, and am 5'8 120lbs."
3.0,"Good fleece, but size too small"
3.0,The length at the knee was just a lil bit longer than I thought but the chest area was too big. My daughter is tall and thin but big chested and it was still too big up top.
3.0,I liked this dress so much I ordered a second one. My first one was black and the second one is maroon. The maroon one arrived with one of the pockets sewn upside down. They refunded my money. I still like the dress.
3.0,"I have a problem with this order ...<br />Amazon sent wrong item and they replace the right one later. But, this skirt look a little weird when my girlfriend tried it on so i decided to request a return."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this product because I am obsessed with this PJ style. I have other ones but in different colors and really wanted a black and white one. The quality is great, the PJ itself is gorgeous! But unfortunately, it runs really small, so I am not going to be able to wear it. I ordered a Large but it fits more like a Medium, it's very thigh on me and all of my other PJs and clothes are Large, so I know for sure that's my size. As an advice: since this is a PJ and the whole point of a PJ is to be comfortable, I would go up one or two sizes. The color and material is great though - no complaints on that; it looks exactly like the picture."
3.0,They fit ok. I just dont like when you put them on. The design on the socks stretch and becomes distorted. I didn't think of that before I purchased them.
3.0,"To be fair this may be a wonderful product. O<br />My better half spends lunch in his car. It gets so cold! And Mr. Save money won't let it run to keep him warm. I got him these to help. He always says the worst part is his toes. They worked when we tried them. But ever since he has ""forgotten"" to out them on so who knows."
3.0,"This ought to be a big hit with many guys.  the fellow I gave it to could't figure it out for the longest time, and neither could 3-4 of us at time of gift opening -- finally he did.  it's not just clever, but a good tie also.  I hope it catches on."
3.0,"My watch broke within 5days of wearing it. I didn’t have anything bad to say about it, other than it broke within 5days of wearing it."
3.0,I do not feel any great change. Feet began to hurt again after a few weeks of install.
3.0,The waist is very itchy because of the rough tule
3.0,Of course these bands aren't as good as OEM bands. Luckily I have several to choose from because a few have broken.
3.0,The color is nice but it is lighter than the photo. Also the sleeves are an inch or 2 short on me. It also does not feel as thick as the short sleeved version I purchased.
3.0,"The quality of the socks are thin, but that isnt my major issue. The left sock is the exact same as the right, so the graphic is facing on the inside of the left foot, rather then facing outward."
3.0,My daughter has had these bracelets for about 1½ months and they are already starting to fall apart.
3.0,"I have a couple different colored Condor Kryptek caps.  This was the only company I could find that sold a blue mesh Kryptek cap.  Long story, short, unless you want blue mesh, the Condor caps are better made and cost less.  This cap arrived in a 'flat' bubble envelope.  I'll attached some photos if possible.  Obviously, the cap was flattened when I opened the envelope.  Really an inappropriate way to ship a cap.  I also discovered the rear Velcro adjustment straps had been inadvertently sewn together at one corner.  A discernible lack of quality control and bad shipping procedures.  I'll try to 'unflatten' the cap, snip the errant sewing, and see if its workable as I really wanted this blue.  The actual cap seems to be decent, but not better than the Condor versions (which are not exactly awesome).  May or may not return this cap."
3.0,"I normally wear a size Small in underwear so I ordered the Small.  Unfortunately the ones I ordered are just a little too snug and so I have only worn them once. They are basic cotton but not that comfortable because the cotton doesn't have a lot of stretch.  Overall, these underwear are just OK, and a bit on the small side."
3.0,"This watch is too big for my wrist, and really can not be adjusted to fit.  I kept it anyway."
3.0,"These are about the size I expected. They are a little tight on me, a medium sized woman, and you can see the outline of my nose and lips. But I actually purchased them for my 5 year old son.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in the color. Three of them match the picture online but the fourth one is hot pink instead of the color shown in the picture. My son is not a fan of hot pink and asked me to send them back."
3.0,"The fit is fine and I like the colors, but it’s not a very soft flannel. It’s ok, but I was hoping for it to be much softer."
3.0,The product was poorly sewn together. I did have to order up a size so it fit as expected but the hems were off which made it not functional. I ended up returning it the day I got it. I am giving this 3 stars because of how it is was to return. The product is a 1 star.
3.0,"It's not actually orange, it's more gold with an orange sheen.  Being the wrong color for this purchase was a big deal since the reason for the purchase was color... to match school colors."
3.0,Light and easy to carry.  Wish it would have more pockets...
3.0,I was hoping to wear this to work with a undershirt but it way to cropped for me. I’ll definitely wear it on my days off when I go out or something though !
3.0,"So cute, but the straps are a pain"
3.0,"A little small, quality is OK (not good but not bad)<br />The shorts and top are a little different. Wish you could get top and bottoms ins different sizes"
3.0,"Pay attention to the dimensions. This scarf is really small. Too small to tie around my neck or stay in place when just hung over shoulders. Design is pretty,  but hard to see when worn as an ascot."
3.0,I should have gotten a bigger size. The best thing is to order stretch pants that strectch. lol Otherwise they are jeans pants whatever. I heard a rip as I pulled them up put them away as I am loosing weight like crazy.
3.0,The fit was as expected. I didn't like that the material was so thin you could clearly make out the wrap layer beneath at the busy or would need to wrap beneath the bust to avoid that and then show more cleavage.
3.0,I love this suit but here are the issues. My bra size is a 34dd and the top tightened all the way was to a touch to big when swimming the fabric stretch to the point it hung over my butt. Not attractive. I sewed it up  the shorts i an a size 9 and they fit a bit snug but when wet the expanded a little. Oh and no form of padding. I have nipplerings that popped right out. Had to put a stocking on the inside. Its a diy suit. But it is super cute!!
3.0,"These Wood bracelets Unisex Tibetan Buddhist Buddah Beads/Prayer Mala Amulets arrived a short while after ordering them; they were wrapped in a sealed plastic bag in a black drawstring pouch inside another plastic bag.  Upon opening the plastic bag, these bracelets are a twin set of dark brown/black beads with a small symbol that holds the bracelet as the centerpiece.  There was a burnt wood smell that was so overpowering I had to put them back into the plastic bag and go wash my hands it was so strong.  Here I am, about two hours later and I can still smell the acrid stench in my nostrils and my hands smell like I’ve been out working on a smoky BBQ all morning.  Sorry, it is not pleasant.<br /><br />I don’t practice Buddhism, so my review will only speak to the bracelets as decorative jewelry pieces since I am not aware of the religious significance of these items.<br /><br />Now, as far as the appearance of the bracelets go, these bracelets are quite the “hip” thing right now with all the hipsters here in California.  A desire to return to all things natural and earthy make these two pieces of jewelry a big hit on almost everyone’s list.  They are well made, very sturdy and the simple beads set off by the one decorative “charm” (for lack of a better word) are indeed very classic and down to earth.  I think they’re very rustic, in other words, and I think a lot of people will go ga-ga for them.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, absolutely cannot get past the smell.  I would like to at least give these bracelets an “I like it” because I do like the design and simplicity of them, but I honestly cannot like them because they stink way too much.  I will give them an “Okay” rating because they’re okay, and would be way better if I could stand to open up the plastic and wear them.  I just cannot, and I can’t imagine anyone else being able to wear these and not gag on the smell.  It’s as if the incense phase of the ‘70s is back, but someone burnt the whole house down in the process of burning the incense.<br /><br />Kind of too bad, really because they’re nice looking bracelets.  But for me, they’re a big thumbs down.<br /><br />Rigorous honesty is a personal policy of mine so as a buyer and a reviewer, it is important to me first as a buyer to choose products that I am interested in to help serve myself and my family in some positive way.

3.0,"what an awful job of cutting the bottom of the skirt!  the color is nice, the straps are a good width and length, but it is un-usable as a dress.  the bottom is asymmetrical which would be ok but the shortest part is in the center pointing up at the crotch -too short and looks tacky.  The edge of the cut on both sides is uneven.  I should have just bought the long version and cut it myself.  It was a cheap item, so I will buy again in the long length and do my own cutting since the hem is unfinished."
3.0,XXL is an XXL youth. It fits my medium women sized daughter pretty tight. Goes way up on legs.
3.0,"I wear XL, I ordered 2x. Had to give it to my teenager.  Very disappointed."
3.0,Back is kinda longer then the front just fits kinda funny but its lose fitting which I like
3.0,very cute! but it fits really small. the size I ordered was a medium and it felt like an extra small to me
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the fit with this hat, I had ordered it in Gray and the fit and slouch was perfect. This one fit smaller and not much of a slouch."
3.0,The glasses are really to small to go over other glasses IMO.
3.0,Very thin. Looks nice
3.0,Cute but made of cheap material
3.0,"My wife is not a fan of the sizing of this bra which is annoyingly large in cup size from what she expects (in her case 36C), and just too much material, so my star rating comes from her. As an outside observer, I'd say that the materials are very good, and you save money from the lack of fancy packaging. I would also say that the construction is very good, I've often had complaints with the apparent workmanship in well known undergarment manufacturers, and this is at least as good as any mid-range brand I've seen.<br /><br />So, design is mediocre and craftsmanship and fabric is good."
3.0,"When I received this, honesty in my opinion it looks great. I ordered a 20mm bracelet which I didn’t like the size as I thought I would. The look of it is great. Very heavy and shined. Yet when I tried to lock it in, the clasp didn’t function so well which is a downer."
3.0,"Much to large for most girls, much more appropriate for an adult, older teen or guy Brony."
3.0,Fits well but is another house frock ..it's not nearly as cute as shown and looks a bit frumpy
3.0,"I'm not sure who this would really fit. I'm 6'4"" and the length is what I was expecting but the sleeve length would have maybe fit someone half my height.  I would return this but the cost and time involved is not worth it, considering the low cost of this coat."
3.0,"Not the best quality. The material feels a little cheap. However, the colors are accurate."
3.0,"these would be useful for many, but the magnification strength just wasn't what I needed; I returned them"
3.0,Not  satisfied with the fit of this product.
3.0,Not true to size order up a size.. managed to still squeeze into it but very uncomfortable I used a different top
3.0,This dress is a little short for me. I’m 5’2” and it is an inch above my knee. That’s fine for younger women.
3.0,It's cute but I'm not happy with the fit. Many people said it ran small so I (usually wearing a medium) got a large. It's way too big on me and the puffy shoulders look a bit silly. Wish I would have ordered a smaller size!
3.0,"I have been wearing Lake Charles for years, and the pair I received has a different design of the sole - not matching what is on the picture - more like a gym shoe, and the leather is more stretchy, giving a feeling that the shoe is wider than W. The shoes lost the &#34;Oxford&#34; type of appearance, and to me this matters since I use them for work. These shoes used to be manufactured in the Dominican Republic but the pair I received was made in China. It seems that with the change of the manufacturer, Orthofeet changed the design, and failed to inform amazon customers about that modification. The picture on amazon site only shows the previous design. I cannot say anything about the arch support, since I wear custom made orthotics."
3.0,I really like this dress. It's a nice length and it's a nice vibrant material. My only issue is it runs small and because its stretchy it highlights all the worst parts of my stomach. I'm probably going to return it.
3.0,Pros: Material is soft and has good length.<br />Con: Material is thin and see thru. Perhaps other colors are thicker.
3.0,"The bracelet itself is nice. I like the turtle charms on every string, and they (more or less) do follow the pattern shown on the image. The turtles are a kind of tarnished bronze color, which I really like. I'm not a fan of super shiny jewelry, so I appreciate that this is fairly subdued.<br />My problem with this bracelet is that the charms are all twisted up, the strings themselves are twisted around, and I need to find an origami expert to untangle everything. The strings feel cheap, and like they are going to break with every wear. The clasp isn't exactly easy to fasten one handed, so I had to have my roommate help with putting it on.<br />Overall it's a cute bracelet, but on the cheap side. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time untangling everything when it first arrives.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,I finally found a Disney hat with a buckle back versus hook and loop.  I would have given a little higher star rating if there was more &#34;support&#34; in the actual cap.  Really thin material that does not allow for much support on its own.
3.0,"Honestly disappointed. Mine look nothing like the picture. Even if the color wasn’t exactly the same, I expected at least a little of the fire that every other moissanite I own has had, including the others from Gemstone King. These look like synthetic sapphires. Like decent quality lab created sapphires, but not what I was looking for. I almost wonder if I was sent the right pair."
3.0,"...but a little piece broke off when I tried to adjust it. It wasn't noticeable, really, I think it was just the little tip at the bottom, but I was a tad disappointed."
3.0,The gloves looked really nice & were warm but they are too small for an average man’s hand.
3.0,skirt can with lining not attached to orange ruffle. I have to get someone to attached the orange satin end to the orange ruffle. orange lining was just placed in bag.
3.0,"Great for a cheap band, gets dirty and stained quickly however"
3.0,"Nice Fabric, good under tunics.  However, they ride down when seated.  Constantly pulling up."
3.0,Thought these would be constructed similarly to some LianSan no-frame glasses that I've had for a few years. They weren't. They didn't fit. I returned them.
3.0,I really want to love this necklace. Great cause and looks really cute. The first issue is it is tiny. I am a really small person and I am on the very last clasp. I got the 13 inch so not sure if other sizes were available previously. But if you are a medium to large person I do not think it would fit. Also it is very itchy and pulls the hairs on the back of my neck. Even when my hair its up.  I gave it 3 stars for the size and being uncomfortable. I have had it about a week and no issues as far a how it is made. I like the simple look of it. Was looking for a necklace I could wear everyday. Unfortunately that will not work for this one.
3.0,Fashionable but not very durable
3.0,It's lightweight which is good for kids. But the quality feels cheap. So it's worth it if there is 70 or 80% off coupon.
3.0,Not a fan of the collar also hair slivers still get through
3.0,Cute keychain. Purchased for a friend.
3.0,"I bought this for school this year, and there is a major downside to this - the two straps that go around your arms are connected (as you can see in the product's picture). I know this is by design but it is incredibly inconvenient for day-to-day use ESPECIALLY if you have to constantly take it on and off, such as between classes. Unless you put your backpack on top-down, above your head, you will have a terrible time putting this thing on quickly."
3.0,It fits in my body but a little bit tight in the armpit. But the material is just right for the price. I love it.
3.0,Husband is 6 foot 6 and t-shirt is short
3.0,"The dress did not fit great but it is wearable.  The length was off.  It was XL as the previous dress, but did not fit as good."
3.0,I love how it doesn't get stuck or tangled to my hair...but it does tend to slide up and off my head which gets irritating and I end up not using it. :(
3.0,"This tie was cheap and you can tell. The material isn't great but you get what you paid for. How often are you really going to wear this skinny pink tie, it's worth it if you are going for a 1/2 time use."
3.0,"Fits on bottom  fine, but was so loose on top and gaped open so much a tank top was needed underneath.  Otherwise, nice dress and received several compliments."
3.0,These are made in China...misleading ad makes yo-yo think they are made in USA but make in China  is stamped all over them...I feel I was lied to.
3.0,Very comfortable soft fabric.  But a little thin for warmth and for obscuring what you are wearing under it.
3.0,Run small order two sizes up. I'm 199 5'3 ordered an XL and couldn't get them on. So I had to return them. But they are so cute!
3.0,"This looks like a cute minidress but it's NOT. it's a shirt and barely touched the top of my butt. I thought it would be longer to make my waist look good but it just made me look fat. Its kinda cute a black zipper in the front. It fit, however if you have large boobs I would suggest otherwise if my bust wasn't so small I don't think it would have fit right. Disappointed but I guess I'll still wear it."
3.0,Arrived today and was very nice but Best wishes were on the box and it's for Mothers day 😥 I would have gave 5 stars but that is terrible that you can't have the option of making it out for the occasion you need it for.
3.0,"Cute dress and fits as expected (5'7 170lb and ordered a large), but came with 2 small holes in the neckline. Fabric is thin with some fraying and didn't feel like it would hold up to much wear or laundering, especially with holes already started. Wanted to love it but returned."
3.0,Nose piece fell off this month...held up for some time
3.0,Beautiful color and nice fabric...
3.0,"It's a floppy hat without stiffener above the brim like something i would usually keep in a golf bag, but it fits surprisingly well and looks great."
3.0,i did not received in the same package with the sterling silver adjustable spoocrgin
3.0,"They are cute.  They sent me a size too big.  But they are only used for slipping into when I need to take the dog outside, so they will do."
3.0,Well for what what it is worth it works. However the color I ordered is not what I want to get.
3.0,seems to make my upper back pain worse.
3.0,Cute! Friend liked it as a gift.
3.0,"Although these are made of a cheap plastic, they're still a good addition to a War Machine costume. Just put on some black gloves underneath them. The plastic is of the same type as the cheap kid's masks, but they still work."
3.0,"It fits snug and the chains are much closer to being the sane length, so they don't sit as nicely as it shows in the photo."
3.0,"I ordered one for me and one for my sister. My sister’s didn’t come with the necklace OR socks, and mine was all dirty and covered in loose strings."
3.0,"Its for the price.  I have to wear a belt daily and can see its not made for daily use, but then again it was under  $15.  So ok for the price but I don't expect it to last."
3.0,"Nice watch, worked for a few days and stops"
3.0,The boots fit but they are not comfortable you can’t walk very long but they’re really cute
3.0,it came apart
3.0,They fit my wife pretty good...material is very thin.
3.0,Good buy i like it it cute
3.0,"This color is more of a sage, light sea foam green. Not mint green at all.  Color is dull.  Nice quality tie just wrong color"
3.0,"The right foot bed has a lip or ridge on the inside where the arch of my foot sits, it is only on the right foot so I am assuming it is a flaw. It is very uncomfortable and leaves a long red indent on my foot and that was while wearing them for like 5 min to try them and adjust the straps. It sucks because the left foot is not like this. I also ordered true size and they are a size to big. UGGGGGG they need to go back but I just don't feel like it is worth the hassle 😪"
3.0,"The width of the garment was about what I was hoping for. But the sleeves and the top itself are REALLY short. I'm 5'8&#34; so I expected some trouble here, but it's bad enough on this one that I've never even worn it out of the house because I don't know what season it's suited for."
3.0,Didn’t fit to good
3.0,"very unflattering. The skirt comes up too high, creating a grandma type of look. I'm 5'5 and 130 lbs., very athletic build,  ordered a small, and my daughter said, take that off mommy, you look like a grandma.."
3.0,"Comfy. Soft material. Kind os boxy, not feminine. Like scrub work pants. I have a short torso so they pull up over my belly button. Not my favorite because I don't like waist bands on my stomach."
3.0,"These are really cute and the quality is good, but they run small. Ordered the 10-12 for my daughter who wears a size 10 and they were too tight and too short."
3.0,Tighter than expected. It's going to sit in the closer until I lose a few pounds. Very pretty
3.0,They help with night driving. I think the packaging is very nice but the glasses feel and look cheap. I got the gold which look funny. Very cheaply made not worth 30 dollars.
3.0,"I LOVE the beads,  too bad the elastic does not last long. I have had two break within a month of getting them."
3.0,The shirt is nice but it didn't fit. It was definitely smaller than expected. Get a size up if buying
3.0,"Too long, didn’t like how the bottom was designed."
3.0,Cute but and fit ok but started to fall apart in less than 24 hours. Lost a whole ear.
3.0,falls apart at seems. my son has gone through 3 in 3 months.<br />delivery was fast
3.0,The size chart says medium is 5/6. We received the coat M for 10/12. So it is too big for our 5yo. Returning<br /><br />Overall the coat is nice and we would keep if correct size
3.0,For it being mens clothing it's styled like girls clothes. Material is nice. Quality is nice but it's snug I normally wear a large and a xxl is snug.
3.0,Corren muy grande
3.0,"The lock works great, simple to use and does the job.  I purchased two locks last year, when they arrived, one lock was missing the ""T"" section.  Amazon replaced it.  I lost one lock a month ago, purchased two more so one is a spare.  Came in and one package is missing the ""T"" section again."
3.0,"Beautiful shirt just a bit tight around the arms, but I can still wear it.  Great price!"
3.0,"I purchased these sports bras with high hopes having read the stunning reviews. Though they are extremely comfortable, the inserts simply do not hold up to being washed. The lining covering them peels right off, they bunch up and can be a pain to put back into place once they've peeled and creased.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad option even with the inserts removed (I had to to throw them away), but a little disappointing."
3.0,It would have been helpful is men/women’s shoe sizes were listed in the description
3.0,I bought a xl for my vacation trip. The top padding is terrible and I decided not to deal with. The shorts were alright and I did wear them over my swimsuit but the top and the cover up needs to be redone.
3.0,"I bought it for my Mom as a gift.  She loves the way it looks.  But, there is something wrong with the zipper it only closes about 1/3 of the way before it gets stuck.  I will exchanged it and update my review based on that."
3.0,Alittle large for my son. Probably more of caucasian fit than asian fit.
3.0,Nada ser pierde la piel
3.0,"So I got this necklace today. It did arrive a bit earlier than forecast. It is exactly the same as in the picture but up close it doesn't look as nice. It is cute, and it will work for what I bought it for. Be aware, the hands are plastic, not metal."
3.0,"It's exactly like the picture but too large. It's very warm because of the wool inside but I don't like the way it looks on me. I'm size 4 (small) and it might be different for other sizes but for me, I just use it when it's cold and I need to go pick up something very quick. The materials seem okay. Since I don't wear it that much, I did not have a chance to wash it. The swings on the jacket do not seem durable but the materials seem durable."
3.0,"Got them for my boyfriend, he thought they were great, definitely made him laugh, but these socks are TINY. He got a laugh but won’t be able to wear them!"
3.0,Good quality construction.I like the length.Not enough compression in this size.Should have ordered large.
3.0,"I actually really like the watch and its style; it just does not fit me.  It is a &#34;clamp&#34; style band, but this one is tiny and leaves indentations in my skin where it has &#34;clamped&#34;.  I still wear it, but only for occasions in which I can wear it for a very short time.  It is not comfortable for me to wear.  I am not overweight; it is just meant for a tiny wrist, which apparently I do not have..."
3.0,The product I received is not 100% cotton. It is 3% spandex. It also runs small and is made of a thin material. I bought an extra large for my husband.
3.0,I like these a lot unless I want to wear a panty liner.
3.0,Th watch concept is neat but the watch face itself is the size of my hand.
3.0,I ordered a size bigger..It is super small in the arms & shoulders??  I have to send it back!!
3.0,"Very good quality fabric, but the top of the top of A4 Gi is too narrow in the shoulders, too tight across chest and too tight at upper arms for an athletic 6'0"", 195 pound, male. Now the pants are a whole 'nother story... the waist is enormous maybe 46""-50"" (I am a 36""). I returned these and ordered a different brand and it was fine."
3.0,I am 5'5&#34; and 125lbs so I ordered a medium but was way too big. Great material and looked pretty but returned and kept a different dress.
3.0,It was nice but way to big
3.0,"The skirt is a little fuller than it looks in the photo, which is magnified by the skirt being lined so that it's not se through. Still this is a cute, comfortable dress that I'll wear a lot this summer.<br /><br />It was pretty wrinkled in the package, but I threw it in my dryer's ""refresh"" cycle and it came out fine. Because of the rayon content, make sure you take it out of the dryer right away so as not to get permanent wrinkles."
3.0,The color is great.  Size Runs a little small. The biggest issue I have with this product is that there is a really foul smell that I have tried to wash out and I’m struggling to get out.
3.0,Looks cool but has blood on the mask that is not shown in product photos. My kids are not allowed to have blood on costume at school so I had to return.
3.0,"It looks fine, I actually like the style of shirt as it's unique and doesn't look like anything else in my closet. Unfortunately I don't think I will wear this very often - it is just not comfortable at all. I washed it twice with fabric softener and it's still extremely stiff and awkward feeling. I don't know what material this is made from but it honestly feels more suited for like, an outdoor patio table cover, or a tent awning rather than a shirt. Imagine the fabric used for an outdoor patio umbrella - that's what this reminds me of. The manufacturers really need to redesign their product to use something softer and more appropriate for clothing."
3.0,Nice but very easily scratches and dulls
3.0,It is thinner and more like a flannel than a fleece. Super cute and but just not what I was expecting after other truly fleece Carter’s PJs. I didn’t return but wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,Nice necklace but a lot longer than expected
3.0,"I’ve had these for about a year. Only use them for driving. One lens has developed an issue that can not be cleaned up. Not sure what it is but I will try another brand. Peeling at the bottom of right lens, other lens is fine."
3.0,"We have 3 pairs of the same brand we purchased through a physical therapy company which are thicker, more comfortable and about 1 inch longer then this pair.  We will keep searching."
3.0,Returned; extremely large.
3.0,"These glasses are a strange fit.  They're too small for most adults (especially my husband), but definitely too big for kids.  They're cute, and the (cheap) quality you'd expect for the price.  But they didn't actually wrap over my husband's ears for his Halloween costume."
3.0,The headband is adorable and looks like the pictures but it is made for a child. It fits an adults head but looks way too small
3.0,"Wearing them without shoes it's great but in the shoe, they either ride down or bunch up. These socks can't make up their mind. I wear a size 7 in shoes.<br /><br />Also, one of the socks tore after one day of use."
3.0,"I got these via a special discount offer on Face Book... I will wear these training AND with spare pair of goggles sitting on the deck - but that's about it.  The back has a funky plastic clasp to &#34;connect&#34; each side... Triathlon swim starts tend be hand-to-hand combat & I'd be afraid that besides being kicked in the face, this clasp could get released/undone & goggles fall off.  As a female, I have a smaller face and the lens/eye section is rather large.  Only used once & they didn't leak or fog - but those issues typically develop over time & use."
3.0,"The material is great and t is cute but im sad the top and bottom aren't matching in size. Im a medium bottom and large chest. So I got a large to be comfortable. The top is more like a XL but the bottom elastic is a little tight, especially for a large.  It is very well made tho."
3.0,Wallet is very thick when credit cards and photo ID is inserted.
3.0,I NEED TO RETURN
3.0,"Absolutely loved my necklace, but one of my baby bears fell off after a month and a half."
3.0,I should have went up a size
3.0,Good product BUT to small for my feet.  Really liked for comfort but after two times wearing I can’t use because too difficult to remove.  My age of 72 perhaps too.  Sorry but wished they were bigger
3.0,"The two black shirts I ordered were the same size, however in the same order I bought a white/pink set. The white one was the longest of the four and the pink was the shortest. Size consistency would be nice. Other than that all four are made of nice material and seem to hold up to washing pretty well"
3.0,"It's nice enough, but I wouldn't describe it as a cocktail dress... Too casual.  Also very thin fabric, not substantial"
3.0,The color of my bag is rubbing off every where! The bag also has a funny smell! Disappointed.
3.0,"I have eight children. Eight. When people ask, “How do you do it?!” I reply, “I eat a lot of chocolate.” It’s true. Chocolate comes in so many delicious forms, each one designed to grant a few minutes of sanity-saving endorphin release, that it is my go-to coping mechanism. Unfortunately, both motherhood and nature’s stress reliever have blessed me with a few extra pounds around the middle and on my upper thighs. Enter the dreaded swimsuit season. The fashion industry has come up with two solutions to these problems; ruching to disguise slight fat rolls, and boy-cut bottoms to hide thigh girth. This swimsuit has both, and I was offered the opportunity to pick one up at a discount, in exchange for an honest review. I figured I have nothing to lose, so here we go, the pros: The swimsuit arrived neatly folded in a reusable plastic zippered bag. Save it, as it will come in handy for stashing a wet swimsuit into your gym bag or car. The seams are well-sewn and the fabric is sturdy and thick. It is comfortable and not binding. This swimsuit would be really flattering to my figure if it weren’t for the cons: First, it simply doesn’t fit me. I try to be realistic, so I ordered the size that I normally wear, as opposed to the size that I’d like to wear. It is too long in the waist. I am 5’8”, so I don’t have an especially short waist, but this swimsuit is way too long. I thought, okay, maybe it’s just a little extra ruching, and I pulled it up so that all of the extra fabric was at the waist. That’s when I really noticed the draft in my nether-regions. The fabric that is supposed to cover my girl parts is way too narrow (or the leg holes are way too wide) if pulled up, leaving me exposed on the sides of my crotch. I haven’t had a Brazilian, so imagine how attractive that must be, and it kind of negates the coverage on the upper thigh, anyway. Unfortunately, when I pulled it back down to once again cover my upper thighs, the fabric at the groin hung down about two inches. Finally, I am currently breastfeeding my youngest, so I have an ample bosom. I’m sporting D’s, yet I don’t even fill the (very nice quality sewn-in underwire) cups. I do wish that the built-in bra extended all the way around to the back for extra support for my “girls.” Tying them up using the straps at the neck just doesn’t win the battle against gravity. Perhaps all of these problems will be rectified if I exchange it for a smaller size. I'll give it a 3 star rating in the meantime. Disclaimer: Before making a purchase, I research a product thoroughly, and I depend on honest reviews to aid in my decision making. This product was received for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. While I have shaken my head at some of the 5-star reviews I have seen other professional reviewers give to lousy 1-star products, simply because they received them for free, I do my best to keep my reviews thorough and unbiased. I won’t give a good rating to anything that I wouldn’t be willing to shell out my own hard-earned cash for. Feel free to ask any questions that you may have.

3.0,"I’m 5’4” and this does not fully cover bottom half of body, stops just below hip bone."
3.0,"First of all I'm a huge fan of the HALO brand. Their product is excellent. I also like the Richardson 112 hats. I really wanted this to work.<br /><br />The rubber sweat band should be the default side IMO. This is what makes HALO so great. For this hat, you need to flip over the band which A) Reduces contact of the HALO material in general. B) Folding the material over is just not that comfortable. C) People with larger heads will be sized out of the hat.<br /><br />I already push the boundries when wearing Richardson 112 snapback hats. The need to fold the HALO material pushes me out."
3.0,"Kinda of big for my head, if I wear as sized it will come to my eyelids. Maybe if it wasn’t so squared either it’d be perfect."
3.0,Did not like the padding in the top. It should of been stitched down it moves. The pant came a bit too large wished it had a string in the waist.
3.0,This brand runs too small in bust for anyone over size 12.  XL fits like size 12.<br /><br />Material & prints & colors are pretty.
3.0,"well build. i was surprised to see all the extras it came with. Not sure if the copper is coated or what but would like it to patina, it has not so far.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This is not RFID Blocking. Still picks up the card. Dont know how with all the metal but it does."
3.0,"Overall it's a decent aftermarket CV boot replacement kit. However I had to subtract 2 start for this item because I did not receive all the items as shown in the picture. The picture shows the axle bolt as included in this kit but I received instead a threaded flange nut where the bolt would screw into. Not sure what the nut was for since I did not have it on my car and it isn't shown in the picture.<br /><br />Kit was used on an Audi A3 2007 (8p), 2.0t FWD"
3.0,Fit Big Ass Hell ! But A Nice Outfit
3.0,The color is great. The fit is great. But the dress arrived with several fraying hems. I can fix them; I'd just prefer not to have to.
3.0,"ok, but found just as good in grocery store for $2.99"
3.0,"Odd material for a mask, felt like satin inside. It did have a pocket for a filter, but my 10 yo son did not like it. It was supposed to be for a Bart Simpson Halloween costume and was delivered 2 weeks later than I was told so we missed Halloween. Even if we got it, I don’t think he would have worn it. Overall we didn’t like it and didn’t keep it."
3.0,"Super cute, but it is quite big. It almost falls off my wrist when I put my hand down....almost."
3.0,"Bonitos los colores, pero se siente frágil  la unión con el reloj"
3.0,the back of the crop top kinda sticks out i wish it were a little tighter also the material is not cotton so it can get hot.
3.0,"Purple color looked like the picture when it arrived, fit as expected, but it started to come unsewn the first time I wore it.  After 4 hours the bottom edge of the seam in the front had unraveled 4-5 inches, and I'd only driven to work and sat at my desk.  Disappointing to have a new project now, to find matching thread and to do a repair after only half a day of use."
3.0,Loved the style and the fit of the boot. They did feel very cheaply made and like they would fall apart within a year. I wanted something sturdy for the winters and these specific boots were not slip resistant like the other styles. Returned them
3.0,Love the gloves and the fit was fine but two of the finger tips were not knotted and started to come apart. For the price I expected better quality.
3.0,looks good on but the winkles dont seem o go out
3.0,"I ordered a 2XL, Shorts are about a med/large.  Very disappointed.  Adding to this review...Nice quality product.  Excellent seller also"
3.0,It looks kinda cheap but for the price it is good
3.0,"It's a little too long. I'm a short person, so it doesn't quite end in the spot I was hoping for, but it's certainly pretty."
3.0,"Not sure if my expectations were too high, but not super impressed with this.  The heart is much larger than I thought (shame on me for not looking at specs closer).  Looks good, but a little cheap looking up close."
3.0,"Love the dress, it’s so cute, comfortable and fits well!  The only downside is that there’s already a string hanging off the strap but it hasn’t unraveled just yet. Overall a great dress with a great price"
3.0,Like a belly shirt. Too loose. Could tie up if needed.
3.0,It’s very soft.  But there is a seam right down the middle which makes it a little unbecoming
3.0,It's longer than expected.
3.0,"The top fit great. I have no butt and these bottoms were cheek city - borderline thong. I was hoping for more butt coverage since the top is cut like a sports bra. Fun print, bottoms are cut far too revealing to wear in public. Honestly, cut so small that I don’t feel comfortable wearing them to a bachelorette party."
3.0,the quality did not look that nice to me but i will let my sister rate it she is the one wearing it after xmass
3.0,"These fit great over my prescription glasses.  The orange ones help with glare at night and the black ones help during the day. The only complaint I have is that the black ones interfere with my prescription to the point of being out of focus, so I have to be careful and not wear them when driving, etc."
3.0,"Nicely packaged and arrived quickly, but the earrings are way smaller than i expected. The stone itself is quite small and i have long hair, so you can barely see them."
3.0,This jumpsuit was okay. I guess I didn't read the material description clearly. It felt more like lingerie than others that I'd ordered. I gifted it to someone else who liked it well enough.
3.0,The watch is difficult to see in the dark. I work at a psych facility at night and the lighting on the dial is not sufficient to see in the dark.
3.0,"The fabric never relaxes due to the spandex, so wearing these briefs is like being gripped in an unrelenting fist"
3.0,"The color is a little off from the picture they have shown but I’m more disappointed that the style is not even close. I was expecting a longer backside and material. This is just a polyester, rayon, spandex mix. But it was cute on so I kept it."
3.0,Thought this was going to be a very long sweater... wasn't goes to my hips. oh well it's still cute.
3.0,"It was a beautiful color but the way the back is set up, you would need to have some double sided tape, add clear straps, or get it altered to fit your back just right. I had to return because of the way the back was for me. Overall beautiful dress."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this purse because it's so cute, but there are non-negotiable issues with it that make me drop its rating down to 3 stars. Here are the pros: the bag is the perfect size and the length of the straps is perfect for throwing over your shoulder and also being able to keep your bag under your arm. The color is a really nice warm tan that matches with everything--color, black, brown, etc. I also love the shape of the bag. In general, it looks really nice, which is why I bought it, but that's also the danger in buying online. The cons: when I first took this out of the packaging, it reeked of chemicals and had a fishy scent. It was so bad I actually had to leave it on my back porch for a week to air it out before I would use it. While the straps are the perfect length, the design of the bag itself is not user-friendly at all. The bag is stitched so narrow at the top where the straps on each side meet each other that you can barely get into the bag at all, and you definitely can't drop one strap and rifle around in it while it's still on your shoulder. I have to take the bag off just to put my wallet back in when I'm leaving the store. Another downside is this strange middle panel in the bag. It has a zipper on it, so I guess hypothetically you could put things in there, but it is so narrow that it really just serves as an awkward and cumbersome barrier between the two sides of the purse. It is also why it's nearly impossible to get anything out of or into the bag unless you take it off. Lastly, the &#34;cell phone&#34; pocket would hardly accommodate the size of a flip phone, let alone a smart phone, which most consumers own. The pocket is far too shallow and it's wider than it is tall, so it's really only good for chapstick. I've still used this bag because I like the way it looks, but it is really a pain in the butt. I should've invested my money and purchased something a little pricier for better quality. But as they say, you get what you pay for :-)"
3.0,"one time use only, batteries do not last long enough, some of the tips had broken straps, overall a fun toy"
3.0,Good material and nicely made but too small. Returned for two sizes bigger
3.0,Nice sweater but fits some what small and length is long.
3.0,Meh. It is passable but only just. Chains break easily. More of a bedroom toy than clothing. Does not seem like it will last long.
3.0,"The item was shipped in reasonable time, but was not quite what I expected. The metal was a little thin and the printing one sided with no back plate at all and the string was a little cheezy. This was a gift for my fiance, who did like it but had the same thoughts I did on construction.  Still she wears it so I guess it was a welcome gift."
3.0,but at least it's funny
3.0,"ok dress except way smaller than expected.  i am 5'4&#34; 115 lbs and very fit.  i ordered a medium instead of a small from reading the reviews and the medium fit like a leotard.  every bump and line showed, partly bc it was too tight and partly bc of the thin fabric.  the fabric wouldn't have been an issue if not for the fit."
3.0,Wrinkles too easily
3.0,"Came in very cute, my only issue is the stitching. As you can see from the pictures above"
3.0,"I love the colors and the print but not the material. It is made out of the stretchy, clingy stuff and makes it fit too small, I went up two sizes and it is too tight."
3.0,"Pros: easy on and off, the sole is a very thick silicone material and protects little feet from cold, they are relatively cute<br />Cons: no internal padding, insole is cardboard, the bow is glued on and comes off easily.<br />I strongly suggest wearing with socks, as raw edges may cause blisters."
3.0,"The tank top definitely runs a little small, especially in the armpit area.  And it's such a thick material that it doesn't have much give.  I like things to be a little flowier/freeing for my yoga practice.  The design on the back was also a little more understated than I would've liked."
3.0,"some of the jewels were loose,  I had to repair it"
3.0,"I bought this vest for fashion/aesthetic purposes, so I can't comment on it's functionality for fishing/safari etc. It fits well, and I like that it's well ventilated. One thing of note is that the ""grey"" color is really more of an ashy purple; it's really not anything like the picture shows. I don't mind it personally, but some might find that irritating. The zipper is a bit finicky and tends to undo itself from the bottom often, which also doesn't bother me as I rarely wear it zipped but it's something to note for those who actually intend to take this fishing or on a safari. You pay for what you get. Overall it feels quite flimsy and thin, and I really can't imagine that it'd be all that durable when used for it's intended purpose"
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, however it is a tight fit.  I would recommend buying at least one size larger than normal."
3.0,"Comfy fit and sexy neckline, but the pleats do not lay flat and give a bigger appearance to tummy and butt."
3.0,My fault-  I did not understand that it was a one inch size necklace.  I thought it would be a large pocket watch.
3.0,"It looks different than in the picture and looks maybe a little lower quality (crooked ears, kinda pointy nose) however they are comfy and warm."
3.0,Sized right until the bottoms… high water length
3.0,"It was a very cute shirt, it runs small and it was really too short"
3.0,"Dress is very cute, but it does run a little small especially in the sleeves. Also I'm 5'1 and I have to wear heels so the bottom doesn't drag. I might get it altered, but I bought it for a special occasion and didn't end up wearing it."
3.0,Not a choker.
3.0,They are a little snug.  I could have used a size bigger.
3.0,They are nice but the weight of the earring was unexpected
3.0,Very small. Would not recommend for larger headed children
3.0,A bit too much fabric. Less is good sometimes.
3.0,The package  was very hard to get off.  It was not easy to use.  I had to get near water to clean  it it off.
3.0,a bit tight in the crotch
3.0,"Purchased this as a gift for my friend who likes Star Wars to put in his BMW. Very cute and a great size, but the chain broke and dice fell off after only a few weeks."
3.0,The product is a thin light weight cotton material. It definitely runs large in size. The material wrinkles a lot when washed. It has to be ironed.
3.0,I would order a size up. They are really tight and the padding is in a strange place.  It might be better in a larger size
3.0,"It does run a little large so I would do one size down. Love the dress, very comfortable but after a few washes the pockets tend to sag a little bit."
3.0,do not like the way it fits x-large is too small
3.0,Velcro wore out pretty fast
3.0,I'm tall and these were not the most comfortable. They started to slide down a little. Luckily I only purchased them for a short Halloween event.
3.0,Cute but very thin material. Not for a lunch or dinner out. Maybe for beach pool cover up.
3.0,"I love the shirt design. However, the material is tissue paper thin and the bottom part of the shirt fits like a bathing suit."
3.0,"Cute, but way too small. Maybe my daughter can wear it?"
3.0,"I am a male and ordered the large, they are kind of tight putting on and wish they were little longer up the legs."
3.0,Cut but order your normal size. Some reviews said go down don't do that
3.0,"Those other reviewers weren't kidding, this dress is so sheer it's almost see through!"
3.0,"This is well-made and the color is vibrant. However, the material is too hot for summer and not breathable. In the heat of the sun, I feel like I'm going to explode wearing this."
3.0,Very pretty top runs small
3.0,"This dress was okay. Not my favorite, but looked exactly like the picture and the description was accurate."
3.0,"this slip is only partially cotton and not breathable and not comfortable to sleep in as I sleep hot,"
3.0,"Not sure how many sellers of this product there are but mine are an obvious knockoff. They were mailed from China by an individual and came in a simple plastic bag. There is no brand marking anywhere on the gloves or the packaging. The photo on Amazon shows an &#34;E&#34; logo but mine have no logo or any statement of materials used in the glove. They do smell like leather and the lining does feel like cashmere. Having said all this, I do like the gloves. They fit very well and look like expensive gloves. If you're not concerned about where they come from or who makes them, they appear to be well worth the small price."
3.0,"THEY ARE USING CHEAPER FABRIC THAT IS INFERIOR TO THE SWEATSHIRTS<br />THAT THEY MARKETED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WHAT A SHAME, USED TO BE A<br />GREAT PRODUCT...NO LONGER."
3.0,These would be great for a young adult. They are way too big for small kids and way too small for an adult. They are cute and well made but make sure you have your sizing right.
3.0,"The material is a bit on the thin side and shiny. If you are in the thick side size up, you can't wear any underwear because it shows everything.  Will return because it's not for my body type."
3.0,the charm looks too big and idk just prob wont wear it because looks more silly than sexy
3.0,Does not set time automatically miss leading has time zones but but does not update automatically
3.0,"Short and a little snug, but cute jacket!"
3.0,"the blouse is nice, runs small and is shorter on than in the picture"
3.0,These sunglasses were wide for my husband's narrow face.  It wasn't worth returning.  They look nice and would be great for a wider head person.
3.0,It's like a shoelace for the tie in the front. Low quality lace falling apart.
3.0,"I love the style, but the plastic is very brittle and fragile. I don’t buy expensive sunglasses anymore because they break/scratch too easily, but I am now on my 3rd pair of these because of how easily they break.<br /><br />They look lit tho!"
3.0,"Skirt fits. But it wasn't the fabric that I thought it was, more rough than smooth."
3.0,"I bought this little crossbody wallet in hopes of being able to carry just what I needed when I shopped. However, it is much too small to even be useful in that situation.  With a phone, money, credit and health insurance cards, and driver's license (the necessities), it becomes too tight. Then, it takes too much effort to pull out what is needed. For someone very, very young, it might be useful."
3.0,The necklace was nice but started to turn after only a couple of wears.
3.0,"Cute skirt but runs very small.  I normally wear a medium in bottoms and this thing made me look like a stuffed sausage!  I exchanged for the XL and it fit better, but the elastic waistband was still a bit tight, even when sitting at my natural waist (30in).  Material is ok and flowy; not quite what I thought it was going to be but it was comfortable for my vacation.  I'd recommend this skirt to those who have a pretty small waist/hips, otherwise it's just not flattering IMO and the button elastics will over stretch."
3.0,These fit oddly compared to other Cortez's I've owned.
3.0,"This dress is truly beautiful. I ordered the red one but the 2X (the largest size available) did not fit even though I wear a size 2X in other clothes comfortably. I was very sad that I couldn't wear it. But I guess if you're a super small gal, you could wear it. Also, I am 5'2 but it did not drag on the floor when I was barefoot. So the length was not an issue."
3.0,"These glasses are cute, I got some compliments from multiple people. Also comfortable to wear, but it broke after a few months of use. Cheap made :("
3.0,"So cheap in quality. I'm not sure they're even metal! They look okay, maybe I'll get what 5 wears out of them? So for that and the design 3 stars.🙄"
3.0,"I didn’t like how it looked, and the material wasn’t great."
3.0,"Comfortable, but a kind of weird fit around the waist. Very thin. Definitely see through."
3.0,She has a septum and it looks sooooo freakin cute on her!!!<br />I kept the half circle for my tragus and its cute.<br />The heart was awkward and wasn't comfortable.
3.0,broke not long long after I got it
3.0,"I've had this bag for almost 7 months now and I can tell the quality is not so good. It looks like I've been using it for longer than 7 months. The sides are tearing and the zipper ""handle"" fell off  (but that I fixed by adding a key chain).<br />But i really liked it before, it is very pretty and very roomy (I particularly love the fact that it doesn't have compartiments inside).<br />I never used any of the accessories, but maybe that's just me.<br />Bottom line, I'm still using this bag, and probably will until it gets useless. But won't buy this brand again."
3.0,"I like these, they seem to be of good quality and the style is unique.  However they do not go up very far.  The top is about 5 inches below my knee.  I wanted them to compress up & over my entire calf like they do on the model leg.  So overall I am disappointed.  Unfortunately I bought two pair, and could not even return the unopened pair due to nature of the product.  Which I understand, but be aware if you want to try them out, only buy one to be sure they are what you expect."
3.0,Liked the color but not the string
3.0,Love the look but snaps are weak so it's easy to loose.
3.0,"Not quite sure how to review these. They look and feel great, though I haven't washed them yet. My son loves them. And I'll grant that it does say ""3-pack"" (I bought the New Day set). But given humanity's generally bipodal design, I guess I just assumed the ""3"" referred to ""3 pairs."" Like, 6 socks in all.<br /><br />Nope. $25, 3 socks. Exactly 3. That's $8.33 per sock, cuz I got 'em on sale. A steal, really. At what price, three warm feet?<br /><br />So maybe buy them along with a couple pairs of neon pink/yellow/green socks, and wear one New Day Head & one generic each for 3 days. Mismatches are in style. Use the extra generic sock (no matter what, you get a spare!) to make a sock puppet. Everyone loves sock puppets."
3.0,"Fun boa that we used for the Harry Styles concert, but the color bled into our clothes."
3.0,Very pretty! Smaller then I thought.
3.0,"They don't irritate my ears, which is good but the plastic is kind of flimsy on the loops.<br />The studs are alright though, be careful of the sharp points! They have been handy on actually re-piercing ears."
3.0,"A little disappointed... While they seem pretty well-made for the price, I am a little disappointed in the three sets that came. I understand they are &#34;assorted&#34; but funny or smiling faces would have been better.  doubt my daughter will wear all of them and unfortunately I waited too close to Christmas and I'm stuck with them. Glad I didn't pay very much.  They didn't even come in a little box,  just a baggie."
3.0,"The front panel could be taller, I’m a fan of covering the girls fully in a sport bra. I use it for yoga so I don’t need support  for running or a cardio manner. Love the look and the straps on the back, it feels comfortable but doesn’t contain a D cup in the top. If I order a size bigger it would be too lose around. And WHY do sport bra makers think women need thick padding in sport bras?"
3.0,Product is as expected. Size chart seems accurate. Is made from the weird thin nightgown material that looks to be printed. Not stretchy but soft. My only complaint is that the sleeves do not taper towards the wrist. Overall happy with the product.
3.0,"Overall nice tote. Strong as advertised. BIG problem is the straps are way too short. If only the company spent the money on making each strap 2 inches longer, then it would be much easier to put on the shoulder and carry it that way filled with items, and really be a shoulder tote bag.  I am not a big or tall person and I have a short torso, so if the straps are too short for me....., what about all you tall people?<br /><br />Fabric had strong chemical smell. Make sure you wash the bag in a washing machine. That's the only way it came out, as handwashing didn't work."
3.0,Fit as expected but I wish it had pockets.
3.0,They were even smaller than suggested ... or they were madeto to hug your thighs ... i followedthe driving comparison chart ... should've ordered them a size bigger
3.0,Lost it's elasticity after a couple of months.
3.0,Very tiny for the enormous price. But I need it because I'm attending a showing of RHPS on the big screen and I want the best purse there. The design is great though!
3.0,"Love the bracelet, but the color of the beads are off. The clear beads have a blue hue to them."
3.0,I didn't realize the purse would be so small
3.0,"These are big, as advertised. I have a big head... 7 3/4"" hats are too tight on me, but 8"" are a little too loose. I actually wear a 7 3/4 ""long oval,"" but I've never seen this size outside of western wear. When I wear a standard bandanna, I have just barely enough material to get it tired. After they're washed once, they're relegated to handkerchief duty. These fit perfectly. I only gave three stars, because they are somewhat cheaply made. I was especially put off, because the description made them out to be high quality. They are indeed 100% cotton and the edges are stitched, but the screen printing is only on one side. The ink is also thick and not soft like cheaper ones. I also ran a couple through the washing machine, even though the manufacturer's instructions specifically said not to, and they held up well. Bottom line, I will probably order again when these wear out, but I wish they would lower the price and skip on the unnecessary individual packaging. It seems wasteful and probably accounts for some of the higher cost."
3.0,Didn't realize it is  a PIN instead of a magnet.  Nice.
3.0,"Product used for covering arms while driving and to cover arms if I have to be out in the sun rays even for a very short time like walking across a store parking lot. Works okay while driving and arms are horizontal for handling the steering wheel; however, the gloves don't stay up while walking (arms down /vertical). Have to keep pulling them up. Basically, there's no elastic band at the top of the glove to keep them up. Otherwise, while driving and arm in a horizontal position, they work by preventing breakout (rash) from sun rays."
3.0,Too thick. So to heavy for my necklaces! Unless you want thick my projects needs less weight.
3.0,"These are obviously stock that didn’t meet quality control.  There was a large 3 inch section of the leg seam that was never sewn shut.<br /><br />On the positive side, they are thick and warm without being too heavy."
3.0,"I ordered a size smaller for perfect fit however,  it had a small tear one week into usage."
3.0,"It was a nice shirt until I washed it. It shrunk like 10 sizes, and I did cold washing!"
3.0,Doesn't look as nice as in does in pictures. And snags on everything.
3.0,Next time would be nice to have this style in real leather. Poor quality
3.0,I loved it when it came but I only wore it a couple times and the chain broke.
3.0,"I chose this adhesive bra because it seemed so similar to one I had purchased previously, but can't seem to find anymore. It fit just as I was expecting, and the adhesive is VERY sticky so it seems like it is going to last for awhile. However, it's almost as if the adhesive doesn't go close enough to the edges because when you put it on, it seems to wrinkle a bit at the edge. This isn't so much of a problem depending on what you wear it with, but it could be visible under some tops or fabrics. For the people that are hoping for some extra lift, if you bend over and put it on from underneath the breast first, it definitely helps with lift and support!"
3.0,Very very cute but runs really small.  Go a size up for sure
3.0,It was a little small for my 7 and 1/4 head. Same color as the marine corps one. I didnt try to turn in but it doesnt have the correct tag inside so most likely they wont take it.
3.0,Cute necklace. The charm was a little smaller than I had expected. The chain also send a little weak. But for the price is not bad.
3.0,This is beyond a crop top.  It is more like a bra because it’s so short.  I was very upset when I tried it on because the sleeves looked awesome and it was super soft material.
3.0,"I bought this a couple months ago for work and enjoyed them enough I wanted to have a cleaner pair to wear, so I bought a second pair. Unfortunately, the second pair had the eyelet break after only lacking them up once and wearing them around the house. Replacing the second pair in the hopes that they are not defective, as my first pair are still good."
3.0,"They are too small for my daughter, who is 9. The masks look good, but we will probably have to give them away to friends."
3.0,These are really really small!.
3.0,Cute the girl is large. About 2&#34;
3.0,"fortunately I'm a sewer.  This thing is coming apart at the seams, literally.  The cuffs are coming off and the seams in the sleeves are also pulling apart and I've only worn it and washed it twice.  I never put it in the dryer."
3.0,Nice design.  Runs a bit too small and short to be considered a high quality shirt.  Probably should order one size up.
3.0,"It is longer in the length than advertised, the model must be tall for it to come up that length. I am 5'3 161lbs 36DD and wear a large and this def came below my knee. Its nice jut doesn't look 100%"
3.0,"I’m a bit larger busted right now (nursing Mama) and couldn’t get the buttons to lay comfortably. The dress was pulling apart in the chest area even though the rest of the fit was good. It would be better if you are smaller busted in my opinion. Also, plan to do some serious ironing or steaming. It came out of the bag looking awful. It was hard to even get an idea of the style when trying it on because of the deep wrinkles."
3.0,would have loved but the ball fell off within an hour of having them in.
3.0,No size on package or product. Much smaller than expected. Nice material. Would not buy again
3.0,Like it and conceptually it's great but you have to squeeze really hard.  I thougt it might loosen with ise but that does not appear to be the case.
3.0,Pretty bracelet but it was way too tight!  It would only fit a REALLY skinny person or a young teen.  Had to return it!  Too bad! :(
3.0,"This scarf looked nothing like the picture. First of all, it actually came as a bright clown red color when the picture makes it look a burgundy or maroon color.The picture is literally so different! Lucky for them I'm too lazy to ship it back, so I'll just have to make my bright bright red scarf work with my wardrobe somehow."
3.0,"Just to get a better idea of the size, I normally wear 22-24 in US size. I ordered an XXL. The pants fit great in the legs. Everything else is extremely tight. It is soft. Not much freedom of movement since the shoulder area is so confining."
3.0,"Shoes look just as pictured, but they run small. Wish I had bought a size bigger"
3.0,Will be buying a medium these are a size 7/8 which is smaller than I expected
3.0,At the base of the tongue there are thick areas along the seam that rubs the top of both feet.  I don't think I'm going to try to work it out. I'm surprised by this.
3.0,Too small. Went by the sizing guide and ordered a large but should have sized up. Other than that an okay product.
3.0,"Look nice, but are ery large and heavy so they make my ears hang"
3.0,It was a little bit bigger than I expected but it still works as a wallet
3.0,Super cute but they run really big and I had to return them.
3.0,This should be bigger for the money you pay
3.0,"This shirt is well made and high quality. However, I will be returning it. It fits overall large and unflattering. I purchased a small, my usual size, and this was very boxy. The arms were huge and sat too far down from my armpits."
3.0,"We bought a couple sizes bigger than normal shoe size. They fit okay, but they weren’t nearly as soft as the Bloch brand we had before. The leather just ended around the ankle without a trim. My daughter didn’t like the feeling. We returned them and got another Bloch."
3.0,Surprised by how large they are. Have purchased at least five different fuzzy friends slippers in the past and all fit perfectly. Feel like I am wearing gun boats as I flop around the house. Good thing is they are cute and warm.
3.0,"Ordered 2 of the metal bands with magnetic quick release. One band is great, the other seems to have a ""defective"" magnet as it will not stay fastened and allows the watch to fall slack and off the wearers wrist."
3.0,"The material is extremely thin, seem more of something to be worn as a cover up not as a dress, not true to size"
3.0,Liked it but there were only polka dots on the from of the skirt part. That was disappointing
3.0,One earring bent shortly after changing the 3 yr olds earring
3.0,"Based on the reviews, I went small but apparently not small enough.  You will need to go at least 2 sizes smaller than normal.  Luckily, with socks these will work for now for outings where she doesnt have to walk much.  Super cute and Im sure in a year when they fit properly she will enjoy them even more."
3.0,"This is NOT a bralette - it's a bikini top!! I am a 36 D and it does NOT fit even though I got a large. Runs small. Cute, but again, it's a swim top!!"
3.0,did not receive clear lens with these goggles  the goggles are great otherwise
3.0,"Not thrilled with the designs, but they'll do."
3.0,"Great for summer but not exactly what I was looking for. This top goes well with a lot of my skirts so that's a plus. I ordered a medium but that was a bit baggy, otherwise it's nice."
3.0,"I’m not sure both dresses come from the manufacture listed. I got it in 2 different colors and they fit quite differently and there is a difference in fabric. There are also no tags to indicate brand. Overall, for the price..,, I’m mostly ok with this purchase. However, it does feel a bit like, “bait and switch”"
3.0,"Shirt was made okay, not as cute as the picture. Fits like the picture shows, a little bigger."
3.0,Very tight fit on a fat old man.  I feel like I am corseted in it.  Probaly suitable for someone very fit.
3.0,I am a groomer and use these at work and on one of them the strap broke in just 2 weeks. I still have one but I stopped using it often
3.0,"The design and elegance of the product is nice.but for the money paid,it’s defintiely not worth it. the nose rings are way too flimsy that if tried to do a strong bend it will break.i just used it twice until  now but not sure when the bends will strip off."
3.0,It was too see through
3.0,It a nice hat but doesn't fit snug on my head. It would blow off in the wind.
3.0,"Love the fabric of the underwear. It's soft, breathable, and stretchy but the cut of the underwear was not as expected. Firstly they ride lower than other hipster style underwear I use of other brands. The cut along the back is also more ridden up (think slight wedgie) than other hipsters as well, but you can't see the back of the underwear in the pictures. Returned this item."
3.0,"My dad LOVES it and it fits great. However, after the stupid comment by the co-founder, I regretted purchasing it for a Christmas gift."
3.0,"I was skeptical about this when it was given to me as a gift and I think I still am. I'm not sure if it's windproof because I never remember to take it out when it's blowing and I'm not so sure about water; I tried to sprinkle it, ended up drenching it… and it drenched. I've decided it's kind of like my grandmothers housecoat that she wore over her clothes when she worked at home so she could take it off when she needed to head out. She had housedresses that were worn alone but I think you'd want to layer this.<br /><br />This isn't breathable fabric so it can feel stuffy, particularly when I end up taking a lengthy phone call. I've used it for light cleaning in the yard, house cleaning that isn't wet, ... I wouldn't use it for cooking because it would melt if any heat touched it and since I keep my phone in the front -only-  pocket it hangs down and everything is at risk- the phone, the nylon, the me, the house, the family & pets, the garments I've figured out, not to mention the food I would've been cooking at the time. No. Don't use it for cooking.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent. It worked for how I've used it but I'm not sure it was worth the money charged(I don't know if I can say that in the review since that's a seller part). I think I'll have to think about it but for now I don't think I can even say it deserves 4 or 5 stars because it does it's job well even though I don't like the design.  Sorry, weird garment."
3.0,"These pants can get on, but they are right. Be ware, YOU NEED TO SIZE UP. Unfortunately, I need one size bigger than what they sell. I’m on a weight loss journey, so I hope I will be able to fit into these. I ordered the white and they are a bit see through. They are still cute though."
3.0,"The inner lining of the bag & the changing pad are both super cheap material & I do not expect them to last long at all. The outside bag seems to be a bit better quality; however the details are not correct. It says there is an exterior back pocket but there isn’t one. It says there are 3 interior compartments but there are actually 4 (2 at the front side of the bag & 2 at the back side of the bag) plus it has a zippered pocket inside that isn’t on the description at all. Like I said before, the inside is all really cheap quality material so I think that’s all going to get ruined/ripped out pretty quickly so then you just have the one big compartment & the other exterior compartments. With that considered, I’ll probably still keep the bag because this is a bag to go with my toddler to daycare with his diapers, wipes, a change of clothes & his water bottle so what I’d have even with the ripped out inner part would still be enough for my needs. You get what you pay for. We are taking an outing to Walmart so if I find something better/cheaper, then this might go back."
3.0,"I ordered a couple of different styles in the same sizes and all Hanes, but I had to return these, as they were smaller than expected. Otherwise they seemed acceptable."
3.0,The quality was very thin
3.0,The tank is pretty boxy. I should’ve ordered a size smaller.
3.0,This dress is short! I am only 5’2” and my crotch is super close to the opening where it’s bunched. I can’t possibly wear this out in public. Possibly with leggings under it as more of a tunic type top. I didn’t pay a ton so I will keep for a sleep shirt.
3.0,I’m 5’m and 130#.The top is a little too big and if it had adjustable spaghetti straps it would be a nice fit.material is ok.And the length is is fine btw I’m a 40 c.
3.0,"The good: This dress looks just like the picture. It's a unique design and pattern that is flattering. The fit was good as well - I am normally a size 8 in dresses and the size 8 fit perfectly. If you don't get too close, it looks great - so much so that my spouse wanted me to keep the dress.<br />The bad: The material is terrible - it's a cheap polyester that looks ok from a distance but feels flimsy and looks cheesy up close.  I have bought several dresses on Amazon from this brand (albeit at a slightly higher price point) and been pleased with the quality--so this was a disappointment.<br />Overall, I really wanted to love this dress and if the material were just a little nicer I would definitely have kept it."
3.0,I've had this bag for a little over 6 months but after just 3 it started to pull apart at the seams. The handle and straps started pulling away first and then the top zipper started doing the same thing. I've used it until the zipper seam actually came apart from the bag. It has a lot of pockets and space to use but this backpack/purse has not held up for the long haul. If you plan to use it long-term I'd go with something else more sturdy.
3.0,"Ordered a L.  Colors not as vibrant and button on top is too high up so you have to leave it Unbuttoned for comfort and style,  which kinda looks dumb.  May take button off.  A bit cheaply made -  not as cute as pic!"
3.0,Likes: good satin material<br />Dislike: too big and the black die comes off on my sheets even after washing it.
3.0,These work well but the leather or rather pleather is already starting to wear just after 1 wear.
3.0,"It fits well, but the color is changing and have lost three stones on it."
3.0,"This is beautiful fur but if you are looking for purple,  this is not it. This is a burgundy,  not even close to the beautiful grape purple shown. Disappointed."
3.0,It looked good on my arm
3.0,"Not easy on, easy off. Good support. Size 10 shoe, xl sock."
3.0,"I ordered this for the two bracelets for my granddaughters. It did not include the two bracelets 158 pieces, But I was really looking forward to the two bracelets"
3.0,"Great hoodie, exactly as pictured! My only gripe is it runs small (Ex. XL fits like medium)."
3.0,"If you can, try getting alternative brands that might be a little bit healthier.  We got this because it's compact for storage, and it's hard to find chicken broth these days with the COVID-19 lockdown that's going along.  It tastes pretty good actually, but we're afraid to really use it because it seems pretty unhealthy.  It's there more as backup in case we really need flavor and don't have another way to get it."
3.0,"The costume arrives as shown, but the sizing proportions are very strange.  The pants fit well.  The shirt is snug through the waist and huge in the shoulder and the hat is child-sized.  Since it is made of a fabric much like the webbing they use on the bottom of box spring matresses, it does not move or give at all.  It is extremely stiff!  Thankfully, Halloween is only one night so it will do!"
3.0,"Beautiful, but way too small, even though I ordered by their size chart."
3.0,Thought I would like jean leggings but to me they don't look like jeans...the pockets seem off or something.  They alright...oh they have a weird smell that when washed twice now is still there...wouldn't buy again.
3.0,I guess I didn't read the size on these studs.  They are oversized.
3.0,"I like the top , to long and ankles need to be more fitted"
3.0,No se informó del peso de los zapatos de senderismo y a mi parecer son algo pesados
3.0,"Two features I really wanted might as well be missing. The alarm & countdown timer alarms can't be heard unless I hold the watch right to my ear. I have reached out to Casio by email & by chat and might as well have just shouted out my window - useless.<br /><br />Otherwise I really like the watch. If anyone knows how to make the sounds louder, please reply.<br /><br />UPDATE: Casio has replied there is no way to make the sounds louder. Bummer."
3.0,"Arrived, quickly. I really wanted it to work.  I am 5'4 and it was too long and wide. I would say this would be perfect for a taller person."
3.0,i always buy a size 8 1/2 and these were just too big but i guess its good for slipping on and off. also there isnt as much comfort as there was with the last shoes i bought.
3.0,"This is a gorgeous and well-made dress, but it runs very small. Order two sizes up if you're at all busty."
3.0,"The blue center wore off quickly with normal wear. I probably won’t buy again, although it’s probably with the price."
3.0,"Color good, zipper crooked and hard to zip. Bag is just okay."
3.0,"They are pretty, seem like good quality, however I ordered based on reviews and sizing chart, and they are far too small."
3.0,These were advertised as warm winter gloves. They are really thin and definitely not warm enough for Northwest Indiana weather!!
3.0,The strap itself is fine but it would have been helpful to have a step-by-step instruction booklet as well as a screw driver with more efficient torque.
3.0,"This fits well, pretty true to size. Pants feel rough, not best material. The shirt could have been a little bigger for a large. 5'7"", 155lbs for comparison."
3.0,"If this skirt fit over my hips I'd give it a 5 star rating. I love the look of it, but I have to lose some weight to fit into it. I ordered a size large which according to the sizing chart should have fit a size 12 to 14. I'm size 14 and this didn't even come close. I don't know why they would have said it's 12 - 14 because there is no give in the material. It's not going to stretch. Kind of disappointed.<br />I ordered the red one."
3.0,Like the belt but it was supposed to be able to go through airport security but it does not
3.0,Make sure to read. Only 2 hats come with your order. The picture is misleading. The quality of the hats are great at least.
3.0,Just too..small..by looking at them...never wear them...took the loss...
3.0,Bought it to make a pair of matching socks. Got a quarter way through the ball and it was pieced and colors did not match up. Hard to make matching socks when some pieces the yarn in a self striping yarn.
3.0,I like it  as a dress but the cap sleeves to big you look like you gonna fly I don't want to return because I like the dress I am gonna try to fix the sleeves my self  because I really like the  it .
3.0,"These are really cute but the soles marked our floors.  The shape of the heel wasn't too sturdy either, for an active 4-year-old.  We returned them."
3.0,"Don't close all the way. The ring twisted in my sleep and got stuck, I basically had to force it back through my nostril. It's cute but a lot of trouble"
3.0,Not as comfortable as I had hoped
3.0,Metal is thin and piece is a little too big.
3.0,Very cute and bright and clown like
3.0,"This is an XL on my 5yr old daughter. So that size seems way off. The real problem with it is, the picture on the front are the exact same as on the back but on the back they’re BACKWARDS. So Adventure Time is on the front middle and it’s also on the back middle but backwards, so they are exactly the same just backwards. Some of the characters are wonky too, like the TMNT. It’s cute though, kids like it. But it’s for flaws. Material is comfortable and keeps them warm."
3.0,"This is a pretty cute dress. Sizing is tts and it’s very soft, but gets very wrinkly. It’s also on the thinner side. Looks cuter in the pics imo."
3.0,"Goofy fit. Was blousy and short, too big at chest. Vey oddly cut"
3.0,"I ordered a medium and that is what I wear in most shirts, shorts, etc but this is way to big!  In 150 lbs and 5'5""..36B and the top is huge.. Bottoms are big and I look like I'm wearing a diaper.  The color, style and pattern is cute but size is off.  I wanted to like it.  I wish you could buy seperate top/bottom."
3.0,"Loved it when I got it, but it shrunk a lot in true wash.  Washed on cold and hung to dry but even so it shrunk and it now to tight across the chest.  Sad!"
3.0,thought I ordered a blended product/did not want 100 polly which is what I got/could not find original item I ordered from/finally found something and price had dropped from $7.55/mar27 to $6.91/mar30/on clothing very important to state fabric content/100 polly not good for bald head in summertime
3.0,"Color was very unexpected, wasn't a good fit"
3.0,I think it should be thicker and larger.
3.0,Sent back the pants didn't look like picture. Material was different.
3.0,The dress is absolutely beautiful. I am 5”4 and 180. I ordered a large. With a 36 ddd chest it deforms the shape of my breast when wearing the dress. The waist line is perfect it just makes my boobs look weird. This dress is made with great quality and could be a perfect work dress...it is about 3 inches above my ankle. Honestly I love it but I am unable to wear it. :(
3.0,It's OK. To me the fabric or 'look' is just not as nice as I would like.- My guy doesn't like it at all.
3.0,Very cute. But runs small
3.0,"Nice color, style and fit but wrinkles badly!"
3.0,"These have slowed me down. I can't serf to position my finger so the glue isn't spilling out. I don't want to rate the product add bad, I guess it's just that I'm not use to it."
3.0,"The pictures you have on the site looks like fit on adult size manechin, but is a little smaller than that and I thought is a little bigger in general . in rest looks good,"
3.0,Your packaging of hard plastic shattered an snagged up the top bra...I suggests using a small box. Fits perfect..just not maidenform quality...
3.0,Ok.  Falls off too easily.  At least on my feet.
3.0,"This is nice, but the width of the leather strap is so wide I have trouble latching it to many belts, or my purse, etc.<br />I also wish the clip, which holds the keys on is easy to accidentally push. Of course, this means that if you aren't diligent, it may be easy for the keys to come loose or get lost."
3.0,"Lock is not solid, quality is not as good but okay"
3.0,Looks a lot cheaper than it did in the photo.
3.0,A size to large and flap in the back yet extremely narrow in the toes.  Very uncomfortable to wear and pinch the toes badly.  Very poorly sized.  While they seem to be made well they are not wearable due to the horrible sizing issues.  The vendor is helpful in resolving issues.
3.0,"It adjusts well but over time with sweat it tends to fall, not recommended for hot season"
3.0,I'm only 5'4&#34; and a large was too short but it's cute!
3.0,Huge.  I ordered small and they fell off me.  We're like and extra large.  They were cute in general and good quality.
3.0,"I like the style, but they are WAY bigger than the purple ones I ordered from the same company. Kind of disappointing."
3.0,"They came all in one bag, so they weren't labeled. After sizing them all up I was really sad to find that I got three 14g and only one 12g. I had my 2 roommates even looked at them and we used the other tapers and tunnels I have, and yup only one 12g.  :(  Everything else looked really good. The bigger they get they are hollow, so they are really light weight."
3.0,"Some of the loops on the ends hold the glasses, and a couple are too big and the glasses keep falling off."
3.0,Buy a size or 2 up. And this is very short. It hits right at pant waist line.
3.0,It's a really nice looking shoe and does not look like a steel toe she only thing i dislike was bit smaller I am a size 9.5 but kept size 10 yet the steel on side of the pinky rubs against the toe. I ended up putting some sort of patting on it still has some discomfort.
3.0,"The dress looked like the picture and for the most part I did not see any damages but it was too big and the waistline of the dress fell way too low. I naturally have a big bust line (36G) and there was space for probably 2-3 more inches and the shoulders were loose. The material is stretchy so that doesn't help to give the dress structure either.Due to it being to big, the waistline to low, and not having much structure (even with a petticoat added( I had to return it. If you do get this dress, size down one and if you have a short waistline or even average like myself it will hit you at your hipbone instead of your natural waist and get a very fluffy petticoat."
3.0,"The hat was ok.  I added “bling” to it as the font was not as bold as I would have liked it to be.  It didn’t quite fit well.  Looked like an Elmer Fud hunting hat.<br />However, it served its purpose - a one day celebration hat."
3.0,"hemline was a bit uneven so it looks a little lopsided when I wear it, but the color is nice and I really  needed a simple top so it works for around the house/yard, and the looseness of the shirt is nice for days that are too warm for long sleeves but still too chilly for summer clothing."
3.0,I would order at least a size larger or more of you like your sweaters loose. It is also a very lightweight material and should not be used for real warmth.
3.0,Daughter seems to like these and lots of color choices
3.0,Size was off
3.0,Not for person with big breast
3.0,It runs pretty small. I'd get a size up.
3.0,13 bucks not expecting a hollywood prop.
3.0,Good quality. My husband will love them.
3.0,Doesnt look at good in person and it doesnt fit very well. Waste of my money I gave them away
3.0,"I ordered a medium and a large. I typically fit in US size 4. I decided to keep the large. The shirt did not have frays and the lace is stretchy yet durable. I gave the shirt three stars due to the sizes running smaller than a typical American sizing. It got compliments and friends assumed it came from Express, they were surprised to hear it was from Amazon! I think the price is well worth the quality. I recommend buying one or two sizes up. The shirt was shorter than I expected on the midriff section. The under material is sewn on well. Looks great dressed down with jeans or dressed up with a skirt."
3.0,Smelled of chemicals.  It took 4 washings to get the smell down.
3.0,"returned this dress with no issues, wasn't the right fit for me"
3.0,"I'd recommend going a size up from what you normally wear. It's a well-made shirt, but shrunk a lot after washing. I can wear it but it's too tight and probably won't become a favorite. Too bad because it's a nice-looking shirt. For a T-shirt that costs this much, I expected better."
3.0,"I love this shirt minus the fact that is runs BIG not small as all the other reviews stated. I ordered 2 sizes up to make sure it would fit, well, it is a dang mumu on me. This is a sleep shirt, I cannot wear it out in public."
3.0,I like it but don't sit on it. Keep it on the passenger side. The zipper gives me trouble sometimes as well just as new.
3.0,Arm holes way too big for me.
3.0,"super sparkly, plastic one broke 1st month.  Quick response from the seller.  they were great."
3.0,It’s a standard tank but it runs very large. I was swimming in the small
3.0,"I have ordered several sets of these. They're pretty, and fit well. The only problem is that if they ever do fall out, they break very easily, which leaves you having to carefully place chipped glass in your ear until the new pair arrives. lol For the price, you can keep spares on hand. I did have one pair that arrived broken, but they're so affordable, it was cheaper to get another set, than to take time off work to go return them."
3.0,It was not true to size. Ran very small for a XXL. Also I didn’t like that was was in the same search as  hallmark movie shirt that I was looking for.
3.0,"This is nicely styled with great snaps made from a bronze colored metal. The fabric is very soft, but it's kind of ratty looking, and it attracts and holds onto anything that comes near it - lint, dust, cat hair, the stray crumb. The three dimensionality of the tufting makes the fabric really grab onto and hold everything."
3.0,"The pricepoint it the only reason this isnt a higher score. They are really cute for halloween, but probably priced higher than they are worth"
3.0,I got better results using my fingers to add the charms
3.0,texture somewhat plasticy. would not buy again.
3.0,"I've worn them a few times and for the price they are okay. When I was in CO my fingertips got sooo cold but it was definitely a freezing day. I'd say they go down to about 20 degrees? Also, after wearing them 5-6x the lining has become kind of loose and it makes putting them on/taking them off a bit of a hassle."
3.0,Had one of these a couple years ago and it lasted a couple years. It was worn through just about everything too. Ordered this one thinking I was getting another one just like my first one.  It's close but the leather on this one is thinner. Not sure it will be as durable as the one I originally had but looks okay and fits fine.  Just wish it was thicker like the first one I had.
3.0,It is a nice brown suede choker
3.0,Cute. But not what I expected. The cc slots are like cuts in a paper.
3.0,"This looked prettier in the picture than it did on me.  Was a little snug in the sizing, I couldn't make it work and had to send it back."
3.0,"cute, but not so good material super complimenting though."
3.0,i  got them for her  i dont know whats going on  i dont know what  i am doing  but i tryed
3.0,"Hard to put on. The edges started to peel the first time I put it on my watch. However, once I was able to get it on, it is super cute and comfortable but I don't forsee it lasting long."
3.0,"This was a gift for my dad, and I shipped it directly to him. Had I seen it first, I would have returned it. The placement of the engraving looks so bad!  But he likes it so I will let it go. Just letting others know this could happen to them."
3.0,"You need so much sun to make the propeller run, that the amount of breeze it generates is not enough to do any real good. I just end up looking like a geeky nerd!"
3.0,"the fit doesn't accommodate my butt. When I squat or lean over, the pants come down in the back. It fits well as long as I'm not working out. Would have rated higher if it had an elastic band or drawstring to keep the shorts up."
3.0,Bunches up at the waist line.
3.0,The Velcro is not very sturdy and the shoes slip off
3.0,"I so wanted this to work.  It was in fact too big, though I tried to make sure to get the correct size for me."
3.0,"Kinda cheap quality. Huge blond spots in my perripheral vision, have to turn my head far before changing lanes. They work better for costume than actual riding."
3.0,Not thick enough
3.0,The handle is not as strong as I thought it was going to be
3.0,"These socks don't fit right. They run small, and I'm only a size 8. The colors were not very vibrant and the purple bled onto the toe and heel after washing in cold water. Not all that warm. Overall, these are just okay and I don't really recommend them."
3.0,"The material is nice and thick. I liked the idea of it. The skirt part looked cool, but the part where the lace-up plaid meets the black top kept bunching out weird. I ordered the medium. I’m size 6, 5’4”. I’ve contacted the seller to return this dress. I’m not sure that ordering a smaller size will help? It took a month to get to the US from China, too. I’m disappointed."
3.0,"I really like this watch, but it get scratches on it to easy. I don't know for sure if this didn't already had some on it. I haven't even wore it that much because of the scratches on it. I have a lot of likeable comments on it.<br /><br />  Paula"
3.0,Cute style but must return. I like the idea of the dress but it didnt sit well on me. I think if the striped part was longer it might have lookes better. My bust takes up most of the stripes so where the dress turns to solid is up higher and makes me look pregnant bc of my stomach/body shape. I also noticed some sloppy stitching at the bottom  but its barely noticable unless you look close. Loved the material.
3.0,"Cute shirt,just but too big."
3.0,Not as looks on picture
3.0,"So maybe you can only wear these high waisted  leggings if you are thin without them rolling down, but as soon as I bent over they just rolled down.  I am a size 12/Large and purchased a large. The quality seemed really great and they were very nice but they just were  uncomfortable since they rolled down; I just ordered some others from a different brand that are also high waist so I will see .."
3.0,This was way too large. Nice fabric but the size was just too off.
3.0,I received the watch as a gift and went through all the directions to set and operate. The sweeping second hand that works as a stop watch keeps stopping after a minute or two. Is it only used for a stop watch? Is it supposed to keep going like any normal watch would? Zero contact phone # for OG so please let me know if others are having the same issue..
3.0,The bottom zipper pocket is my only complaint but use this backpack everyday.
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful but the plastic stick they gave to put in your ear broke immediately as I tried to put it through my and the earring. Now it’s actually stuck in my ear because the plastic stick broke! I need some to use tools to get it out, then maybe whittle some wood without splinters to actually be able to wear these gorgeous earrings."
3.0,"pretty thin, but very cute. They're also very large on my 18 month old's hands...at least we can get maybe one or two more winters out of them!"
3.0,The material was too thin and the dress was too small. I am 5'9 and the dress came above my ankles. Returning it.
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" tall and weigh 190 lbs my waist is 36"". I ordered a size Large and was surprised they were way to small. Returning and will try an XL hopefully they will fit. According to size chat the large should have fit."
3.0,It definitely looks fabulous on the other people that have posted. I bought a large based on reviews. It fit beautifully in the body area but the arms were loose and awkward on me.
3.0,"I have an AT&T samsung galaxy 7 edge, and it is a really tight for my phone.  But the quality of the wallet us actually really nice, but the color was more red than coral like I was expecting."
3.0,Nice earrings (a little small) but I am still looking for a slightly larger center stone.  Would like to also have in bronze to replace a lost pair.
3.0,I got these pants because they have pockets and looked great on the model in the picture. I was dissapointed when they arrived. I usually wear a large/xl and these were way to tight. I also found the material to not be that stretchy or soft. They felt kind of stiff. They are on the thicker side so they are not that lightweight.  I definitly recommend that if you do purchase to size up a size or two.
3.0,"Love the look, didn't like the fit."
3.0,"Love the watch but the strap is cheap. I had to buy a new strap after 2 weeks, it split were the pin is and almost fell off. I get a lot of compliments on the watch.<br />If you buy one order a good leather strap at the same time."
3.0,Odd fit. Seemed more narrow on bottom half.
3.0,I thought the quality would be better.
3.0,Great Backpack but a strap broke after less than 3 months of use.
3.0,Supposed to be 2 right? I only got one and it took a couple of months
3.0,I have pretty large calves so I just went to a fabrics store and got a stretchy lace and replaced them with the ones that came and they fit pretty well then.
3.0,"When it's summertime, I love to wear long maxi dresses anytime I can! Most of the time I wear them to church on Sundays but they are versatile so I can wear them really anywhere. I had purchased a couple in chevron prints last summer and wanted to look for a different style to mix my wardrobe up a bit. I found this dress and loved the colors and style so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This dress is a long maxi dress and comes in a variety of prints and colors. I purchased Color-3, which is a mix of navy blue, red, and white so the dress has a nautical look to it. It's an A-line style so the top part ends just under the bust and the dress flows down to the ground. This particular style that I ordered is made of 65% cotton and 35% polyester. I've washed it in with my dark clothes in warm water and then I hang it up to dry. I've had no problems with it either shrinking or bleeding colors. This dress is made in China.<br /><br />For sizing purposes, I am 5'6&quot;, 175 pounds with a 36D chest and I purchased a medium which fits me pretty well except for the length. I guess I hadn't considered that I could be too tall for this dress but it turns out I am. It goes down to my ankles which is shorter than I like since I prefer my dresses to touch my toes. I wear flip flops with this dress to keep up with the beachy theme and so I don't look even taller. I read several reviews and found some people who were around my size and figured a medium would fit best, which it does. It isn't too see-through but I wear plain color underwear with the dress just in case.<br /><br />Besides the length, the other thing that is strange about this dress is that each color is a separate piece and they are sewn together. After I put it on, I can feel the seams which was annoying at first but I've gotten used to it. It doesn't seem to bother me when I sit down but most dresses that have several colors in the pattern aren't made this way, at least that I've seen. Some of the other patterns on this page may be sewn differently.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this dress and I've gotten many compliments on it! I wear it to church and it pairs nicely with flip flops and some pretty jewelry. It's shorter than I'd like and the seams are strange but I really like the pattern. I think if you are shorter than about 5'4&quot;, this dress will fit you just fine. If you are taller than that, it might not be as long as you'd like. Still, it's pretty and I will wear it until it gets too cold!"
3.0,"Product description indicates that the pantyhose are control top & sheer, which is what I was looking for. They are sheer & durable (no runs on the first wear), but they are not control top.  Disappointed at that."
3.0,"Cute Necklace, Quick delivery"
3.0,"While these shoes started out very comfortable and a perfect fit they stretched so much my toes now hang over the end. I've even tried soaking them in water to shrink them but to no avail. I still flop around in them but only inside . Maybe, with socks----"
3.0,"Proportionately, the heel is much wider than the toe box.  If you need a wide toe box and have a normal heel width heel, these shoes will be a bit snug in the front and will slip at the heel."
3.0,"My order arrived earlier than the expected delivery date. However, I have to say, I was disappointed when this arrived. It’s definitely a cheaper quality fabric and the colors were not nearly as vibrant as pictured."
3.0,"Pretty color, not too thick, which is nice for breathing.  But I am pretty small female, and it was too tight on my face, so I cut it in the back to relieve pressure, so now better."
3.0,It could be better! But my son loved it just the same!
3.0,Cute dress but the pleats on the bust made the top too tight and caused the pleats to open and look unsightly on me.
3.0,Disliked<br />The sizing
3.0,Very tight on the back part of ears but I love that they are big frames.
3.0,"AS I SAID THEY ARE NICE LOOKING,BUT WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THEIR SIZE.ONE CAN'T HARDLY SEE THEM EVEN AT LIKE 5 FEET AWAY."
3.0,The product is shipped from China so takes a good deal of time to arrive. The package was a normal package coming from overseas in a reinforced plastic packaging. The shirt itself is very cute and so-so on material and looks a little cheaper. The chest are was a little smaller than what most would expect in the size. I do not have a large chest so I was surprised by that. If I choose to order again I will just order a size larger than I need.
3.0,"The pattern really is pretty and the cut is flattering. BUT. The size ratio with the tops and bottoms are way off. I ordered a 2xl, I'm usually a large, bottoms fit nicely (a little room at the waistline) but I could get past that. The cups in the top were ridiculously big. Like 3 sizes too big."
3.0,The pants are great but they are tight in the legs.
3.0,"My husband used it to clean his boots and my boots, his boots didn't get too clean. My boots were cleaned  enough to have them polish with another color."
3.0,Strong but there are teenieweenie tiny
3.0,I needed to remove three links from the band.  The company sent instructions promptly when I requested clarification on how to remove the pins.  The pins were almost impossible to remove.  I was almost ready to give it up & return the band when the first pin came out.  I have a couple of puncture wounds but I successfully removed the links.  The band is attractive but the pins should not be this difficult to remove.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, however the color is not right i order royal blue and i get navy blue."
3.0,Super cute on but it was too small for me and I ended up returning it. The cups on the breast part were the part that made me decided to return it.
3.0,This was a good purchase but my silver glasses was Bented so when I wore them it would be pressed against my eye brows. And the padding for the Nose area would often fall off or Unscrew
3.0,"Vest looks great, but it runs quite large so I had to return it. I'm typically a medium but I think a small would fit me."
3.0,Great price but just okay in fit
3.0,They DO NOT have enough TIGHTNESS IN THE ANKLE AREA WHERE I NEED IT THE MOST!!
3.0,"I like this suit!  I want to keep it, but cannot.  The sizing if just plain OFF....I am 5'7&#34; 135 and usually wear a medium.  This was too large in the bust, which never happens, because I am a 32DD, and a bit loose in the trunk area...I am afraid to order a small, because I know it will be too short for my trunk as I have a long torso.  It is a lovely suit, but the sizing is not right."
3.0,"i like this type of fabric, it has a double layer. But the fit of top part is too wide for me even in XS. The bottom was fine. I'm 5'6"". 117lb, 34 B.  i kept the dress because it is inexpensive, easy for summer and i modified the front to fit like a ""twisted"" halter."
3.0,I like the shirt.  I just wish the pattern on the sleeves was symmetrical.  The pattern is off and it kind of bugs me but I still like it and it is comfortable.
3.0,the little ones are super little and they are shinier than I thought but I kept them. I do wear the larger sizes.
3.0,It’s ok. The peplum sticks out a bit on the profile and it looks a bit unflattering. The concept is cute but the execution isn’t.
3.0,"Cool glasses. Very fragile, easy to break"
3.0,"I enjoy wearing this as an accessory that is non-committal to my outfit, something light and fun and the infinity symbol means something to me, but don't pull on the ends too tightly.. my ball came loose after wearing it for about a week."
3.0,They are small considering I ordered 8 when I am usually a 7.5. My toes are a bit scrunched.
3.0,"These are really cute, but REALLY uncomfortable and gave me terrible blisters on my toes after a night out. okay for a night out here and there. I'd suggest ordering for an occasion since they're a good price."
3.0,This dress is very thin. It seems like it might snag easily. I got it on sale so I will probably keep it but it is much thinner than I would have hoped.
3.0,Thought 1 piece. Fits larger should have went size smaller.
3.0,"This was nice, but the loops for the sash (to tie it at the waist) are too low. I bought many of these and everyone agreed. You couldn't tie it at the waist, only at your hips."
3.0,They are thin and cheaply made but... they were inexpensive so I got what I paid for. The black shorts were true to size. Both pair are marked Large but  the blue pair  are quite a bit smaller.
3.0,"The quality is okay nothing too fancy, the adjustability feels like a cheap feature but it works as expected."
3.0,Used for a Mexican vacation. Donated to goodwill
3.0,"This bra did not fit me right, I think the sizing is slightly off towards the large size, and I am large, like a F-cup large.  I think this is a great bra to have as an extra"
3.0,It was a little too small. Should have ordered one size up.
3.0,The shoes are adorable but they wear very easily.  The toe of the shoes are already worn after use and the Velcro is not as strongly made to stay secure!  But the shoe is adorable!
3.0,Very heavy purse but looks nice and has a lot of room
3.0,Great material..but they are so tight on my hands and on my arms an I'm not a big person! They are meant for petite ladies!
3.0,"This is one of the first Arcteryx products that I am not rating 5 star. In 2020 most higher end shorts have some stretch to them. Who would think that a $100 pair of shorts doesn't? It is like buying a dress shirt in this decade that isn't wrinkle free.<br /><br />Anyway they look nice, typical build quality but the lack of stretch fabric is a major let down. If you have muscular legs (yes some men actually train legs) then these will not work for you for any outdoor activities. There is no way I could scale a large rock without blowing them out. By comparison I have a pair that looks similar by another company and they fit the same but are way more comfortable due to the 4 way stretch."
3.0,These are what I expected. Ordered 2 pairs. 3 gloves worked and one glove had a dead battery. Batteries were available at the drug store so not a big deal. Just another $5 a<br />and a run to the store.
3.0,"A little smaller than what I was expecting but they are still good, and hurt just slightly when you first put on but then after a few minutes after your ears get use to having them on they're fine"
3.0,"Fits well on 5'10"" son who is well built (runs, lifts weights, swims, and teaches swim lessons for a job) and very thin, expect there is a huge poof in the bicep area. He's concerned he's going to be cold while diving with such a large space in the arm. Came very close to returning this."
3.0,The underwear is pretty good quality but mine came with a big hole in the lace on the front.
3.0,"Opening is a bit tight to use as a computer bag, and it also makes it hard to find the contents."
3.0,"Used these to substitute as a corset liner. Was looking for something close to an open bust, light compression. While I did get that out of this odd shape, I wouldn't recommend as a full body shapewear. The bust is to big for the body, and the bottom elastic band too small for the body. And the middle while light in compression, you just want more in the areas its too light in and less where it's firmer. If you're narrow in hips, lack muffin top or don't have hip dips to accentuate and fully busted you'll probably have better luck. I can still use these but I'll be looking else where next. At least I got them on special!"
3.0,"Loved the print!! It was TOOOOOOO small. Def not the size described. I was able to gift it, so it worked out."
3.0,Loved it for the look and price but one of the metal grommets broke after much use.
3.0,"I found the material to be very thin and the dress small. I am 5'10&#34; and about 140 and usually always wear a medium of some sort. This was too small in the rib cage (and I am only a 34B bust). I would buy it in a larger size because it is perfect for our corn roast with a yellow pettiskirt under it, but I wouldn't put it up there with my other 50's dresses that I love!"
3.0,"My only problem with this is the length. I thought it would fit below my hips. But it fit right above my knees. More like a dress than a tunic. And I'm 5'10""."
3.0,"Fast delivery and excellent quality of material, it was just way too small. It said XXL and it fit like a XL. The bottoms were a XXL but the top defenitely was not. The refund process was quick and easy though! Ordered a XXXL hopefully that will fit well."
3.0,Looked more like a bathrobe. Love this style of the dress not what I was looking for.
3.0,"The quality is average but it's definitely cute. Love the color combo. I purchased size S, fits well."
3.0,En la foto se ve mas pequeño
3.0,got this for my little sister thinking it was a pair of earrings. note to self: read more closely. cute but VERY small and its singular
3.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 115 lbs, 35.5 bust. I got the small and it fit perfectly. The sleeves are long enough which is GREAT, many shirts skimp on the sleeve length. I love the unfinished hem and sleeves, but the unfinished neck did not work for me, so sent it back"
3.0,The reason I rated with three stars is because this thing is tiny. I am c cup and this thing didnt fit. I gave to a friend who is a cup and it fit perfectly. But it is pretty and kind of good quality.
3.0,The face has writing on it that isn't attractive that wasn't in the picture. The blue hands look better in the picture than in person. And I guess we will see if it lasts at all also.
3.0,"The pants run small, because the top is over sized it fit ok."
3.0,"The bag is very cute and definitely made of a sturdy canvas. This was supposed to be a gift though for Mother’s Day and to replace a grocery bag, but it’s nowhere near the size images shown. The pictures show a full-sized bag, but it’s about half that size. No actual shopping, baby stuff (beyond a tiny toy, one or two diapers and some wipes - basically a small outing for a few hours not many), or a few hours out are possible with this. Unless you are taking a tiny tablet - a laptop won’t fit with cords etc. so it’s not truly practical overall. I think it’s a sweet concept, but not worth it as a whole (since it’s not practical) more as a nostalgic gift. The 3-star review is due to the false advertising in the images *They do post a size in print, but it by no means matches the pictures shown which genuinely comes across deceptive. I would have still potentially purchased this bag, but for far different purposes and a different style possibly if I’d been aware of just how small it would be."
3.0,These pants like to pill especially the white star ones. My daughter still loves the pants so I guess the pilling annoys me more than her.
3.0,These boots are just ok. They really dont fit well and they now are just in the back of the closet!
3.0,Has a bad smell even after washing it.  I wore it one time and it looked fine.  I just can't get past the smell!!
3.0,"I brought two pairs of these specs for my sister and me for surfing purpose. They are light and did not fog up. I enjoyed wearing it while surfing, however, noticed that the lenses were not secured and had to secured it constantly to make sure they stayed in the frame. When my sister had a big wave, both lenses were taken away and only the frame remained. The glasses did float as advertised but strong waves could have prevented them from floating up (lost mine on first day surfing). Overall good bang for the buck if you remember to secure those lenses."
3.0,This is nice. However the top is not as great as expected. The pasties are very thin...so that takes away a little from the quality. Over all cute and as pictured.
3.0,I love the pattern and the material of the pattern. It is revealing just a button and a tie back. Lower rating because the button fell off already. Really bummed about that because I really really like the shirt. I got a lot of compliments. Just wish it had held up a bit better.
3.0,"The colors are nice, the medium was small and doesn't fit. Very thin knit."
3.0,Cute but Uncomfortable
3.0,I liked this product when I got it but it doesn't come with a replacement needle. Very cheap so I gues if you bend the needle not to much money to replace
3.0,"very pretty put the arms are so small fits very very tight,  everywhere else was perfect fit"
3.0,"Pros - I do like the durability of the elastic.  Much better than previous shirt stays.  My problem is with the clasps.  Although they seem substantial, the clasps in the back tend to release if you sit on something hard without any cushioning.  The front clasps hold since they are not exposed to any sitting situations."
3.0,It does run a bit small....get 1 size bigger
3.0,A lot smaller than expected for the price
3.0,It does not look like the pic but it is honest and its totally gatsby style all the way
3.0,I ordered this way to big. My own fault.
3.0,"length is shorter than expected...pockets make you seem hippy even if you have none! The rise was on the short side. The fabric is ok, not loving the fit."
3.0,"The fit of the shirt is great, however, its cut short,  wish it wasva little longer cuz its such a nice shirt"
3.0,"I just didn't like the fit around the neck. The quality was decent enough, but I like my t-shirts to be a bit more snug around the neck than this one was."
3.0,"A little too large, but maybe they’ll shrink"
3.0,"No matter the dial window or band width is a little more bigger for Asian ladies, would suggest to buy a nother small model with similar design."
3.0,Very pretty but flimsy. Was disappointed in extremely  light color of the aquamarine stones. Thought they would have a deeper aquamarine tone. The chain has very tiny links and it is difficult to fasten the claw clasp into the very very tiny jump ring or extended link. I will have to make modifications to wear this. Add a larger silver jump ring once I determine appropriate length.  Bit pricey for quality. Very tiny moons. Almost need a magnifying glass to see the star element. Thinking about returning because of cost vs. Value.
3.0,The material is really thin and the pants become see-through in the light.
3.0,Like wearing a towel. Doesn't look nice.
3.0,The fit is a little strange. Major sagging in the front but it is comfy
3.0,"I felt this purse is a very natural color of red.  It looks like a very high quality looking purse which was nice since I bought it for a friend as a gift.  But it took forever to get it, I was a month past her birthday before I ever received it and I ordered it two weeks before her birthday."
3.0,"Overall I like the bag, but the lining is very poor quality. One of the lining zippers was broken when I received it and tore away from the lining soon after. Other than that I like the size and all the pockets and I will continue to use the bag for the near future."
3.0,"The vest is decent quality and I don't have any complaints except that the sizing seems misleading - it's described as being in Asian sizes (Asian L = U.S. M, etc) so I bought one size up and it was quite a bit too large, so buy your own size or smaller."
3.0,"I wouldn’t buy it again , it’s too thin for snow"
3.0,"They just weren't long enough.... Nothing wrong with the product, well, I guess idk because I couldn't use them."
3.0,"I was so excited when I tried on the pick half zip - the quality of the stitching and material and the dye is 5 stars. The length and sleeves fit perfectly upon arrival. BUT after one wash on COLD, the sweatshirt shrunk horribly ... the sleeves and length shrunk by about three inches and the width by about one inch.... I ordered a size Medium and I’m 5’7” and 140 lbs. BUMMER"
3.0,Looks pretty good but it took like almost a month to arrive.
3.0,"These jeggings look great. Nice dark blue with a twill-look weave, but started pilling after first washing. I still wear them and probably will for another month or so, but they will loose their Jean look pretty soon. No Nonsence denim leggings are not quite as spot on with the weave, but they look great regardless and do not pill. These ones also stretch A LOT. I got the XL, but actually think I could stand to do the L. I am a solid size 18 and very curvy. They are fine the first time, but after that, they are a bit loose. I got both these and the No Nonsense ones at the same time and the NNs still look the same as when I bought them, fit more snugly, and breath better. They are available on Amazon or at the evil Walmart."
3.0,"Liked it lots and lots, til it shrunk in the wash! I was wearing it nearly every day, and now it's a going-out only dress, because the hemline shrunk up so short. Black color has stayed dark, and bodice still fits comfortably."
3.0,Looks like a strong product but you need to make them 50&#34; if you want to sell in America.
3.0,"Arms were too small for the sizing... the body of it fit well.  Even though it is stretchy material and could have perhaps stretched over time, I elected to return it."
3.0,The earing comes loose and I have to be checking that it hasn't fallen. To heavy for the earring backing. But very good quality and very nice.
3.0,Can't even read what the heart says.
3.0,the first moth I had this it broke so I ended up making in to a necklace :3 just not for heavy use.
3.0,Very thin and had to tapper in to fit
3.0,I love dragonflies and thus I ordered this charm. The dragonfly is so small you can hardly tell what it is. I love the design of the dragonfly I just wish it was larger.
3.0,Very thin and way too small. I'm 115 lbs and a medium still didn't fit. You can see thru this whole dress.
3.0,These earrings are OK but color of each piece was not a great match to the other.  Price was good though.
3.0,"It has no anti-slip element,necessary for driving."
3.0,"The material is soft and stretchy.<br /><br />1. The plastic snaps for the onsie have me concerned, they seem super cheap and likely won't last long.<br /><br />2. The pants are crazy long. not an issue for me, I can roll the pants legs and she will be fine."
3.0,Nice purse lots of pockets but too small I couldn't fit my B&N Nook inside. I gave this bag to my sister she loved it.
3.0,They are alot smaller than they looked in the photos.
3.0,"Fits well and is very comfortable but material is very thin, can easily see thru it when stretched so not recommended without a long top or use in the gym, also attracts a lot of lint"
3.0,"I always pick the pants/shorts that don’t have the waist sewn in. Washed these once and it all got wrapped up in the waist. Other than that, these are great."
3.0,"I don't know about the fit yet, but it appears to be be a really nice shirt!"
3.0,But it's doesn't look the way in the picture
3.0,"My wife: This dressed served its purpose, wore it a few times, very comfortable. Beautiful flowers and colors and lots of compliments. However i had to take it in myself on the sides (it fit up top, but was very wide and shapeless on the sides). I was able to keep the pockets so yay! The fabric is cheap, started pilling at the chest during the first wear. Overall good but cheap."
3.0,"I am not too thrilled with this dress. I got a black one in Medium, for reference I am 5'5' and 139 lbs. The material is thick but not thick enough to hide imperfections like belly fat and sides.<br />I wore it once with top control sheer tights and was still very uncomfortable with how it looked around my mid section."
3.0,Very thin..not how it looks
3.0,"It was so small, you couldn't tell what the letter was. Seller gave me a refund quickly, tho."
3.0,"It was comfortable, lightweight and breathable. I did not find it to be XL. It was slightly larger than the typical average mask."
3.0,"This strap is well made, is extremely comfortable. There's no doubt it would a joy to wear for a full night. I'm 6'1"" and play a Strat. If I hold the guitar neck horizontal, I like to wear it at about belt level. This strap is not adjustable any higher than about crotch height, even at its shortest length. I am considering cutting the heavy nylon rear strap, removing about 12"" and re-sewing the strap. Normally wouldn't consider this, but it's a great strap otherwise."
3.0,"She just started walking. I needed a shoe quickly for a dressy occasion. This shoe certainly worked for one day. The bottom got ripped from walking on concrete and pavement. Notice the rubber part of the shoe doesn't have any markings. The cheap vinyl that surrounds the rubber doesn't hold up. If she doesn't go outside, this shoe will work for you. We went with a size 5 and I'm glad I did. She is a size 4 but her foot is very thick. The velcro strap would not have fit in a smaller size."
3.0,24 &#34; is a little bigger than I like. I think 23&#34; or 22&#34; would be better. That was my selection though because I wanted to install a pendant on it.<br />The chain itself came in .time. The quality of the links is not very good. There is a gap in them.<br />I have to look at my silver chain to compare this. It is a figaro chain and stainless steel. Comes in a neat little bag and well packaged. 7mm is still big for a pendant to be installed I think. The shine isn't bad. A little darker than silver but still shiny. The chain is kind of heavy on and feels cold like at first. One thing about a 24&#34; is you can pull it up and look at it if you did place a pendant. It is long enough to look at but comes to the upper part of my breast bone. Kind of mangled in the chest hair sort of. Outside your shirt doesn't look too bad. I have mixed opinions about it.
3.0,Almost too thick
3.0,Purchased for my husband. The green color is not what it looks like online. It looks more of a dark grey with a little hint of green.
3.0,"You can read a newspaper through this pretty nightgown.  Wish it weren't so, as it's a very pretty gown with pockets!"
3.0,"This is much bigger than expected and is not very feminine at all, even with all of the feminine detail.  I would not buy this product again!"
3.0,"My son is happy with his vest, but the sizing is way off.  I measured him, and ordered a size above, and it is still very snug."
3.0,Pretty but to small for one size
3.0,It broke with in 2 days
3.0,"Kinda frumpy fit, ended up sending it back"
3.0,doesn't fit or look like I thought it would
3.0,Good for the value at first but starting to show signs of wear and material thinning out already
3.0,"The design is really cool, however it was pretty small. I got a size larger than my usual size and it still was small. I'm 5ft 7in and 115lbs, a sized medium fits me fine."
3.0,Bought this dress for my baby girl. She wanted a green dress like Princess Tiana to play in and this fit the bill. It’s good for one day event or for the child to play in. It’s not the best quality but it’s so pretty
3.0,One was damaged but the other two were great
3.0,This is really cute and comfortable !! I ordered the XS but unfortunately is too loose on me. I’d say they run a little off on size based on my experience. I would definitely purchase again if I there was a smaller size.
3.0,"Nice color, but a little small."
3.0,"Runs small. I am between a size 0-2 and I ordered a medium because I am 32D up top.<br />It does look very flattering but is made relatively cheap, as the liner rolls out and shows as you can see in my pictures.<br />With that being said, I love it when I’m dry and standing up. When wet it seems to not look as nice."
3.0,Flat mount doesn't lay flat but instead tilts and dents furniture.
3.0,I needed sleeves for a dress and this did the trick.  It is a thin material.  It fit as expected.  If suited the purpose I bought it for.
3.0,These are really cute and fun. I purchased these to go with a mermaid shirt for my daughters birthday. Problem is she was playing with new toys (she’s 8) so the knees completely rubbed off and are black. The quality isn’t that great .
3.0,too big and hard to reshape
3.0,Color is the same as the product. Fabric can be better.
3.0,"I bought a small and while I know it’s oversized, it is ridiculously oversized lol. It goes down to the tops of my thighs like a dress. Also the lighter color in the photo is not the same as what I received. It was straight up gray."
3.0,Definitely not Maui Jim you get what you pay for
3.0,"I bought it for me, but the XL, was definitely much bigger than average, so I gave it someone it would fit better.  They said ""I don't like the way it looks on me, but OMG is it comfortable!"", and they'll be wearing it a lot lol. So, in the end it worked out.  Just not for me."
3.0,The fabric is kind of cheap and the feet are really big but I guess that's what you get for the price paid.
3.0,"Who dirtied up this poloroid? What graphics designer thought that would be a cool image? Yuck. Also the image is a little busy, I find most people don't notice much past vader and the storm troopers."
3.0,Ring nice but for very small fingers
3.0,"Love the colors. This is my second Moxie jersey and I find that the back pockets are very narrow, making it difficult to reach into as you are biking. The jersey was very long (I'm 5'2&#34;) and the bottom reaches almost mid thigh; hence it doesn't provide a smooth fit."
3.0,I do love it but unfortunately it did not fit. This just too small for a large. But I decided not to return as I’m hoping I may loose some weight somehow. It’s just the texture and the materials is really good and even the style. Will just keep it.
3.0,Ran small not really for an adult.
3.0,"Not the worst,but I returned it cuz it was just a bit too small and i ordered the biggest size."
3.0,"I ordered this belt a few days ago. It come in and i thought &#34;Man this is a nice look package it shipped in&#34; I put the bet on the next day and went to work. Throughout the day it kept coming loose a few notches. I would just adjust it with a pull. Then more and more. I am not a big man I am 5'9'' 175 lbs with a 33'' waist . I wore it 2 days and when i took it off , It has a bow in it like some of the other reviews says . After two days. I did buy another brand like this belt and i have not had any issues with it. I really like the way it looks on . I think the belt could be thicker ."
3.0,"They slide off my nose, like they are too heavy or too loose."
3.0,see the headline. I messed up. But that is the point I wanted to make.
3.0,Cool jeans but not as skinny as the picture is showing
3.0,"Super cute in the photos, not as much on. Definitely runs a bit big if you’re looking for a fitted look, I got an XS and its wearable… just not what I expected.<br />Super cute pattern though!"
3.0,Yes we received it. In this season of giving asking for a review one or 2 days after receipt is beyond what can be answered. So – this is a gift – since it was on a wish list We’ll assume the receiver will be pleased.
3.0,"I am typically a small, but ordered up to a medium. It fits, but awkwardly and is almost too tight in some spots and too big in others. The leather was surprisingly softer than I expected for the cost. I don't think it will last very long though, which I wouldn't expect for the price."
3.0,It’s made well just too big and bulky for my taste
3.0,This keychain is well made. It was a bit smaller than expected. It is beautiful!
3.0,fun compression sock but out of three nurse mates styles this and the striped on are short. Now admittedly it maybe because I have large calves? But the third pair are long enough so I cant figure it out. The compression part is great and my legs feel great at the end of the work day its just the length. The only pair that are long enought are the ekg pattern.
3.0,"Not worthy as a shield at all, however makes a great skid plat for 4x4"
3.0,"Cute slippers and great fit. Stitching along the sides popped within the first wear, but they are comfortable."
3.0,Fits as expected. I'm 5'9 and usually a size 4. I ordered a small. Only 3 stars because the fabric is thin and see-through. It will be OK for summer over a swimsuit.
3.0,Cheap look and feel. Disappointed.
3.0,Definitely not wide calf.  I can't wear these at all.  Seem cute.
3.0,"Not the color expected, more of an off white blonde color in stone as I expected"
3.0,it's a cute suit! Fits as expected. the bottoms were a little higher on my hips than expected but the suit is cute.
3.0,"Nice design, but defective."
3.0,"Seemed like very nice soft fabric, and the actual waistband was about right, but strangely tight around the hips.  I've returned this to try a slightly different style."
3.0,Larger than expected and material is not to my liking.
3.0,Didn’t really block the sun and for night driving it stopped glare but vision was not sharp
3.0,These are a cheap version of spanks with pockets nothing like it looks in picture ok to sleep in tho
3.0,Color is dull blue and not bright like picture.
3.0,I've had better
3.0,Satisfied with earrings. Hangs right and looks nice.
3.0,"I’m used to wearing compression socks, but these were CRAZY tight. I could feel my blood pumping, which is good since that helped with the health issue I wear compression socks for. But by the end of my 12 hour workday on my feet, my calves were swollen when I took my boots and socks off. It was painful. Won’t be wearing those again. (For reference, I’m an average sized woman with average size legs, so I feel like these shouldn’t have been THAT tight on me.)"
3.0,Whenever I finally received the order after getting sent the wrong item the first time I received just the top. It's fine I have black bottoms that will go with it but the ad wasn't very clear that it was just the top. Cute nonetheless I will definitely be keeping it
3.0,"In the beginning, I order 8-10 for my 6 years old girl. I thought it was way enough for her age and size. However, we end up buying 10-12. The size is not accurate which causes some logistic problems."
3.0,It fit really large. wish there were size options
3.0,"This is pretty, but the picture makes it look like a full and long scarf. It is not full. It will not cover your chest. It is more of a small accent...like a necklace."
3.0,I liked the dress. But returned it because one of the straps was sewn the wrong way.
3.0,"I love the sheer lace face masks. This one is poorly designed. More for a child under 10 years old. The ear loops are itty bitty, And came un-sewn in just 2 days of wearing it. It could be better."
3.0,I used the sizing guide...even whipped out a measuring tape...it was still too big. Also the pattern wasn’t as flattering as I had hoped. Sadly I had to return it. Although it did seem well made.
3.0,The pearls were what I expected for the price. The pearls were more irregular than I had hoped but again what I should have expected. If you want an everyday type pearl necklace this is it. If you want fine jewelry you will need to pay more.
3.0,I'm pleased except the first trip we took the duffle bag already has a little hole in it. Hope the rest of the bags hold up a lot better.
3.0,Love the feel and the softness. The pockets are just so far apart. I feel like I’ve got my hands in my back pockets
3.0,"The shirt was so cute. The fit was great in the body, but the sleeves were so short."
3.0,Love the texture. Very light weight.<br /><br />However too tight in the crotch as another reviewer said.
3.0,Not very good quality. They don't fit well for the kids.
3.0,Very comfy and comfortable to wear but they ripped like the first day and I don’t even know why lol. Otherwise I love the fit of these and will probably order another pair when it gets hotter out
3.0,"I bought these in black suede because I thought they would stay looking clean. They are the opposite. Every dust particle, kitchen crumb, and what-have-you sticks to these things. I thought I could just brush it off with my hand but noooo. I took a wet cloth to them to try and get the particles off which worked, for a few days. They gather everything. I mean everrrryyythinggg. They're also a bit too warm. I usually wear socks with them just so my feet don't sweat profusely in the fake fur."
3.0,"Cute. Cheap. With that said, you get what you pay for with these earrings. Earrings do not stay screwed. Not interested in DIY gluing and etc. Wouldn't buy them again but for the price point definitely not mad at 'em."
3.0,"yeah, too small really."
3.0,"I wear a size US 9, and ordered a L.  With the strings knotted at the end, instead of tied in a bow, to allow the suit sides to open more, it just barely fits, still muffining some.  Good quality, cute, and shipped right away though."
3.0,Ordered a 4t for my daughter that wears a 2t based on other reviews. Worked out perfectly. Order 2 sizes up and it should fit fine. Otherwise quality is great and very cute.
3.0,At first I loved it.  I have not had it long maybe 6 months and it is already falling apart.
3.0,It is a great watch--BUT--the wrist band doesn't hold up.  The buckle has parted on two of them.
3.0,"I ordered this for a sibling and it fit well around the band but the shoulder straps kept falling. The padded inserts could be bigger and they slide around the inside of the cup.  otherwise the fabric is soft, wears comfortable so stated."
3.0,This was cute but the chain is very thin and short which would not be too big of deal if the pendant itself were not so small. You literally cannot switch chains. Not only would you have to break the one it came with but the loops are too small to fit onto another chain. I returned mine :/
3.0,Got it for a Halloween costume. Fits as expected. Was a little too short for my liking. My booty would show with certain movements. Not a lot of material either... Suggest wearing spandex’s
3.0,I like this bag. It's cute and has a lot of interior pockets which is great so your purse doesn't get the &#34;black hole&#34; effect. The only two things that I don't love about it are 1. I've only had it for a week and it is already collecting dirt. Which I understand considering the price it can be expected. 2. The shape isn't perfect. I'm not sure if it's how it was packaged before shipped and got squished but currently I am trying to get the irregular creases to go away.<br />Overall a nice looking functional bag but quality reflects the price.
3.0,"Although they are beautiful socks via design, they are very tight on the calves, for men. I ended up keeping them for myself cause my husband couldn't get the socks past his ankles. Got the appropriate size for him as well, so they are way too tight."
3.0,The material is thin so it's a little set through. So if you don't mind that then you're good.
3.0,"Ordered a small, looks like I'm living in it. Money wasted."
3.0,The arm was very small end up giving it out
3.0,they are adorable!  a little thinner than I thought.
3.0,"They are pretty, but the clasp is difficult. You have to thread the part that goes through your ear into the hoop on the other side. It's tricky. And if you accidentally run your fingers through your hair, you can pull it out easily. But they are nice. My husband loves them on me."
3.0,"Bought for my husband when he got snowbound from plowing snow in intense sun without polarized sunglasses. He really likes them, especially the changing lightness and darkness of the lenses. I gave them three stars as, on our budget, they are expensive. The earpieces started peeling, losing the black paint that's on them, within 6 weeks. He had to put electrical tape on both sides! Ridiculous! They're scratching now, he's had them about 4 months."
3.0,Coarse material. Wrinkled.
3.0,"pants were too short,"
3.0,"The quality of these is good, and the packaging and extra components (case, fabric bag, cleaning cloth) are really nice, but these are way too big for me. And I do not have a small head! They open at a set position and just won't sit behind my ears. Since I don't move around much while driving I guess I can make them work, but I'll probably just get a different pair down the road."
3.0,It’s a nice bracelet and well made but the leather is very thin and looks like a plastic wire. Not sure if the price tag matches.
3.0,Way too big. I'm 5'6 and 115lbs and 34C.I ordered a small and it's so big in the bust I can't wear it ☹️
3.0,It is like an extra latge. Cute though.
3.0,"I get lots of compliments on these. The only complaint is that the bevel is already tarnishing on them, and I haven't even had them a month."
3.0,I bought these for my granddaughter.  They look like toddler underwear though in back.  They will need to be worn with a long tunic or long dress.
3.0,"Nice product, ran small"
3.0,"I chose the set of sports bras because it came with this cute pink color, but they aren’t pink AT ALL. They are definitely more of a peach color and no shade of pink in the slightest. It’s a completely different color. I was pretty disappointed. The fabric used is definitely a high-quality and I really like the support yet lightness without a wire, but I really didn’t care for the cut going longer in the front and higher on the sides. Each set of colors has a different cut, so make sure you pay attention to that.  They are NOT all the same, just in different colors.  I’m sure if I lost about 10 to 15 pounds maybe it wouldn’t bother me as much, but it rolls up over my stomach so if you don’t have a complete flat stomach, it may do the same to you. Overall I really like the quality of the sports bra, just not the color, or cut."
3.0,This is my first attempt to use liver of sulfer. I am not happy that the instructions do not allow for measurements for small quantities. I had to guess and go. I bought powder form in hopes it will be long lived.
3.0,Very cute boots but had to send back because they were too small.
3.0,I bought these to use under black light for a children's program.  Nope.  They didn't work.  Used them for other activities.  They're just OK.  Not very fitted.
3.0,Dress itself seemed cute if it had fit. Seems to run quite small. The green color was a beautiful emerald. I got a large I think and I'm an 8 right now. Tight around skirt.
3.0,"Disappointed these are slightly thinner and smaller than what I already use for elderly parent, but it works and the tread is fine. Would not buy again unless in a pinch. And his foot is just normal size, it fits him but if he was fat and had a fat foot then it would not fit or maybe fot but be stretched out."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5d301a94de3c5c06014108dd8bd0950d]] I have been looking for a comfortable lounge set that I can throw on when I go shopping or to even lounge around the house. I was excited to receive this particular outfit however I quickly realized that I could only wear it in the house. I ordered a size Large due to the reviews but I don’t think the reviews regarding size accurate. Unfortunately, the lounge set is really unflattering and I think it would only look good on tall, skinny girls. I’m 5’3 and am more on the curvy side so it makes me look bigger than I am. Also the pants are really long so even with boots with heels, it drags on the floor.<br />There are some definite pros to this set. It is super comfortable and not confining at all. The color that I ordered, brown, is a nice toasted brown color. The material is soft against the skin which is really good.<br />I will definitely only wear this in the house, as I wouldn’t feel good wearing it outside.<br />-<br />*Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps make your decision easier*"
3.0,"I actually really liked the dress and didn't mind the material...it's clearly cheap material but it's light weight and doesn't seem too fake. The only issue is there needs to be an xsmall option. I'm 5'1&#34; 100lbs and the length is perfect but it's too large around the body. There is elastic in the lower back above where the bow ties and it is loose when putting it on, so when the dress is tied it makes the elastic part bunch together and hang off my back. Also makes the butt area look like it has a bunch of air in the area like a balloon. Really wish this worked because the cut of the top and the color are great :("
3.0,Not great. The key doesn’t actually fit into the heard properly.
3.0,I liked this product as I saw it online. I was going for a more conservative dress for a specific evening but that still had some sex appeal even though there was more fabric. Definitely didn't look the same on me as I am shorter. Cut me in a weird spot on the calf and looked like it was meant for a much older person. Fabric also wasn't as high of a quality as I was expecting. Also in the picture there are earrings - are they supposed to come with those? If so it did not.
3.0,"Cup size was right, length was off by two inches....bought 9 different bras, this was the only one that didn’t fit. Beautiful bra, order a size up."
3.0,Wish it was a little looser and less see-through.  Love the brand and great quality though.
3.0,"Too big for a newborn, good size for a 6 month old"
3.0,"Theses are just those cheap gloves you buy for kids or adults that are fine but not all that warm for long. The kind that used to cost just a dollar. The picture and description are deceiving. Oh well, I needed these type too."
3.0,"Overall decent strapless backless bra.  The adhesiveness will not last forever but it is of decent quality.  There is no padding to the bra but it is thick material.  The color of the bra was darker than my skin tone which doesn't normally happen- it was a little more visable under a sheer top than some of the other backless bras I own.  For reference, I have very fair skin.  I recieved this product at a discount for providing my honest feedback.  The opinions above are my own true honest thoughts about this backless strapless bra."
3.0,This product does make you sweat but it is not good quality; the rubber separated from the fabric. You get what you pay for. This is not a waist trainer.
3.0,"These worked great the 1st hour or so of wear, but as the day went on, my shoe heel started to come through the bottom. They are made of a tougher plastic that stretches, but doesn't fit a lot of heels. I bought these for 8 bridesmaids and my shoes were the only one they fit."
3.0,"I'm not sure why these earrings are billed as hearts because mine are simply two small hoops joined together. The earrings are very cute and extremely lightweight. They don't stand out very well on my ears and I'm finding them hard to put in because the posts are so small, soft and bendable. I'm not sure how much use I'll greet from this pair -- I like costume jewelry earrings to be super easy to put on and these are not."
3.0,"I was looking for a plain, simple silver or stainless steel cross and this one is nice.  Like the other person who reviewed it, I was surprised it is in two pieces.  The outer piece constantly became dislodged and tangled with the solid inner piece.  It broke and fell off but honestly, it's better now that only the single inner piece remains.  I bought the 24"" chain for it and I am happy with the look and feel of the cross pendant/necklace combo."
3.0,"There's a sucker born every December, and that might be me.  I'll use it in the summer for summer related reasons (Texas) but not for it's intended purpose.  I would recommend taking the &#34;vest&#34; to a tailor and getting the sewing reinforced too (seriously).  The shoulder strap stitching popped on me."
3.0,"I was looking forward to using this product because I was gifted a number of old coins from a friend, and wanted to clean them up. This product works fast, so be careful to not let your coin sit in chemicals for more than 5- 10 seconds.  It seemed to work best on silver and gold. On copper and bronze coins it turns the copper an ugly pinkish color and bronze a pail amber color. Even on silver and some gold coins I noticed that cleaned coins tarnished if left in tap water rinse bath. I found that after dipping in the solution again, rinsing, and quickly drying off solved that problem. Perhaps this would not have happened had I used de-ionized water?  I found that rubbing coins with Never-Dull produced a much better and authentic result. It's a lot more work if you have a lot of coins to clean, but you won't ruin your collectable coins. DO NOT USE ON COPPER. IT RUINS COPPER!!!!!!!"
3.0,Quality was good. Fit wasn't.
3.0,Dress was beautiful but the color was lighter than expected .
3.0,No instructions on how to change the date?
3.0,"I put tickets to a show in the wallet for a Christmas present for my husband.  Unfortunately, looking at the picture, I did not realize it was so flat and did not have a snap or some kind of closure.  I will probably need to get a roomier one for him."
3.0,dust under the glass!
3.0,"The pants feel nice enough, but there is a massive hole in the inner thigh after only about 3 washes. Very disappointed with the low quality of these pants, especially after reading such great reviews."
3.0,Nice light frames the only thing is they are very<br />Wobbly on the face and lens are small
3.0,The quality of this bracelet is not very good and the snap is very loose. It gets open all the time.
3.0,"Not infant sized at all,  definitely sized for a toddler,"
3.0,Quedaron un poco grandes pero estoy acostumbrada a usarlos más pequeños
3.0,"The pockets are great. The fabric is thinner than other leggings I've purchased from this brand. The fabric is also weirdly soft/fuzzy feeling despite being thin---for me this makes them feel less suitable for athletic activities, and they are a hassle to put on if it's humid as they don't slide smoothly over skin. The way the fabric stretches makes them feel tight, so they aren't the best for athleisure either."
3.0,Fabric is very light and thin. Super soft but to wear everyday will be tricky with undergarments lines not showing. It's comfortable and stretchy and will be great for hot days at home but for work or going out I wish the fabric was thicker. Other than that it handled my larger bust and is a pretty color. Solid mid-grade summer dress
3.0,"This is a comfortable bra, but for a sports bra, it is not super supportive.  I cannot do high impact activities like running while wearing it.  I wear a D cup."
3.0,"I like this dress. It isn't a dress that I would rave about, but I do like it. I think it does a great job of helping accent the curves you may already have which is what I was looking for.  It is super comfortable, the fabric stretches tremendously, and the material is thin. When ordering your size keep in mind that if the fabric stretches a lot, the colors lighten and the overall look of the ovals changes.  I recommend this dress. If it helps you, I am about 5'0 190 lbs and ordered a L. Honestly a medium would have hit in the right places better due to my height and super short waist, but I wouldn't recommend ordering down a size due to the stretching/distortion of the fabric/pattern."
3.0,I think it would help others to know when ordering that the jeans run larger than other brands.
3.0,stays put but very uncomfortable behind the ear after wearing for over an hour
3.0,Very cute and comfy. Can be used as a cover up or dress
3.0,"Too long, not attractive. Am returning."
3.0,"The dress is cute my chest is just too large for it. I ordered a large which fit well everywhere except my bust (34DDD), which caused the dress to bunch up/ride up over my chest. I feel like if I went up to an extra large to accommodate my bust that the dress would just look like a sack. I saw some reviews saying the pattern looked pixelated, it seemed fine to me."
3.0,"It’s very stiff and idk , not soft and wrinkles really easy.<br /><br />Wouldn’t buy again.<br />Got an XL and it fits a bit weird but it’s ok I’ll wear it. Hopefully it softens up and shrinks a bit in the washer/dryer :("
3.0,definitely not for large chested women
3.0,Item arrived with a hole. They're waterproof to a point.
3.0,These shoes are beautiful they fit a little snug around the toes and they hard to walk in.
3.0,"this purse is really awkwardly large! Would make a nice designer type diaper bag, or over night bag."
3.0,I bought the shirt for compression as my bicep fell.  The arms have very little compression.
3.0,"I'm conflicted on these. The material is soft and stretchy, and fits as expected. But there's basically no padding inside, like with most beginning training bras. There IS a cotton lining, but it's very thin. More appropriate for, say, a 6 or 7 year old who is barely starting to show, vs an 8-10 year old who needs something definitely more modest and padded."
3.0,"I don't hate them (particularly for such a low price), nor do I love them. The quality seems ok; the pearls aren't going to detach from the posts anytime soon, and the silver is shiny. They did not irritate my skin. However, the posts are thick, which isn't a great choice for my thick ears, and after wearing them I think I prefer pearls without any visible attachment (i.e., a simpler style). If you like this style and the thick post won't be an issue for you, try them out."
3.0,"Fun bracelets for gift bags but some looked too cheap, so more of a birthday party grab bag gift!"
3.0,They slip down a bit when you workout. I'm constantly pulling them up.
3.0,Shoe is too narrow and the heels feel wobbly when walking in them.
3.0,Said that it would fit  as described and it didn't at all
3.0,"Love the material because it feels  good and breathes well. Unfortunately, one pair is already separating at the waistband. Good news is the other pairs are holding up well after a few months wear."
3.0,"These were ok, what was expected nothing special in my opinion. Nothing negative either. All depends on what you are using them for."
3.0,"I was not happy with the fabric and the measurement for the size is not correct. It wiuld have been nice if the fabric was true african fabric, make of cotton not spandex"
3.0,Tight with a much too busty cut!
3.0,I fit a large with a good amount  of room this fits like a small. I'm afraid that if I reach quickly I'll tear a hole in the back.
3.0,"They’re cute but too small. The lenses should be bigger, they fit but look off"
3.0,Looked great for the price but the cross broke off a week later
3.0,"The material was just okay and the fit was fine - all pretty much expected for the price, but I returned it because it was too short.  I'm 5'4&#34; and it was a few inches above my knee.  Even with dark tights I felt if I bent over at all it would be too much!"
3.0,"It’s an alright shirt, pretty cute. The material was not what I was expecting and it’s kind of itchy and hard."
3.0,The texture of the fabric and colour
3.0,Material was a little thin. Wasn't so flattering as it appears.
3.0,"It's beautiful. But it's way too heavy and bulky.  I really should send it back, but I have no printer and therefore I can't print down a package return slip<br /> Oh well,"
3.0,"I usually wear a men's medium (US Sizing) and knowing that it ran small I ordered a Large.  This comes out of China and is definitely Asian sizing.  the Large fits but an XL would have been much better,<br />~Thin material<br />~Runs Small"
3.0,"Yes ,as in previous reviews, these break very easily. But I took my pliers and tightened the ends so they wouldn't come apart. And that worked really well. I tested one and when it came apart, it gave me a chance to cut it to my size and then put it back together. But that part ,one needs to be careful or you'll destroy the end ring."
3.0,It's too big for my nose but works for my ear cartilage.
3.0,"A really nice dress for people with a smaller frame. My size is plus sized and I ordered in the largest size made. However, the dress doesn't fit properly in the bust area. It is rather tight up top but it fits fine everywhere else. The picture of the dress looks better than when I was wearing it, unfortunately. It doesn't really flare out at the bottom like I had hoped and really doesn't accentuate my figure, which isn't huge or funny shaped at all. The material is great quality, doesn't stretch. It is soft and feels durable to wear it won't rip easily. Overall, it is a great quality dress for smaller frames.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Pretty but runs a little small.
3.0,Its usable but just barely
3.0,Socks are good. Fit we'll. however they are very thin.
3.0,"I do love the side pockets on this. Looks like something to lounge around in. However, any drop of liquid including plain water stains this material."
3.0,The quality of the dress is nice.  Just not made for busty women and it was a little on the short side.
3.0,Not a bad shoe just could make the straps match and not look completely different
3.0,"It's beautiful, but it's too small.  I ordered a size larger.  Probably should have ordered two or three sizes larger."
3.0,"This is super cute and I loved it, but after wearing it for a little bit, my neck started itching. I've never had this issue with other plastic/fabric chokers. Hmm. :/"
3.0,Order larger.  Sleeves are tight
3.0,"T-shirt and pants fit nice, but the tank and shorts are super skimpy and not what I expected which was disappointing.  Out of a set of four I'll only be wearing two of the items.  If you don't like skimpy nightwear I would not recommend getting this set and purchasing something else to get the full value."
3.0,Its okay. Pretty sparkly
3.0,Guess you get what you pay for. The jacket looks nice but that's about it. It is not a true double breasted coat and a button fell of really soon after getting it...
3.0,"This top was a really nice material and I love the design, but it is really short. I got it about 2 sizes too big so it could be loose on me, and it was wide and short, only coming to just below my navel."
3.0,"I've had this for 4 years now. I'm amazed it lasted this long. Cleaning pewter is not my strong point, but it's as easy as cleaning silver."
3.0,"These are gorgeous and all the women at the dance studio ooh'd and ahhh'd over them, BUT the stones are also along the inside of the thigh as well as the entire panty area.  Why is it in the panty area???  During dancing, the stones got tangled together along the inside of my thighs and I had to rip them apart!  I actually had to forcibly rip my own hose to untangle the stones.  Are you kidding me right now???  We all know that hose is fragile anyway, never lasts that long, but having to purposefully ruin it to separate the stones from one another and get my legs apart?<br /><br />If you buy these, plan to wear it as in the posted pics with ripped up jeans or something so what happened to me WON'T happen to you!"
3.0,I didn't like how the flowers looked. They looked computer generated and not real. The dress itself was really comfortable and good quality. Not a fan of the pattern and how flowers looked.
3.0,Colors are washed out that's why the rating. The dress would have been great otherwise.
3.0,"My wife was disappointed in the color and that it didn't really look like real leather.  Returned it without problems, thus the 3 stars."
3.0,"The keychain is so cute, but I cannot use my key!! The bear comes down too low and the key doesn't go into the keyhole all the way."
3.0,"Beautiful shirts. HOWEVER, if you are muscular in the upper body you will next to order XXL or larger depending on your size. XL is VERY TIGHT and not comfortable if you have 20"" shoulders, 18"" or bigger arms, and a chest bigger than 48"""
3.0,"Different then pictured all around. Shorter and white is more of an off white or ivory. Thin and wrist portion of the sleeves are tight, no stretch."
3.0,Tighter than expected and had some issues the first few times snapping these together. It seems to be a little better now. Bought for my husband but I'll be wearing it now.
3.0,Great shorts but the size 34 was really too small.
3.0,These are Chinese sizes and can be tricky to order. I ordered an XL and typically wear a medium to large. This fits but has little spare room. Still I think it is cute and the price is great!
3.0,This is a velveteen material and a very bold rock pattern with lace at top and bottom.  It is not tunic length as shown.  It could be cute but the material and pattern give it a very cheap appearance.  Am keeping it to wear under sweaters but Woukd not dare to wear with just slacks.
3.0,"Cute, but runs smaller than I thought so the fit was off!"
3.0,It is pretty.  The color could be richer.
3.0,". I purchased these for my four year old in the adult size and they were okay! Super Cute but not all of<br />The stickers would hold up , you would definitely needs some sort of adhesive underneath. I didn’t bother as this was for Halloween and simply just threw them on her face! The nose sticker, and eyelashes stayed on her face the best."
3.0,The little piece in the middle pops out easily. Pointless to have it. Doesn’t change their effectiveness but kind of looks dumb.
3.0,They are very comfortable and fit well. I myself should have ordered a smaller size. Will do that at a later date. I washed them in warm water and put them in the dryer. Came out great.
3.0,"The band is fairly small, smaller than expected."
3.0,"It looks great, just like the picture! However, the clasp came stuck shut. Even once I pried it open it was difficult to put on."
3.0,"For an expensive pair of glasses, the quality is a bit disappointing.  One of the brand appliques has already fallen off and there is no way to put it back on.  While this does not affect the glasses per se, Vuarnet is not a cheap brand and this sort of thing should not happen."
3.0,"I love the Panache sport bras, so I had high hopes for this one.  I wear a 34E in the Panache underwire sport bras, which fit great.  Unfortunately, the cups of this bra run small and there was just too much plunge, so I spilled over the top,  I was sad to send it back - very cute bra and nice material, though."
3.0,"Bikini was very cute but I got a Large and it was still really small. I am 5'6&#34; and a 36D (sometimes DD, depending on brand) and I usually wear a 28 in pants. Being a genuine hourglass figure it is very hard to find things that fit and flatter (especially online). The hardest is swimsuits because a low rise bottom will hit right at the widest part of my body and make me look wide but a high rise bottom with no high cut thigh looks like a diaper. The bottom and top are both a little tighter than I'd like them to be. They are very cute! However, if you are my cup size and do not want under boob, this product is not for you. In order to not have my big boobs bubbling out of the top i have to position it so that the under boob peaks out (it more than peaks, its a solid kim kardashian amount of under boob).  The item came in a nice sealed packaging and the quality itself seems very nice upon first impression, especially for the price. I highly recommend this, just be careful about sizing. An XL would have fit me best and I am normally a S/M in american sizing"
3.0,Ends are sharp and itchy
3.0,Not sure how it works. Ordered a large...fits like a small...
3.0,"The shell is just fine - decent enough quality, etc., that I decided not to send it back even though the photo in the summary is not at all representative of the blouse that arrived.  The photo looks more navy/teal than the actual blouse which is a very greenish blue.  While 'teal' can be one person's greenish navy and another's greenish blue, the photo is surprisingly off."
3.0,"Its a nice suit, but on me, disappointingly not cheeky at all - I don't have a long torso. After about a month of wearing it to surf in pretty regularly, it stretched and is now baggy in the butt. Meh."
3.0,"The ""large"" Bakugo hoodie fits my 11yo (thin) daughter. She ordered it for a friend who weighs maybe 60lbs more than her and she's not going to even be able to fit into it. I'm 36 and it fits snugly on me. It's also the kind of fabric that shrinks when washed.<br />Do yourself a favor here."
3.0,Charm came off of white bracelet. Can I get a replacement charm?
3.0,Cute idea but the pants are very short on my small 4 year old boy. They are more like capris.  They shrank and did not meet my expectations.
3.0,Do not wear any material that can potentially snag on the jewelry
3.0,"Fabric is not as soft as I hoped. It's not really a cozy sweatshirt more like a rayon, shiny shirt."
3.0,I like the earrings but the cushion came off while I was wearing them and now they are impossible to wear until I can buy more cushions.
3.0,Nice skirt if you 6ft tall
3.0,The shipping took longer than expected
3.0,"It is a little large for my 9 1/2 size foot.  Other than that, seems good quality."
3.0,Jersey top fit ok except around my arms.<br />I have normal size biceps for a fella who's 5-11&#34; but the this jersey was borderline extremely tight around them.<br /><br />The bibs fit ok as well. Except that the seam at my thighs was stretched out. The fabric around my legs fit ok it was just the seam seemed as if it was stretched. And looked funny.<br /><br />I ordered a size up from what I would normally wear. I would suggest maybe two sizes up. But it will be a gamble either way.  Delivery was timely.<br /><br />For what you pay... I say meh!
3.0,I'm sure this works fine for most people but for some reason I don't really like wearing it.  I think it's just a personal preference.
3.0,The dress is a nice dress I must say however the top don’t look anything like the picture. The sizing is great I’m glad I didn’t buy a bigger size. I brought a size bigger than what I am and it was perfect. Not to happy though with the top cause it don’t look the way the picture says.
3.0,The water leaked in immediately
3.0,Not happy with colors  I thought large assorted set was ordered I have only 3
3.0,"I like this a lot. However, it's just not long enough to fit around my wrist.<br />If you are a big guy ..."
3.0,"SORRY I WASNT REALY IMPRESED WHITH THIS ITEM,IT CHEAP,BUT STILL NOT HAPPY WHITH IT,IN THE PICTURE IT SHOWS,LIKE A LINE,WHEN I PUT IT ON IT DIDNT HAVE THE FLAIR SHOWN IN THE PICTURE,IT WAS JUST WASNT RIGHT HAS SHOWN SORRY"
3.0,cute purse and looks just like the picture but the straps broke easily.
3.0,"The screw on one side of the lenses comes out all the time. Luckily, I have been able to find it every time but I'm kind of just waiting for the day that I can't. I really love these glasses other than that issue."
3.0,They’re ok.. one of the socks ripped the first time I wore it but I guess the design and material doesn’t help either..
3.0,"Well I bought these for the boyfriend, he loves them they are comfy and everything. Until I get a phone call that how on earth is he supposed to use the restroom unless he pulls them 100% down. I'd give a 5 star if that weren't the case."
3.0,"I like this suit and I still plan to wear it but the top is very short waisted and fits more comfortably at the belly button area. If you try to wear it like a traditional tankini top you’ll be pulling it down all day. At the same time, the bottoms roll down so you’ll be pulling them up all day. Almost makes you wish they were pinned together. 😂 Still a cute suit. Love the strappy back. It seems to minimize back fat."
3.0,"Bought these for fun, they're ok."
3.0,Had to return this one as I couldn't un-hitch it! Nice looking though.
3.0,I bought a large I'm 5'4 159lbs and it is big on me. But I do like it!
3.0,"It is very beautiful and elegant, however stinks very bad.. I have to spry many perfumes inside to take the smell away and still stinks, it is also very heavy with nothing in it and I am not sure if is real genuine Leather."
3.0,"They fit amazing, love the length!!! The only 2 things that are not my favorite is the pockets need to be longer (cell phone sticks out a little to far, feels like it might fall out at times) and the type of material makes a switching sound when you walk (legs touching at the top) … but other than that they are very nice 😁"
3.0,A bit flimsy it'll be a matter of time before one snaps
3.0,"It looked beautiful. However, I paid extra to get a long sleeve onesie and received a short sleeve one."
3.0,I am a size 8.5-9 and bout the small. They fit fine but tore a little on the first use. I don't think these will last long.
3.0,"They were the exact color I wanted but for them being for smaller kids it was a little big for my 8 yr old son, and way to big for my 2 yr old nephew. But still very cute."
3.0,"thin, but okay"
3.0,They were cute but didn't like the material
3.0,Cute shoes and fit but after walking in them for more than 20 minutes they are uncomfortable. They rub on your feet and will cause a blister is in them to long.
3.0,boot shaft is too wide :(
3.0,Necklace was fine but bracelet has thin elastic which broke immediately upon placing it on my wrist.
3.0,"This shirt took awhile to get here, but the seller was accommodating.  The size I ordered ran small-it was tight through the back of the sleeves.  The blue color is not that shade shown, but I actually liked it better than the color shown."
3.0,The bag has a lot of potential but a month into the purchase the strap came off and now is tied in a knot.  Can't justifying buying another bag when I just received one.
3.0,"Cute, but lacking much support. This nightie is cool and comfortable, but I have hot 50 and breastfed two babies in my 20’s as well as having gained weight. As a result my breast are of the DD variety and not as perky as they were in my younger days. This night gown is a bit big and loose and does nothing to contain them. As a result I wouldn’t consider this a sexy gown for me. If you need a little support or control, I’d steer clear of this one, but if you don’t really need that it might look good on you. I’d order smaller than normal as the fabric is t-shirt material, meaning it has a bit of stretch to it and is roomy. If it was a less stretchy material, it might have kept things a bit more contained..."
3.0,"The material is very thin, but it fits well and can be dressed up with a jacket."
3.0,"Fabric is beautiful and feels nice.  Problem is that this is so short.<br /><br />In photo, it looks like it's meant to be almost a tunic, but reality is it barely reaches waist (I'm 5'7).  In fact, if you wear a tank under, it doesn't totally cover the tank.<br /><br />Returning it - but really wish it would have worked as the colors are beautiful."
3.0,Cover made of plastic. cord sticks out way too far for my taste. The silver one is a metal one by Marshall. Neither key cord is flexible.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in this necklace. The chain seemed cheap and the disc with the writing was bigger than I expected. I like what the words say, so I kept it and will get a different chain. I guess it's ok for the price."
3.0,The actual dress fit well but the arm holes were way too small.
3.0,Not much sparkle but good build
3.0,"Runs extremely small! Men’s large fit like a small, the inseam was only 28”!"
3.0,"Sturdy material and warm, fit as expected. My only complaint is that the heel is constructed with a very rigid material, sewn in where the black patch is on the pictures. While walking, this is fine, but the top of this really hard heel jabs into my ankle if my foot is bent at all, which is very uncomfortable. This happens mostly while sitting, especially noticable while driving."
3.0,"A review for #Tantino Classic Teardrop Aviator Mirror blue Lens Sunglasses the For the price, I didn't really expect a whole lot out of these glasses. But when a pair of sunglasses show up and the nose rests are bent so out of place that I have to take the necessary time to see if it's something I can readjust without breaking, I don't see the price as being justifiable.  If you're looking for a cheep pair of aviator sunglasses, this is for you.  But If you're looking to try the aviator style sunny for a pocket friendly price, this is for you."
3.0,"Good, but in the Photo you can see bette Than phisical ..."
3.0,"Oks o, I read the reviews. I've waned this ring for so long, i just ignored any red flags. when I got it I was happy, but soon realized that I was disappointed. It is chunky and hard to wear as a ring because it's diameter is so much wider than the photo. It was a little rusty, and looks nice, but it was less than I hoped. Trust the reviews."
3.0,Was listed as 85% cotton. Its 60/40 cotton-polyester.  XL fits like an XXL. A bit on the thin material side. Will see how it holds up after a wash.  Guess it's okay for the price.
3.0,"The cap looks nice, fits well, pretty comfy. Havent tried the buttons but they seem to be in the right spot. The small business thing is a gimmick for sure, the product is clearly labled ""made in china"" but it does the job i guess"
3.0,Thought it was going to be great.  Too small and not what I expected.
3.0,It fit my 8 year old boys head well.  Sadly he says its super itchy.
3.0,No slip grip head bands are hard to find. These are just okay. For the price its not bad.
3.0,"This item was not as large as it appears. The bust form is not true to body size. The necklace did not have a curve in it, it was a straight bar and not as big, there fore not as stunning."
3.0,"My daughter used it maybe 6-7 times and the strap broke (separated from the purse). Granted that her purse was heavy since she stuffs her phone in there but i would think that it is to be expected. Anyways, we have innovated and managed to attach the strap by making a hole in the case itself. In all other respects it is good  - there are plenty of slots/pockets for cards, cash, etc. It is of the right size and looks good."
3.0,"In theory, a very nice outfit but the skirt material is horrid. As you can see I ironed it. I spent like 20 mins trying really hard to remove the wrinkles but to no avail. It is just an awful material. I have no complaints about the top. The pattern is absolutely beautiful and feels soft but the matching bottom is just wrinkles galore!! I’m not happy!"
3.0,"Glasses do not match the two pairs of Smith Wolcotts I already have. the material is a little lighter particularly the lenses, and optics are different. They are polarized  sunglasses that match the photo, and the price was quite low, so I guess I should have expected a knock off which is why I rated it 3 stars."
3.0,"Idk about the sizes. Some rings fit better in the same size for me but it’s fine. The print is ok but it’s not centered on the ring. Not a dealbreaker but every time I look at the ring, I’ll see it….every…time…I see it"
3.0,"Bought for a Disney trip. Cute skirt, but inner shorts are white mesh and see through. One good breeze and I’d be flashing the kiddos. Returning."
3.0,The fabric isn’t good or pretty but at least is fresh
3.0,"2x fits like a l , but it is cute"
3.0,I bought it for a photoshoot.  It was too small/snug on my daughter.
3.0,Loved it for well
3.0,"Nice hat, but the rim is mush larger than I expected. Don't plan on driving with it or you will not be able to see."
3.0,It “fit” my head but looked WAY too small.  I normally wear 7-5/8 fitted hats.  Fits my wife’s tiny Mellon though.
3.0,I don't think this bracelet was made very secure. It broke as I was taking it off. I only had it for a couple months.
3.0,"It was beautiful but, had to return due to it being a little too big."
3.0,Color was more beigy than cognac.. othee than that.. good quality
3.0,"When I saw this dress I just had to have it! When it arrived however I was very disappointed. I ordered the smallest available which was a small but it was very big on me from the waist down. The dress's shape was very awkward like it already had &#34;built in hips&#34; for it which for someone who is not very curvy, frankly, I looked ridiculous.It looked like the dress was wearing me lol. This dress gave me all types of legally blonde vibes and I also saw Emma Stone wear the Valentino version of it which I absolutely loved! so I decided to keep it. I don't wear is as a dress but I made it into a shirt and so far I love it. lol"
3.0,Too long on me
3.0,too big dint and the material horrible i sent it back
3.0,"I love the colors.  Material is very thin, shake off the rain water but stays, poor water resistance quality.  Carry strap is useless, came off on the first day I used.  There were black dots on the white part of umbrella."
3.0,Light lens but not a fan of plastic lens
3.0,"I had to wear a camisole and spanx underneath it because the fabric was almost see-through and very unforgiving. The design of the dress is really cool, it just needs to be made in a better fabric."
3.0,Very nice! Just not wide enough as advertised.
3.0,They feel great but it was suggested I get a xxl due to measurements and height and found it fit like a regular t shirt with zero compression so I will attempt to order a size smaller
3.0,"Nice soft material. Bag structure is good. Comfortable to carry. Only problem is that I'm already seeing a few spots of white where the leather has peeled away or worn off, mainly at corners. They're small so the bag is still usable and I got a great price so it was still worth the price....just not as much as I first thought!"
3.0,"This is NOT rayon, it’s 100% polyester.  It does fit nice but I needed to wear a tank top under, but I usually wear one under every thing"
3.0,It is a lot smaller then the size I thought it was. This is more like a choker.
3.0,Tight on the nose bridge and leaves impressions in skin. Has spots after a couple days that won't go away. Still looks cool
3.0,These are much thinner than the first set I bought. And the thread on the inside is breaking off.<br />So I loved my first set. But very disappointed in the second.
3.0,"Pros:<br />*  They stay up at the very top. The elastic band around the top of the leg isn't tight and constricting , and stays in place.<br />*  Thin , but thats what i was looking for.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*  The feet were too long for me. At least a good inch. I wear a womens 6.5 US shoe.  There is a tighter band in the middle of the foot - like on sport socks - that holds the sock in place, but that made it difficult for me to make that extra inch of sock work inside my shoe.<br />*  while the band held at the top, the rest of the sock slouched all the way down. I was constantly pulling them up.<br /><br />At best, i'd wear these at home.  I'd spend too much time pulling at them if i wore them out.<br />Downside is.. at home, i'm walking around with an inch of sock hanging off the front or back end of my foot.<br />I plan to wash and dry and see if it makes any difference."
3.0,"Returning,maybe I didnt read right but the flower is humongus and I personally feel will look absurd as an earring"
3.0,"It is ok, but extremely small even though I ordered a large! (I am normally a 4/5 and wear a small/medium)"
3.0,"These pants are cute, but they were definitely smaller than I thought they were. They are snug on my legs and butt. The material doesn't really stretch, so they are pretty tight. If you're between sizes I would definitely go up a size. I usually wear a medium, but I should have ordered a large because of how these fit."
3.0,Cute top. It can be dressed up or down. It’s a little bit itchy and runs small but for the price It’s an addition to versatile sweaters.
3.0,Runs really small compare to US sizes
3.0,"If you have a bigger chest, you would need to go up a size.. I unfortunately just returned it because it wasn’t long enough nor did it fit around my torso."
3.0,I like this blouse.  It runs small so I returned it and reordered a bigger size.  The blouse is described as multi pink in color.  The picture shows it to be more orange.  I wanted it to be orange and was hoping the description was inaccurate.  So I took a chance.  It is inaccurate and for that I am happy.
3.0,"I like this shirt, bought for tye-dyeing..however I feel that the sizing does run a little small. I ordered a Medium which I usually am. I'm hoping it won't shrink too much after washing! Quality is just ok."
3.0,Not quiet as expected but they work
3.0,"The fit is too large making it impossible to wear, straps keep falling down. too loose."
3.0,I receive this from the mail today. I thought this will be a bit thicker than the arm-sleeves with UV protection. Apparently it pretty much the same quality but you will have to pay a bit more for this.
3.0,These are well made.  They are going to work better for people with feet below size 9.
3.0,"Pretty good item, the fabric isn’t soft at all & was a bit rough. I liked them, but felt like they were a bit to baggy on me. Honestly looked like I was in a hip hop music video. Not really my style. All together, they were fairly comfortable, but was disappointed when it only had pockets in the top front, not on the bottom (like I thought it would since they were supposed to be cargo pants)."
3.0,"It was nicely designed and well put together, but is not true to size- order a size larger!"
3.0,"Too large, bulky and heavy. Never wear it."
3.0,I love the colors but the black band is way too tight. I snatch it off in the middle of the night.
3.0,It is light weight though and very comfortable. I'll most likely use it under sweat jackets and sweatshirts this winter and really love it. The soft feel is great!
3.0,Love the hat but the color is orangish instead of the vibrant yellow in the picture. Wanted it to match my yellow outfits but now need to look at some other options. Still keeping this however as it's totally cool.
3.0,Love the thickness of the hoodie but the arm sleeves are too short especially after you wash it!
3.0,"Yea, my dress was delivered to the right address, that's a plus. The fabric and color content is on point. However the size is off. I'm an 8 on my best day and 12 depending on the dress. I'm a M-L. I ordered this dress in a large and it fits snug.  I'm afraid when wash it I won't be able to wear it again. I'm a little disappointed with this buy. Buyer Beware."
3.0,"I liked this skirt.  However, it is 6 inches too long.  I am 5’5”.  I will be returning it."
3.0,Mine tarnished after just a couple of weeks.
3.0,Loved the fabric.  Super light weight.  But time was way way too small. Even the biggest size didn’t fit my grandson.
3.0,"The length and chest was perfect; however, the waist was way to big. I guess when it says, Loose Dress, it is literal. The size chart didn't match the waist."
3.0,"Not as good of build quality as the pair I bought at Fred Meyer, probly a knockoff."
3.0,This dress is beautiful! It is listed as a white dress but it is actually cream colored.
3.0,The bill of this is smaller than what I was expecting. Not a lot of coverage.
3.0,Band around button is cheap and broke first wear.
3.0,The fabric is slinky and shiny. I’m 5’1” and wear Medium tops and Size 10 pants. The large swallowed me up top. The shoulders were too wide and loose but it fit me well in the hips. I think this dress is perfect for gals with a larger bust than bottom.
3.0,Wasn't expecting it to be as small as it was. Definitely looks much bigger online.
3.0,"It looks great when you first get it but after wearing it off and on for a week, it already wore and well, looks pretty cheap to me honestly.  Plus if you have a thick neck, you'd need a different chain, pretty sure this would break easily."
3.0,"The 3XL is like a normal XL.... I just purchased another pair of 3XL from another brand, and they fit perfect."
3.0,Glasses come in a nice case with a cleaning cloth.  They are rather large.  Not sure if they will hold up.  So far so good.
3.0,Nice glasses but they did not float.
3.0,I bought a size 10 because I’m normally a 9-9.5 but they didn’t have in between sizes. And it turns out I probably would have done better with an 11! I’ve never had shoes run this small before. This is ridiculous
3.0,Larger than I expected.  They have not changed colors yet so that is a plus
3.0,I was looking for minimalist wallet for women. It is a bit too big for my taste and the dark pick color is not vibrant enough as the picture shows. Returned it.
3.0,This is a super cute dress and I wish it worked but it just does not for me.  It’s super tight under the arms.
3.0,Fit ok. Part of the sheer material was not stitched properly to the top
3.0,These run huge.
3.0,Dosent come with anything to adjust the links so not happy
3.0,These socks are very thin. They look too small but they stretch right out over your foot.OK for summer use.
3.0,Not a terrible shirt but could be better. First of all this shirt was supposed to be black and it is navy blue instead. Doesn’t really look like the picture depicted online. Another thing is white thread was used for the stitching which looks bad on a dark colored shirt. The third thing is this shirt runs small so get at least one size larger if you purchase this item. Overall a disappointing purchase.
3.0,"The Wooly Clothing Company's women's merino pro-knit wool cropped pullover hoodie looks adorable on my wife.  She ordered the size XS, which is her regular size, and the waist is perfect, as are the shoulders and her bust region.  The problem occurs when she dons the hood.  It's several inches too short, and pulls up the area over the shoulders.  My wife commented that while we love Wooly Clothing Company's products, they need to hire someone to properly design and size the products.  For my wife's slim and light-weight profile, each item is a gamble as to whether it will fit her properly.  If you look at the model in the product photo, she's only partially donned the hood, and the waist is being pulled up in the front.  Even in Size Small, the proportions aren't right."
3.0,"I sized up to a medium but should have gone up even further. I went off the measurement chart and reviews. I have a 36&#34; bust and 30&#34; waist. It fit great everywhere but the bust. Fabric seems good quality, not see through."
3.0,Fits very well and great price. I'd give it more stars but the pink fabric fades very quickly so the suit looks like it's years old after only several uses.
3.0,For an 80's party.  OK
3.0,"Light weight, but takes time to get use to the color ... hold your head a certain  way and things have a purple tint to it"
3.0,"Bought for the wife hoping it would fit like the photos, but it was way too small. We purchased an XL thinking it would fit similar to other shirts we've recently purchased of similar cut and fabric (she is a 40DDD and sz 20 pants) and you would likely need to size up one or two from your normal size for that to work. Other than being too small though, the fabric felt like it was a good quality. We returned the item."
3.0,I bought size 34 but fits to 8 year old. So my daughter used it instead.
3.0,Cute! But the top is much smaller than sizing... even B-C chest in a large size doesn’t quite work
3.0,"I think you need a long torso for this dress. Cute design, but didn't fit me right."
3.0,Wore once..already had a bead fall off
3.0,It's a thinner material. I'd like it to be thicker but I still like the hoodie.
3.0,Doesn't hold much.
3.0,"it too big , but it ‘s soft , nice color."
3.0,I don't always like buying bikini sets becuase my top and bottom are not the same size. Colors don't seem as bright in person
3.0,"Worked for boat clips,  but soft foam breaks easily."
3.0,Quality fabric is good ... but just too large.
3.0,"I found out that if i wanted to keep this watch wound i would need to have Pedro or one of his brothers move in. I wasn't spending another 200k for a new addition on the house so i decided to get a F1 serval cat and attaching it to his cute little paw. Little did i know this 22k cat soon decided to take over the house establishing dominance over my Gardner, i would find him stuffed in a hole in the ground or in my slippers in the morning. I just couldn't have this so i sold the Gardner and moved to a condo in NYC, i love there salsa.<br /><br />O yeah the watch is ok"
3.0,Impossible to shorten with included tool. No instructions  except yhey may be here iin Japaneese.  If you have  a small wrisst plan on having a jewler adjust it
3.0,Very small not as shown in picture size perfect
3.0,Loved the color and style.  Material was a little thin for my taste and the band on the waist is only in the front on the dress.
3.0,"When I received them, the emblem on one of the arms was off. Exposing 2 obvious holes.<br />Like the shape and fit. Wish I could wear them."
3.0,"I like the way the shoe looks, but I think it is not going to be very durable."
3.0,"I figured it would be undersized, but not as much as it was. I gave this set to a much smaller friend. Despite being too small, the quality was fine and it appeared to be well made."
3.0,"6'1"", 180, pear shaped. Bought XL. Hem hit 6 inches above my knees, not like pictured at all. Fabric is ok, if the color were lighter it might be translucent"
3.0,My son used it for a couple of days and the chain didn't hold and broke off after 3 days.
3.0,Cute but the bell bottom part is mega cheap looking.  I’m afraid to even sink wash them.
3.0,Much bulkier and rugged looking than expected.
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a 4x (I usually wear a 14-16, or XL). This top was way too big, so I reordered it 2 sizes smaller. Luckily I will get the 2nd top in time for the event I needed it for."
3.0,"The dress description listed and displayed on the model, is not the style that I received. The design that I received did not have the wrap design at the bust that I loved so much. I received a regular scoop neck design. I wish I had time to return it before the animal themed virtual online event that I was attending, but I didn’t. The overall dress is made beautifully and is true to size with some extra give where it counts. I just wish the seller delivered what they promoted"
3.0,Very nice jacket but the sizing is way off. I bought a small for my daughter and a large for me. Had to return the small and my size 0 daughter is wearing the large. And looking back I see there was a conversion chart in the listing but it was an obvious at first so I ordered the wrong sizes but the sizes are not standard US sizes
3.0,"no heel or padding,but my grand daughter loves them.Ordered another pair for my daughter!"
3.0,I guess I got what I paid for. If I wanted something nicer then I should have spent more. I had to assemble the clips into the band and the side that sizes the band sticks out.<br />It is comfortable though.
3.0,"a very attractive band with nice weight and looks.  the only downside to the band is its limited adjustability; sure, you can remove links as needed, but most metal bands have a provision for fine tuning the fit through a pin adjustment near the buckle.  I find that the band is either slightly too loose or too tight; I am not able to find the perfect fit that I've found with similar bands."
3.0,I ordered two sizes up from what I wear in hopes of getting a slightly looser fit but they're still too small. I have never had this problem with size variation before. I checked the tag because I assumed they sent me the wrong size. NOPE
3.0,I kept it even though it’s on the larger size. It’s nice because the camo is blue and black l. Lots of pockets .
3.0,Love the sweater but the smell was horrible when i opened the package.
3.0,The color is a bit bright. I ordered red but its orange . That color is also good. Arrived a bit late but i loved the dress
3.0,"I like the tree but I give it 3 stars because there's no directions and I had to figure out how to put it together by loosening the screw and putting it in the base. I was so confused at first, but then I got my screwdriver and knew what to do. Once you screw the tree into the base, it's pretty nice."
3.0,"These masks (I got the cat face pack) are nice, but they are silky and don't have a metal bit in the nose, so they don't hold tight. I have found them impossible to wear with glasses, but I plan to add a metal bit so I can wear them since they are so cute."
3.0,"I ordered medium which was too tight for me.  The style is nice and I like having a slit in the back.  Too bad, there are no other colors."
3.0,"Good, VERY soft, well made, and comfortable band. However, the color seemed just a bit more of a deep purple than I had expected. Could just be the difference between screens, lighting, etc. (included photo with flash on for reference). It should also be noted that because of the design, it is very difficult to fasten the band without assistance from another person but not impossible with some practice. It fits my very small wrist with 2-3 extra holes which is really nice. Overall a good band with no real “flaws” but a couple things to take note of before purchasing."
3.0,Ordered for my daughter's Halloween costume but it ended up being too small 😕.
3.0,I was excited when some reveiws mentioned it was on the larger size. I am usually a S-M but wanted to size up to get a really oversized fit. I have the same brand jersey in red from goodwill in a large so I thought it would be fine. It was not as big as I expected. Should have gotten an XL. Too much to return so I will just have to deal.
3.0,Harley stuff always fits weird. Some times I’m a small some times I’m an XL. Well this vest fits in with their weird sizing system. I’m 5’3 125lbs and initially ordered a large buy returned it for a medium. It’s a weird for- the armpits are super long. It’s a decent buy since I paid $20 but I definitely wouldn’t pay more than that. I’m not overly impressed
3.0,Appeared much shinier in the picture than it was.
3.0,"When I purchased this shirt, I noticed the antiquing process on the Rush lettering and thought it looked OK. However, when I received the shirt, there are also brown streaks of printing on part of the body of the shirt (which did not clearly show up in the online picture). I'm sure that it is intentionally part of the design, and intended to give the antiqued look.  But instead it looks like the shirt has been dragged through the mud or had something spilled on it.  It is not at all tasteful.  I will wear this shirt to work in the yard, but certainly not out in public.  I think the intent was good, but the execution and end result are certainly not."
3.0,This was sewn very badly .no seems matched will have some one alter for me. I am disappointed that it did not fit.<br />Order regular size
3.0,"Simple thank u gift, guess it's ok"
3.0,"If you are looking to dress like Max from stranger things then this is your outfit. However, the quality of the material is not great and the shirt that it comes is very flimsy. The neck of the shirt is unusually high and tight as well."
3.0,Not the best<br />Not the worst
3.0,The bottom was like a child size....top is fine.
3.0,"My Birthstone is a blue saphire.  The color is right, however the weight is too heavy.  The stud pulls on earring hole so much so that it stretches.  If this is why one ordered it, then OK.  Just to heavy to wear for any length of time."
3.0,"Nice coat, but looked kind of boxy on me so I returned it."
3.0,Sizing is a bit off on this product. Overall very cute..I just wish it were more functional
3.0,"I didn't even try them on. The material and sticky strip almost went up to my shoulder bone.<br />For a size D, DD or larger cup size it would probably be great."
3.0,"Its sexy which I can believe however the fabric is very sensitive, and mine ripped very easily. Also it was very tight since it has that type of stocking feeling."
3.0,It can't fit my iphone6
3.0,Band is ok but what's annoying is the buckle is cheap and not made for this watch band.  It has an extra loop that makes no sense and makes the buckle stick out from the band.
3.0,My 3 year old has to wear sunglasses because of a neurological issue so we own more pairs than I can count. The strap that goes around the back of the head is virtually useless even on a two year old because it is too short. We kept them because she said they were comfortable and pink. Also polarized which is hard to find in toddler size. Not ideal to have no back strap but they fit fairly well as long she wasn't jumping on the trampoline. However after 3 months of use they stretched so much they won't stay on at all. Fix the fit issue and these would be our go to glasses. So far the best I have found are the &#34;My First Sunglasses Sporty Fit&#34; unfortunately they only come in what my daughter calls boy colors.
3.0,A little big for a women's hand. My lady hardly wears it
3.0,It was for my mom and she liked it. It's exactly as described.
3.0,"I have a fairly large belly that I need hidden.  I am also busty (DD).  The top (patterned print section) was too loose for me and the skirt portion was too tight on my belly.  Looked ok-ish standing up, but the moment I sat it looked horrendous on me.<br />It seemed to be made good enough.<br />Returned due to fit."
3.0,the beads slide to the back of the bracelet and I can not pull the stings to tighten the band when it is on my wrist.  It is pretty.
3.0,Need a replacement
3.0,Watch itself looks fine and works well for a $10 watch. However I didn't anticipate it being so small. Looks and feels like a woman's watch. Ended up giving it to my 3 year old son... at least he likes it!
3.0,Was hoping these would go with my rose gold necklace.  These are unique but very small - maybe would work for a teenager.
3.0,Most definitely runs very small! I ordered a 3XL and it was so small. I'm returning it.
3.0,"These are adorable and I love the fabric but the waist is too small, pants too long and they are snug around the thighs<br /> Had to return them<br /> I purchased a small, Im petite and still too small. The medium would probably fit but would need hemming."
3.0,Cute shirt but I’m too short. The peplum was too much. Maybe works better if you’re tall.
3.0,The product was used prior because the box was not for that item and there was no product or size label included. Bad repackaging. If I would’ve known they were used I would not have gotten them for a Christmas gift. Not cool
3.0,Two of the buttons were falling off when it arrived; I nearly lost one of them in the packaging.
3.0,It fits true to size  the picture quality is good
3.0,"Nice color, warmth, craftsmanship not the best. Seem split in finger within first hour of wearing"
3.0,"Its to big, I buy median is it same size large"
3.0,Great charm! Cute! Fell off after 1 week of having it on bracelet
3.0,The material is made very nice and thin so it's going to be great for that nice hot weather. Now with that being said I did find that they do run slightly smaller. I ordered the largest size possible and I normally wear a large shirt and even then it was still a little too snug on me. I suggest when ordering the shirt try to go at least two sizes up if not at least one size up if you want that loose-fitting shirt.
3.0,Very weak socks. Holes within a few washings.
3.0,"Did not fit as expected. Does not wash well, comes out too wrinkled and needs ironing to be worn."
3.0,The product is good. Although it might shrink a bit on multiple washes.
3.0,"Most of the kit was great but it was missing two pages of Wide Receivers.  We had to write in players that were not listed.  Realizing there were no receivers with the last names between H and W.<br />I opened to entire draft kit a couple days before the draft, but it was during the draft (right now) that we have found there are missing sheets."
3.0,"The pants are nice and as shown. The fabric isn't to heavy or light. They fit nice i'm 5' 2 and about 120 lbs and got a small. Only complaint is when i tried them on 15 minutes after being delivered i noticed they already had a hole in the seam near the lower leg. You can't see it that much because it's not that big and the pants are black, luckily.. because i never return anything. Just disappointed in that with them. Want to order a grey paint too still. I'm glad i held off to see the first pair..i'm debating that decision for a 2nd pair still, might browse around for cheaper ones to try because of the quality."
3.0,"This product is cute, I really do like the design, it fits well and it is comfortable.  But it is a sleep mask and it is meant to keep out the light, and it does that job rather poorly.  You can see light through the mask it self, not from the edges but through the front piece as a whole.  I guess it would be good in a low light setting but, it does not meet my needs.  It is a shame cause it really is cute."
3.0,My item got here when it was suppose to but even an XXL was a bit tight around the shoulders and chest. Will see if I can mail it back and go up in size.
3.0,It's  actually  to small. Not adequate  room  for additional  layers
3.0,"The pants are a little loose, probably a size smaller will fit better, although I always wear a medium.  They are very long, but is not a big issue, the mayor problem is that they pick up dog hair like crazy. Like someone else mentioned in another review, they look like a pet lint roller."
3.0,Too narrow across the shoulders and chest unfortunately.
3.0,not bad for the price if your kinda thin.
3.0,its cute.... but ordered two thinking I would love them... and no... too box-e.. I ordered large and medium both fit like a small. and I'm 5'3 weigh 120..<br />if I wore this with a regular bra you wouldn't be able to see the hoodie. Don't recommend it. Will be returning both<br />this is for the white and black stripped hoodie....
3.0,The overall fit was great but it wasn’t long enough for me. I don’t like my ankles showing so I returned it.
3.0,"This is a cute shirt. The sunflower decal is like the iron on I remember as a kid. It’s ok, but definitely has that vinyl feel.  The arms are a little tight. I have thicker arms and they were a little snug. I rolled the sleeves (like we were kids) to give them a little distraction. Overall, cute fall shirt."
3.0,does not fit hamilton watch i have. the pin come with this set is ok.
3.0,"They break right in the middle even after the first use. They are confortable to wear, though."
3.0,The dress was beautiful but it was to small I had to return it .so size up at least two sizes I have a curvey body 26 waist 34ddd and big butt athletic legs I had ordered a medium and I couldn’t get it to go pass my waist the bottom part does not stretch at all and that mesh materiel can easily break.
3.0,These don't have a draw string. They would have been much better fitting with the draw string. I have to wear shorts over them for fear of them falling down.
3.0,"Cute ring but stones fell out in a month. The steel part is great. I should have gotten a less ornate ring I think. Can't beat the price, though."
3.0,"The only issue I had was that they sent two groups of the same pairs of socks. So I have redundant socks which was a bit disappointing. Looking back at the picture and description I can see that it isn't the case but still feel justified in my initial assumption. Just be mindful that if you order these socks you will get 12 pairs but two pairs of each sock pattern.<br />The socks fit great and will update the review, if I remember, if there are any issues with quality over the time I wear them."
3.0,Material is a little see through
3.0,Prints look like it can peel of at any second.
3.0,"I bought the Large, but they would fit someone that is probably a size 9."
3.0,"This dress is very pretty, except that it runs really small. I normally wear a Large/XLarge and the XLarge I ordered did not fit. It’s not stretchy at all. Very pretty, but Definitely size up!"
3.0,Very comfortable but the pants came apart on the leg at the seam with the first wear. They fit loosely & comfortably as I ordered them to be so it wasn't an issue of being to tight causing the problem. I sewed them back up & having had a problem since. May have been just a defect in the pair I recieved.
3.0,Really wasn’t a slouchy hat. Fit was like a standard size beanie. Wasn’t what I was looking for but wouldn’t be worth the effort to return it. Quality was fine just wasn’t “slouchy”
3.0,"I purchased 2 sizes up from what I needed to ensure it would close all the way, figuring my hip into the equation.  The torso is quite large on me, and it doesn't cover everything.  Very comfortable, material is exactly what I expected, but I can't wear it closed."
3.0,Somewhat small and not that transparent
3.0,"The material and color of the shirt were great and exactly like what's pictured. But the twist knot thing isn't. It's very difficult to get it in a spot that looks cute. Mostly, it just makes the front of the shirt look baggy, then pinched, then baggy again."
3.0,"We usually love Vans, but these shoes just seem off. They're very narrow and hard to get on and off and my kiddo has pretty narrow feet to begin with. They also run a little smaller than usually. Not only that, but they aren't holding up great. The red Vans stamp on the back is falling off after about 6 weeks of use.<br /><br />That being said they are cute and besides being narrow and the rubber stamp coming off they aren't terrible."
3.0,"The frames on these are unbelievably thin and brittle. They are also a bit small and somewhat uncomfortable. My wife will probably only use them for Halloween, so it won't matter too much."
3.0,"The bracelet is cute - cheap, but perfect for my 6-year-old for whom I bought it. My problem was with the seller. I ordered and paid for 2 but only ever got 1 with NO help or refund from the seller. That was disappointing, but luckily it only cost me about $1.50 so that wasn't the issue so much as their complete disregard for handling the issue. However, the bracelet itself is very cute and my daughter is very happy with it. I love this kind of stuff because it's inexpensive and designed to wear out and she breaks stuff (being a kid) so quickly that it's a nice, symbiotic relationship."
3.0,"These earrings have felt light backing and the earring backs are made of light plastic.  They are pretty but are not durable!<br /><br />The black pair looks like a deep blush gray!<br /><br />Don’t think you will receive strong, durable earrings!<br /><br />Not truly satisfied!"
3.0,Cute but heavy. About 4” from top to bottom point of heart
3.0,"I like this skirt, I ordered a second one, in a different color."
3.0,Wanted a compression around my stomach and chest but just more of stretchy material then compression so doesnt do much.
3.0,Color like black large I like also
3.0,"This shirt fits odd. While I like the colors on the shirt, the fit is strange. The seams on the sleeve of the shoulder almost hit at my elbows. Feels very boxy."
3.0,"It’s a good hoodie, BUT the color is nothing like the picture. I was so disappointed since I was so excited for it to come. I specifically ordered it to match a pair of shoes. The color on the picture would have matched perfectly, but when the actual item arrived the color was nothing like the picture, so I felt like I just wasted money honestly.."
3.0,The remote does not work.
3.0,"Loved the shirt, but it was too small. I ordered a large, but fits more like a medium."
3.0,"I like the band, but the screw driver doesn't work with detaching the band!"
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs of these pants, 2 black and 1 gray. While they are comfortable and look good, they have an unpleasant odor that hasn’t gone away even after several washings. Luckily the smell isn’t very strong, so I can wear them without worrying too much that anyone else will notice unless they actually sniff my pants, but it still bothers me a bit. I won’t be buying again."
3.0,"I love the leggings, but I ordered them with pockets and they have no pockets. I cannot give 5 stars on something I did not receive."
3.0,I ordered a 2x thinking it would be loose... but it was too tight. Not roomy at all.Sleeves were too long.<br />Returned. Very dissapointed
3.0,At least 1.5 sizes smaller than standard fit
3.0,"I run in these. I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Nike and New Balance.  They're ok, but I will keep looking."
3.0,okay for the price!
3.0,"Kinda cheap looking, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I'm sure these are of quality, but I swear I ordered size 12 not size 7.  I've contacted &#34;Hosiery and More&#34; and they stated it was size 7, I just don't know how.  Oh Well, I donated them"
3.0,The blue is navy not royal blue
3.0,Unfortunately this was way too large on me
3.0,Top fits fine. The bottoms are a high cut on the thighs. Not exactly what was expected. Seems to be good quality.
3.0,The ears were bought for a male adult and were a little small. Would fit a child perfect.
3.0,The material feels very cheap and the color is much lighter than the picture shown (I got the gray one). I got a size up from my normal size and it’s tight in the shoulders.
3.0,"Cons: It is not a big deal, it’s made of plastic. Pro: Fast shipping."
3.0,"Started to fall apart within 2 months. It was beautiful, while it lasted."
3.0,I purchased an xl and it fits like a small
3.0,Very long needs hemming
3.0,"I liked the color and that it was more lightweight, but it is so lightweight that it is see through. I can only wear a solid color with it. I wanted to wear stripes, but you can see the stripes through the material."
3.0,"The raised toe bed sat too far back for my toes.  Had to return and, unfortunately, had to pay shipping, which surprised me because I bought these on amazon prime.  Kinda bummed me out!"
3.0,Está bonito pero en la foto lucen mejor
3.0,THIS SIZE XL IS NOT QUITE AN XL. ITS MORE LIKE A SIZE LARGE. NEED LARGER SIZES AVAILABLE.
3.0,Dress was too small ordered and XL should have went up 2 sizes. Didnt have enou6tine to return and reorder.
3.0,Too small and narrow for the size and hurts between the toes
3.0,bag is ok hest for someone young..
3.0,"I love the print on this scrub caps, but was pretty disappointed when it came out of the wash/dry cycles with my laundry. It wrinkles horribly. I don't know if I will have time to iron these after every use 😟"
3.0,"Cheap made but cheap price,lol,I guess you get what you pay for"
3.0,"They seemed like they would have been our new favorite bands, but they were so big straight out of the package that the watch just spun on our wrists. Should have been much shorter so they could be stretched into our wrist since there was no choose a size option available at checkout."
3.0,"The purple color is beautiful but I had to buy a large instead of XL. If didn’t fit, of course, so I returned it. I did buy the “pink” in XL, but not sure what I think. The material is very thin, snags easily & overall the top really isn’t that flattering on me."
3.0,Returned because too small
3.0,CUTE BUT LARGE
3.0,At least the glare was a soothing shade of yellow
3.0,I am 5'1 -150lbs. This doesn't have a size option when you order. This isn't as sheer as it looks in the pic and for someone my height and build this thing fits like a big dress- falls a little past my knees--IT IS NICE but to big and not sheer enough for what i wanted- Sadly I will have to return it
3.0,"Mine arrived with stripped hole where the brass knob screws into the heel end of one of the trees. As a result, pulling the knob to remove the tree from a shoe would remove the knob from the tree instead. This was easy enough to fix with a matchstick, but beware of small quality issues like this!"
3.0,"Cute earings, they are on the small side."
3.0,"I went by the sizing guides typed in the product description and ordered a 2XL because I am 38-32-39, and this was at least a size, if not two, too big. It's just very loose overall, but I would have to tighten the straps all the way to have it fit decent at the top."
3.0,"really cute top and fit well but the material is stiff not flowy at all, it reminds me of softer burlap? its also a little shorter than I thought it would be I'm 5'4&#34; and its about 3 inches above my belly button. The color is so cute though, I got the yellow one and its true to color."
3.0,The length is a bit snug but it’s pretty. I would go up a size
3.0,Loved the little one the other two are better suited for septum piercing.
3.0,The pin falls out to easily.
3.0,"Update @ 20FEB2023:<br />I experienced several unexplained delays via third party delivery personnel despite prime membership perks and I was just about to cancel my order when it was suddenly delivered.<br /><br />Anyway, I waited as patiently as I could only to be somewhat disappointed upon delivery.  Look carefully at my attached photos and you’ll see that although the embroidery quality and design look great, the color looks a little off with its “orange gold” finish.  Also, the SnapBack strips are so far misaligned in comparison to the other (One Piece, Trafalgar Law) hat from the same manufacturer.  Look at the photos!  However, I’m keeping it nonetheless and adding it to my One Piece hat collection.  I just wanted to point out those details for potential consumers considering these particular product variations.<br /><br />Firstly, the embroidered image is surprisingly accurate and the quality of the embroidery itself isn’t too bad.  However, fitment is horrible with seemingly unusual cuts of fabric stitched together to yield for an odd void space toward the front.<br /><br />This is a good hat overall, good enough for loyal fans of One Piece and its kooky characters, but there’s undoubtedly some room for improvement.  The actual product is not identical to the displayed unit in the product listing photos, but it’s very similar.  The fabric strips between each panel is simply black without any logos and unfortunately, there is no tag present to identify materials or care instructions.  Further, a portion of the vinyl SnapBack material is too far recessed into the right side panel on the rear of the hat, resulting in a challenging adhesion of both sides during an otherwise simple task of size adjustment.  This is an  infinitesimal detail is easily overlooked and would only bother those of us with even the mildest form of OCD.  “Why is the last tab covered?!”  😂<br /><br />Nevertheless, this hat will serve its purpose as intended.  Meanwhile, you can demonstrate your fandom of the show while hiding your morning hairdo.  Just get it!"
3.0,bigger than I wanted but will use for something else
3.0,"Decent gloves. Used them while sitting in deer stand. In 35 degree weather, hands got cold after 2 hours"
3.0,"I bought this ring to wear for travel. I wanted something that looks very similar to my real wedding band, but I ordered rose gold (my real band is white gold) so it'd be a little different. It's a very durable ring, and it's difficult to tell they're not real diamonds, but I'm disappointed because the rose gold faded after only four days of wear. There are still some bits of rose gold color around the stones, but the majority of the band looks silver. If I'd known the rose gold was going to rub off so quickly, I would've just ordered the silver version. It just looks weird now with parts of the ring silver and parts of it rose gold."
3.0,"I got this back in January. I've worn it out in the rain, snow, and sun. It's great as an outer most layer. I pair it with a fleece vest that I wear underneath. This is great for those chillier days. Here's where it gets a little complicated: a rain coat is just better. The nature of it being a vest means that if you decide to wear it out in the rain, your body will still get wet as rain runs down your neck or arms into the unprotected body cavity. It'll still keep anything on your person in the pockets dry (or should), but YOU will still get wet. Speaking of: the water resistance is rather poor. I would wear this on drizzly days to class and some of the water would initially bead up (this is water resistance) but too much would cause some of it to absorb into the material (if it didn't, this would be water proof). So, it works, kind of. You definitely shouldn't choose this over a proper rain coat. But it does look really cool and provides another layer of warmth when you don't need a light jacket but a fleece vest isn't enough."
3.0,Middle part of bow that holds bow together broke off after a couple of hours.
3.0,"Kinda ugly, kinda cheesy. Would make a fairly good gift for a child."
3.0,Much wider than expected-should have given measurements
3.0,"It's a little larger than I expected for my tragus piercing.  If you want to really have a stand out, larger piercing for any part of the ear other than the lob, this is a great choice."
3.0,"Like the shirt very much.  However, I always wear an XL very comfortably.  This shirt runs a full size smaller.<br />I have ordered & received 2 new replacement shirts in XXL & they fit quite well.<br />I am in the midst of returning the XL.<br />I am very pleased with the new shirts & highly recommend this company as long as you order a size larger than you normally wear."
3.0,They change color after exposure to air for a while!
3.0,"Its cute but its not a micro mini, it has 3 tiers instead of the 2. Its the length of a normal mini skirt so that kinda sucks as thats not what i wanted, but it still cute. Ill probably just cut and sew it to make it shorter.."
3.0,It would have been cute for a costume if it weren't huge on me. I got a full refund but I didn't have anything to wear at Comic Con.
3.0,"I like that it's cotton. The neckline is just fine. The arm holes are odd. The back is good. The side slits are too high. The bottom back is too long. Hate that style. Wasn't tracking how high the slits are, or the length in back compared to the front. One arm hole is larger than the other, but only slightly.<br />I will keep it, because I need a cotton tank top. However, I will move on from this brand."
3.0,"Runs very small, material is slick and does not stay tucked into jeans very well. Would not recommend this product"
3.0,"A little narrow, but a nice shirt overall"
3.0,Waist is wide. Made well.
3.0,"I really like the size and the insert that allows the bags to sit upright. My only disappointment is that the loops that attach the bags to the registers all broke off the very first time I tried to use them. I mean, every last one of them. I told myself I was going to save them and sew them on properly, but I never got around to it, so I now get the stink-eye from sales clerks. However, the bag handles and seams seem to be holding up fine so far.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now the seams of three of the bags have failed. Luckily I noticed before I was scrambling around the grocery parking lot."
3.0,looks fine other than the crooked pearl thing. It couldve happened during shipping but it was glued like that. I kinda regret buying a bow for 16 dollars when I could've made this myself for cheaper.
3.0,This is a cute t-shirt material dress. It would be very hard to dress it up - it's totally casual. I like the length (just above the knee) and the dress will be useful for different purposes; it's very comfy; but it's unlined and thin material. Only 3 stars because of that (and bcs the description is a bit misleading).
3.0,"I was looking to replace a pair of Hue Denim Moto Leggings in Graphite. These did not compare to my original, even though the names (aside from color) and cut/style are identical. My original pair were much thicker - closer in weight to jegging/jean than legging. These are very lightweight, like a thick yoga pant. They are comfortable, but I can already tell they will get loose quickly. They don’t feel of the same quality I am used to with Hue products. They had Hue tags (that were weirdly in bad shape, though the pants were fine) and a Hue tag on the inside, but they did not come in the original Hue leggings packaging that their products typically come in. I’m giving them 3 stars for the price and the fast shipping. They arrived a week before they were scheduled."
3.0,wrinkles very fast.
3.0,"The jacket was really nice. I had ordered a large because most of my jackets are that size but when I got the jacket it was a little tight around the chest and shoulders. When I looked at the size tag, the jacket said it was an XXL jacket. So the sizing was very confusing. Although I got the size wrong, the quality was very strong. I really wish the sizes were easier so that I could enjoy the bomber."
3.0,These were too large. I really wanted to like these but they were not a proper fit.
3.0,Great watch but it sucks how it stops working when you're not wearing it
3.0,I am typically in between a large and xl. I ordered the large and they are a little tight. I also don't like the seam that goes across the chest. I am keeping them because I purchased to sleep in.
3.0,"Didn't like the  shiny material, but overall it fit great"
3.0,"Received the item on time. Unfortunately they look like they fit a child, not one size."
3.0,"I expected them to breathe, but they don't.  I find them quite warm.."
3.0,"Love the style and color of this Cardigan. Unfortunately, the SLEEVES were so tight as though they were made for a skinny teenager and not a middle aged woman like me. All else the fit was fine Shoulder seams not hanging over and body area not boxy looking. I am 5' 1&#34; and 130 lbs. Saw reviews saying to size up will think about possibly doing that although other areas maybe bigger too. Too bad"
3.0,My baby  did not enjoy the earmuffs but they are cute.
3.0,Nice. They breathe very well and don't hold moisture.
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this. It is as pretty in person/on as in the photo and I put it on as soon as I got it. However, the next day, after sleeping in it, I was disappointed to see that during regular wear the thread (yes thread!) that the beads are strung on had stretched and left several sections bare of beads. I'm contimplating restringing on my metal beadwire but I had purchased this to save me the time of making my own which is now pointless if I do decide to restring. If you are not very hard on anklets or take them off to sleep etc then this will work for you but if you are like me and put it on and forget it then be warned."
3.0,Chains tangle fast
3.0,"Reading previous reviews, I felt that a vast majority of satisfied customers were saying buy a size down from your usual. I am 5'5"" 186 and a 38DDD and typically wear either a medium or large for dresses. I ordered a medium. Big mistake. This dress was so tight it was like putting on a corset. My T&A looked great while the entire rest of me looked like a busted can of biscuits. I'm super disappointed to have to return this as it's a very cute dress. But if this experience is anything to indicate the difference in sizes, I'd rather just find a different dress instead of cramming myself into a Chinese finger trap."
3.0,Didn't like the large zippers at first but have gotten use to them.  This is really not the quality I expected tho..
3.0,Super cute but break easily.
3.0,"Pretty bracelets. However, don't try to stretch them too far because they break easily. I already broke the black one."
3.0,"These are cute but only fit on one style of cup we own without falling off.  Also, one came with no tail (pink shark) and another in the same package (lime green) has a smudge I thought would wash off, but it didn't.  Overall, a disappointment.  Not worth the money."
3.0,"This shirt runs small, but cute."
3.0,"It's a cute choker, but it took 3 different people to get the latch to actually open.  I thought it was going to be unusable or broken, but we finally got it. I have a feeling it's not gonna last long!"
3.0,"I usually wear medium but these were too long, too loose and provided no stomach support."
3.0,"This is not the nicest item you'll every buy but it's less than $5. As hard as I am on jewelry, it's fine for my needs. It's better than Claire's quality (as in all the &#34;stones&#34; appear to be mounted fairly uniformly) and probably not quite as nice as Charming Charlie...but you know, CC would charge $15 for this. I didn't realize that half of the design of this was a nylon cording. It also had a funky chemically smell when I first opened it."
3.0,They work well but are just very cheaply made.
3.0,The only negative thing about this watch is the way it sits on my wrist.  I have tiny hands so maybe that is why I find the comfort level on the way it sits on my hand to be bothersome.  Well made and looks very nice but I believe it is not a wonderful fit for small wrists.
3.0,Top fits small
3.0,Not cozy lounge wear
3.0,"I am 102 lbs, 5’2” and it was so tight I could barely talk. I keep it for emergency."
3.0,"First of all, it came broken, so I haven't even worn it yet. I had to buy a package of clasps at JoAnn's so that we can repair it. But, I will see when I wear it what I think. For the price it is, it seems like a nice necklace, if it hadn't come broken."
3.0,I really liked the fit of this; but the fabric is very sheer almost transparent! I suppose it’s a good thing it’s pajamas but definitely would not recommend to go out at all.
3.0,Very pretty ring minus 2 stones missing.
3.0,"Very light weight, thin but suitable."
3.0,I got a size 20 and they fit fine but they are definitely not shorts like the picture shows. I'll keep them but it's disappointing to not get what's pictured.
3.0,They are really cute but run very small in size!
3.0,"This dress is nice, but it's so tight around the neck I couldn't wear it."
3.0,This dress was such a dark green it was almost black. Does not appear that dark in pictures. Dress was too short and a little tight. Would have been nice if the sizing and colors were correct.
3.0,bold colors
3.0,"The material was more for a kitchen apron than for a hair stylist and the stones and pink dots started coming off after one wash.  Definitely not great for a stylist as the fabrics is stiff, not water resistant, and likely not bleach resistant."
3.0,Didn't realize it was spandex type material. The picture was like in the description. Honestly didn't try it on due to the material.
3.0,"not bad for 8 dollars but the material is very fragile you can feel it because of the weight, however it looks good from afar but when you touch it you feel the material"
3.0,I gave these pants at three star only because they wasn't what the picture look like but they do fit great material look can achieve but great Leight size and color
3.0,I am not a tall person. I do not have a long torso. I am just under  feet tall. I wanted a slightly slouchy shirt and ordered a Large instead of a medium. It is far too thin to be a sweatshirt even a light weight one. It's more like a thickish shirt.  It's cute and I love the shade of crimson HOWEVER  this shirt is not suitable for adult women who wear adult women sized clothing.  First of all it's oddly tight and cut weird around the arms. I don't even have fat arms. I have normal arms. It's just odd. It's cut weird around the bicep and more of a bracelet length for the sleeves. ( minus one star for that).  It's also short for the torso. Yes I've got big boobs so maybe that plays a factor but even so I did order a large not a medium. It should have been fine. It hits my already short torso  just under my belly button instead of my hips.  ( minus another star) I had deliberated buying it and kind of regret it b/c now I only wear it over a dress so that I don't expose myself if I raise my arms above my shoulders.  This is a great gift if you're buying it for like a sixth grade girl who hasn't hit puberty yet.
3.0,"Nice color, cute style. Quality is fair."
3.0,The top over the chest is a little small and the arms are a little too tight
3.0,"First impression is satisfactory, but sleeve size is tight. After first wash it shrinks, sleeve is tightened to barely get thru."
3.0,Much too large for a woman and quite cheap looking. Gave these as gifts to guys but won't be buying again.
3.0,Overall this is a nice wallet.  The only drawback is that the slots for credit cards are just a little bit too narrow.  It's hard to get the cards in and out.  The removable license pouch was really stuck and I had to pry and wiggle it out the first time.  I have left that pouch out to help make the wallet a little thinner.
3.0,Even after 2 washes material is stiff. Pockets are shallow. Lenghth is good.
3.0,The underwear is very strange. The cotton crotch is vertical instead of horizontal. I have never seen anything like it.
3.0,"Warm coat.  However, it was so wrinkly.  Could machine wash but line dry only.  Had trouble getting the zipper up.  I did return it."
3.0,Neckline is really wide and slit easily falls open so watch out. I'm going to add a hook and eye or velcro to the slit and I have to layer for the neckline. Maybe needed a size bigger.
3.0,Love the skirt but the zipper broke day one.... had to return
3.0,"This shoes are so confortable for my feet and easy to walk and handle. The only thing i didn't like is that the clear material over the toes is so hard. So it hurt a lil bit when putting them on but once is worn it work great. Also i walked for avout 2 hour with this shoes and very confortable, no pain in my feet. Very light weight and the heel makes a little weird sound when walking on a marble like floor."
3.0,"Nice crisp cotton around the house dress that has a zipper running 3/4 down the front. The zipper has a nice looking pull that makes it dressier looking. The zipper tape facing keeps getting caught in the zipper and doesn’t lay flat against the fabric of the dress. I’m going iron it flat and if needed I’ll sew an border edge around the tape to keep it from curling inward into the zipper teeth. The manufacturer should look into the zipper issue. The arm hole openings are somewhat snug, they fit me fine, but if you have larger upper arms they won’t be big enough. The manufacturer should correct that for a more generous opening where the sleeve meets the body of the dress. I washed it in cold water and tumble dried it on low. Very little shrinkage. I hung it up immediately after the dryer stopped and it wasn’t wrinkled and the hems didn’t curl up, so that’s great! I wear a size 16/18 but I bought the 1X to allow for shrinking and while it’s comfortably loose it’s not too baggy looking. Lots of room in the torso. You’ll feel comfortable answering the door or getting the mail or watering your plants in your yard without looking like you’re in your sleepwear. You might even feel comfortable wearing it over your swimsuit if you are going to the beach for the day and need to have something presentable for getting gas or running errands on the way there."
3.0,"I got this for my wife (along with a few other summer hats) to try, but she just simply doesn't like this one.  She described it as dorky.  She has thick long hair, and couldn't quite figure out what to do with the top of the hat:  Hair out?  Neither way really worked for her.<br /><br />It was very crinkly all over.  On the plus side, it's very light weight and breathable."
3.0,The graphic is blurrier than photo shows
3.0,I am usually a 2-4 and definitely would be a small in these. Even though I think I have an a bigger butt than most people. I would size down.
3.0,"A good quality sock, however they claim that the sock fits shoe size 6-12. I wear a size 10 shoe and these socks are extremely tight.  If more money was involved I'd return."
3.0,"Liked the colors and fit, but it was more like a long sleeved t-shirt when I was expecting something dressier."
3.0,Material looks and feels cheap. It does for well.
3.0,"I am very glad I made a mistake and ordered a size 10. My daughters measurements according to the size chart showed she should have fit in a size 6 and by mistake I had size 10 on the order. The dress fits perfect but the size chart needs to be revised. We love the dress and she looks amazing in it! I give the dress 5 stars, but for the size only 3 stars."
3.0,Nice product but runs small a size maybe 2
3.0,"Great watch, durable, easy to use. Problem is that the battery died a few months after bought and in order to replace the battery, a tiny jewelry screwdriver is needed. We have several tiny screwdrivers but none small enough. Not sure the price of this watch is worth having to take to a jeweler to replace battery."
3.0,The overall quality of the belt was appropriate but the sizing charts have to go. The belts were returned for being too large.  I used the same method to size as I did for a belt that fit about a year ago.
3.0,The colors aren't as vibrant when you shift the wallet in the light. Its still very pretty though. And when I opened the package there was an awful chemical smell to the wallet. So I put it in a baggie with some dryer sheets and some scented washer beads to see if that would help. Haven't taken it out of the baggie yet
3.0,I love the design on it.  Having a filter is a bounus.  For me personally the problem is the earloops are too high.  It pulls my ears.
3.0,The size was smaller than expected.
3.0,Bought this as a wedding ring for my Fiancé. Look and feel is great. It is good quality. Reason for the 3 stars: do not listen to the directions. We had to return a ring because we followed directions and ordered a 1/2 size smaller. Fiancé needs two half sizes bigger!
3.0,I like the design but the fabric is not so nice.
3.0,"I usually wear a Medium, ordered a large and it was still a tad snug. Going to re-order an XL because it's a really cute shirt."
3.0,Not what I expected from Modern Miss.
3.0,Very cute but the clasp broke on the second wear.
3.0,"Very pretty maxi dress, however I'm 5'7 and it was above my ankle. Too short to wear and I'll have to try to sell it."
3.0,Great socks but some of the socks fell apart after the first wash
3.0,"Very cute, and well-made! However I ordered an XXL and received an XL so I am returning them."
3.0,It's cute but the Large was nowhere close to fitting me. The top was super tight.
3.0,"I have ordered about 5-6 dresses in this price range and all of them look nice, but leave a lot to be desired in terms of quality. Now if you are someone who likes to show off your body, all of these dresses will do great. But if you were maybe wanting to wear this out with your husband to a formal dinner or a night on the town. This will show off more than you'd like. Each one of these dresses, no matter the style, are pretty thin almost to the point of see through. Even if some may not be see through, they aren't made of the material that is thick and tight enough to hold in all of those bad spots without being noticed. It's tight, but not that tight so what you end up with is a dress hugging all your rolls and you have to keep tugging to get it to fit right.<br /><br />I won't say these are horrible as they do have their place. But just not the quality you may need if you are a bit more professional."
3.0,Runs large..not from fitting
3.0,The quality of the bad wasnt the best but gest the job done.
3.0,Beautiful color but way smaller than I expected
3.0,"Ordered size 12-14 but although looks good it fits a little large. In addition, the faux leather is too strechy so the fit is not as the Charmian steel boned that I got with same shipment. The shoulder straps are too big and bust fits a little loose...probably because I should order a size down. Another fact to take into consideration is that the back does not have extra fabric to cover;therefore, if order smaller size, it will show skin. At least that is not my liking; therefore, I will return this one.<br />I think I will order another brand that offers 100% leather with cotton lining and steel boned for better fit and waist training."
3.0,ended up being too small for my head
3.0,"Those palm leaves are NOT palm leaves! Buyer beware... other than that, these are awesome!"
3.0,"The girls suit is great, and cute, but the boys suit is made out of the same spandex material and are really short. I wanted these for my boy/girl twins, but my son won’t wear these! 🙄"
3.0,Cheap. The paint wears off easy.
3.0,"Comes out of a vacuum sealed bag so it looks really weird, after washing it was fine.<br />Have to iron, gets really wrinkled in dryer<br />Cheap material"
3.0,"The stitching around the neckline is obviously a malfunction of the machine, but because I can't replace the dress. I will be keeping it and fixing the stitching myself.<br />Otherwise, I love the shape it has a waist line that hits right at mine and flares out for the skirt which creates a nice shape (flattering for smaller chested women, Im a 34 A)  and length (it hours me about mid-calf).<br />The material is not sheer, and it is slightly stretchy which I like"
3.0,My husband said it was too big. Even though is adjustable. All the fabric that was gathered and made a huge lump in back. It is good for people who have wide head. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to fix.
3.0,Not what I expected but still nice for the price. I bought a trio to share with my daughters. We still like them.
3.0,Didn't want goggles.
3.0,Good shirt to wear around the house. Art is printed on and size is a bit wider than expected. Good price overall
3.0,"When this arrived I was quite surprised by the color as it clearly looks purple online and it is not purple at all in person. This shirt is not mauve and is a tan sandy color. For the price though, it seems to be a decent baselayer."
3.0,Fits small. My husband is an XL hat size and this is on the small side but exactly as expected.
3.0,"Living in the Pacific Northwest, I could use a good pair of boots. I was hoping these would get me through a few seasons, but it doesn't look like that is going to be the case, unfortunately. They are a fast-fashion type of boot. I wear a solid size 10, so that's what I ordered even after double-checking my size choice with the company's chart. My foot isn't chubby or slender, but it is a size 10 so I'm sure it maybe has a bit more girth than a smaller foot. I put on my thinnest boot socks to try these on and really struggled to get them on, the whole time wondering if I'm going to be able to take them off by myself. As soon as I put the first one on, my foot felt like it was in a strange position like the boot shape was forcing my foot into an unnatural foot curvature and the top of my foot was extremely tight against the boot. I actually checked to make sure I put the correct boot on that foot! I did put the other one on to see how they would be walking in them. They both were too tight and had that strange shape to the footbed, making them unwearable for me. The weird curve of the foot might only be an issue with the larger sizes, since someone else has mentioned it also. I did like the style, color, and faux leather. I do wish the soles were made of a more sturdy material, but for a fast-fashion type of boot, it's fine. They are very lightweight which is a plus, just be aware these are not for very cold weather."
3.0,"Fit was okay. on my suit it seemed the ruching was on the top of suit in the stomach area and I wished there would have been more towards the bottom, which is my problem area. I love the color. Still deciding whether to keep or return."
3.0,I was able to purchase this item through a flash  deal/sale that was available to anyone. product  did fit a bit too small not the bust area mostly around the arms it gave you very minimum space. material is  a little too thin. however  I ended up giving the bras to my daughter and it fits her way better than me. I gave than 3 star my daughter  gives them 5 STAR! (she's  16)comfortable  C CUP/ I'm  B CUP. do yes this company will be getting more purchases from me but it's on my daughter's  behave not mine.
3.0,The glued in cheap foam insert ruined these shoes for me. There's no way to swap it with something that would actually be comfortable and it was pulling away from the edges and peeling when I got them right out of the bag.<br />These shoes also reek of processed rubber and plastic.<br />Honestly if you could find a way to scrape out the glued in sole/insert and swap it with something good these could be decent costume shoes. But that's too much for me to figure out.
3.0,"Purchased for my 14 yr old travel ball catcher.  He is also the starting JV catcher.  We found that this product would be good for palm protection but doesn't protect the index finger or thumb, especially when your catching in the low 80s.<br /><br />We found it to be soft and squishy, and very easy to put on; but kind of bulky when trying to squeeze the mitt so this would be used as practice accessory at best."
3.0,Must bend to shape mouth for best fit look.<br />If you mess up the wax fitting when you fit it it’s difficult to take out wax for a retry.<br />Don’t bend to much will break. But it works .
3.0,"Good arch support, but scary to walk in. Tried adjusting the strap, wearing with socks and barefoot. My feet slip around and I’ve almost fallen a few times. 😳  I think the faux fur footbed might be the problem."
3.0,"Third eyelet on shoe broke, first day tying shoe. Pretty disappointed."
3.0,Nice Bib!
3.0,Very disappointed.  It only plays the music for a few seconds and flashes.  Over-priced for what it does.  It was purchased as a gift for my 9 yr. old grandson.  I ordered after reading other reviews that it was a great toy.
3.0,"I didn’t really like the material, I thought it was cotton it’s more so polyester"
3.0,Feels cheaply made not worth the money I paid for it!!
3.0,"Too small.  Return was easy.  Reordered twice and settled on a full size larger than I normally wear.  Were comfortable, light weight and waterproof.  Will have to wait until next winter to see how warm they are."
3.0,I don’t feel right giving this a bad review because it is extremely soft and well made but the cut is awful for someone who has any type of curves. I’m 5’4” and weight 145lbs and this was horrible on me. So bad that I wouldn’t want photo evidence of what it looked like on me. It looked like a tent even with the belt. So my suggestion is if you have hips leave this one for others. Super bummed because I wanted to like it.
3.0,The quality did not look worth the price and it was not black it was grayish black
3.0,This dress is not for large chested women.
3.0,3rd one over the years - great boards - for some reason (on this the third) the polarization of the magnetic pieces are  opposites and a pain to stack when game over -
3.0,Sizes run small otherwise nice shirt.<br />Have it to someone smaller than me she loved it so it worked out good
3.0,"Don’t know if the situation I faced is same for other sizes or colors. I ordered XXL in the Blue color. ‘As expected’ is correct in that Made in China XXL is closer to XL or even L in actual sizing. Sleeves, always a concern for me, we’re adequate (I’m a 36” shirt sleeve). Body length just long enough if you are wearing just a thin layer underneath.<br /><br />The letdown was the lining was ugly plaid, not the attractive speckled pattern. Inside collar is black, not light grey (not as annoying as the plaid lining). Amazon gave me a partial credit to avoid returning the sweater. I would have rather known if any of the inventory matched the pictures. But when you shop at Amazon, you know that not something you can expect to find out. You’ll only know if the picture is corrected and you can decide if that suits you. Otherwise what you’ll get is a coin toss.<br /><br />It is comfortable. And zipped up you can’t tell the style gaff. But it subtracts at least a star from the rating. Zipper is small and catches a bit when unzipping. May not have a long life span. That’s the other star deducted."
3.0,"It’s such a cute mask. But it won’t protect you from germs. It’s a sheet of rhinestone with no extra layer underneath. If you’re looking for protection, don’t buy it. If you want it for fashion, get it."
3.0,"Even though it said runs small, I ordered a size bigger. I wear a xl and ordered a xxl. It fits like a large."
3.0,cute idea. stretchy material. not what I expected from the picture.
3.0,"I bought this to use as a base layer in a trip to Alaska, in the winter. I read many posts comparing synthetic to merino wool and what made me pay the high price were the comments from people from Norway, affirming that merino wool is far superior to synthetic when it comes down to wearing it for long periods without stinking as bad as synthetic. They also claimed that when wet it retains heat better.<br />Pros:<br />  Great fit.<br />  Breathes a bit better?<br />Cons:<br />  Away more expensive than synthetic.<br />  Heavier.<br />  Bulkier.<br />  Catches everything.<br />Other thoughts:<br />  Because I was able to take showers and wash my clothes regularly, I couldn't test if merino wool would really not stink. Also, I could not test if when wet it would retain heat better, I never got wet! It did not rain and every time I started to sweat, I opened the zippers.<br />  I am comparing this product to a [[ASIN:B006SRT0EG Duofold Men's Heavy Weight Double Layer Thermal Shirt, Black, Medium]], which I paid only US$14.95 in Nov/2016. I also bought it for US$ 24.46 in Dec/2015. I am not sure how the price can oscillate so much, but the price is still several times cheaper than this product.<br />Bottom line:<br />  I would not recommend it, since the synthetic is lighter, less bulkier and for the type of activities that I was doing (hiking, dog sledding, snow mobile, waiting for the aurora borealis and so on) the synthetic did as good of a job as the merino wool, with the advantage of being much cheaper!"
3.0,Good one. The sleeves kept falling off and the top was way too large than what is mentioned in the size chart.
3.0,the grey pair fits fine but the black pair i have to squeeze into..  Not the same fit for sure but over all they are fine..
3.0,The quality was excellent but the fit was too small even though I ordered a larger size.
3.0,"The coat was beautiful and well made but definitely too small. I bought it for my grandson who is 15 days old, size 3-6 month it was too small. The inseam of the coat from the top of zipper to the toes was 22”, my boy is 21 1/4” long. The people who are making this coats in China have to realize that we In America have big babies and if they are making coats for us it should fit our kids. I had to exchange the coat for a 12 month and hopehe has room to wiggle"
3.0,"I will wear them and they are comfortable enough. Not soft. Wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase again. I have purchased similarly priced pjs that are softer. Full elastic waist band, which I do not like."
3.0,"It's a SNUG fit. I wear a size 10US but I upsized to an 11US. The soles of the boots are THIN!! I drove my truck comfortably without interference from the boots. I also wore them outside to an appointment which is why I'm telling you they wont last long with prolonged outside wear. These boots are perfect if you're going out but just walking from the car to the front door of an establishment. I would NOT wear them outside in inclement weather at all!! These boost are honestly overpriced house shoes. While walking in them I could definitely feel the ground and wouldn't dare step on rocks/pebbles etc.... They are definitely cute but have zero foot protection/ support. They are also so oblong/out of true shape that you MUST mark them with an L and R. Cute/eye catching ""boot"" but I may as well stop and purchase the actual "" Moon Boots""..  Too bad I've already gotten 5 different types of these by cape robbin BEFORE seeing how they were in person."
3.0,"The torso section fit as expected and the color was nice but the arm holes were too small. If i had tried to wear a thick sweater it would've  been too uncomfortable. Also, it is quite thin and I am not sure it would have been sufficient warmth for the type of winters that we get. I ended up returning it"
3.0,"I do love how large this bag is, but one of the handles broke the second day that I used it.  I didn't feel as if there was a lot of weight, so I was disappointed.  I was able to correct it by tying a bigger knot, and we have used it without issues several times now.  Like I said, I love the space and the amount of things that you can carry!"
3.0,Seem like good quality but the lenses are unbearable - the yellow tint makes everything much brighter
3.0,"Looks cute, but veeery small/skinny, Don’t hold tight to ear"
3.0,"I recently received this for an engagement  present because i didn't want a ring  ... The product states it does not tarnish ! .....THIS IS A LIE !!! I like the necklace  but now I question the quality ,workmanship and even the authenticity of the material ...is it silver ...are the crystals genuine ? how do i find out and whats Amazon''s guarantee on such matters are  ? please Amazon contact me ...also i want to know if this is pewter ,  is it lead-free ? I need to know I'm pregnant and need to be concerned of the welfare of my child !<br /><br />  Thank you , M.A."
3.0,Huge they're massive for my face.
3.0,"Set was nice , but it would fit a 1 year old. Very small"
3.0,The quality isn’t lacking but they are uncomfortably tight. I wear a women’s size 7 and was sure to purchase the correct size range.
3.0,"I found this to be kinda large. The open crotch part literally goes from the waistband in the front to the back so it's a very giant opening, goes way above your stomach. Also you can't tell from the picture, it's not a fitted piece. There ends up being a bunch of material scrunched up above the waist band in the back. Maybe I just have too small a waist. The color was beautiful though."
3.0,"These pajamas get the job done, which in my case was unbutton for easy breast feeding overnight. They aren't very soft and are quite thick and warm. The colors are a bit faded without having undergone much washing yet. Not my favorite overall but you get what you pay for of course."
3.0,The picture of this earrings looks better than the actual earrings and the color in the picture is darker pink.  Sorry!
3.0,"...but I had reservations about the tassel. The right height, comfortable, nice leather. Wasn't crazy about the tassel and the brown heel on the black shoe...so I returned it."
3.0,it fits good but it gave pain to my leg because of hard urethane base
3.0,Bought two items both the same size and this one was just too large even though they were both the same size when ordered.
3.0,Thankful for the return. I wished it had fit it was pretty.
3.0,"Really cute TINY charms - the majority of those in my order were skulls/skeletons, which was exactly what I was hoping for. I would say all the charms are the perfect size for earrings or charm bracelets. There were also a few ghosts, witches, pumpkins, spiders, and bats.<br />The reason I am only giving it 3 stars because it is advertised to contain between 75 and 100 pieces and mine only had 59 pieces. Most of them were very very tiny so they really didn't weigh much; therefore, there should have been at least a dozen more in the bag if not two dozen.<br />I kind of feel like I got a little bit ripped off. Because of that, I probably won't buy from them again."
3.0,Fits my Pandora but slides over separator beads
3.0,was a little disappointed because I thought they would have more blue in them....mostly gray and black.
3.0,"for a low quality product its ok, but thought it would be a bit heavier and the lens is more easy to change for and optical lens change"
3.0,"These come in sets of two- the one I received included one dark tie of average thickness, and one purple-ish thin one. I actually really liked the purple one and want to wear it more, however it is too thin for me. I'm a larger guy that usually wears XL sized clothing, and super thin ties often look comically small on my frame. The other tie seems to look a little better, but unless I'm dressing up as the Men In Black or going to a funeral, I don't often wear such dark colored ties. I wish the purple one was the thicker one and the thin one was the dark one. But either way, this is an interesting combo because chances are you'll find a tie that works for you, either color or size-wise.<br />I just wish they had switched them around, as both are a compromise in one way or another for me personally."
3.0,"I love these slippers BUT I'm so sad that after 5 months of wearing them, they are completely worn out looking. Not the soles but the outsides and there is a hole already from the stitching coming apart. I do wear these everyday as inside shoes only but I don't feel after only 5 months they shouldnt be so worn."
3.0,Cheap material. It says it's fleece but it feels like felt.  Also wish it was longer.  Other than that it looks just like the picture.
3.0,Very nicely made shirt but runs very small. Had to return it.
3.0,The tail was awesome but the matching ears are just glued onto a Bobby pin.
3.0,"I really like the concept, holds cards and money securely,. The leather is cheap and stuff.  The elastic band has a very large knot where it's down together.  This is not a 49 buck wallet."
3.0,"Runs large, not just loose. Plasticy and very thick logo. Material and graphic are not as pictured. Same design, but expected the soft, thinner material as advertised."
3.0,"These stud earrings backings are a help for heavier earrings although I could not tell the difference between these and others like them, so I really do not understand what makes these superior."
3.0,not keeps time perfectly but design is okay.when you take off this watch will stop in 2 hours.
3.0,"I bought an XXL due to fleece lined leggings typically not having as much stretch as regular leggings, but that wasn’t the case with these. I could have probably gone with an XL which I typically wear between a L and XL depending on style and brand. They are super stretchy and soft, but I do wish they were warmer!"
3.0,"Size up one at least.  It's a nice enough sweater and arrived vac-packed.  So you gotta let it regain some plump.  I removed the hood and put it in a drawer, but the sweater-digan is snug and large fits like a medium."
3.0,Stone is much smaller than what is depicted.
3.0,Have not used it yet. However the inside part with the zipper is very narrow.
3.0,My voice was extremely muffled.  The mask is very thick (even without the filter).
3.0,"Gave as replacement item to a friend. I thought they were very thin and flimsy but she said they were okay.<br />Wish they had been a heavier guage. I would never purchase these again however, for myself."
3.0,"They bunch up pretty often, I find myself pulling them down alot unlike other brands of boxer briefs.The price makes these a winner though."
3.0,Material not very good quality.
3.0,"The style and fabric are exactly what I wanted, but it was ridiculously small. I have purchased Lands End clothing and had no problem with fit and nail this piece. Sent it back."
3.0,This hat is funny and cute no to say soft! BUT only one ear works I would not recommend if your looking for something that you would get complements for.
3.0,Cute shape and good size. The strap with the chain shown in the picture is super short so if you put in on your shoulder the purse is in your armpit.<br />It does come with a longer strap to attach but the other strap doesn't detach. There are a few areas where you can see where the lining was cut off from the swing machine also.<br />Overall it works for the price.
3.0,This shirt is soft and comfortable. I would have given this a better rating. But it was either damaged before I got it or it snagged immediately out of the package. It also seems to just barely fit. My son is 13. The sizing says it is for a 15-16yo. My son is a bit on the large size. But it seems to be a little bit off in the description.
3.0,"I wear a 38 C and I bought the largest size they sold. The criss cross material on the chest was tight and felt to thick to wear for too long. Also the band was tight. Not much support at all. If you have a smaller chest size, this probably would work for you."
3.0,There is still some bounce..... a good medium impact bra. Easy on and off.
3.0,"I like compression shirts to help support my posture while working long shifts.<br /><br />I usually wear a medium, so that's what I ordered.<br /><br />This was way too small. It was difficult to get on. and the arm holes were too small. They were chaffing my armpits.<br /><br />I won't wear this.<br /><br />If i got a large it would probably have worked better.<br /><br />Order a size up"
3.0,Look faded out get what u pay for i wouldnt let my wife out of the house in em
3.0,"Like the color, maybe fits a child"
3.0,To see through and runs very small
3.0,"Let's just say these shoes aren't too comfortable but, with a suit on and these you'll look great... You have to break them in before they can feel somewhat comfortable, I would advice getting a half size bigger and buy some quality cushions to go inside the shoes."
3.0,This bra does what it’s supposed to do: supports and allows for very low-cut tops. But both the band and cups run a little small. I’m going to try a larger size because I don’t think the smaller one will hold up if it has to stretch.
3.0,"I love the style of this but right off the bat it lost a stone.....but, I still love it .."
3.0,"Hideous color, but so comfortable I chose not to return them."
3.0,Shirts run smaller 5han size
3.0,"It's too long for me, who stands just 5 feet.<br />I wish if there were variety of length to choose from."
3.0,"This blouse IS adorable. BUT, be sure to order up at least a size larger than you normally would. I usually wear a medium. I ordered a large & it's a bit snug. It does show my muffin-top. Which I'm NOT happy about. If you have any extra pounds around your middle, this top WILL accentuate that. Also, if you're tall and/or have a long torso, I don't think you'll be happy with the length. I really do think this top is best suited for a thin petite woman."
3.0,I went up a size to medium and it was still a little too small.  but you get what you pay for...
3.0,I love the pattern and style of this shirt. The size is strange as it is too large and blousey on top (falls off my shoulders) but tight around the bottom (rides up die to being tight). I would liken it to an upside down triangle becuase it is very large on top and small on the bottom.
3.0,"The sizing chart is wrong and the dress runs REALLY small.<br />I was impressed with the quality of the the dress overall but it has ZERO stretch, it runs small, and you will leave a trail of fringe wherever you go so if you are trying to disappear somewhere, you WILL be found! I was finding fringe for days after I wore this dress. The accessories were of a high quality too. Very durable and THOSE stretch at least!"
3.0,Shipped fast and good presentation. I'm glad I opened it first before giving however as the chain was knotted in two seperate places. My authenticity card said $275 not $325 but still nice.
3.0,"Runs a little tight. I’m at the border between large and XL most days. If you are in the same size bracket…<br />For that skin tight fit, go large<br />For something more comfortable for every day, xl."
3.0,"The finish on the ring was not complete and the metal from underneath showed through.  The design was cute but the finish was a turn off.  But for the price, I got exactly what I paid for."
3.0,"As a teacher of kids with special needs, I know compression can help with sensory and adhd. I bought this for my son who fits that description, but he doesn't like them because the bottom rolls up on him and he's constantly having to adjust it. So this unfortunately this was a miss for us."
3.0,Its a nice necklace I did get a lot of compliments.  However did not have it for a week before a piece became unglued.  Please note I am very careful. With ALL my jewelry.  I purchased some jewelry glue in hopes of fixing it. Fingers crossed<br />8-3-2020<br />It didn't work. Nice but unfortunately breaks quickly
3.0,"I guess I was expecting too much after seeing this recommended by a fashion blogger I follow. I was hesitant because it was inexpensive but the reviews were good so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was disappointed that the quality and fit weren't what I was hoping they'd be. But for the price, it's a pretty cute style/cut, it's just not for me so it's going back. Glad I gave it a shot though..."
3.0,They are very cheaply made. I gave a 5 star rating  for value for money  because it is still a great deal. You can’t expect the best quality when it’s less than $2 per ring.
3.0,when I think XL  I'm not expecting together something more along the size of M or L if I'm being charitable.
3.0,"These are really cute but they're so tight on the back side the rushing isn't noticeable so it doesn't actually fit the shape of your bum like the picture.<br />The quality feels alright so over all not bad, but not butt lifting like they're supposed to."
3.0,Watch is nice but difficult to put on by yourself. It one very long piece that you wind around your wrist. Didn't realize that when purchased.
3.0,"Fit is great! I am 5’2” and 170#<br /><br />My only complaint is that the pocket is not there which is a bummer!!! But, the fit is so good that I’m going to keep them anyways."
3.0,The fabric is cheap to the touch and stretchy like nylon its a beautiful design but don't let anyone feel the fabric i gave 3 stars because it fit and is pretty
3.0,"Unfortunately this dress causes the dreaded uniboob for those of us who have larger chests. It's a gorgeous print and a beautiful silhouette if it just offered a couple more inches up top. Instead of draping gorgeously and delicately, I've got sateen and mesh stretched across my front like I'm trying to smuggle cantaloupes. Sent it back because a larger size wasn't available - super disappointed."
3.0,"Very cute, but just a little bit smaller than expected. Still fits OK though :)"
3.0,"These weren’t as dark as I thought they would be, the feel was cozy and high waisted. Way longer than I hoped and I am 5’7"
3.0,"Adore this jacket. Only flaw, inside seam ripped within about a month. Luckily I can sew"
3.0,"This was not as I’d expected.  In the pix, it has a different look.  What I got was a skirt with a hanginging apron on it.  I’ll do some alteration magic to make it work.  Overall happy, but ..."
3.0,Fits a lil snug! Otherwise very cute!
3.0,Material is cheap and thin.
3.0,earring were smaller than it appears
3.0,"The seller isn't misrepresenting this item at all.  It's a nice size and has plenty of compartments and its very attractive, but it is also super light and flimsy.  The strap is thin and feels cheap, and there is no way to swap it as it is sewed directly to the bag on one side.  Out of the package, all the zippers were half-zipped and had to be forced open then re-zipped.  I have zero confidence that the zippers will hold up to regular usage. Instead of using it as a handbag, I now play to try using it to carry my drawing supplies.<br /><br />I recommend ordering this only as a light duty bag."
3.0,Great Product but gave it 3 stars because it doesn't have Pockets!! If it had Zipper Pockets I would have given it 5 Stars!!! Please start making these and your hoodie ones with Zipper Pockets!!
3.0,It’s a very cute dress. It fitted perfectly but it looked a little bit old.
3.0,"I had too return this item it's too big even if i ordered the smallest size. Material is excellent, if i were bigger i guess it would have fit perfectly"
3.0,"Sooo I love how thick the ring is, but the bolt sign is so dang small, it's silly. Also, ring size is off for sure. Go bigger!  I wear an 8 ring with my chunky fingers lol.  Lastly, it has a bunch of scratches and the bolt symbol is less than 2inch<br /><br />It's a gift and I'll just buy another elsewhere.... this, my son even laughed at it smh"
3.0,I ordered a large because I wear a size 91/2 shoe. There is no elastic in the back and they just fell off my feet.
3.0,I like the great fit Get size larger than normal size.
3.0,"I ordered the large or extra large, but either way the fit was tiny. It fits, just not oversized how it looks on the model. I'm holding onto it because I'm hoping to lose some weight and maybe it will fit a little better then. It is well constructed and very cute, and the fabric is suuuuuper soft. If you're thin already, but you want an oversized fit, I'd say go at least two sizes up."
3.0,"I bought  2XL for my grandma, but they didn't even fit my mom who's a large size.<br />Returning the product!"
3.0,"Love the top, but it runs a bit smaller than stated."
3.0,LARGER THAN I EXPECTED.  GO QUITE A WAYS UP MY ARM AND I DON'T HAVE A SMALL ARM.
3.0,"The fabric is very, very thin, I hope they will last on my long trip...."
3.0,I feels too delicate for my planned use but I'll enjoy it anyway. I'm looking for a more sturdy gold chain for a pendant I'd like to securely wear.
3.0,"This piece is warmer, and feels slightly rough, for a piece to go over a suit in hot weather. Due to this it's not my go-to, but it otherwise fits and looks decent."
3.0,"It is cute, but much smaller than it appears."
3.0,These are cute but the size 5 I ordered was way too big! She is 16 months old and wears a 5 in other shoes but these are really big.
3.0,"The quality of the garment is great! However, I followed the sizing providing in the product images and the garment arrived an inch smaller in the bust than listed for the XL. Also the arms are tailored very tightly. I will reorder but likely two sizes larger than I originally purchased and will tailor here in the US if needed."
3.0,Necklace frequently hangs up on clothing
3.0,"The quality of the shirt and the thickness of the material are great. But you absolutely have to size up.<br />I wear a Large but buy XL when I want loose and long. This XL fits 100% like a Large.  You absolutely have to size up. And if you usually size up one, then you need to size up 2 for this one.<br />It’s definitely a longer length shirt but It’s not long enough to qualify for “tunic length”."
3.0,"I bought this expecting a lightweight sweater. It’s actually more like a shirt material. I do like the design and fit, but it’s just not what I expected. Material is very thin and not really soft. Suited for summer months."
3.0,"The shirt looks great. The material is not soft cotton though, and it’s a bit thick. I’ll be cutting off the collar for sure. If you’re looking for a soft cotton T, this is not the best choice. It’s similar to the plain T’s you can buy at Michaels for crafting."
3.0,"ook way too long to receive a product that was poorly rapped and with a case that was broken when I received it. Then the double edge razor didn't even work at all, it didn't bend the blade so it would work. Atleast I was able to receive a refund quickly."
3.0,The picture shows a dark green while the description says Kelly green; I ignored the description and went with the picture.  The color is Kelly green and I wanted dark green.
3.0,Awesome lighting effects but really heavy shoe
3.0,Nice dress but fits small. Had to return.
3.0,"Followed the sizing instructions to the letter even though my husband was really concerned bc it was going to be way larger than every other belt he owns. I insisted on following the instructions and he was correct. The belt was way too big. Fortunately due to the style he was able to cut it down to fit. Recommend anyone purchasing go for their usual size and NOT what seller guidelines state. Because he was able to cut it down and it is a beautiful best, giving 3 stars."
3.0,A lot bigger then I thought and more of an army green. I’m 5’3” 130lbs and it was very big and longer then I thought. A small would of been perfect but I kept reading that it ran small.. I put a belt on it and it looks much better. Material is nice though.
3.0,"Bottoms were great but top is wonky. Kind of crooked and the bottom is loose, makes the cups look weird. Not sure I’ll be keeping."
3.0,It came quickly and was as described.
3.0,"If you want a dress that is shorter, this is good, but it was way to short on me and I am 5'6"
3.0,Fit is too small and very very snug on straps.
3.0,"Be warned.  The watch pictured is not a vintage Precision by Gruen watch.  It is a new Precision by Gruen watch made by MZ Berger.  As of two years ago, you could pick one up at Kohl's for $23.  The velcro band shown is cheap.  It does have a rotating bezel.  It's not bad for a cheap watch.  But, the $103 price asked by this vendor is completely ridiculous."
3.0,"I love these workout pants! The material is very soft, stretch, and I do not have see through issues HOWEVER, every pair I’ve owned, except one pair have ripped in either the middle of the butt or in the enter thigh. This makes me upset because they always tend to rip In the middle of a workout. I’ve owned Nike pants that have lashes for many years. My purple pair ripped before I could get a good photo."
3.0,The material was very thin and didn’t meet my expectations.  I’m keeping it but not impressed with the quality.
3.0,"Very simple, but nice rosary.  I wish the crucifix was larger and said something else beside &#34;Jerusalem.&#34;  Overall, it was fine."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:cdc9b108fce90844ab65443b73786802]] I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. It’s a nice color and the top is pretty flattering with the off the shoulder look. The material isn’t what I was expecting, it’s kind of cheap if anything. It also has a strange little tie that just makes the dress look kind of frumpy. All in all it’s OK, I would wear it may be as a beach cover-up."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2c8f8c0be45d5784f96fdaf4f46eb610]] The Saved By The Max pop up restaurant is currently in West Hollywood. Since it’s August and it’s hot we wanted loose costume clothing. His fit fine. His dress shirts are 32/33 ordered him a 42 jersey and fit as expected. I’m a 36D bought a 42 and it wasn’t as loose as Kelly Kapowski’s! I was expecting loose and drapey but that’s not what I got. I would suggest buying the next size up. Quality was great, no random frays, letters were neatly sewn on."
3.0,"There  are no exact same pair so if you wanted these for a nipple piercing I'd say no, but my girlfriend and I love the material. I use the pastel pink for my septum and blowing my nose has never been easier. She uses the black one for her tragus and has felt less irritation due to the weight. I wish the balls were less awkward though. The balls don't match the jewelry whatsoever. But you get what you pay for."
3.0,I had this item sent to my son in GA ... it arrived broken .. a screw was out..<br />They also were too big !
3.0,"This was not received looking like the picture. It is definitely different and I know this because I already have one and wanted another one. Logo is washed out, does not say “just do it”.Hood strings not the same, zipper has white fabric. the authentic Nike one has blue.  Does not look authentic."
3.0,"the material is very thin, I expected thicker quality fabric."
3.0,Yhis is okay
3.0,Like the price and the coolers but quality a little cheapy. The band part is a bit rough not as comfy as I would like. Also if the band does get wet it takes forever to dry. Wish it was a bit more quality.
3.0,The ring itself looks nice just much bigger than anticipated.
3.0,"Plenty of ability to move about in them. Easy to wear.  Pretty airy.<br /><br />The fabric, however, is a bit rough on the skin.  I'm not a huge fan of the feel.  I can wear it, but i don't want to wear it for long periods and I can't even imagine trying to excercise in it."
3.0,"The finish of the chain is not pretty, the color is scattered uneven<br />The stones are fine but they have holes on them"
3.0,It's like made from bikini material. The item is pricey for the material. I have no boobs so it bunches up and in pointy on the sides because of the square openings folding over. Just not for us tiny boobed ladies.
3.0,I love that it's slim for my small wrist but the snap is horrible.  It literally comes undone several times a day. I probably won't use it much cause I don't want to lose my fitbit sense!!!!
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:edc0209d8f650a86588532d12f65b45]] As my title states, the costume is actually very nice. It fits well, and the design is actually present. But… the hat… the hat had hot glue strings everywhere and the hot glue is visible on almost every place it’s used. It is fine for camera, but looks cheap up close."
3.0,Not great quality but it will do for what I wanted - to use it as a sun umbrella.  White is not really white - it is more of a cream color.
3.0,Size is a little off. My son is 2. I should have gotten a size smaller... otherwise pretty good. But when size is off. It defetes the purpose. He cant wear them now.<br />Packaging was great tho.
3.0,My profession is very hard on footwear and finding a boot that holds up to miles of walking and twisting is impossible. I gave these a try because of the reviews and price but they did not hold up well at all. In less than 90 days the inside edge of the sole seperated from the boot so I could see my big toe. These boots where comfortable and fit well they are just not up to the task of hard work. For a less demanding profession they should be good which is why I still gave 3 stars they are comparable to boots from other low cost stores.
3.0,"Beautiful dress! The fit was not a plus size fit. The waist and bust was extremely tight. If ordering this dress, order several sizes larger than needed. Beautiful, just plan for sizing issues."
3.0,Great fit just need more support in the bra because I do high intensity exercises.
3.0,These seem like a pretty OK pair of light duty boots for the price. I like to put Odor Eater insoles for extra cushion as well as smell. These boots feel like a 1/4 size  small to begin with and the insoles make them way too tight. Oh well.  I like all my other Goodyear boots and if these don;t make the cut somebody will get them at Goodwill. So goes online shoe shopping.
3.0,Super comfortable but it’s super see through so I can’t wear to the gym.
3.0,"Good waist trimmer for the price but the wires in the back of corset starts to poke you in your lower back after wearing it for a while. Stays in place as your working out or walking definitely makes your stomach sweat too which like and it keeps your posture upright when your sitting, helps with back pain too"
3.0,It was a VERY NICE Purse but it was just to big for want I wanted for. Thanks
3.0,They are very round ...but fun to wear. A girl can't have too many sun glasses ..
3.0,I loved this dress when I saw it. I took out of the bag and the material was stiff and itchy. When I put it on it fit well but wouldn’t zip.
3.0,It is beatufil but I can't drive with
3.0,does not sit flush with your neck it is very wide even if you use the adjusters and not like pictures. does not cover entire neck
3.0,Great quality shirt but runs a full size to a size and a half too small.  Had to pay the postage to return it.
3.0,"Easy on is probably fine for many people... as a small woman, they're not workable for me."
3.0,Ran small. Forced to purchase colors one doesn't want. Warm enough for California and tips work fine.
3.0,The material is a heavier weight than I was expecting.  I washed and dried hoping it would shrink but it didn't seem to.  I'll order a smaller size next time.
3.0,Smaller than it looks but my wife enjoyed the gesture the chain looks flimsy but my wife put it on another chain.
3.0,Too flimsy for a full busted bra
3.0,"The item is beautiful; the price is more than reasonable. The only issue is that the main link that holds the bracelet together comes off easily. The bracelet fell off my wrist twice already. Just replace it with a stronger link when you get it. Other than that, no issues"
3.0,"The dress is okay, but it’s not the same pattern as shown.  Very loose and much larger than the same size purchased in another print."
3.0,I'm wasn't happy with the quality of this set so I gifted it to my daughter because she really liked it.  A 3 for average... I am use to higher priced products I guess.
3.0,Love the shirt. Only issues it the stitching started to ravel after the first wash.
3.0,"This veil was well made, but it wasn't what I was looking for. There was only one picture available. There are combs that secure the veil on both sides, but I didn't know that until it arrived. I guess I have a big head because the veil seemed to smash my face when I tried it on."
3.0,the shirt fit well. the only thing is that the white stripe looked off white instead of bleach white like the collar
3.0,Would like to Re-purchase in a size that fits
3.0,Did not live up to past purchases of glasses on line. I needed sunglasses to read outside. These don't fit as well as past ones did. Vision works well though.
3.0,"GF writing in. Ladies this is not squat proof at all. Its a cute set, not the most comfortable fabric. I don't know that i would wear this to a gym or on a long walk but maybe for pics or a quick outing."
3.0,It’s manageable
3.0,Maybe just my personal body chemistry but my shin and even cloths are stain black from oxidation. Otherwise looks great but I can't enjoy it during the summer.
3.0,"They are cute, but very wide on my daughter’s foot. I would have returned them, but she likes to play dress up in them."
3.0,"It took awhile to arrive, it’s not dark blue it’s black and too tight for the top while it fits well for The bottom. I am not sure if BH the socks will stay on though since B I have not worn it out yet but for reference I’m 128lbs and 5”3 in height but medium was too tight though that is what I wear comfortably. I didn’t feel like returning because I am thinking of repurposing it"
3.0,They are lil tight were u put ur foot in for him! After get squeezed on wear for few hours he has ring on his foot! So there ok i guess! Need more room!
3.0,My daughter loves it. Unfortunately we’ve had it two weeks and had to fix it four times.
3.0,Giving it a 3 star rating because I ought it as an xmas present for my cousin and the packaging was torn in a few spots. It makes it look like a last minute gift
3.0,Nice coat for the price. A little on the snug side.
3.0,"I like it, but it's not the one I ordered... I ordered the black one with the face icon.. I like it anyway.."
3.0,"These are adult sized socks. I bought them for my 4t Daughter and they ended up being my size. They are really cute so I decided to keep them. ""Big girls"" means adult I guess, lol."
3.0,"To start with, the top split from the bottom the first time I tried it on. I sewed it up and wore it to a Christmas party. By the time I was leaving the party the overalls were falling apart. Such a bummer because they really were comfortable and fit really cute. Too bad this can only be worn once because it just starts unraveling :("
3.0,"Came broken, but thankfully I used to make jewelry and repaired it. Cute for Stevie Nicks costume"
3.0,"I don't wanna be mean since it is a really good design, but, the print is a sticker. I'm honestly a little scared to wash this because I was able to peel the corner off easily so if this goes in the laundry it'll probably come right off, also the image quality is kinda questionable. The hoodie itself is really comfortable and soft on the inside, it feels thick enough I could wear it out on a 40° day at the lowest. Besides the design itself seeming like it's going to slip off at any moment this was pretty decent. Just be careful with the print as best as you can."
3.0,Had a similar look to a pair of sunglasses i already own and did not live up to my expectation. Just not a good fit for me
3.0,Advertised 5 pair only received 4 pair. Otherwise are as described
3.0,Doesn't look as it is on the picture
3.0,The fabric seemed plastically and it runs small.
3.0,Watchband was nice until I washed it now it’s tight.
3.0,"Very pretty but the vine does not stay in place. The vine has a very long post which you have to bend so it clips to your ear like a paper clip. Unfortunately this does not work and the earring flops, spins off the earlobe, and doesn't stay upright. The post is also very pokey and constantly pokes the back of my ear.<br /><br />Very hard to wear!!"
3.0,the sizes definitely run quite small.
3.0,"This dress fits true to size, however, I am very disappointed that the color was way off. I ordered the “wine red” and it’s more of a pinky red. Fabric is shiny and reminds me of a geisha Halloween costume."
3.0,"I like the color, good for enlightenment, but the piling is too much and it's plenty hard to get clean, esp. the cuffs.So I wouldn't buy another one."
3.0,"Really cute slippers, they just have to be darned a lot.  Wear out rather quickly."
3.0,The material wasn’t as thick or soft as I thought but they are ok
3.0,I’m 5’8 and it seemed a little long on me and the chest area was too big. I probably should of ordered a size down.
3.0,"I bought this as a pregnancy reveal outfit for my daughter to wear and the fit was a bit off.  The onsie was short and wide and the tutu was really long.  Overall the proportion was just not quite right for her.  And we didn’t even use the headband.  The stitching was poorly done and the bow was too big and floppy.  I like the gold glitter lettering though  All in all it worked for what we bought it for, but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend."
3.0,I ordered a medium & im more like a small ish medium depending on.. but I like my tshirts a lil looser & this was quite a bit smaller then expected for a medium. So size up. But it’s cute shirt good design.
3.0,Cheaply Made. Broke after 1 Wear
3.0,"Shipping took longer than expected. One of the green pair arrived with the wire unattached to the resin; hope can repair.<br />Rest are cute, lightweight."
3.0,Kids like them but seams aren't holding up with machine washing.
3.0,Too hot for me.
3.0,This 3/4 sleeve shirt fits fine except that the neck hole is much too big.
3.0,A little too big for my face but otherwise perfect!
3.0,Great dress just too tight in the shoulder and chest area in a size M. I am a 34D so a large would be better. It was a great length and look!
3.0,"The first one was really pretty. I purchased two additional identical fascinators and they diminished in quality between each one.  The mesh was smooshed. the feathers more sparse. the trim on the edge not even the same color. These were to be for my little bridesmaids and rather than go back to the drawing board I embellished them in their favorite colors and ""fixed"" it. A foam head, a little water, pins, fray check and re distributing the feathers so they looked more similar I think did the trick. I guess the price was too good to be true, but I made lemonade out of lemons here..."
3.0,"I bought these rings- yep I paid very little for them so I shouldn't complain.  They are cute but turned very quickly. I wanted to wear one or two instead of my wedding rings when I went to the gym, pool or on walks. Some are bigger than others so you have to wear them strategically or they will fall off =)"
3.0,They fit great but they had a tare by the string 😞😞
3.0,"Very silky.<br />The arm band things are kind of annoying, and the collar in the back doesn't lay flat."
3.0,Wanted to love these but something about them wasn't perfect. Like the amount of pockets though.
3.0,It's super wrinkly and I don't wear it often because it's a little small and falls off my shoulders a lot... it's a pain to keep putting on my shoulders again.
3.0,Beautiful shirt except the sleeves were too long and looked silly on me
3.0,"I've had my case for a good bit now and I must say that I'm 70 percent satisfied. The waterpoof capability is 100 percent. However, the screen protector scratches very easily. And I mean EASILY."
3.0,A little too wide for what I was looking for but its ok
3.0,very small on the arm length:(
3.0,"The chain was not the similar thickness as the one my wife owns,,, however,,, good price,,, is a beautiful piece,,, especially,,, the way it sparkles due to its diamond cut,,,"
3.0,"It’s a nice heavy shacket. But part of the reason I selected it was because the color was such a striking teal green. When it arrived it’s actual grass green and not even close to the pictured color. It’s not a monitor thing. It was so far off there’s no way it was a monitor issue. Big disappointment. Otherwise it’s nice quality. Size is oversized. Generally between large and XL. For reference 5’5’ height, 189 lbs."
3.0,"This is not a bad shirt, but fits very small. Almost to small to predict what size to get. I ordered 2 sizes down, and it was still to small."
3.0,I don't care for the washed out faded color of the sleeves or the fabric this made from. Shipping to return cost more than the shirt itself so I am keeping it.
3.0,"I run and bike. The leather band was awful for exercising in the southwest heat. I loved this band while it lasted: lightweight, waterproof, comfortable. But it tore where the pin passes through the band in less than one year. Nonetheless, at this price I'll probably buy 2 more and hope they last me as long as I have the watch."
3.0,"It runs small. Definitely order a size bigger. I ordered a 3t for my 2 year old whom is pretty petite and the dress is tight, fits like a 2t.<br /><br />Amazon said my review goes against guidelines? 🤣"
3.0,Missing crystal. Not gift quality. Sloppy manufacturing.
3.0,"Wearable if you can get past the cheap material. I should have purchased a size smaller because of the give in the material.  You may use a belt or scarf to dress up. It is lightweight smooth on the outside, but the material is irritating to my skin. Not recommended for picky shoppers. I will give to the resale of giveaway to charity. :)"
3.0,This watch is okay. The only issue I have with the watch is I can't set the date properly. I don't know if it's just the one I have or if they're all like that. But it does come with a battery and a cleaning towel.
3.0,The back is stretchy elastic so definitely buy smaller than you normally wear.
3.0,loved the case but the bar between the 2 lens is a little too high. great if your going to a look but not everyday style for me
3.0,"Looks nice, but it is completely see-through, which to me, defeats the purpose."
3.0,"Nice dress just way too long, almost to ankle"
3.0,Did not come with the rubber insert needed to have it lock in place so not very useful.
3.0,Not great but not worth returning. I’ll wear them to work and such. These do smell awful when they arrive! I had to spray the heck out of them with Febreze.
3.0,"lovely dress but it is not Midi, i am 5.5feet. medium fits perfectly but it hit above knees. wish it was longer :-("
3.0,"I really wanted to love this set, but I can't. I know you get what you pay for, but I was hoping against hope. I was hoping for some fire, but the stones appear dull. Perhaps there aren't enough facets for the light to catch...I don't know.  Not sure I'll wear them. Maybe my expectations were too high. I will say that the items are packaged nicely. You get a gift box as well as a bag."
3.0,"Comfortable once they're on, but the tops are too narrow through which the normal human foot can pass, thereby requiring a long shoe horn combined with downward thrust to place the foot inside the shoe."
3.0,"Very petty,  however varied GREATLY in size and about half I could not use."
3.0,"Just ok, ring too wide to fit on my Honda remote"
3.0,"I initially liked this hoodie, and found the thin fabric weight to be just right. But after a few wears that were by no means strenuous, I noticed that the fabric was already losing its shape. The stitching quality could be better, and unfortunately I ended up returning this after 2 or 3 weeks didn't dissuage my concerns."
3.0,"Good quality, although since it doesnt fit 36C, i will give it to my sister."
3.0,"Not what I thought it was. It's pretty and has nice pockets inside, however, the straps confused me. The straps did not fit on me and cannot be sized at all! I don't know what the snaps on the straps are for... but every time I tried to wear it, they can undone. I gifted it to a young girl with hopes she would find better use in it. The material is really nice and the inside is great. I wish it had been usable for myself."
3.0,"No, it was tore upon arrival. However I was scheduled to leave for a conference in Nashville and needed it. So I made do and I will have to sew it.<br />Thank you,"
3.0,My daughter is a Rebecca Zamolo fan. The material of this sweater is very cheap and she hasn't worn the sweater because she says it feels like a plastic bag. She has the sweater hung up as a souvenir.
3.0,"Quality is good, but it's to big in size."
3.0,Bought these for my 6 year old daughter.  They fit great. The eye pieces are soft and comfortable. The strap however is a different story.  The stitches come loose around the edges after only 3 uses.  My wife had to restitch it.  Could be better.
3.0,"the fit is really good if it's around the shoulders, the sleeves are a little bit big there is plenty of room to fold twice; the length of the pants are a little bit long but otherwise it fits around my hips.  My only issue are the buttons, they're too small; I button the shirt when I go to sleep, wake up with my buttons all in disarray.  basically I will have to replace the buttons! which is a hustle because I just don't have the time, nor do I want to pay somebody to do it and it's disappointing in a sense. it's a great color, great fabric, good quality, keeps me warm at night. like I said just the buttons, they do come loose! the button hole is too big for the small buttons. I'll just have to spend an extra $10 to replace buttons!!!"
3.0,"The shorts are a great fit, both pockets have holes in them which is a bit annoying but I would order again for the price."
3.0,"The sweater was similar to the image displayed, but nothing more. The color of the lips is more of a cream color, not white and the ink of the spots is more blue than black. It wasn’t what I expected but is similar to the product. Probably won’t be able to wear with much as it appears it’s a cheaply made sweater."
3.0,Way too small and I ordered the biggest size. Might be able to make it work.
3.0,"It fit a little bigger than I was expecting and it was too transparent for my liking. I ended up returning it, but would consider buying it in another color."
3.0,They bend pretty easily. Also not the worlds best sun blocker outters.
3.0,Was an odd fit. Tight around the waist but very roomy in the chest. Returned and got a different brand.
3.0,"REVIEW UPDATE: These pants MUST be ironed after washing, and even then, the wrinkles won't completely relax (can't iron on highest heat b/c of rayon content but low heat doesn't do the job; label says hang dry...maybe I'll take a chance & put in dryer). 3 stars b/c they're still comfy & flattering but won't order again b/c high maintenance garments aren't in the schedule).<br /><br />Good fit, comfortable and can definitely go from lounging to business. BUT the laundry instructions say not to put in the dryer, so I hung dry and they ended up so wrinkled that ironing didn't fix. I wore to work & most of the wrinkles worked their way out. Also, a 2nd pair purchased in same size was too small & will be returned (might be partially due to 16&#34; pizza for dinner, but they should stretch, right?)."
3.0,"1. It's a bit loose on me, since I needed a 0.5 size up, not a full one. But I can wear it on my thumb...<br />2. The saw inside is VERY difficult to take out the first time. So try it. DON'T leave it untouched until you really need it! Afterwards, it still isn't easy to take out. Let us just hope we won't need to use it, or if we do, then we will have plenty of time to finagle with it.<br />3. It gets scratched easily. I work a desk job and go about my daily routines (so nothing too major), but every day I notice more and more scratches. I have no idea what really causes them...<br /><br />Overall, a cool GADGET."
3.0,"These fit great, are very comfortable and look good. Big drawback and the reason my daughter can't wear them...they are dangerous on hard floors. She nearly fell a few times when she walked into the kitchen, so these are a no go for us.<br /><br />They have super slick bottoms and therefore I would not recommend these shoes at all."
3.0,"I guess for the price I can't complain, but they are not flared enough and fall out of my ears a lot."
3.0,"Fits super small, large is too small for US 6. I'm not returning only because I removed the tags to try it on. You could buy better bathing suits with Ekouaer for this price."
3.0,Fits well. The design is kinda pixilated though. Wack
3.0,"Under garments show through after one washing, material was cheap and too thin but I LOVE the cut. The darker dresses that I ordered aren't as noticeable."
3.0,"Received this jacket with high hopes.<br />Felt cheap, was not as described. Very wrinkled. Definitely did not want to wear.<br />Returned."
3.0,"I like this dress, but I wore it to work and once I got there i realized it was a bit too sheer... may be good as a beach coverup or around the house..."
3.0,"I was excited to receive these, because of the cross-over design that would add additional support. These are ok for home use, but I wouldn't wear it in public. The material is very thin, and the shoulder straps offer no support. I'm not even sure the cross-over does much of anything. It's just a flimsy product. No - I would not go running in it. As I said, for use in the privacy of my own home, this will do. The other thing I did not like is the tiny little pads in the cups. They look horrendous through clothing, and they move around. I am trying to see if I can find a way to remove them. Sigh. Someday, some company will get a bra right - actual support, smooth back and front lines, with substance to the bra. I'll keep searching!"
3.0,Runs small... See thru
3.0,"i dont know if it said it in the add and i missed it, but i ordered a 3xl and it just barely fits my son who wears a xl,  so maybe a 3xl fits a l  definately runs a few sizes small"
3.0,They work as they should except there is no way to adjust the strap around my leg even though they are a bit too tight.
3.0,"The scarf is made from string.  It is still flashy and sparkly, but not suitable for formal wear."
3.0,"This dress was purchased for a Tea Party.<br />I was very disappointed with the sizing of the dress. The dress must not have been cut for USA sizes.  But I loved the color, style and length."
3.0,"Love this. Holds more than it looks. Straps broke , needs reinforced"
3.0,"It's a cute design and nice full skirt. It was larger in all measurements than I expected. I'm 5'6&#34;, 37&#34; bust, 26&#34; waist, 40&#34; hip."
3.0,"This shirt is a nice material.  It is thin and slightly transparent.  It says it's made of 100% cotton.<br />Mine has a small defect in the front, namely a small hole.  The button holes seem to be lower quality; when I unbuttoned the shirt, there were threads that caught the buttons.  The care tag is on the side towards the bottom and is made from some sort of material that pokes me.  Mine is a large and I take a medium to large shirt, so a large should be plenty big.  However, it still fits tight in the shoulders, so I've marked it as running small.<br />The wash instructions are: Maximum wash temperature 40C (what is that in fahrenheit??), do not bleach, iron medium temp, DO NOT DRY, hang dry, conventional dry cleaning.<br />I am puzzled, why does this shirt say it's made of 100% cotton (no flax which is what is in linen), but yet it can't be put in a dryer?  Is it because of a shrinkage issue?<br />This shirt is made in communist China."
3.0,"Unfortunately, the yoga socks did not work for me. A little too big, my feet slipped a bit, and the toe grips didn't stay attached. However, I brought my issues up with the seller and they agreed to give me a full refund and I don't have to return the product. Excellent customer service makes up for a lot!"
3.0,"Have already commented above. I have owned numerous generations of this watch for over thirty years mainly because I know how to use all the functions. I wondered if the Amazon Casio is a cheap knock off. The light does not work as well as the store bought watches and the strap is light duty. The strap on these watches is usually the first thing to go. Previously, after replacing a few straps I decided it was more cost effective to simply buy another watch. The Amazon watch is about one half the regular price. The batteries rarely run out and it is definitely not worth replacing them."
3.0,Tried this dress on and I do like it. It’s form fitting and flattering. Pretty short so keep that in mind. Only problem I have is that it is see through.
3.0,Not very supportive. Weak material
3.0,"These shoes sat on my wish list for weeks before purchasing. I should have known that I didn't need them as there were hardly any reviews. When they arrived they were packaged nicely, however they are not the most comfortable or quietest. The faux leather crossing makes so much noise like plastic as you walk and I am flat footed so the arch area for some reason makes squishy sounds while walking. They are trendy but not the best made shoe."
3.0,"I love these cable band watches.  Can't wear an ordinary bangle because my wrists are too small; these fit very well and don't flop around on my arm.  I've had several, and most work fine for years.  However, when they don't, it's VERY irritating.... this most recent purchase was to replace one I'd ordered just days before, which was ""deadern a doornail"" from the day it arrived, new battery and all. The second one I bought on 27 July literally fell apart (the stem and stem cap came out/off) the first time I tried to set the time.  That happened at the beginning of August; I had to spend a good deal of the rest of the month in the hospital, and when I was well enough to check, the ""return by"" date (30 Aug) had passed.  So, I'm dissatisfied with not being able to return a completely defective item."
3.0,Product quality seems good but came in a tangled mess.  Still trying to untangle.
3.0,"According to the size chart, I wear a medium which is what I ordered. These are a bit snug around the hips. Not too bad but the pockets pull a bit. I didn't love the feel of the material. They are also way too long but since I'm short, I'm used to dealing with that. Overall they are okay but didn't do a lot for me."
3.0,This runs very large.  I was hoping for the opposite.  It sits above the waistline. It is dusty rose.  Fabric is nice.
3.0,"Very tiny and all though I only have two other charms on the bracelet, this one still gets lost due to its tiny size"
3.0,The dress is beautiful.<br />It's too big in the waist. I had it taken in for $30.00 ended up paying a lot for this dress. It's a bad flaw in design of dress
3.0,The umbrella is quality but when it is described as compact/travel I expected it yo fit in my pocket for travel. It is large even when collapsed.
3.0,Pocket interior fabric is cheap. Seems bust open often and need to be sewn.
3.0,This is transparent and needs to be said in the description
3.0,"Very soft, but the elastic waist keeps flipping inside the pants and twists.l after washing."
3.0,The necklace chain tends to jostle and get stuck on itself so it doesn’t lie flat while you’re wearing it and you need to adjust it.<br /><br />Gold is a little bit too costume-jewelry for my taste but otherwise design is nice.
3.0,Frames feel good and the lenses are very dark. The only issue I have is that there seems to be a inconsistency in the lens causing a ripple or bubble effect
3.0,"Cute bras, fit was accurate for me. But two of the bras have fallen apart already... after only a month or so of normal rotation."
3.0,"Seems to be a quality item.  The pattern is exactly as pictured so in this respect it did not disappoint.<br />The sizing is quite off, especially if you're a busty gal. I got a XXL which pretty much fit my body but not the bust.  For prospective, I usually wear XL dresses from old navy and wear 36K/L bra."
3.0,Very chinzie
3.0,"It's a nice quality shirt with a real pocket unlike some of the other bowling shirts. This fabric is flexible but very tight in the shoulder. I had to return this because it hurt to bowl.<br /><br />Be aware that they run very big. I normally wear an XL shirt, but this thing was huge and I had to exchange it for a Medium which fit perfectly. I noticed no shrinkage after a wash."
3.0,Must have been for Juniors - gave it to  my daughter that wears an adult XS - she loves it!
3.0,Super cute. Just runs a bit tight. I’m normally a medium and this is snug against my hips. Wish it were more flowey.
3.0,"This wallet seems to be of decent construction and has a lot of slots for credit cards and the two ID windows work well.<br /><br />It is not, however, slim. While empty is was almost as fat as my current leather wallet is while full. The ID window contributes excessively to the bulk. For posterity’s sake I tested it out, and it was like a brick. The butt-feel is also hampered by the wallet being quite tall and wide. Smaller walleta can get away with being thicker because they slide to the side of your pocket so you aren’t sitting directly on them.<br /><br />The organization options are quite nice, and I could see this wallet doing well for an inside-the-jacket option, however I decided to send it back after the test sit. Unfortunately for this reason I can’t give an opinion on durability."
3.0,It's cute but it's not super soft and if you dont like clingy fabric or tighter shirts I would order a size or two larger
3.0,This top has a weird shape to the bust and don't really flatter smaller chested girls. It just doesnt fit right.
3.0,Not squat proof 😏
3.0,Isn't how expected
3.0,It was very pretty but the blue stone in both necklaces were  placed crooked in the heart.
3.0,It's not as a cute as the pictures. I don't love it but I don't dislike it. Order a size up if you want an oversize fit.
3.0,Should have received combo of black and purple but only received the purple which is lighter than it's shows on picture. But I don't know that I have time to try and switch out it's for a costume party coming up pretty quick so it will have to work. Shipped pretty quick though.
3.0,my bridesmaid size is 2 in USA. Size 4 didn't fit her on this dress. It's a beautiful dress but sadly we need to alter it.
3.0,This is the second one because the first one the clasp keeps breaking. Now the second one is the same thing. My fiancé is tiny so it’s not like it’s to tight. I don’t recommend buy from this vendor
3.0,straps broke! But I did have it pretty full...
3.0,"So my mom purchased this for me for Christmas. First off love the look of this coat, and for the price you can't beat it.<br />The only reason I didn't give it full 5 stars is because the hood feels a little strange when you have it up...doesn't feel like it sits properly on your head and leaves openings on the side...and that the sleeves are not cinched...so if you were to wear it in the snow it would let snow right up the arms, so definitely not as warm as it should be. I would have returned it but did not purchase to ski, just wanted a warm coat for living in NC in the winter. If I still lived up north I would have returned it. If the manufacturers fixed these 2 issues it would have definitely been 5 stars."
3.0,This dress is gorgeous but the sleeve are a lil tight but beside that the dress is great
3.0,These are very cute but flimsy. When they arrived the backs were already bent. I was able to bend them back without them breaking them but they bend easily.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, it looked very elegant and flattering.  Unfortunately with my body type it just looks like an unflattering robe.  I'm 5'5"", 153 lbs, and 36 H chest, so obviously it's not going to fit me the same as the model, but the way the dress fell on my body made me look a lot bigger than I am, especially where the pockets are because there's so much extra fabric in that area.  It looks flattering in the other reviewers photos, but if you're body type is like mine with a very large chest, smaller waist, and wider hips, I don't really feel like this dress will do your body justice.  Also, the fabric is pretty heavy and I was overheating in 80 degree weather."
3.0,I think the shirt is adorable but did not fit the way I wanted it to.
3.0,I pack it as back up for travel.  The tight squeeze to get the glasses into their case causes them to twist out of alignment which results in a poor fit.
3.0,"This wig was nice, long, curly, but if it was average size, it is a small average."
3.0,"Hot, but, no material in the bust to prevent parts from being seen, especially when wet."
3.0,It fit like its suspose to however the zipper is real cheep and you will struggle with zipping. I dont think ill buy again.
3.0,"They are lovely, but HUGE for my head, and same with a few coworkers that bought them also."
3.0,"they’re pretty comfy but they fold under you when you walk, i’ve tripped and almost fell too many times"
3.0,"No big issue, smaller than expected but no big deal... looks great..."
3.0,"The shirt runs large. It’s almost 24 inches in the chest, the chart says 20.... I got the medium since thinking it would fit and it’s way to wide across the chest and stomach, again 24 inches across. It’s also the smallest size they have. This is like big and tall clothing.<br /><br />The material is pretty bad too, very rigid and super thin, not soft at all."
3.0,Too small in the chest. Fit well in the waist.
3.0,"Very cost effective but a bit flashy, to the point where the necklace can look a bit cheap."
3.0,Nothing fancy.
3.0,It didn't specify a size..
3.0,"I ordered off of the product's sizing guide, and this was way too large. It looked like a trash bag. There was a ton of fabric at the bottom, which just added to the issue. The neck was also higher than in the picture. It was more like a crew neck t-shirt. Sending this one back for sure."
3.0,Little tip. Order 2 sizes bigger that what you normally wear. Not just one size.
3.0,"This is actually for my husband and he had this to say:<br />Too thin, flimsy, too big, and kinda scratchy. They weren’t soft and cuddly."
3.0,"Nice,for kids"
3.0,Beautiful pattern compliments those of us who still use cloth and not diappsable. Would be a good gift for a proper older lady to use. I wanted bother to tie my hair with
3.0,"Broke the first time i wore them even though they seem to be made very sturdy. I really love the added style they provide, just wish the chains were reinforced better. The company I ordered them through is replacing them with another pair so, hopefully they will hold up better."
3.0,"I'll keep it but this shirt has no shape to it. It has no tailoring and is very baggy. Its okay for a lazy day on the weekend but its not casual day at work quality. The model makes it look nice, it doesn't really look the same on. That looks like a different shirt even."
3.0,"Two of the straps came apart when I tried to extend them, but the remaining three work fine. If you're careful, they're still an excellent value."
3.0,These clip on earrings are cute and light but hurt your ears after having them on for about 30 minutes.
3.0,"I returned the product (for free - thank you Amazon) because it didn't fit my head very well.  Instead, I purchased a pair of Mr. O (brand) Fitover sunglasses.  These were a tad cheaper and fit my head better.  If anything, the lenses of the Mr. O glasses seemed to be a bit darker, which was a plus for me."
3.0,After my order being a week late to recieve Im somewhat satisfied with the product.
3.0,"Made with very thin felt. They are cute, but Ties are to short, size is more for thin people. I wear a petite 10 and the ties just fit me.<br />A one time wear!"
3.0,"Very cute and sturdy, no plastic.  Comes with pouch and cleaning cloth too!<br />Unfortunately I ordered pink but got gold.  That's a bit of a disappointment because of the great quality."
3.0,The watch itself feels very good on the wrist and solid. The quality seems to be good also.<br />I had to return mine because the date adjustment wouldnt work out of the box and not sure about taking a risk on it breaking out of warranty.
3.0,Order up whatever size u are! They are super tight!
3.0,"Beautiful appearance & nice design layout, if a bit small for my needs, as it turns out. If you don’t carry a whole lot & don’t need to access your stuff frequently, this is worth considering. Unfortunately for me, the threads holding the silky synthetic linings in place don’t seem to be adequate, strengthwise, for the thick, stiff leather that is used."
3.0,The earrings are cute but they are much smaller than I thought they would be.
3.0,"It was okay, not what I expected"
3.0,A lot thinner then I thought it would be.
3.0,A little too thin.
3.0,"Love the colors and they have pockets, but they run very long and a little large."
3.0,"This bag is really beautiful. My only problem is that the description said it was large. It's definitely not a large bag. It's a medium sized bag, at best. That was very disappointing, but I'm going to keep it and use it as  an ""occasion bag."""
3.0,This is just an avg product
3.0,Obviously the fit is tight because they are work out pants. I purchased the only black option and the option that says red on it both in size small. The red ones are hot pink. Not in anyway radish and both pairs are very comfortable but see through.<br />Definitely see through. I can clear as day see my leg tattoos straight through both pants and my fiance can see my bum.<br />Good price for house pants though.
3.0,"Nice gown, but it is a little short in length and the fabric is not the soft feel I was hoping for."
3.0,I would give it more but the sun on my necklace already fell off. Other than that it is a nice size and eye catching.
3.0,"Ordered adult xl, received kids xl. If the sizing issue was resolved I'd still give this 3-4 stars because quality is pretty bad for the price. Thin, poor quality shirt but very adorable design, you're paying for Fortnite branding which I understand. I wouldn't have returned if size was right BUT I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,Nice material washes nice but tight in arms and shoulders if you are not a petite build. Runs 1 size smaller on top
3.0,"the length is ok but the strap is way too large, feeling disappointed."
3.0,I ordered this ring as a thumb ring. I ordered it to large. Very pretty though.
3.0,"Very basic comfortable shorts, house shorts. They're about just for that to wear around the house. They were a cheap set of shorts so I bought them just to wear around the house and that's what they're good for, very basic."
3.0,Cute but a small piece broke off pretty quickly. Still useable but be cautious.
3.0,They are really cute but they are hard to unfold and the. They rip easily. The seams were ripped already on them when I got them too. I won’t buy again.
3.0,Very cute love it but I never got the belt
3.0,gave it to a child
3.0,Runs too big if you wear a size 14 order size 12
3.0,"return the pink one. didn't like the color, too light."
3.0,"I like the color brown it is, the braiding is very pretty and the closure is spectacular. But it's not at all flexible even though I can stretch the braid. Hoping it will get softer as time passes."
3.0,"I wear Med in most jackets with plenty of room; however, this jacket fits very small around the armpits.<br />The jacket is a very good quality but please buy a size larger...I hope the vendor will exchange it for a larger size."
3.0,Very small amount of ash held but very cute
3.0,"I returned this product because this sandal have smell, and bad quality."
3.0,"The print on the hoodie is nice, however it is the THINNEST hoodie Ive ever seen. The material will not keep you warm. I expected this to be a thick hoodie, one that would keep me warm. I wish the seller would advertise more honestly."
3.0,The dress stated that it can with a belt. I did not receive the belt. The dress is super cute and fits perfect.
3.0,"ok, not crazy about them, but ok. Love style, wish they were bigger<br />keep falling out."
3.0,"I get torn shirt, like chopped."
3.0,Not as happy as I thought I would be. The band is definitely tight fitting.
3.0,"They fit great and looked cute and He loved them, but they did not hold up to a the wear and tear of a 16 month old. Who wore them less then two months."
3.0,Too small<br />Couldn't wear
3.0,Love the pendant but the clasp was broken.
3.0,I love this dress HOWEVER. . . I have had a size M. I washed it in the machine on gentle & cold with cold water wash. It SHRANK.<br />A friend gave me a Large. I washed it by HAND in cold water wash. & let it drip dry. It SHRANK!!  I have just purchased an XL. I have washed it. Im hoping it shrinks to my size which is a size 4.<br />It’s  a lovely dress but goodness!!
3.0,"This dress is just ok. I was hoping the material would be stretchier and more sweatshirt-like, and it's thinner and shorter than I expected. It's fine to wear around the house which is pretty much why I bought it"
3.0,Bought for 7 year old granddaughter s crocs. They were too large and gawdy for her. Better for an adult.
3.0,Works great on a tablet. Unfortunately the stitching is very poor.
3.0,I was a bit disappointed in the quality and the feel of the dress.  It looks much nicer in the photo then it does in person.  Would not have purchased had I seen it in person.
3.0,Not no show socks. They show a lot
3.0,Not really lose fitting  ordered  an extra large and it didn't  fit and the material is too clinging.
3.0,"No es de la calidad que esperaba, está por debajo de su precio"
3.0,LOVE everything about the color and style!! Pattern is wonderful. VERY snug in the hips and behind.
3.0,These are not shoes.  Product was good though.
3.0,"The wrist band is too small.<br /><br />I figure, no problem, easy to replace, right? Wrong. These weird ass pins REFUSE to come out. I basically destroyed the watch trying to remove the pins (not to mention my thumb...) And yes, I followed the arrows imprinted on the original watch band; the pins were still a nightmare to remove.<br /><br />Basically, if you've got larger wrists, be hesitant about this watch. It's great, but it won't fit comfortably, and replacing the strap is not a fun time."
3.0,"I really like the style of these yoga pants but everything else fell short for me. I prefer my yoga pants to be a bit thicker - these were made with a high content of polyester and not much spandex,  they were a bit too small and definitely too short (I'm 5'8"").  They did come with a hair band that I was expecting which was a nice bonus."
3.0,Fabic is too thin
3.0,The size of the shoes is okay but the arch is too high. It makes it feel like my heel isn't all the way inside the shoe.
3.0,The style was hard to wear and the fabric was cheap looking.
3.0,These look feel how they look. I ordered a size up and couldn’t even get them around my ankles.
3.0,"The color is not as deep as the picture, the feel of the fabric is silky.  It is a good beach cover."
3.0,"I'm a 38DD and got an extra large. It's a little bit snug on top. But it's REALLY tight on the waistband. The whole reason I chose this suit was because I have a mom stomach that I'd like to hide, so having a tight band around the bottom cuts into me. The bottoms are cute and not too tiny."
3.0,Kind of a poor quality.
3.0,Ordered daughter’s size and it fit like a very snug shirt. Great quality but size is off.
3.0,Not as loose as I would like but its OK for the price
3.0,"The colors are pretty enough, but I'm returning this scarf.<br />It would've been helpful to have known that it's 100% acrylic."
3.0,Bought for my daughter for Christmas she likes is
3.0,smaller than what i expected and falls down when ever walking you have to tie them so tight that they cut of ur circulation n even then they fall down
3.0,Fits smaller than normal
3.0,"This necklace is really pretty but it is a huge amount of beads.  I don't care for the clasp in the back, its white and doesn't really go with it and stands out if your hair is up.  Other than those things, its gorgeous!"
3.0,Little stretch and didn't fit around the waist that well
3.0,"I got this dress in dark blue, size XL. It's  is so soft and the color is as I expected. I'm a size 12/14 or size L in dresses of this style with an hourglass figure, and I went up 1 size after reading the reviews. The dress fits perfectly and it looks so cute on me BUT the material is so thin  I can see my bra and cleavage through it. I want to love it, but I can't wear it without a tank top underneath. I think the problem is that I'm busty (36F) and the already thin material has to stretch to accommodate. So if you're busty, you might want to go up 2 sizes or just be aware you're going to have to layer."
3.0,The chain could of been a little bit longer.
3.0,order the xlrge... look big
3.0,It's pretty good<br />But the black cat looks dirty
3.0,Wayyy too small but it's beautiful! I wore it as a top and wore a skirt with it.
3.0,Good quality pants. They fit smaller on me than other pants of this type and size. I have a curvier build.
3.0,"They are nice, the backs are just a little to long."
3.0,The socks seem kind of flimsy and seem prone to ravel. I don’t think they’ll last 100 washes in the machine but they do the job today.
3.0,Very pretty but very thin and they need ironing.
3.0,"I ordered a size large which is my typical size and should fit according to the sizing chart, but this dress is too tight and way too short.  The length is the biggest issue for me. I'm 5'6"" and even standing still the dress doesn't adequately cover my rear or the front.  I have a small rear for a woman and this dress makes it look like it is so big the dress can't contain it.  The dress is also pretty tight fitting and not flattering at all. I look like I was stuffed into it.<br /><br />The material itself is pretty constricting.  It's a thicker material and it kinda feels like I am wearing a thermal shirt on top as it provides a ton of warmth. You are kinda limited with your options of what weather is best suited for wearing the dress as it wouldn't work for summer months or any remotely warm weather.<br /><br />I washed according to instructions, cold cycle and then air dry and there were no further issues with the dress than what was present on arrival."
3.0,I am size 12 petite and this is tight thru my shoulders.  The material is light and comfortable.
3.0,Fit as expected but color not consistent. Part of the red was faded and looked washed out.
3.0,They are rather difficult to use.  Still trying to adjust to there usage.
3.0,"Cute gift for a little girl. It's much smaller, and very lightweight. If it wasn't such a hassle, I would return it.  But, it did arrive on time."
3.0,"Unfortunately, because it took as long as it did to ship, the hat was inevitably squished, so there are a few creases/warping on the hat (think &#34;hat cellulite&#34;). I'm considering ironing/steaming the hat to see if the warp bubbles will go away (otherwise, they're there to stay). The fabric is made of nice, strong material. A lot more sturdy then I expected. Doesn't really feel like the type of material to get many lint balls, so that's good. The band around the head is removable, so that's a nice option to have. If not, you can just glue/pin it down. The brim is pretty long, so it does a nice job at shading and because it is a simple/minimalist hat, buying it won't be a tragic aesthetic choice (unless you're nitpicky about the wrinkles).<br /><br />Definitely fits around my head (and then some). In all honesty, it fits a little TOO loosely for my comfort because I'm always worried a random gust of wind will knock it off my head. I live in a city that feels like a wind tunnel, so I do not want to run after my hat as they do in the movies--it's not as adorable as it looks, people.<br /><br />Recommended if you: like wearing wigs, want to put your hair up in a bun, or just have fabulously thick locks.  It's always risky to buy these things online since you can't try them on, but for the price that I paid ($11), I can't say it was a terrible choice."
3.0,really like these and they do fit but run smaller than any other jammies I have purchased in the same size
3.0,"Strange shape, it is too small for a 14 month old toddler, so it is useless for us."
3.0,good deal for how many you’re getting and the price but some were see through others weren’t they were made from different materials and only like 2 of them were worth keeping
3.0,I am reordering an XS<br />They fit great!
3.0,"Overall the material is very stretchy and super soft, but it’s only one bra when it says 3 pack"
3.0,"Nice band, but notice clamp color rubbing off."
3.0,"It's too large so I will need to return it.  However, I do like the bathing suit."
3.0,"Nicely shaped but it doesn't fit loose like the pic. Had to wear my shaper with it otherwise, I would've returned it. Material was thick an unforgiving. Stretched it intentionally to get it to work."
3.0,The large fits like a medium
3.0,"I don't play basketball often but needed new shoes with high top support for my ankles. They felt very good and secure, but on an indoor court I was sliding all over the place with what seemed like no grip at all. I'll still use them for other things, but I consider them useless for basketball."
3.0,"I had ordered a shorter sleeve in the spring and it fit perfect in xxl.  Longer sleeve top is bigger in the v cut.  Will need to wear a tank or something underneath it, not sure if it's the same company.  Not sure yet if I'm returning it."
3.0,Did not do what i expected.
3.0,Good looking but the lid is hard to open
3.0,It’s to open on the top for a Child. I needed to buy a shirt to go under so my 6yr olds chest and belly aren't showing.
3.0,"I was expecting a little more tightness on these trousers. They make a feet sweaty, but it's better if worn over a cotton based socks. Great delivery."
3.0,"Cute dress. My daughter loves it. Thankfully I paid attention to the size reviews, because this dress runs really small. Ordered what was noted as a &#34;6&#34; but fit like a 4T"
3.0,"The dress and accessories are beautiful altogether! However, there are several issues with the dress, like the loose thread with beads, off-shaped beads, and uneven flappers. The size was good but there is room in the lower back, although my hip fits well."
3.0,First bought a large since I wear a women's size 10 ut that was too large.  Next order a meek but I find they are too tight in the toe.  I will go back to my cheap comfy brands.
3.0,Looks exactly as advertised.
3.0,Beautiful replacement for the real thing. The baby's breath fell out as soon as removed from the package.
3.0,Love the clothe nice quality
3.0,Cheap plastic ends
3.0,"I returned this umbrella because it was so long! Because of the design, you can collapse it and make it small. I didn't try it out, so I'll let others tell you if it works well."
3.0,"Feels a bit starchy, but it's cute!"
3.0,"mine doesn't look like this one.  mine does not have the clasp like the photo shows.  I still like it though, maybe even better than if it had the clasp.  It is a wrap and attached...."
3.0,"This suite is super cute, but unfortunately about half of the little sequins have fallen off of Ariel's tail after being washed only twice. My daughter was a little upset about this, but it's still wearable so not a huge deal."
3.0,"Nice looking, but the magnets are VERY small. I lost one the first time I wore them."
3.0,Its kind of big and super loose shirt
3.0,Very thin.  Not quite what I was looking for -too tight around top
3.0,I have ordered this brand of boot many times for my toddler but these for some reason are huge on her. Same size as another pair that fits perfect and yet this style she practically loses with every step. She drags her feet in them to keep them on with every step which is not the way you want a 3yr old to walk.
3.0,"Like: the design. It’s perfect for travel. My Brita water filter bottle fit perfectly into the side and my travel stainless steel cup fit into the other side. The inside is spacious.<br />Dislikes: THE SMELL. Sometimes faux leather smells bad. This bag came with a scented pouch inside. I guess they were trying to make it smell better? I have let this bag air out for three days before my trip. The smell was still so bad that people moved away from me at the airport and the smell made me sick on the plane. It’s disappointing because I love the functionality of this as a travel bag. Some people are complaining about the zippered opening size - it’s that size and cut for the anti-theft feature. If it weren’t for the smell, this would be my go to bag and I would be buying it in other colors."
3.0,"These aren’t as tight in the waist as I would like, belt loops would be helpful for that. I love the material and how comfy they are but unfortunately my color is fading after 4 months of wear and washing"
3.0,"plastic too thin, tears easily"
3.0,"This is a very cute suit that fits well, however, it arrived damaged so I had to return it.  It appeared to be a manufacturing defect so I'm not sure if they all would be that way or just the one I received.  In any case, part of the skirt was attached to one leg opening in an awkward way.  I examined it, initially thing just a few treads had caught and I could cut them but it was pretty extensive and I think I would have ruined the suit if I tried to remove them.  It was very obvious that this was an error, not just an element of the design."
3.0,"Love it and like how it keeps me warm . I wish I had ordered two instead of one. Love how it has a casual neat where with jeans , or exercise wear look. Not in item that would go unworn , and remain in the closet over the years to gather dust. Glad I got an extra size big , because sometimes clothes can shrink up in the dryer."
3.0,"Nice, feminine sweater albeit a little thick. The sleeves in the small size were 4 inches too short so had to return! Very itchy. The body length was perfect and reached mid hip which was a pleasant change."
3.0,I’m giving this 3 stars on behalf of my husband. We purchased these for him to work out in under his gym shorts. The problem is that they are made for people with no butt. It barely covers him up so they slide down a lot.
3.0,An apron should have a pocket; nonetheless l would love it except l can't think of anyone l know who is small enough to wear it!
3.0,"I typically wear a L or XL in clothing, to hide my mom pouch, so figured an XL in this would be loose enough......NOPE. Very unflattering, and not loose fitting like the model in the pictures. The fabric is nice, the straps are very long, but runs WAY small. Sad because I absolutely LOVE the style of this outfit! My recommendation: order several sizes bigger."
3.0,There was a problem with the left shoulder cut. Also there was a lot of dust and white stuff on it.
3.0,Very cute. Loved the fabric. Could not wear. The bust was too big.
3.0,This didn't come anywhere near and XL.  Cute shirt though.
3.0,"This suit runs small.  I bought the 36 for my 15 year old daughter and she could not even get it over her thighs.  She is a year round swimmer so her thighs are bigger then most.  I ended up having my 11 year old daughter try it on and it ended up fitting her, but a little snug at first.  My 11 year old usually wears a size 34.  Over all for the price, it is not bad.  It will due if you are on a budget, just order up a size or two.  A side note, both my girls are curvy girls with long torsos, if that helps."
3.0,"Really cute top but kind of cheap material. Also, I realize this is a cropped top but I have a big chest & top was too small for me. If I raised my arms up at all most of my bra would show. Just be aware that it is pretty short."
3.0,fell apart in no time
3.0,Armpits a little large underneath needs taken in.
3.0,It's ok. Would not brag on it though.
3.0,"Beware: fake drawstring. This is a short string sewed to the front of the shorts. It is unraveling at the ends  would prefer it not be there at all. That said, the elastic in the waist is thick and holds up the shorts on its own, even though I ordered a size up."
3.0,These shirts are great shirts but they are very long. Wouldn't recommend ordering for short people
3.0,"Made very nicely but I found it too bulky and heavy even when empty.  As a senior, I wanted a well-made but light weight card case.  I returned it"
3.0,I got this swimsuit when I first got pregnant hoping it wouldn't make me look like a multi-colored whale as my tummy grew. Thankfully it worked. It was easy to put on all the way through my 7th month and it was super comfy and didn't ride up in weird places. Design is simple and cute as well.
3.0,"Cute, but I'm a busty size 8-10, bought a L (12-14) and I can't button at all, totally tight with all buttons open.  Go up 2 sizes!"
3.0,Style and comfort was good
3.0,For well nice light fabric not see through
3.0,I went to take out some links and had to buy a watch kit to do it and still hasn't worked.
3.0,"I've had these for 2 winters now. They are ok, but started falling apart at the beginning of this (2nd) winter. I don't do anything crazy with them but do push a stroller a lot. I very much like how they look - the cording on the backs is a nice touch, and they aren't super bulky. However, they also aren't all that warm. The touch screen feature only worked for about two days. These aren't terrible, but I won't be buying them again."
3.0,Color does not fully match with watch silver. After a couple of weeks started making annoying &#34;cricket&#34; noises... Not very good quality.
3.0,"It’s ok.  It’s slightly tight in the chest area and hits just below my knees. I’m 5’3” 165 lbs, 38C bust. Hides my flabby stomach  could be a little bit more tapered at the waist I think. Not the most flattering thing I’ve ever worn but it’ll do for what I bought it for (nephew communion). I will say it’s SUPER comfortable! I will be chasing my kids around the party and I feel this will work great for that."
3.0,They are very hard to unscrew. And the picture on the earring does not look as good in person. It looks cheap.
3.0,pretty colors - comfy summer top
3.0,"First: the buttons are mismatched, which I can now barely see in the picture....but it certainly not what I was expecting. They’re hardly sewn on as well, and I thought I got some weird repaired dress initially.<br /><br />Second: this dress is not made for curvy ladies. I got the large and the shoulders and sleeves were quite big on me, and normally that’s on the tighter side. However, the waist was very tight, and having hips/butt made the dress ride up and it was quite short.<br /><br />Third: the fabric was not as soft nor as nice as I was expecting it to be.<br /><br />Overall, I could see this dress working well for the right body type, but it just wasn’t for me. The burgundy color was very rich and quite pretty. I do tend to get quite a few of these cheaper dresses on amazon to great success, so this one was very surprising to me how much I didn’t like it."
3.0,It was too tight in the bust.  Actually it fit better when I put it on backward with the scoop neck in front.  I returned it and am ordering the next size up.
3.0,"It's ok, should be worn with turtleneck sweaters. I'm in California, and the weather doesn't permit me to wear turtlenecks all that often. It doesn't look like the picture, but the price was good."
3.0,"First the good part...this Band appears to be pretty well made...the rubber is thick and strong and the buckle feels solid...so I think this should last for a good while....now for the bad parts...First, I am a 200 lb. male and the band is almost too big for me (I have one set of holes left)...not sure who they are making it for, but certainly not the average sized person...Second, the material is super stiff so it doesn't really want to bend around your wrist.(it wants to stay flat)..  I have been wearing it every day for a week now and it's starting to take shape, but it's still no where near &#34;round&#34; like your typical rubber watch band yet...hopefully some long hot days in the summer will square that away...until then, it works, but not very well.  All that being said, if you have a very large wrist this is probably a great product since the negatives won't really apply to you, otherwise, I suggest you look elsewhere"
3.0,I usually what a Lg (10-12) and this top in a 12 was like wearing a tent.  It has a lot of pleating in the back.  The khaki is a nice &#34;dressy&#34; color and the material was not too sheer.  I may try a smaller size.
3.0,I like the fang but i will have to buy a leather cord to replace the cords that come with it other then that its cool
3.0,Leather is thick and nice but rivet is actually a screw and seems weak...it came undone the first time I tried the belt on.  Time will tell how well it holds up.
3.0,The lighter/royal blue one fades horribly. The darker navy blue one was perfect.
3.0,Looks nice for the price. The black wears off after not long in small parts.
3.0,The material is great !! The only thing was that one the thread  was a mess and looks weird without one row..<br />I try to fix it but it didn’t come out well
3.0,"Suit was too little, and dang I hated that because I really wanted to wear it. It was of good quality but run small."
3.0,Dress was adorable my husband liked it but I didn't feel comfortable in it.
3.0,This was ok but not what I was looking for<br />The picture isn't what it looks like in person<br />The material is not quality & im sending it back
3.0,Lots of clumps of hanging threads and very thin fabric.
3.0,"Top fits loosely even when tied tight. Was not as flattering as pictured. Crotch was a little short, so overall a little awkward."
3.0,"The socks are soft and comfortable, but I don't like the brown lines on the grey socks near the ankle that are visible still with a shoe on. they wound be so much better it the socks were solid color instead of these stripes."
3.0,Nice pants but fits alittle small and has zippers on the sides of ankles at bottom of pants.
3.0,"Nice concept and great materials however, not great for hunting. The “break away” feature sucks, it comes undone way to easily. Got the item in the mail and went to the woods, it got snagged a couple times on brush and with no effort it came apart. I wouldn’t be happy tracking a deer and messing with that. But other that the breakaway feature, it is very nice quality! Do away with that please!"
3.0,"They run small and short. If I buy them again I would bye the next larger size. Otherwise I like the material and look! I'm 5'9 180lbs large is too small, I will bye XL next time! Great value for the money."
3.0,The dress ran large and the style was not flattering. I am a true small and I ordered a small. There is no extra small option. The waist was too high up and I wish it was more form fitting. The dress was also a bit long on me and I’m 5’5”.  Was good quality though if that’s the style you like.
3.0,Sharp looking and does run small.  The top left snapped pulled off the first time it was worn
3.0,Good quality...but way too small/narrow.  Begun return
3.0,Doesn't go down to size to fit my head
3.0,"Material is soft and this is exactly what I have been looking for, unfortunately there too short, had to return."
3.0,Ordered 2x hoping it would run big. I normally wear a XL and it fit like a Large.
3.0,The pajamas weren’t what I expected. The buttons were quite large and I thought they might be uncomfortable for sleeping so I returned them without opening the  package or trying them on.
3.0,This dress is GORGEOUS but it's way too low cut and loose around the breasts to look as classy as I thought it was going to be.
3.0,Mines broke the 2nd day!
3.0,"I think it looked better online.  It's OK for a teen, but an adult would see why it was cheaper to purchase."
3.0,Extremely dark glasses.  Almost too dark.  The price was fantastic but I am really going to have to think hard about whether to buy them again or not.
3.0,I really wanted to like this.  The link was good on me and I like the weight of the fabric.  But there was a major sewing error around the bust area that makes it lay funny. The sleeves are a little long.  I plan to return it and order another one in hopes that I will receive one without poor sewing.
3.0,There wasn't a strap included for the top.
3.0,I wear a size 14-15 in jeans and the large was too small so if you are a bit on the thicker side get an extra large
3.0,"Replacing my leather credit card carrier with this new carbon fiber cc holder was not as eventful or slimming down as it is advertised. Yes, maybe the rfid protection is better. Yes, you can jam more credit cards into the holder. And yes, it has a money clip. But, the wallet itself is at least as thick as four or five credit cards, all by itself! It is bulky, not slim. I am using it, but it is awkward. Trying to push out the one cc you’re after, is like fanning out a deck of cards to pick out the joker. I am glad that I only paid $21 for it, unlike the $70 and up models they do sell. Just be prepared for a hard, bulky hunk of plastic in your pocket!"
3.0,"Soft and comfy, but it did have a toe seam. Other than these socks are good."
3.0,Beautiful piece just a little small.
3.0,Bottons on same side of sock so both facing left?
3.0,The color is orange orange
3.0,"I love this scarf and had high expectations., but it got caught on everything, especially my wedding ring. Stopped wearing it because too many snags that I could not fix."
3.0,Love the earrings but why would you put GOLD clips on a silver earring???  That looks so odd.
3.0,"Too large, very thin(although it is breathable and flows)."
3.0,Colors are great!  Nice wide brim. It had to go back because it was way too small. It just perched on top of my head.
3.0,The necklace is pretty. The price practically given free. I believe I paid less than $2.00. No shipping charges although it took a while to get to my mailbox. No worries! Yes I liked it. You will too.
3.0,"I am 5'7, busty and when I put the dress on it was first off very snug with no stretch. But it didn't come to my knees. It went above my knees and with the small split in the back I felt like I was three steps-literally-away from showing my underwear. It rides when you walk, and it was difficult to zip. Not easy to get on or off and literally I took a few steps and it started riding up my thighs. And I felt like if I sat I'd rip the dress or not be able to breathe. Not exactly plus size friendly, I got a 2x and it was still very snug and not very moveable. I got the 2x so it would be bigger, but holy moly I feel like I should have gone bigger. Not very plus size friendly. No give. I loved the colour and the style, and if I get it again maybe I'll get the biggest size and get it taken in from there. But I may have to add rubber strips to the hem to keep it from riding."
3.0,FYI if you’re thinking the deep color is purple in this sports bra you will be mistaken! There is a lot more pink than I thought and the dark color that I thought was a deep violet is actually black! So the deep violet pants that I got to go with it needless to say they do not match. Guess I’ll wear this sports bra with black pants?
3.0,"Great pair of shorts as far as the fit goes. I use for hot yoga classes; however the seams seem to give way pretty quickly i.e. the very first couple times. I'm pretty sure this is consistent with other feedback on here as well. Hopefully, the seller has a good customer service policy."
3.0,"Other reviewers are right that this shirt is made of a very thin semi-sheer fabric, so it’s certainly better worn as a beach shirt than regular wear. The green color, which I got, is more of a “tennis-ball” green or maybe a “highlighter” green than I was expecting, but again it’s fine for beach wear. I think it’s fine, but (candidly) my wife thinks it’s a little cheap-looking so I’m not sure how often I’ll be wearing it."
3.0,"It’s a cute skirt, good quality. However, it’s very small. I got a large and wear large and medium clothes and it fits like a small."
3.0,It is beautiful but the fabric is a lot lighter weight than I expected. It clings so doesn't look that great on me with Jean's. It will be fine if worn with leggings.
3.0,My daughter loved these sandals but they are already falling apart within 2 months of use.
3.0,"If you are concerned about the measurements they give, they aren't accurate. I could fit another person in there with me lol. Other than that they are cute. They do move around a bit but not too big of a deal."
3.0,"I was prepared to love this, but the sizes are way way small..."
3.0,"Overall the necklace is very cool looking, and considering the price I was expecting plastic. but this necklace feels very fragile. It was cheap though, so all in all I can't complain!"
3.0,Look Great but cheap quality.
3.0,Lightweight leather like material. Fine for what I need it for.
3.0,"I love these, but they run very small."
3.0,"These are nice, make sure you hand wash"
3.0,Shipping was fast and quality of dress is great! Was too small in XL. I usually am between large and XL so I went up. Should have gone up another size.
3.0,very small XL
3.0,"Nice color but a bit large, baggy shorts"
3.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It sure is pretty but it's HUGE! I thought I would keep it for myself but the band doesn't appear to be adjustable as there were no extra links or instructions included so it's going back.I guess I missed the part of the description that had dimensions and adjustability (or lack there of).
3.0,"Not sure why these got high marks from other buyers, as they are no better than no-show socks you can buy in the store. Wore these with loafers and had to pull them up no less than 30 times over a 4-hour period, before I finally took them off."
3.0,"Sadly I returned this item.  The magnet, while strong won't prevent it from pulling if you are digging in your purse or it catches something.  Its beautiful..."
3.0,It serves the purpose and doesn't look bad but it is NOT leather as it is described.
3.0,I didn’t like the quality.
3.0,Little holes have shown up after multiple wears and washes. Quality not so good
3.0,This product was cute but didn’t fit right. The back was too low and showed my butt crack... didn’t fit me well but it may fit other body types well.
3.0,"Not very flattering, might wear as an under shirt"
3.0,"Bought these exact ones 2 years ago, same numbers in the size of the ear muff, same color. The first pair I bought fit my son perfectly for he past 2 years of everyday use. They’re kinda falling apart and he requested the same ones because he loves them so much. The second pair is too short for his head, it only covers half of his ears. I put both pairs side by side and the new ones are significantly smaller."
3.0,"Listen to the other reviewers, these run small (not in mm, but in diameter). For small lobes only. I'm lucky I have such thin lobes. But I'm still a little paranoid that these may slip out, especially if your lobe holes are a little oily."
3.0,Came badly damaged like the carrier had stepped on it high heels or something... A very detailed and good quality tardis was the only thing that made me give it more than one star.
3.0,These were recommended to me by someone who loved them but they didn’t work for me. They scrunched my toes together.  Otherwise they are cute. I ended up returning them because of the fit.
3.0,"I own the Georgia Wallet and want to switch for the days I use smaller bags but didn’t work. Although this Wallet has a lot of pockets, it gets to bulky if you fill in completely. I’ll return to my Georgia Wallet"
3.0,Quality not bad for the price but the color was way too different from pictures... Had to return.
3.0,"I'm a 36D so this definitely fit small. Thought it could be a sexy sports bra, but it's sort of uncomfortable so I don't know how much use I'll get out of it."
3.0,"Find myself not wearing it on account of the tight elastic band.  In all fairness, I do have a big head.  :P"
3.0,"I loved the look, quality and feel but it was just to small"
3.0,"It looks nice, the print designs on both sides of the sleeve instead of one side so it's kinda tacky looking in my opinion, and the sleeve doesn't like to stay in place I have problems with it sliding down"
3.0,"I bought a black/white ruffled (Tweed) skirt - very cute, fits just right, but the shoulder strap length is not adjustable , and after one machine wash a lot of thread snagged and pulled. Poorly tailored.  It says “machine wash cold,” but I would recommend to hand wash . I had to fix and trim a lot of loosened threads. Was excited about this product initially, but now disappointed."
3.0,The item came and it was perfect and so pretty. Bud sadly they sent me the wrong size. I had ordered a size large. They sent me a size small. So I'm returning it and gonna be hoping to get the right sis.
3.0,"Me quedo muy grande, yo peso 110 libras."
3.0,"I ordered the Black and Navy two pack and love the shorts. Perfect swim trunks.  I decided to order the Gray ones.  They are 3"" smaller in the waist and about 1.5"" shorter.  I don't know if they are mislabeled or the gray just run smaller than the other ones."
3.0,"Runs loose, not made well"
3.0,"The bracelet looks really great however the clasp is unfortunate as it cut into the skin of my son. It scratched in several areas of the wrist as the clasp do not line up evenly and has sharp edges. This bracelet would be great if it had a different clasp, however it is unfortunate because my son really liked this bracelet and can not wear it."
3.0,It is more like a house dress or a pajama dress then anything I can wear out.
3.0,"Works well but not as dramatic as advertised. Also good when overcast/raining. Solid unit with metal frame.  Could use a little more cushioning at the end of the arms. I drive a sedan on back country roads with a bunch of yahoos with lifted trucks and off-road only LED headlights. There is no high/low setting on these LED headlights, only ""I want it bright enough to see into the future"" setting, so yes these help!."
3.0,"They're so cute and fit perfect. They're totally wearable and have nice pockets but mine came with holes in the seams that I fixed on my own. The material is pretty weird too, definitely rougher than I expected. I think they should be cheaper because of the quality but I do still wear and enjoy them."
3.0,"The pattern was cool as was the cut design, like what you see in the photo, however the quality was just too cheap for me to consider keeping this suit. For the price it might be worth it to you, but the seams were really obvious right in the middle of your chest and it made me worried they might not hold up. If you're looking for something cute but super cheap and not worried about quality or durability, this might be the ticket. Although usually I want my suits to last a little longer"
3.0,"Ordered an XS, and they fit nicely, maybe a little bit loose compared to other XS leggings I’ve worn in the past. When I put them on, I absolutely loved the way they looked. I got tons of compliments at the gym, but after the first workout in them (and not a particularly intense workout,) they had a run in the worst possible spot, down the middle of my butt near the crotch. I had to leave the gym early, so disappointing. I’ve already ordered them in another color because I liked them so much at first, so I’m hoping this is just a one off.<br /><br />My updated review: the new color I ordered I returned because they were too loose. The seller contacted me and sent another original pair and was very polite and helpful. I’ve worn the new pair one time. These are a little bit loose (still an XS), but not too loose that I won’t wear them. I wore them once to the gym before being quarantined at home, and they held up. Still love the way they look on, very flattering."
3.0,Good materia and comfortable but the bust area is so not comfortable..  i have small boobs and still feel like it's not covering that area so good.. if you have big boobs this won't feel comfortable at all..
3.0,"Wish it was an actual sweatshirt. It’s just a thin polyester. It’s the type of polyester that everything sticks to. Lint, pet hair and your hair. Hard to remove with a lint roller. Also sized up but wish I hadn’t. It runs probably true to size. I still like the style. Was hoping it would shrink after washing but it doesn’t."
3.0,"I have to take some responsibility for not catching it before purchasing but the quality control manager might want to break out that spell check. It's ""R-O-A-R"" 🤦🏼‍♀️"
3.0,Too small in bust area. Its long on short people so rocked it with some stiletto heel boots.
3.0,Looked good made good but too small
3.0,"It is a very cute dress but the fit is so awkward on my body. The top is too small. If you are very small up top then this is the dress for you. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me."
3.0,Wrongs small
3.0,Very good sturdy glasses & come with a nice case to hold them  - plus cleaning cloth & carrying pouch.<br />Just got these - so I have only used them once & did help just a little with the glare of lights.  I notice when you are on the road at different heights/hills - levels or angles they seemed not to work so well.  I will use them because they did help some with headlight glare & reflection.
3.0,Pretty color but cheap and thin so decided to return
3.0,I love these but the reason for the 3 stars is the posts are too fat and hurt my ears.
3.0,"Looks cute and I like the inscription but you have to double the hair tie to keep it on the bracelet. Also, you can't wear the bracelet without a hair tie because it's so big and falls off your wrist. And I have a pretty large frame and the bracelet is still falling off of me. I guess it runs big.<br />Shipped from China so it took forever to get here, over a month."
3.0,"Was expecting the same colors as shown in the picture but got something different, had more white in it. Top portion was a bit snug but other than that it was a show stopper."
3.0,Waiste will fit as expected.  But be warned this cargo short is long in length.  Im 6'2 and ordered the 33 size and this this thing looked like i was wearing capri style pants (almost 4-5in pass my knees) get it if your into that.
3.0,"Poor quality, couple even came with small defects"
3.0,Loved the concept and stylish look. However the Solar fan is not durable. I purchased 2 from this site and both hat solar fans stopped working after a few weeks. Love the hat but the solar fan doesn’t last. Too late to return.
3.0,"I wish that I would've received two of these for the price but, the anklet itself is adoreable (It does actually say 1pc I should have read the decription more thoroughly) . Part of the chain broke the 2nd time i wore it but, it actually looks better that way & is easier to walk in.  I'm hesitant to order one for the other foot."
3.0,Bottoms were too small for top.
3.0,Great wallet! But is not made the best. Card holder part is not sewn together so sometimes my cards go on the inside of the wallet and I gotta fish them out.
3.0,"I bought a similar wallet at Walmart for $12, which I loved and used for over a year. I finally retired it, but it was still fully functional. I bought this one as a replacement, and was extremely disappointed when the clasp stopped closing after a few months."
3.0,"The y are very lightweight. (Quality is ok). Kind of large on face. Wish they were a little smaller, but for the price I'll keep them!"
3.0,Super cute but they run small. i ordered a 9 and my daughter wears an 8 and they were too small.
3.0,Material typical cotton not super soft. Maybe after some softener in the laundry. Run a little on the small side. I can wear the pants but not a lot of room. I buy extra large cause I want the room  Shirt too tight. Where normally will be loose at that size
3.0,"My bad, I think I didn't read the ad. I expected the soft, wonderfully soft MediPeds that I buy in the store. These are like compression socks which I do not like. As said, my bad, just caution to read the whole description to determine if it is what you want."
3.0,My zipper to my boots pulls out the threads of these leg warmers.
3.0,Pretty and petite earrings but if you look close the stones are set crooked and the silver is on the cheaper side. A little overpriced for the size and quality.
3.0,It's nice but a very tight fit. Also the helmet is very small
3.0,"I am 5'7 and have a long torso as well and these came up about 3 inches above my belly button- way too high waisted. I folded the top over but then it was not high waist at all. Also, I am 25 waist and 37 hips, it fit and most of the pants had a lot of stretch but the top of the pants does not stretch so it was really hard to get over my hips. If youre larger than my measurements it would probably rip the top seam. The pants are horrible but for $16-18 I think I find cuter so I will return. The fabric is the type that will definitely show wear easy and fade."
3.0,"I purchased the black slippers today through my healthcare provider. They are fairly comfortable, but not quite snug enough for my feet and I would prefer a strap around the back.  I could live with the imperfect fit, but the problem is, after two hours of wearing these slippers around my house I noticed they are making black marks all over my hardwood floor.  I'd hate to see what the floor would look like after an entire day of slipper wearing.  Of course, the marks will come off, if I kneel on the floor and rub them off, but overall, although my feet may be a little more comfortable with the slippers, but my knees, back, etc, will be sore from the floor scrubbing.<br />Definitely not worth the high price and I wish I could return them."
3.0,"This blouse runs two sizes smaller that US sizing. There is also a considerable difference in the feel of the fabric between different colors. The grey is ok. The blue feels terribly rough and is being returned. The fabric is not breathable at all for either color blouse so even in AC it feels warm. On the plus side, for a chiffon blouse it is not sheer so a slip or camisole would not need to be worn with these colors. It is also long enough in the back to fully cover the rear when wearing leggins.<br />Note that the tabs on the sleeves go through metal D rings and will most likely need to be tightened repeatedly throughout the day."
3.0,"I have small wrists and my fitbit falls off my hands.  If you have regular sized wrists, I am sure this product would work great for you."
3.0,"The color is not as vibrant, i ordered 7 and my granddaughter uses 6 and uts very small,unable to fit with socks. shes wire them a few times and they are fading and look old.<br />I also ordered the red,blue and yellow, the red is brownish,not as bright."
3.0,"These will stretch to fit a wide calf. However, that stretch is means the weave has holes and thus not really a leg warmer."
3.0,Delivered broken but I was able to fix.  I'm a relatively handy person though. Very pretty and would have rated higher if it wasn't broken.  It's a pretty heavy metal so it doesn't feel cheap.
3.0,"Nice presentation, but the polarized glass is not the best. The won I ordered was better lens, but the frame broke."
3.0,"It’s a beautiful ring, but the metal tarnishes. I actually ended up returning it because it just looked dirty constantly. It scuffed easily."
3.0,Great price however the shirt is very thin.
3.0,I am returning this shoe because the soles squeaked and made loud noises when I walked.  Otherwise I would have kept it because I liked it a lot.  I have both hardwood and tile floors.
3.0,"They're very short. I'm 5'10"" and they are only capris length..."
3.0,Cute but was smaller than I expected
3.0,Lamentablemente no me gusto el material en que esta hecho de mi parte yo nolo recomiendo bien disen mejor comprar más caro que va a hacer buena calidad que barato mala calidad.
3.0,"Some reviewers stated the mask is not as wide as shown on the model picture, but I ordered anyway. I intentionally ordered the masks with only “adult” in the description thinking I would receive larger than child or teen girl. I was wrong. The masks do not go anywhere near my ears and gap over my cheeks. More under-chin coverage would be desirable, too. The mask (solid color) is of heavier fabric yet breathable and well made. The ear edges are a bit too stiff."
3.0,"My husband is very disappointed in these boots!  He has worn these boots 4 times and The fabric is already separating from the rubber, causing them to leak!  At the ankle, the hard rubber digs into his outside ankle bones and has rubbed them raw!  They are only warm when worm with thick, wool socks!  He had this boot previously, 4 years ago, and there is no comparison!  Very disappointed!!"
3.0,Cute glasses but took forever to get her. Worth the cheap price though.
3.0,Price was good but the product was a little on the cheap side. What do you expect though with the price? You get what you pay for.
3.0,just ok. It looks nicer in the picture
3.0,Not worth the money. It's great that they're polarized but they're very dark and very flimsy.
3.0,"These sandals are very pretty.  If your only going to wear them for a hour,  then take a chance on them.  If your looking for a sandal to enjoy for hours at a time,  I would pass up on these.  They are very hard on the bottom of your feet."
3.0,"This may seem nit-picky but, while these pants are fine, I'd expected COTTON pants, sort of like really, REALLY light-weight cargo pants almost (that's the only way I can think to describe what I mean).  These are absolutely no different from jersey sleep-pants.  I put them alongside the Hanes PJ pants I have & they're the same product.  Exactly the same.  SO I guess they're OK but NOT what I'd expected."
3.0,"Revised in March: My boy just ripped through the hinge. There is no such thing a non-destructible to my 5-year-old boy.  Am checking if there is any kind of replacement offered.<br />Note: These do not come with a case. They were in a ziplock bag.  These fit my child's face (age 5, almost 6) great. We previously had Miraflex frames for him but they were a bit too large and the hinge style on these works much better because he can't bend the bows out like he could on the Miraflex. Also, the price is so low compared to others - you can't go wrong. Only wish they had more color options."
3.0,"This is a warm jacket for fall or the beginning of spring in most climates. The sizing is way off, I usually wear a US size 6/small and in this jacket a large fits. The size chart guided me to the right size but if a size 6 wears a large I am wondering what happens to ladies who usually wear a large! I do admit to buying a medium if I plan to layer but a large is really out of my wheelhouse. Also, the jacket has a tag with washing instructions in symbols. I went online to decode the symbols and some are not anywhere to be found so I am clueless as to how to clean this jacket. The arm length runs a bit long but since the material around the wrists is knit it works for this short armed girl. Zippers are good quality and look nice. The pockets are a bit high up but this placement allows for roomy large pockets. The jacket is stylish and warm I just wish it had clear laundering instructions."
3.0,Much thinner than expected. More of a light jacket than an actual coat. Disappointed
3.0,Cute dress nice feeling fabric but too shirt for y’all girls. 5 11” and it was half was up my calf
3.0,"I am a true size 6 (I have an athletic build) I sized up thinking it would have a free people fit; however; on me, it was way too tight in the chest and arm area."
3.0,Decent. Leaks a little.
3.0,Super cheap and arrived weeks later than expected. Disappointing.
3.0,"Five masks were a great value, three masks not so much."
3.0,"Seems to be good quality, just too small"
3.0,Okay. Can't figure out how to wear it
3.0,"fit a a little tight around the neck,"
3.0,Bands were not as soft as others I have bought. The stiffness of the band feels more like plastic. I didn’t like it. The print is cute though.
3.0,Mini purse. Cute but disappointing size. My fault-- measurements were offered.
3.0,"Doesn't look great on broad shoulders, if buying- go 2 sizes larger than normal."
3.0,"I think this case has some great and unique ideas, but the execution needs some work. It is all doable if the manufacturer fixes some simple issues. The outside of the case has a nice smooth look. I was confused about the inside, because it was kind of fuzzy, but I looked back at the description and realized that it is microfiber and meant to provide more protection to the case. Because you don't see or feel it once the case is actually on the phone, it's not a big deal, I just thought it was weird. If it really does protect the case more then it's okay to keep that part since like I said you don't see it once it's on the phone. The biggest issue is that when I was holding the case, the bottom part just came off -- I went back to the description again and saw that it is supposed to be a 2 piece case, so at least I know it didn't break, BUT I did try to lock it in tighter and there is no lock or click. It just slides together without locking together, so I would be really concerned that it's going to randomly fall off while on my phone between putting in my pocket, purse, or just while using it. It was a great idea to make  it easier to put the case on the phone, but these two pieces need to lock together tightly in order for it to really work. If this issue is fixed then this could be a great case. For now I'm just too afraid that what is supposed to protect my phone is going to fall apart.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

3.0,Bought 2 of these for my daughter in July. One has turned the other has stones that have fallen out.
3.0,I got an extra large bc I have big boobs. And it does not fit at all. I ended up giving it to my 125lb sister who has not boobs at all and it fits her just fine.  Other then that. The print is really pretty
3.0,"They are a nice fit but stretch out quite a bit after a while.  They are way too long.  I am not short at all.  5'6"" and they are too long even with platforms.  I was not given an option for regular or long so I'm not sure why this was not addressed in the description.  Also some tears in the butt and crotch seams after only a few wears."
3.0,These were much bigger than expected... Maybe I should read a little better..
3.0,"I like these gloves, but they aren't very durable.  I wore holes through the fingers the first or second time I used them.  They are still useful, but probably only for very light jobs or if not, maybe only a couple more times."
3.0,The bracelet is very cute. However the leather cord that is attached to the elephants trunk does not stay on and is constantly slipping off.
3.0,The material on this one is strange and really absorbs orders (both body and environmental) and doesn't breath well
3.0,The fit was good. I hand washed it and the moth ball smell is gone.
3.0,"The dress looks very pretty in the picture but the fabric is sort of strange.  It's very stretchy ... the netting on top as well as the skirt underneath.  The netting on top also doesn't iron very well.  I got this dress for my daughter's high school graduation.  It really didn't look bad on her, though and she didn't say it was uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,It's cool. It's a watch. It tells time. Never wear it in water ..even to do the dishes . . Be mindful cause it takes no time for it to look cheap.. it is but you know what I mean 🙂.. but it's function works just fine.
3.0,I bought these to wear around the house and when I go for walks.  I bought my normal size but they were wayyyy to small so I had to return them.
3.0,"I love the fit of this bralette.<br />What I don't like is it's virtually see through, which would have been fine, had I been expecting them to be. I bought the pink and white pair, maybe darker pairs for the future. The fit is great and the fabric used is very soft to the touch. It's comfortable to wear all day."
3.0,Nice product- but they didn't fit over my calves.
3.0,It's OK! I must have small wrist or this is mad for men but its BIG on me.
3.0,The color is nothing like the photo. It is a warmer shade of brown that I was expecting...a bit disappointing. But It is comfortable and I will probably keep it.
3.0,"This dress is very cute, but much, much shorter than expected. I am 5’8” 130 pounds, and ordered a size small.  It fit perfectly except it was really short. I didn't see a length anywhere in the description, but the photos looked like a couple of inches above the knee. On me, it was fingertip length, like a tunic. It was 7 inches from the top of my knee. Overall length from the seam at the top of the shoulder to the hem measured 31 inches. It probably would be ok for a shorter person, but I don't want to wear leggings under a sundress, so it's gotta go back. Bummed, because everything else was great! Hope this review helps other tall people."
3.0,great product but when wearing the bracelets without a hair band the ends scratch my skin.
3.0,Very cute! But also r smaller Asian sizes. I got a size larger and it's very tight on me.
3.0,"It’s the exact dress shown, so that’s always a plus. I just don’t have the right body for the fabric-it’s lightweight/flimsy and for me (34DDDD), needs a strapless bra, (which adds bulk), since the fabric doesn’t hold tight enough to support. I would typically get a smaller size (L), but because of my chest I got XL and that makes it work but has a uni-boob effect, and the arm bands are a little tight as well.<br />I’m considering keeping it, but have my eye on a couple other dresses for the reunion I am going to.<br /><br />If you are young, firm, fit, don’t need a lot of upper support this would be so cute!"
3.0,not good not bad.
3.0,"I got this for my 3 month old. She weighs 14 pounds and wears size 3-6 months in everything else. Unfortunately this 3-6 month outfit is more like a 12 month outfit. She won’t get to wear it for a while. It’s very cute, just way too big. It’s super lightweight and very soft though and comes with a cute bow that you have to tie yourself. If it were true to size I think I’d love it more."
3.0,Looks good but not good quality. The buckle broke the first day I used it.
3.0,Super cute but ordered two different sizes and neither worked for my daughter had to return both.  Top are too tight and bottoms were oddly weird at some spots.
3.0,smaller than expected and a bit too thick
3.0,I did not like one thing about it because the back part the the band broke after 10 minutes!
3.0,"I needed spacers for my Pandora and while these do the job, they are just okay. But for the price I wasn't expecting too much anyway. Some of the spacers are very lovely and cute but others are very inelegant (doesn't fit the look of my Pandora bracelet). I only liked about half of them. BUT the product is as advertised and fits my needs so I'm okay with not using half of them."
3.0,The feel of the material is weird and cheap. If you can get over that it is super cute!!
3.0,Returned because I decided I did not need them.
3.0,Easy and simple
3.0,The ban broke after 3 weeks not good.
3.0,"The ladies bracelet makes for a great addition to a main bracelet, but I wouldnt wear it by itself. I was expecting a more solid piece of jewelry, but it seems light and plasticy. It's dainty enough that you can't tell, especially when it's paired with another piece. I've been wearing it 24/7 and it's held up well, through a couple of weeks of showers, too. The men's bracelet, since it's bigger, you can tell it's not a solid metal bracelet. It looks like a plastic bracelet."
3.0,"I love these shoes but I've had to fix both of them myself, twice.<br />The bottom sole has peeled back on the front and the back.<br />The owner did say he would give me a code if I sent them back to get some new ones, but it was just too much trouble since the sale wasn't going on anymore, so I just fixed them myself."
3.0,They were so heavy that they made my normal size ear lobes droop. Avoid.
3.0,They fit fine. The only thing is they are too short. Before I ordered them I  checked out some reviews. The majority of the reviews stated that they are too long and how people have to roll them up.So I decided to order a pair since they are advertised as classic long Overalls. About 3 inches too short. Contacted their customer service and have to say they are not very helpful. Guess I will cut them into shortalls
3.0,Not super great quality and runs small
3.0,"Eh. VERY cute when I pulled it out of the shipping package. Even cute on a hanger. This cut was made with very, very specific proportions/ height in mind- I'm 5'3&#34;, and this JUST touches my upper thighs. If you're 5' or shorter and are a size 00- this would be cute for you."
3.0,"Bought these to wear under some summer tops that required a strapless bra. These are ok, but they are hot and not all that comfortable. The fabric doesn’t breath…at all. They would be great in the winter when I decide to go strapless…not sure I would ever need that! Lol! They offer ok support. I’m a C cup, so not a lot of extra baggage. Won’t buy again or recommend, but one girls junk is another girls treasure."
3.0,"I wear a large and ordered a large. I'm 5 foot 10, and wear size 34 pants. This was not big enough. Go a size or two higher than the sizing chart says. This was too small.<br /><br />Besides that, the outfit is mostly good. But the mask has no air holes, is a bit tough to get into, and the eye holes are tiny so it's hard to see out of them. I will be modifying the outfit to fit better on me, but the outfit is simply not large enough. The cloak is small and doesn't cover me enough. The pants barely fit on.<br /><br />If you wear a large, go XL or double XL. Large is like a medium or maybe even a small."
3.0,"The lens is short, therefore when you look up, the frame is in your eyesight. You need to do allot of nodding. It gets aggravating after awhile."
3.0,"The shorts are cute. I ordered them for a Chuckie Finster costume but unfortunately because they are more teal* then actual green, I have to return them."
3.0,Don’t like at all.  Sit in my drawer and will some day give them away.
3.0,Can't tell which side is front or back. Smells terrible like a petroleum factory.
3.0,i wish there was more designs i got a lot of them that were the same. but it was ok and priced good!
3.0,I liked the cute little design. But after 2 showers the colors fade super bad and stain your skin.
3.0,Looks thicker in the pic and I am usually a medium I ordered a large so I could wear it over a sweater or sweatshirt it fits tight the fur is very thin and matted good lightweight jacket for over a tshirt
3.0,I’ve style but ran large in size
3.0,Gets tangled in my beck when worn long time.
3.0,"Not quite as pictured. No variation in the lense, totally black lenses. If they took a new more accurate pic, these would get 5 stars. They are cheap sunglasses,  but not crappy."
3.0,"Very hot to wear, make sure you are willing to get in the water."
3.0,"I was expecting a bit more these... they are just not as nice a quality as I had hoped.  I have included a pic to try and help.  The earrings are very small.. which I did expect.  The bracelet is really just a throw away.  I missed ordering this style of earrings - which is really all I wanted - without the bracelet.  So I paid $25 for both pieces. Eh.. The earrings are certainly overpriced even with the bracelet in my personal opinion.  I can no longer wear pierced earrings so I am collecting a few pieces that I can integrate with other pieces I have.. I don't have a lot of &#34;turquoise&#34; options for earrings, so I will keep them.. but I can't really recommend them at this price or even less.  They'll work.. but they will not be my go-to's or my favorites by a long run. They do have a stone like feel...and are definitely turquoise like... the bracelet has a little weight. The earrings are quite light, good for comfort.  The fall is very small... they provide a very good photo of this on a model on the ad page.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope my effort and photo to provide this review is helpful to you!"
3.0,"I found these tanks recommended on a website reviewing yoga tops that don't ride up. It's true. They don't ride up. But I will never go out in public wearing only this tank. The fabric is so thin and revealing that I'll need to wear another top over it. But, if this tank doesn't ride up, hopefully it will keep whatever I'm wearing over it in place as well!"
3.0,The skirt is pretty and fits well. But the material is super snaggy.
3.0,"Material is weird but somewhat stretchy. Clot of fabric is just like the picture online. I usually get XL for dresses but ordered XXL and happy I did because if fits bit too tight. Great length on dress, slit in back goes up pretty high but not inappropriate. Only paid $14.99 and would not pay more than that with material used."
3.0,"Nice quality, but it’s cut too small"
3.0,More like a deep tan than the light beige pink hue that is shown in the. Still a nice casual overlay. The fit is somewhat small. I normalls wear a small and ordered a medium as per other reviews and even then I would have liked it fit more loosely.
3.0,"It looks super cute on the model and on many of the ladies who've posted reviews, but that wasn't the case for me. I am 5'3 (ordered a size S) and there is a LOT of fabric in this dress. The length on me was as pictured on the model. The neckline is definitely not off-the-shoulder, though. All that fabric just hung everywhere, without looking stylishly drape-y as I was hoping. I was still considering keeping it as something to lounge around the house in, but the final straw was that my teen daughter said I looked like I had climbed into Santa's gift sack ... so back to Amazon it went!"
3.0,"A little on the small side, it is pretty but all the hearts on closer view are not completed, at least the one I received. I have ordered other charms from this seller and some have been great, while others are ok."
3.0,Runs small in sizing.  Order a size bigger than you normally order.
3.0,They came in as a very light grey color instead of the darker Grey as pictured. But the fir is good.<br />5’6 143lbs size small
3.0,The skirt is too long for my height of 5'2.
3.0,"Okay this jumpsuit is precious! HOWEVER, the fit is pretty weird and is paper thin."
3.0,"These did not fit well around my waist and seemed to loose. The length is good for wearing under shorter dresses. The lace band is a nice add and doesn't feel to tight. I returned because I did not care for the waistband. I am 5'4"". 165 lbs and ordered a Large which fit fine."
3.0,Cute almot-comfortable shorts that I wanted to love.<br /><br />There is a wide elastic band in the waist that started to twist the first time I wore them.  After a couple washes the elastic is so twisted and bunched they will likely be thrown away soon.
3.0,I love this band which makes it so sad that it isn’t durable enough to to wear everyday. My wrist is small and I have to use the band that holds the band down which is ruining the end of the band.
3.0,"Item is ok, there is no hem on this so the edges roll. Pretty cheaply made for the price. All they did was cut from a roll and ship. For this price you would have thought they would have at least hemmed it. The design is also printed on not woven in."
3.0,"The polka dots are giant, so in this light blue I looked like grandma Mickey Mouse. The waist is high, so it flairs out above my belly, and makes it look even bigger. I'm 5'2"", 135lbs."
3.0,didnt realize that they aren't polyster
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but I had to return it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-it's beautiful<br />-perfect brunch/summer dress<br />-material is perfect for summer/spring<br />-probably looks good with sandals and heels<br /><br />CONS:<br />-fits baggy at the chest. (I am a 34B)<br />-bending down was going to be a nightmare because it was a bit short on the butt (i am 5'1"")<br />-it is made of incredibly thin material that renders the dress fairly see-through, despite being lined. I would've had to use a skirt slip or something, which I do not have and would've had to purchase separately.  buying the slip for the sake of keeping this dress would've made the dress no longer worth the money.<br /><br />---if you have a skirt slip, this is the dress for you."
3.0,Product was a lot smaller than we thought.  Quality is great for the little ones.  We gifted it to a little girl since it didn’t work for our granddaughter!
3.0,"They don't shine so much, they see opaque metal."
3.0,I absolutely love this product but would like to tell who makes it that they need a better glue. On the bracelet I lost 4 stones in one day and luckily found 3. I bought a second one for a friend for Christmas and it is already here. I love it so much but I hope her stones dont fall out. I have had my earrings also for about a year and wore them about 6 times. Unfortunately a stone fell out of the earrings too. I would love to return them and have them fixed.  They are so beautiful I just hate the stone problem.
3.0,"Sizes varied within the 3 pack. They seem to be made well enough. The varied sizing didn’t bother me too much, but might be a problem for others."
3.0,"I just got this product July 19, 22 and it's Aug 22, 22 and there's I seam rip on the side of the left hand glove! I wanted my money back but it's too late for that. Might not want to buy this set of gloves."
3.0,nice other than the stain that it came with
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:76e6aa0a0b6296f90fa5b7b89d22f8ad]] With improvements this could be 5 star product. I like and search high and low for a SLIM braided solo band, I have a small wrist. The band is stretchy enough to slip on and off my hand but it does stay in place on my wrist.  The sliding connectors are plastic. They do have that sliding middle lock mechanism that most bands have.<br /><br />The only downside and con is the plastic connectors are not a 100% true fit with the Apple Watch, see pictures. There is a small gap on the curve. When taking the band off, my Apple Watch left grooves in the plastic connectors. If the connectors were silicone or metal I think that would fix the issue.<br />I give it a three star as the connectors are an important and vital piece. Overall, I like the design and the slim solo band."
3.0,These earrings are nice just too heavy.
3.0,Comfortable but is too big  Sizes run big!
3.0,Nicely made but too small.
3.0,Kids loved it but some of them didn't work
3.0,"I'm 5'6"" and a half or so, and sometimes dresses can be a little short, especially since I have a long torso. I would consider ordering this dress in a larger size to get a little more length.<br /><br />It's a great price and hugs my body appropriately (typically 12-14 and ordered a L), but it would probably work better for someone 3 or so inches shorter than me especially if pairing with cute wedges to dress it up a little."
3.0,Slippers not true to size. I will be ordering a half size smaller.
3.0,"I love the look of these glasses, but feel they don’t fit on my nose properly. Just sort of a weird fit. Cute as can be though, and I have a narrow nose so I don’t think it’s the glasses so much as it is me with the fit."
3.0,It's a lovely top but sizing is way off. Much too small. Would not buy from this manufacturer again. I gave it 3 stars because it's a pretty top.
3.0,Fabric was weird. Kind of like bathing suit fabric. I expected linen/cotton…it didn’t flow the way I wanted so I returned it. Color/design looked ok though and length was good.
3.0,not a very forgiving fabric so it was a little snug
3.0,Ordered a small & it fits like a men’s medium...-
3.0,"The pearls were black, but appears that the charm and earrings are midnight blue."
3.0,"It came with the smallest nose piece attached, and it was way too big for my 10 year old. These are definitely for adults."
3.0,"The sizing is funky so it fits oddly, and then when you wash it (as one does when clothes are dirty) the red coloring bleeds into the white sleeves, turning them into a pale pinkish color. 🙄"
3.0,"Pros:  This reinforces hard case is well made. I appreciate the latch onto which I can easily attach to the outside of my handbag.<br /><br />Cons: Though it can hold 2 pair of glasses, it has just one big space.  It would have been better to have a separator so 1 pair would not scratch the other. Its too bulky for me and easily bangs into things, though it the best of what I found online."
3.0,"I like the look online - very Princess Kate. I ordered a small (I'm 5'3&#34; and about 125lbs with an hourglass shape). The very top portion fit beautifully, but the waist was about a couple inches too loose and the belt is purely decorational, so there was no way to tighten it. Also the skirt part was a very stiff fabric, not flowy, which was not incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />I was hoping this would fit well for my company's holiday party, since it looks great in the photos here, but it just missed the mark for my figure."
3.0,"The leather used in the construction of this wallet is of high quality and at first seemed too stiff.  The leather has since softened as it has broken in, but there remains a problem with the thickness of the billfold due to the unremovable ID holder.  If this was removable, I would rate it 5 stars"
3.0,"Cute, but not for all day wear. Also, the straps seemed a bit large around the ankle even when I wear it on the tightest buckle. For this reason, the shoe flops around and drags on the ground. I don't think this shoe will last more than a season."
3.0,"These gloves were ok, but for the price I expected more. My hands did not stay warm even when it was 10 degrees and only being out for 30 mins. The grippy stuff on the fingers and palm started coming off pretty quickly too. I didn’t have much luck with using a touchscreen while wearing them either."
3.0,"Was in good condition, but the color wasn't as I expected. I ordered the plum color, but it came more of a purple color. Not like the original Fitbit plum (which is expected), but also not like the color in the pictures exactly either. If you like the colors though, it's a pretty good product overall."
3.0,Way too big and not flattering at all. The yellow color is great
3.0,"It's pretty, but smaller than I expected."
3.0,"The cups are a joke. Way too small. The top looks long line in the photo but when you put it on the material just bunches up under the cups. I imagine someone out there has the right body type, and assuming they also stand perfectly still, for this to fit long line. It's just a shame too because the design and material are beautiful!<br />The garter/suspenders portion is gorgeous. The fit is lovely and I think will work nicely whether you're hippy, have a booty, or both. It's well constructed, goes on easily, and comes off easily as well.<br />I gave the top to a small chested friend and paired with a sexy nude bra and nude thigh highs."
3.0,"We ordered size 7-8 years and it came size S. Too large for 7 years old kid, though she wears clothes for 8 years old."
3.0,"The quality is super nice- heavy leather with pretty embroidery. I really wish it would've worked, but the fit was all wrong and size change wouldn't have helped- it was super loose on the waist and flattened out the booty. Not flattering at all for an athletic girl with curves. For reference- I'm 5'5, 135lbs- athletic with a smaller waist + booty. I could see this working for a slender all over kind of gal."
3.0,"It’s cute, doesn’t fit my cartilage piercing right"
3.0,Overly large for what I was looking for (typed in &#34;gym bag&#34; and got something the size of luggage) and it smells like a camping tent.
3.0,I normally don't approve of buying cheap piercing jewelry from Amazon or anywhere online but it was an emergency. They came within the week and they are simple enough to wear around Gramma.
3.0,The product was defective.  The circle was split and cracked.  It was not sealed.  This took away from the beauty of the earrings.
3.0,Very small for an eight year old!
3.0,Way too large. I sure wish sizes were standardized.
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it was way too short and rode up in all the wrong ways. if you are any taller than 5'5&#34;, get a large!"
3.0,"Too Tight & Too Short, I reccomend ordering 2 sizes up"
3.0,"Not so perfect. There is no angle.... I mean the gear fit is a curved machine and this band is straight. Because of the elestac force, the two long lines on the side of the band always tend to come out."
3.0,"Too small. I wear a size 6, but ordered up because of some of the reviews. Ordered an 8, but its way too small! Fits more like a 4. Item was returned. It was pretty good quality tho."
3.0,Jeans fit good..nice quality
3.0,I had bought a pair of these smaller without any color to them and still wear them today.  The ones that I bought with the sapphire were never right and found out at home thankfully that they would not lock together.  Amazed I had not lost it while away from the house.  I would love them IF they lasted longer!
3.0,"A couple of the seams were not fully secured and began to unravel after 5 washes (hang to dry).  Have repaired, but disappointed that it was needed."
3.0,The dress seemed cheaply made but held up well surprisingly.
3.0,The color did not look good on me so I returned it primarily for that reason. Also the material is very thin.
3.0,"Fits amazing and it’s pretty thick, I use this for the gym but it is hard to breathe in due to how thick it is and it holds a lot of heat in"
3.0,"I really like this dress and wanted to make it work, but it was way too tight in my butt and would be inappropriate for work. I'm 5'4&#34; and 144lbs. I ordered a medium and returned it. I feel like the large would have been too large."
3.0,They fit weird. They're also not very warm.
3.0,Did not came with instructions.  I had to YouTube the item to get an idea what is what.
3.0,"If you're looking for something to wear under skits/dresses to prevent chafing and embarrassing wardrobe malfunction, these do the job. They're comfy. Fabric is a little bit scratchy, and tends to stretch out a bit as the day goes on so I end up fiddling with them. But for the price, I'm satisfied."
3.0,The zipper comes off of the track everytime I try to open it or close it. The purse is cute but maybe not new as I ordered.
3.0,"The shirt is soft and cute, and it fits as it should. However, the shirt came with a large stain on the front of it. It looks like a food stain. I am hoping that it will come out."
3.0,The headband and stickers were fine.<br />But the kunai were miniature size... smallest I’ve ever seen lol. The product description didn’t offer dimensions of the kunai at all so I assume partial responsibility. Perhaps if you can stage a fight with your action figures with the miniature kunai or use them as darts than not at will be lost.
3.0,The bottoms were very transparent... fit well but didnt leave much to the imagination. I ended up just wearing the top with different bottoms.
3.0,The posts are extremely long.
3.0,Cute but wayyyy too large.
3.0,"Had to order a replacement since the first shirt was completely botched. Almost just returned it but decided to try my luck, and I'm glad I did. I like it for what it is and the replacement was just like advertised... Probably paid a bit much for it. Pic 1 shows the second order laid over the first--the graphic printed about 1-1/2 in. off-center. pic 2 and 3 show how the right shoulder was a good 5/8 in. Longer than the left. Fabric is 70% cotton 30% spandex, so it feels good. Stitching seems to pass visually, but haven't really worn it yet."
3.0,"Nice looking watch, but small band. Tool included to take links out, but no extra links to make it larger than 7.5 in."
3.0,"I am a 3x and it fit great.  I could make it bigger or smaller if needed.  The fabric was nice as well.  It did however come apart at the hanging loop on the second day.  It is not that big of a deal, but would have liked the loop for hanging on the hook.  I would still buy again, if after a few washes it is still as nice as it is now."
3.0,"Did not receive anything other than the belt clip. I bought two and they are nice and solid, but they are not as pictured."
3.0,"Cute band, i just got it today so i don’t know how it will hold up. It is not easy to install.  I actually had to trim some of it off to fit it in the groove and the clasp is backwards from the band it comes with."
3.0,Velcro area could be longer so the show could be more secured.
3.0,Small for size and pretty short.  I am 5' 7&#34; and it barely hits the top of my hips.
3.0,"I just chose the wrong type of glasses for my needs. Beautiful glasses but extremely uncomfortable on my nose. My mistake was thinking such a small frame would protect my eyes from the opposing traffic bright lights but it doesn't. This is a good pair if being worn indoor and you need to soften the light, but I will not use this set for driving (day or night) ... They have never transitioned past the lightest grey shown on the picture (yes, I've held them in the sun) ... They came in a beautiful fake leather pouch, though ..."
3.0,"This dress is super cute, the only issue I had with it was the sleeves being too long and baggy and the the upper portion of the shirt bunching a little. If the arms were a little more fitted I’d say it’s perfect"
3.0,Ordered a small. Received one that said small but fit more like a medium. Good thing I know how to sew.
3.0,Very cute but big on me
3.0,The face printed on it is way bigger then a normal face would be .
3.0,Runs very small. I am 115lbs and 5’4 and ordered a small. These were extremely tight and unflattering. The material was good quality but going to have to size up 2 sizes than normal!
3.0,"I bought this for my school's Honors Program ""Tacky Prom."" It was only a one-night event, so I decided to buy something cheap and easy. This ended up all over the floor of the dance, and I felt sheepish about wearing this. I inhaled a goodly amount of feathers that night as well.<br /><br />It looked great, and was suitable for a one-night costume, but if you're trying to buy this for kids or want to use it multiple times, I recommend you think twice before purchasing."
3.0,The colors are lovely and the design is retro. These head bands are to enhance not cover your hair.
3.0,It was too long.  Otherwise ok
3.0,"Bought it to prevent injury as I play with my Pitbull. I still feel the bite, but no punctures. You will feel right through this. It does not prevent the actual pain of the bite. But your skin will remain in tact. Only the hands are extra padded. Seems of good quality material and has not rip or tear after use. Comfortable. Only the arms are thin and .... ouch spot!"
3.0,somewhat fragile but worth the price
3.0,they seem a little too dark.
3.0,"Like everyone else, I can't understand why anyone would put the seam at the front of dress and not the back. I'm planning on flipping the straps so that I can wear it backwards in order to look right."
3.0,They grow in size as you wear them.
3.0,The shirt just met at my belt. I prefer longer shirts
3.0,I was honestly expecting better quality.  It'll be a great watch to workout in if I want to sweat in it but it's not too &#34;dressy&#34; looking.
3.0,"Ear loops uncomfortable. Had to attach extenders in order to tolerate wearing them. Once adjusted, it is breathable and comfortable against my face. Recommend next iteration have adjustable loops."
3.0,"Bought based on a previous purchase someone gifted because I thought it was amazing. While it's pretty sweet, I believe I received a flop. The speakers and battery work great, the right speaker doesn't stay in place and moves all over the place inside. Therefore, it's hard to use the buttons properly as they aren't always lined up."
3.0,I bought these belts hoping they were as good of a quality as what I bought off Facebook unfortunately they are not. First time I wore my black belt the snap pulled out of the belt. These are light weight. I will not be buying this brand again. Was so disappointed.
3.0,"When I saw this for my Iwatch, I instantly fell in love! It was delivered on the 18th of this month. Sadly it only lasted a week. It’s already broken...guess I’ll be sending it back<br /><br />****Update***<br />Amazon replaced my band and the pin hasn’t come out!!! It’s going on 2 months now *happy dance* thanks amazon!!!"
3.0,Cups were too big ordered a D fit like a DD
3.0,Shorter than expected. I’d have to wear shorts or jeans under it. I’m only 5’3” and these were still really short
3.0,"Ordered this in a different color and loved it so got this one. Fabric is different,  not cotton and dress is way too long. Other one fit perfect."
3.0,"Not real gold of course (gold plated resin) but makes a nice gift. The front is a Templar cross and the back the Templar seal. I have a historical and spiritual interest in the Knights Templar, but there are many different sorts of persons who would appreciate the encased coin. I also have one in silver."
3.0,It was cute a little hard to keep it on.
3.0,"Band are comfortable but they changed color in certain areas. For example, I wear mine daily and tend to drag my wrist across my desk when typing. Overtime, the band change color and start to look very cheap."
3.0,It was easy to put in and they are super cute . Only thing is the pink wasn’t as pink as the photo they presented
3.0,Hard to split apart to use.
3.0,"Loved this belly button ring but I wore it every day for a couple of weeks and some of the gems started to fall out. Looks really cute, just don't wear it swimming or in the shower or every day or it might fall apart a little."
3.0,"Good price. But, I purchased it for a birthday gift and it's much duller than shown on the website and it seems too fragile to be adjusted to fit over the wrist. Thus, I may be returning it."
3.0,Not enough dedicated spaces to hold pens.  I returned it.
3.0,"While it looks cute, however the smell was horrible"
3.0,It is not small like advertised.  It is larger than anything I have ever used.
3.0,Pretty but for a very tiny wrist like for a 8 or 10 I'm sending it back.
3.0,Chain broke at clasp
3.0,Front pouch was a little too small.
3.0,its ok. a little tight.
3.0,"No problem with packaging, but this watch is not really unisex. I personally think it is too big for a woman. Both the face and the strap. But, I will keep and see how it is in the summer with swimming in the pool!"
3.0,No pockets!
3.0,I did not like how small.it turned out to actually be. Wasn't at all what the picture with the person wearing it looked like. Comfortable but too small
3.0,They color of gold is kind of off with my other gold charms but it works.
3.0,Best fitting shorts I have bought in a long time. Nice looking and looks to be well made. I liked this pair so much I bought a second pair. The second pair did not fit as well as the first. They were tighter around the waist. I hope they do not shrink because there is no more room.
3.0,"Good news: I got tons of compliments on them and love that they're real wood.  Bad news:  They are held together with a simple post and drilled hole, which worked well in the beginning.  Over time, the post became looser and bent easily and the hole mush have become bigger because they would easily fall off.  I may try fix them myself bc I really like how they look.  Maybe I can add something to the hole, like sawdust packed in, to make it tighter."
3.0,It is falling apart a little after one use. I don't think I'll be able to bring it on the plane again. I should have spent more and got a different one.
3.0,"I ordered a 4T for my 3 year old who is very petite. The dress is tight in the chest and belly but bigger in the arms. It came all in one piece, not the dress/jacket/leggings as described. There were no leggings in my order. The zipper is sewn over so it doesn’t work. Overall I’m still happy bc it is cute on her and fits and she loved all of the accessories it came with (not to mention it was a 1/3 of the price as the costume at the Halloween store). Would recommend ordering a size up if you want it to fit for a while!"
3.0,Adorable outfit & great material but definitely buy a size or 2 bigger. My daughter is a size 4t & the shirt was way too tight & we struggled to get it on...  the short were alittle tight at her waist but lose around her legs. I ended up returning for the size 6.
3.0,I am 5'10 210lbs physique power builder normally wearing 30x32 pants. I have big quads and big butt. I was hoping to use these to run and squat in but to my surprise I already found them too small. I ordered a large thinking oh its a US medium and the waist should fit. I was wrong. If you have an athletic built and your butt isnt flat order another size up. I am a medium US and a L from where ever this is from so i should have ordered an XL.<br /><br />Other than that nice material slightly see through. I would also be weary of the stitching that they may come undone if they are too tight.
3.0,"I wish I  would of ordered the black ones. They would go better with a lot of clothes.<br />The shoes fit perfect without socks, but my bare feet sweat. They look good but I'm still not sure they are authentic coach."
3.0,Get a size down
3.0,"The fit on this was awkward compared to my other Coolibar items. I am a larger-busted lady with small-ribs, and the shoulder/collarbone area was just far too tight. The sleeves were nicely slim, the body was a decent fit, but the shoulder area just rode up and made an odd funnel effect. Fabric was rather thin, zippers were a bit sticky. Not what I expected."
3.0,"It's a great dress. Soft and comfy, easily dressed up or down, lightweight and NOT see-through. However... the length is ridiculous, I'm 5'3, and the dress comes about an inch above my ankle. If it went to the floor OR just below the knee it would be totally perfect, especially considering the price. That said, I'm thankful that I'm a seamstress and can alter the dress to fit me."
3.0,"I love the style and fit of these pants, however they do not survive actual wear and tear. I wash in cold cycles and dry in gentle,  but after just a few months they are falling apart.  It is very disappointing."
3.0,The product arrived on times and was of good quality.  They are a lot larger that they appear and really sit high off the nose.
3.0,This is a very pretty and well made blouse but I am returning it. I didn’t like the neck line so it’s just not for me as I won’t wear it.
3.0,the print hids the seem and weirdness. i would say 'ok'
3.0,"I liked the top somewhat, but the underwear did not look like the size it should have been. I think they need to work on that, because it all fits smaller than what it should. It's a pretty blue color, though."
3.0,These are ok for the summer but will not last long term.
3.0,"Get a smaller size , looks like pajamas or a moo moo . Got my size and I’m swimming in it."
3.0,"quality is not the best, but it looks great-  not bad for the price"
3.0,Wishing that the logo will be embroidered rather than sun screen
3.0,"The shoe looks great, but it is about two sizes too big.  My son wears a 13 kids, which were getting small. I ordered him a size 1 kids, and they're huge. He probably won't be able to wear them until next summer."
3.0,"Great fit cut style.... but I got the first pair they had a bleach looking strip on the left leg so I thought it was a defective pair, so I requested a return/replacement pair and the second ones came the same way. Just makes them look cheap and tacky! Not sure if it was just the light blue Jean's batch but definitely not the color or look in the picture! =/ I didnt mind it at all til the yellow bleach strip."
3.0,Waist of money does last more then an hr ... doesn't the fan dont help plus they send u the wrong face plate
3.0,LITTLE TIGHT
3.0,Pretty shoes but a little stiff.
3.0,Good price but material (espically on pants and headband) are super cheap!
3.0,"I decided to keep the beads as the refund was not worthwhile, But they are much smaller than described & I would not describe these as large pearls, very misleading."
3.0,"The largest pair of hoops the clamp is super tight and hurts my ears.  Other than that, great product, quick shipping and good price."
3.0,"Quality is ok, but the heel slips off."
3.0,not the real New Era hat...its a knock off
3.0,"The shirt was still very nice, nice material but instead of a neon green it is more of a grass green."
3.0,I really like these earrings although they do not look like how there were online. I wore them one day and by night time the plated part came off of the actual piece that goes in my ear.
3.0,"I love how it fits and covers my waist and butt/  it doesn't fit my chest as I'd hoped. I am a 34 G and I ordered a large. It holds me well without being too tight and it holds my girls up perfectly. However, my boobs hang out a bit on the sides and I didn't care for it."
3.0,The watch is overall good. The orange color really pops. There are illustrations on the band. However the display is extremely hard too see and that makes them pointless. Outside of that I think it looks great.
3.0,The net and tie ribbon are black. So it looks kinda cheap
3.0,I liked the dress except there was something funny with the belt. It didn't look right tied in the front or the back. I was thinking if the belt was longer & could wrap all the way around or maybe if the belt was detached it would fix the problem. I had to return.
3.0,Just bought this Perfit band and the material and style is exactly what I was looking for to replace my Moto 360 gen 2 watch. The only problem i have is the length of the strap is was too long. I have medium width wrist and i had to use the 2nd to last hole leaving a lot of extra strap. I wish they had 2 different sizes because I love the material and style. It is made of durable non-sticky rubber instead of cheap silicon material.
3.0,This was a really cute bag but I didn’t like the handles. They looked very cheap and as if they should be turned the other direction where the seams were not showing. Wound up sending it back.
3.0,"I love it.  The watch is rather small and that's okay, but the clasp doesn't keep the cover close."
3.0,"I purchased these socks because I read a review from a plus-sized customer saying that they fit her.  Unfortunately, the same was not true for the person I gifted these to.  To preface: she does have a large shoe size (12-13) and is a plus-sized woman.  These socks would not come up past her ankles.  These socks aren't very thick, nor are they very stretchy, but the sewing seems to be decent and the seams at the toe looks secure.  The best feature, in my opinion, is their brightness (which was one of the reasons I picked them!).  The colors are vibrant and fun, so I can't complain there."
3.0,"It was a lot longer than I was expecting, and the stitching was very sloppy."
3.0,Death it is a bit strange on the top looks weird. I don’t know if it’s because it’s white but you can see the padding through the top
3.0,"There nice headbands but the bow doesn’t hold its shape, it basically looks like a sad bow : ("
3.0,I purchased a similar necklace years back. However I lost it. When repurchased the item was not the same quality and actually snapper in half. It's beautiful but not made the same way again.
3.0,"I'm going to keep these, but I won't be able to wear them how I intend...to do yoga. They are opaque when standing, but as soon as you do a forward fold, that goes out the window. I ordered based on other reviewers and the size chart (L), and feel as though they fit, but the waist band is a bit loose on me, as well as the knees and ankles. I would have exchanged these for a smaller size (M), however, I'd be showing even more of my bum and I don't want that. These will work for the gym though, so I've decided to keep them."
3.0,The dress is well made no long excess strings and the design is very cute but the skirt was a bit too long for my daughter so I needed to alter the length. Only other major issue was that the headband was too heavy and kept falling with every slight turn or look up and even took the pins and bows I tried to secure it with out with it. My daughter still likes wearing it around the house playing dress up just without the hair.
3.0,it's ok. hard to get it to mold to your teeth
3.0,Is top heavy-keeps turning upside down when I wear it
3.0,"When item arrived links ans size of chain & bracelet very large-good for large person.  Should include diameter size in description, waste of $.  Could not give as gift"
3.0,"Size runs small, more like a size large than an x-large. Also the material was rough to touch. Ok product for the price."
3.0,its an awkward cut... almost too short to be a dress and too long to be a tunic
3.0,These were cute and fluffy but got dirty quick and broke off completely from the rope.
3.0,These were ok for shoes around the house but for an active 6 year old boy. These are poorly made. Made of a foamlike material. It’s been about 3 weeks and the design is wearing off.
3.0,I love this shirt but the sizing is smaller than normal. I bought it for my MIL but I dont think it will even go over her boobs. If the sizing was a little bigger it would be perfect.
3.0,"Ordered a medium, I'm 5'2&#34; 32B. Fits too big, might use it as a bathing suit cover for the summer."
3.0,I like the design but i feel it’s too long especially for a small design. Also since the chain is too long it does tangle a bit more. Wish the chain would be a bit thicker for the length or the charm larger
3.0,"Let’s start off with the price. $16 for two ties is an incredible value. BUT know this - you aint gonna get silk ties for that price. A solid good quality silk tie will set you back 50 bucks or more. But if you rarely wear ties (my husband wears them everyday to work) these will suffice. You get 2 polyester ties - a dark teal tie and a purple patterned tie. In my husbands words - I did not realize that these ties are skinnier than my usual business ties. If you are of slim build this will not be an issue. But if you are of larger or a portly build, this will look comical. I weight 190 lbs. and have a 44-inch chest and am 5’7”. The purple tie looked like a cartoon pictogram on me. I would have preferred it to be at least 30% wider than it is. It says width is 3.1” at its WIDEST but it was slightly under 3”. My typical tie is 3.75” at the widest point. 3/4” may not seem much but that balances pulling your ensemble outfit together or looking like a clown. Onto other points like the ease of tying the knots. I use Oriental and the Half Windsor techniques for the knots. It worked well for these ties. The length was satisfactory as is the thickness of these ties. They are not a piece of limp seaweed. There is a slight heft to them.<br />These are a solid 3 star product and they are colorful; but you do get what you pay for."
3.0,The tanks weren’t cotton as I expected. They fit tightly which made them not so comfortable. This was a miss for me.
3.0,It's super tiny!  The box it came in is equivalent to the size of a MAC lipstick box... No joke!  I was a bit shocked!
3.0,Such a great value! Love how cute these were but they were a little too wide for my little one.
3.0,"I have to wear Nitrile gloves for CoVid protection and do a lot of work on the computer. This leads to sweating hands inside the gloves. I bought the inserts to help wick the moisture away from my skin. The inserts fit well and (because of the half-fingers) give me good touch sensitivity on the keyboard.  They do effectively absorb the sweat inside the nitriles. The problem is that after about six wearings (and gentle hand washing after each use), they are starting to unravel and the seams are starting to split.  If these were about $1.00 apiece, I wouldn't care too much.  But at the $10+ per pair, I don't find them a good value and will probably shift to throw-away cotton inserts instead.  Great idea; poor quality and overpriced as a result."
3.0,"These are very comfy, but they have a giant problem that I found out about the moment I opened the package and has continued to this day to my shock. They are huge lint magnets! I opened them up and I literally saw lint get drawn to them from several feet away, what I would have thought impossible before. I washed them with fabric softener and dried them with those super anti lint dryer sheets in a dark load, they came out looking like a wooly mammoth! I did them by themselves and it barely let go of anything, so I used a lint roller to delint them and was going to wear them out but two minutes after putting them on they were covered again. My place is kept clean and I should be able to go from the kitchen to my bedroom without getting covered in lint, not pet hair lint from who knows where because nothing else I own does this. After more than twenty washes I still cannot wear these pants out, I can only wear them around the house. For that I guess there great but that's not why I got them. I give these pants three stars."
3.0,Wings were folded together and when pulling them apart to be worn a good amount of feathers fell off. Only got 1 use out of them as it ended up being white cardboard she was wearing by the end of the night.
3.0,"They are a little more gold than rose. But still good and doesn't irritate my skin,"
3.0,"This fits fairly well, although the waist is so high I notice it riding up over the bust at times— not a good look! Additionally, I wasn’t completely sold on the fabric. The print is pretty, but the cloth has almost a plastic-y feel and doesn’t breathe well. I have a similar style in another brand name in a solid color that I love— it has neither of the above  problems.<br />I am 5’7”, 150 lb, 36C , and I am happy in the size L- a bit of extra room but not baggy."
3.0,"I have a large, a little bigger in the waist but still nice dress."
3.0,Pretty not to cheap looking color was different but still nice
3.0,"Overall fit was great, except inseam was way too long, returned item."
3.0,I'm short so I knew it was going to be too long. I planned on wearing it with heels so I wasn't too worried. Even when I tried it on with 4 inch heels it was still dragging on the ground. Had to send it back.
3.0,"Cute dress but the letters don't stretch with the fabric. Instead, the letters look pulled. Returned this item."
3.0,It fit as expected at first but then after washing the legs shrink and now looks more like high watered pants (an inch or two above the ankle). Very disappointed as it was one of my most comfortable and cute scrubs.
3.0,"So, I like these leggings, but they really need to update their sizing. I’m 5’8” 160lbs I got a size large. I’m tall and slim with long legs. These pants are better suited for someone with a short torso, I’ve uploaded pictures of the waist area and where they sat on my figure. The waistband gave me a very unflattering pooch. I’ve also included a picture of me in my regular pants. If the cinching length of the waistband went further down I wouldn’t have had the issue. The compression is fairly tight and the waistband rolls when doing workouts which is a bit annoying. Also it’s a bit silly being so slim and having to order an XL. Please update your sizing.<br /><br /> Overall quality: well done<br /><br />Sizing: Runs small<br /><br />Length: ankle length<br /> (on a 5’8” woman with long legs)<br /><br />Waistband: Is short, better suited for a short torso. And no one with a slight pooch. :/"
3.0,Very thin material and the plastic is a bit thick for the print. Otherwise they look nice and are comfortable. Maybe better suited if you live in an area that doesn't get very cold in the winter.
3.0,My son wear a size 9 I got a 10 he can’t fit them what do I need to do? I will have to put cushions in the front in order for them to not flop off his foot.
3.0,"If you are expecting that emerald green color as shown in the photo, don’t. It’s not emerald green at all. The photo also makes it look like a silk material, it’s not. Shirt is just not at all like the photo."
3.0,it was ok but not the right color need to return please thank you......
3.0,"These shoes are very cute but unfortunately for me at least they hit in all the wrong places and are extremely stiff even for a new shoe.  Hope I can break them in some more or find pads for them.  I have a size 7 1/2,but I have to buy a size 8 due to my wide width. I did ballet for many years and have two bunions,  very large ones at that.  So if you are a member of the bunion club I would suggest not getting these putting pads on them they will be noticeable guess my sister gets these"
3.0,If you have a chest you will need to go a size up.
3.0,I gave it to someone else because it was too large.
3.0,I wanted to like this however it was not for me.
3.0,"Before ordering, we read the reviews. We ordered a size larger than normal and happy we did. An XL fit like a L. The fabric has a decent 'hand' but it does pick up an inordinate amount of lint and dust. The zipper sometimes opens from the bottom up expectedly. Bottom line, great jacket for the price. Comfortable and perfect for mild Texas winters."
3.0,"I didn’t care for them. Compared to the ones I got at Target, just not as nice. They work though. The adhesive is a little too strong for me. They were worth the money to me."
3.0,One set of the  charms were chipping which may have been it’s style but it didn’t look right at all. I feel like it should be removed from the pack...it’s the silver one which looks sandblasted but the charm has raised pieces of particles which doesn’t look like it should be on it.  one set was missing. I gave more stars because the company was quick to correct the issues.
3.0,"some of the pairs did not stretch enough to get my foot inside. Some of there pairs had excessive yarn/string material inside, cause it to get stuck between toes when inserting my foot."
3.0,"Very, very cheap looking, completely made of a plastic-like matetial, not mtetal and stones. Just metal for lnks holding necklace together and clasping on neck. Asca grown woman, would be embarrassed to wear."
3.0,"this cinched my waist as wanted, i would not wear this to workout in or for long periods of time. the bones are plastic and started to poke through after a few uses making it painful to use as it dug into my ribs. the hooks are metal and do not bend easily so that is a good thing but i wish the bones had a stronger casing to prevent the painful situation i ran into after a few uses"
3.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6 / ordered a large in light blue<br /><br />The front of this suit is so weird... the little keyhole wasn’t sewn well so the lining flips around and shows, the fit in the front is really bad, but the back is cute. Might look cuter on a different body type, but it def doesn’t work on me"
3.0,Very cheaply made. Get what you pay for.
3.0,"Used this for a photo shoot for my 4 month old daughter, I bought the 3 to 6 month since the next size up would have been 6 to 12 months. The onesie barely fit so I could size up.  Some of the sequins were falling off before even wearing and the headband left some weird irritated patches of skin that has not been the case with any other headband before she"
3.0,Way smaller then I thought they would be.were talking cm size..but shipping was fast! !
3.0,"This is a questionable product-for what I paid-I expected it was 14k gold coated, but I’m pretty sure it’s not. It seems it’s spray painted gold. We didn’t open It before gifting it to our child, so we can’t return it because she 7 and can’t understand the quality component. The chain seems nice enough. She’ll enjoy it-but I’m not convinced it will last terribly long."
3.0,&#34;Little Sister&#34; started fading only have a few washes.
3.0,Bottoms are a tad different in fit and style....not my fave....but doable. The top is cute and could always pair with white or different bottoms as I often do.
3.0,"I work outdoors all day and needed something to protect my skin better than sunscreen; which sweats off in about an hour.  These sleeves are like putting on a thin pair of socks.  The pros: They're lightweight, soft, they stay up (no slouching), and are long (about 2 or 3 inches short of the armpit).  The cons: The fabric snags on EVERYTHING; which quickly causes little holes and tears.  If you zoom in on the attached pics, you can see how the fabric has little holes (I mended a large one) and gets &#34;fuzzy&#34; - expect this to happen immediately during 1st use.  I still like using them for work (they don't have to look pretty)."
3.0,smaller than it sounds!!!
3.0,It was ok...It served it purpose.
3.0,"Great dress, just too big."
3.0,Is good for the price 😝
3.0,The black/white pair is fantastic. This is the pair I bought them for in the first place.<br />The black pair sags in my ear because they're unbalanced. Looks funny...
3.0,I have bigger hands so most fit but they didn't go down all the way. Overall they were good quality.
3.0,Way too small got my daughters size 4-5 and they didn’t fit I went up to the size 6-7 and they still fit small.
3.0,Length is long as pictured.  Fits great around chest and stomach but it's a little tight in the arms for plus size.  Super cute though
3.0,Fits good but had a problem with the band coming off the watch
3.0,"I had really high hopes for these sandals. My 4yr is super active and goes to a couple parks everyday. Within an hour of wearing these he had blisters. They look like really nice sandals, sterdy, and durable. But hard to get the adjustment right and like i said.....blisters"
3.0,They are cute. They are quite narrow and they fit more like a seven than an eight.
3.0,Very cute but very big on my 4 month old
3.0,Very cute just very transparent more like a swim cover up then a dress
3.0,It didn't fit so I had to send it back.
3.0,Nice swimsuit for the price. It fits as expected and it’s cute on. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest opinion.
3.0,"Not what I had expected. Looks cheap...but hey, it was cheap!"
3.0,It is a nice soft shirt but the arm area is super small. I have thin are but not twiggy.  I had ordered an XL 1st an it was huge all over so I got a medium the 2nd time an other than the arms not fitting right it's a good top
3.0,Was disappointed that I didn't see that the item ran small before ordering.  Just exercise caution and upsize accordingly.
3.0,"The colors and patterns are very pretty.  But, the fit, even with the adjustable straps is to restricting.  Every time you breathe the mask sticks to your mouth.  The sliding pieces on the straps comes off easily and then the mask is too big and slips below your nose."
3.0,"Had to take off two stars because these socks came nowhere near being over the knee, granted I'm a taller woman, but I seriously doubt these would even go over the knee of a shorter person.  These only came up to just UNDER my knee and that was pulled tight.<br /><br />I did keep them because they are decent socks, soft, super comfortable, I like the color combos, and BIG PLUS, they don't slide down and bunch up in the arch of my foot.... I HATE that.  I do like the colors and I was able to make them work with the shorter boots that I have.  So overall... A good purchase but the seller should rethink advertising these as ""over-the-knee"""
3.0,"These are very inconsistent in sizing. Some fit perfectly, some are way too small. I tried the S/M, and L/XL and had the same issue with both sizes where some socks would fit, but others were too small."
3.0,it is a good product.
3.0,"They are very simple boots and are very wide at the top so they don't stay on well, but they worked okay for my daughter's Peppa Pig costume."
3.0,The Night Optic Wraparound Glasses did not live up to my expectations.  They were purchased as an aid in night driving to help<br />reduce the star burst glare of headlights of oncoming cars.  They did not significantly reduce the glare.  The best time to wear<br />them is early dawn and later dusk......the yellow tint helps with the colors in the sky at that time.
3.0,Cheap made and runs small
3.0,Loved the style but runs small
3.0,Too small had to send back but I don't know if they are gonna send a bigger size even though I requested it. So here's hoping lol
3.0,"I am not totally satisfied with the sweater. I ordered the khaki color and it looks more like a golden mustard. I wasn't thrilled about the fit either, the picture makes it look flowy but the bottom of the sweater is actually tight so the wear is much shorter than anticipated."
3.0,"Cheap material and barely fit my wife after some modification, was not happy the way it fit"
3.0,The cup is flat. Even with a nice push up bra there is no shape to the cup
3.0,Thought too small
3.0,"I just cannot make this work in my hair, but it's cheap, so why not give it a try?"
3.0,Good looking belt but it's already wearing out...have to buy another belt again already
3.0,The tops tend to be too tight. I have other v-toe socks that are tight and I was hoping these would be looser. I'm not a big person and they do leave a major impression on my leg.
3.0,"super cute...super big! It wasn't fitted, I guess I need a bigger butt and waist to fit in it.  I ended up giving it away."
3.0,"You get what you pay for; I like this hat in that it's brown, which is cool, and it fits just like my other hats of this style, but when they say 100% polyester, they mean in the way that clothing from the 1970s often was, woven with a texture not unlike a burlap sack. Considering this was really inexpensive with free shipping, I should have figured there'd be a catch; oh well. It's good-looking, and somewhat comfortable, if not as nice a material as other ones I've got. I don't really recommend this hat for much of anything but some kinda Halloween costume which might require one. Sorry."
3.0,"I often don't review an item when I feel it's just OK and I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said. Then I received an e-mail including this phrase, &#34;If everything is satisfied, could you please kindly take a few minutes to offer us a feedback and review.<br />we just want you know your review and feedback will be very very important for us.&#34; The grammarian in me is cringing and other than that, I do have something to add.<br /><br />If you've ever owned any other yoga/exercise toe socks you might assume these are the same. I bought these for a great price on a lightning deal, so I'm not angry and returning them. However, I would not recommend wearing these to yoga class. It would be far too easy to slip inside the sock, resulting in an injury. There isn't enough stretch to the material and the extra fabric on the front of the ankle is awkward. With the exception of freezing temperatures, it's healthier to wear toe separating socks so my review is to go ahead and buy them for wearing socks at home during the winter, but avoid them if you plan on using them for exercise."
3.0,"I am not sure why these did not fit me considering I have the same pair in black that are the same size I ordered. Maybe it is the colored fabric. Might want to go one size more than normal. Other than that, they were nice."
3.0,"this suit is so flattering and the hot pink is so beautiful. However, I am larger in the chest and this suit has NO support at all. Like none. It pressed my chest downward and was rather uncomfortable (dare I say painful).  I highly recommend this swimsuit to anyone who does not need breast support (or doesn't care)."
3.0,Little bit big for my wrist.
3.0,It's pretty but if you have big boobs they're going to fall out all the time and the straps are going to come off all the time you're going to have to rehook it constantly it's quite annoying
3.0,"Miss at &#34;I love you bracelet&#34; is very big, and I've got big hands, I like it anyways."
3.0,A bit thinner than expected.
3.0,"The items arrived a month later than scheduled. Perhaps due to COVID, not sure. The variety pack is less enthusiastic and several head wear were Christmas related.  My favorite is the Cheetah. These seamless headwear have been through sweat, tears, colds, washes, hiking, bicycling, and the pool. Material is soft and comfy for a child and adult.  I use the scarves to take fancy pictures with my fashionista nails, to wear at night on the patio, hiking, and use as cooling cloth when I pour water on top or from the creek.  Easily multifunctional over the hair during sand activities, smell prevention while barbecueing, masking a bad hair day and protecting my neck in Las Vegas during hot weather, and obviously, use as a facial covering.  Oh yes, I have done it all.  These headwear bandanas dry quickly when wet and absorb sweat or perspiration. The colors are noticeable even through Zoom.  Another feature are people LOVE THEM as gifts. Yes, one simple scarf brightens their smile.  I would purchase again because the ones not desired can be gifted."
3.0,The bag is cute but the handles arrived bent.
3.0,"it's very floppy, it needed to be stiffer!"
3.0,"The style is sooo cute and I want to love it and keep it, but unfortunately the fabric is too clingy and unflattering for my mommy tummy."
3.0,Cute dress the stitching was lose so I was disappointed in that
3.0,Very cute. It’s a bit tight in the arm and chest area. I usually wear an XL but I got an XXL hoping to have a looser fit but it was snug.
3.0,"It works and is great for keeping the sun off you, but not very comfortable.  I did vandalize some property with this disguise!!!  Works great."
3.0,"I had to return them 3 times.<br />First time- too small (my fault)<br />Second time- They were defective. The right shoe was lopsided.<br />Final time- They fit BUT DIDN'T COME WITH ANYTHING IN THE BOX.<br />This first 2 times. There were little coach inserts &amp; the paper wrapped around the shoes said Coach. I made sure to return both boxes with all packaging included. Assuming I would receive everything in this last one but sadly nothing. If they send me all the little papers, despite having to return twice, I would give 5 stars."
3.0,"As far as design this daith hoop is absolutely adorable! I bought this particular one because I have a thicker amount of skin in that area so I need the extra room that I normally would not get from other piercings. As far as room it has it. So thicker skinned people this is for you.<br /><br />However out comes the problems that I had with it. Again, some of it is due to me having thicker skin. I just couldnt get it in the hole. My son came to help me and we finally got it in after I straightened out the swooped heart spot. Then once it was in we had to rebend it to make it look nice. After we rebent it we then had to close it. Closing it was hell!!!. Two days later I noticed my ear was hurting me and I noticed that there was a gap in the ring, that wasnt there before. The swooped heart piece was stuck INSIDE THE HOLE OF MY EAR!!!!!! We had no other choice but to take it out, straighten it, put it in, rebend it, and call it a day. It would not rebend right. It took some work but we have it looking like some what of a heartish type shape. We also have to check it every few days to make sure that it is still closed.<br /><br />I love the design but somehow it opens despite not being touched."
3.0,This is much more of a mustard yellow than a tan/camel color
3.0,"The bra was a great fit. But after a few hours, it began to lose support. Definitely better for a smaller chest"
3.0,"These are over priced Gildan hoodies. The only thing “Joes USA” about them is their logo screen printed behind the Gildan tag. Great sweatshirts, but save yourself half the cost and search for Gilman hoodies instead."
3.0,These are so cute but the rhinestones are already falling out after just a few days of wear.
3.0,I purchased these bc my partner is always losing her earrings. The description states they are screwback.  Although nice in quality they definitely are not screwback. They are the regular butterfly push back.
3.0,This is just a so so belt.
3.0,It is actually heavier than I thought it would be. It doesn't hang as nicely as the picture shows.
3.0,I thought I would take the time to give some good feed back on this product. Upon its arrival it is beautiful band the texture of the band is great. I loved that all you had to do was brush the band and it looked like brand new again. Its been six months or so and because I ware the watch everyday and some of the work I do requires me to sometimes get wet.  This band is designed for a dress watch you will get the best longevity from it. Last night the leather ripped where the clasp is located making my band  unusable. But this is do to how I wore my watch not the durability or quality of the band.
3.0,I bought this magnetic band because a friend had one and really enjoyed theirs. I got this installed after almost losing one of the pins used to hold this onto the watch. The band was good for about a week when it just started to randomly catch on stuff. It was a few days later that I noticed one of the ringlets was broken and pulled out so it would catch on stuff.<br /><br />I am also tired of having to re-adjust the band 6-7 times in a day because the magnet is too weak to keep it in place. I removed it from my watch but will keep it as a backup for the just in case.  So as the title says not bad just not good either. I don't regret buying it just might not buy it again.
3.0,"I gave the medium to my daughter and ordered a large for myself, it fits great"
3.0,The bottoms hold everything in and are wonderful. Fits as expected. The top is a tie top so it leaves the sides falling out. I would have preferred a more solid side/back to it so my side boob didn’t overflow.
3.0,Very cute but a bit too small....I think it runs small....
3.0,"It didn't fit well when I was bald but when hair started returning, the cap fit nicely."
3.0,the embossing is not the best
3.0,"I got a good deal on these (-50%, sorry not on Amazon), so I pulled the trigger as I was really intrigued.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />-They are very comfortable to wear. They are roomy at the waist but tapered below the knee. Combine that with the stretch material and you will find these pants are an easy ITB fit. I tried them with Leatt knee braces and with Forcefield armored underpants and they work for both. I look forward to using them in an upcoming Baja trip. I believe these will work at low speeds and resist the occasional branch but I plan to wear something with more abrasion resistance in the highway.<br />-They fit very close to your Levi's size. I'm 5'11, 170lb and usually wear Levi's 32/32 or 33/32. Got the Recon in 34 and as expected they are little loose. The 32 would have fit me but wanted to make sure that I have space for my armored underpants which have thick pads in the hips and coccyx.<br />-The pants feel light. They are perfect for warm weather although not to an extreme. You have to bear in mind that at 100s any pants will feel hot, but hey! compared to ADV style pants these are certainly lighter. Now, compared to the common ITB Off-Road pants these pants probably weight 50% more than some of those.<br />-2 zippered pockets. The zippers will probably offer some level of water & mud resistance although certainly the pants are not waterproof. There are also 2 jean style, non-zippered pockets<br /><br />THE SO SO...<br />-There is really no info on Armortrex and its claimed protection level. I tried contacting Shift to get more info but I didn't get an answer, so here's what I know: according to the label, Armortrex combines Nylon, Polyester and Spandex. The company claims that it provides some level of abrasion resistance but there is nothing to substantiate it. I have found that the manufacturer selling Armortrex offers different fabric combinations under the same brand name. In some, there is even Kevlar but nothing on the label indicates the Recon has K despite the fact that the yellow color of the liner resembles its looks.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />-The Armortrex liner doesn't cover the knees. At the front of the pant the liner stops at the top of the knee pocket. In the back of the leg the coverage is slightly longer which is strange as the protection is needed at the knee.<br />-No knee pockets.  What Shift calls knee  pockets actually are open at the bottom, so unless you  have  armor pads with Velcro on the back or you sew the pockets as other reviewer did ,  there is no  way to  fit pads.<br /><br />Finally, the color is different from what the pictures show. For comparison I put it next to some classic gray trousers as well as some with a light gray and the Recon seem to be some sort of green/gray. They look good though."
3.0,"Todo bien, gorro, faja y guantes muy pequeños"
3.0,"I ordered an 8 for my granddaughter who wears a size 8 in literally everything, and this was too small. With the swim bottom sewn inside, she literally was unable to pull it up to her navel. I wound up just cutting the panty out of it as I assumed a 10 couldn't possibly fit her and she only wanted it for a cover up anyway. However, although without the panty inside she can pull it up higher on her waist, it is very short. Not impressed, especially considering the price."
3.0,The face covering seem too thin… I was aware that it would be thin but not that thin.
3.0,It's not seamless around the legs and butt
3.0,"These are way larger than they appear. They were kinda cheap and tacky looking too, so I returned them for a refund but I was refunded promptly :-)"
3.0,Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas some of the metal is cheap and breaks easily but it was great for being 110 piece set.
3.0,"The metal retainers are oversized and way too large for the strap itself.  Material is good, but the size of the retainers ruins it."
3.0,Got it very fast!!! Too big for my toes though. It's for bigger toes.
3.0,I think this may have cut down on my snoring. Tried this after I realized a mouthpiece was not for me. BUT it also managed to rub my skin enough that I developed a blind &#34;pimple&#34;. At least for me it is not something that I can continue to use.
3.0,"It's really sexy but there are a few problems with it. There is not padding, therefore your nipples will show through. My middle lacing is very sexy but it isn't made right and it looks like the swimsuit has a hole at the bottom or like it ripped."
3.0,The purse is beautiful sadly it was missing the brown leather zipper pull that opens and closes the purse! It is shown in the photo when I made the purchase. I would like to keep this item and and request that the seller please send me the zipper pull so I am able to enjoy my new Spring purse! If I receive it I can upgrade my review to a more positive one! Thanks!
3.0,the earrings themselves are lovely but i got to different size gauges<br />14mm and it looks like a 15mm.... so I can only wear 1
3.0,They are cheap for a reason. They tear easily when putting them on. The ones that don’t tear protect fine though. That’s why I gave a 3 star rating. Out of 100 probably 1/3 are crap.
3.0,It is very pretty. The elastic in the sleeves is a bit tight and I feel it will fall apart with washing as there is already some fuzzy seaming. The size is pretty true to the description.
3.0,"They're nice/fine but not high waisted. They are def mid rise, which is fine, but if you try to make them high waisted they'll give u a wedgie *** even if you size up***. They would be 5/5 if actually high waisted but they're not so be aware. Size up and you'll have a nice pair of midrise joggers for a good price."
3.0,The clasp is difficult to open. Had to maneuver it off the wrist to prevent from breaking it.
3.0,"True to size, looks so clean on! Insanely unasex not to girly and could be worn on a wedding day. MY MAIN THOUGHT FOR OTHERS would be if you have a GIFT IDEA for someone who has a mental/learning/ drug issue or to many kids/CANCER or DIABETES I wouldn't quite recommend only because the back is so thin that to get it to fully screw on it can take a few minutes which seems a bit frustrating. Unless they have someone to help them with it. (Could feel like a wear the one day kinda thing.)"
3.0,"I am 5’8” 170 lbs (3 weeks postpartum) and I bought a medium. The pros are that I love the design and material of this dress, it’s airy and comfortable without being clingy to unwanted bulges like knit is. The skirt on this dress allows so much movement, you could do the splits in this dress if you wanted, not constricting whatsoever. Cons are that it is cheap, I had to cut off the front tie ropes after the first wash and I wish it was just an inch or two longer so it would cover my ankles. I also wish the waist smocking would go further down. I have a long torso so it almost could pass as a maternity dress on me if I were still pregnant. I decided to keep it because I do like the dress overall, like not love."
3.0,"Definitely for athletic cut people.  If you aren’t trim, order a size up."
3.0,"PJs are good quality, but the fabric is a damask (1” stripes) sateen not shiny satin. Also the hue of purple is a bit darker, more subdued. Given as a gift so unsure of sizing. Quality fabric so not sheer."
3.0,"Received my item with missing rhinestones, very upsetting!"
3.0,My son loves this hat for the long cold bus ride into school. He said the battery dies super fast so he has to charge it every night for his 30 minute ride
3.0,"Pretty bag, but not a tote bag,won'teven hold a decent lunch, it barely measures 10x10, the description said 12x15. Should have read the other review. Not sure if even worth sending it back"
3.0,"Made for a man, but chain is made for a woman -it is to short and delicate for for a man. Had to purchase a thicker and longer chain. There is room on the back for personal engraving, like a name and date, which is nice."
3.0,"Belt was long enough, looked nice, functioned well with some durability bu it was not genuine cow hide but a manufactured Lester like product not what I had expected."
3.0,"I love how these water shoes look they are adorable, but you can not wash them in the washing machine they tear fast, because they are so thin you have to wash them by hand, so that you do not brake them."
3.0,"It was beautiful and looked great on, but the weight of the stones made it sag and it would not stay up on her face.  Constantly pulling it back up and holding it over her nose."
3.0,"Text is really hard to read. Made well, good quality just hard to read"
3.0,Cute but the ball cracked the 2nd day worn.
3.0,"Cute shoe...way too big. My daughter is almost 12 months, and wears 18-24 mo clothes...they slip right off. Was hoping for a better fitting shoe beings she's started walking a month or so ago."
3.0,"I bought 2 of these dresses for my almost-4 year old daughter. The quality was spot on, and the colors were vibrant. The sizing was pretty true to size, also. The twirl factor is amazing! However, the green dress that I received had stains on the front. I contacted the seller directly, as I know it's encouraged to not post bad reviews when you receive a defective product, but it took them over a week to get back to me, and when they did, they  just said, &#34;Hello Angela, I am so sorry that you received a defective product it usually doesn’t happen. City Threads is a big brand and all the products are checked before they are sent to Amazon. It may have got damaged in transit.&#34; Really? A stain on your dress was a &#34;damage in transit&#34;? To me, that felt like they didn't really read my email at all. I had sent them pictures and a detailed description. If their products were all &#34;checked before sent to Amazon,&#34; I can't see how this one would have made it through, as the stains are really obvious. Anyway, yes, the dresses are amazing (if unstained), but my customer service experience with City Threads was not so amazing. Sure, I can return the item and life will go on. But it did not instill confidence in me to make future purchases."
3.0,I usually love Anne Klein products but this watch is extremely heavy. It's a pretty design but realistically it's way to heavy to wear on the wrist.
3.0,Stitching is coming apart
3.0,"Earrings are nice enough, but the screwbacks are so small they pinch my ears. If I screw them tightly enough that the earrings don't hang down, they just are uncomfortable.<br />I wanted screwbacks so I wouldn't lose them, but regular backs might be more comfortable. Nice studs though."
3.0,"They worked well while they worked. But as many people have written, the metal hooks snap quite easily. I would appreciate it if they could be replaced."
3.0,The item was not fully as the picture. There were no false pockets and the blue was not a light blue like the picture. But still decent.
3.0,Had to return because the clasps were loose but really liked the small size “huggies” and the turquoise with silver was pretty. Will try another pair to see if clasp is better.
3.0,"You get exactly what you pay for - It fits a bit small tho. It's made to wear around your waist, not your hips."
3.0,"I think the product overall is great, unfortunately I cannot button the collar, it’s a bit tight."
3.0,The picture's skin tone looks darker than the actual product still kinda stood out because of how light they were
3.0,This is a nice undergarment to smooth out lines.  The only issue is that the material is very light and fragile.  The back strap ripped in the washing machine.  I would only wash by hand in cold water.
3.0,There comfortable by themselves but when you add the mask which they do work fine the only problem is the buttons are not stitched on firmly enough and once you hook the mask on the buttons they kind of fold under and make it not so secure but it does make eating a mask more comfortable
3.0,"I really like these shoes, they just run small. I can't wear them after a few hours."
3.0,Very good quality but not very easy to put on
3.0,"I purchased several satin scarves for wrapping Christmas gifts in.  This is by far the most “Christmas” due to the colors, but it’s also the thinnest.  I didn’t realize the print is white Lips with green and red stripes and white teeth, but that’s my fault for not zooming in and looking more closely.  I would like to point out that the photo which shows 70CM (27.6”) is the correct size.  The description which shows 35” is incorrect.  I was expecting the 35”, so these are a bit small."
3.0,"These are really cute but definitely not high quality. I'm giving them a three because I expected them to be cheaply made. It's a decent value if you just want some cute toe rings to wear for photos or for a few hours. Some of them have worked out okay but one broke as soon as I put it on. I had to use clear polish to keep them from irritating my skin. I plan to buy sterling silver and real gold soon, but in the meantime, these are a cute temporary option."
3.0,"Got these for my daughter. I ordered same size as other shoes that fit her, but they were too small. They seemed like good quality and really cute."
3.0,i LOVE this watch band. i’ve had it for almost 2 months and it hasn’t worn BUT it is starting to make my wrist turn green where it attaches to the watch. I might reorder it and use clear nail polish.
3.0,Not much to say.It's OK. Will probably wear.
3.0,I bought this for my son and it’s very stretchy and see through. Very thin.
3.0,Look like a nice pair of shorts but the order page says 7 inch inseam and it wasn't even close.  Returned them with no trouble.
3.0,"I have big hands, but the cut design for the thumb and the pinky fingers are cut and sewn to narrow, they only allow my the 3 fingers in between fit great.... just poor design on the pair I received, both gloves thumb and pinky cuts don't match the 3 inside for my hands."
3.0,Sadly the small was way too big and there wasn’t a smaller size. Typically a size 2/4 in dressed
3.0,"I love the product... but the only downfall is that this band didn't come with the pins. I received another band from Vancle, so I had to take the pins from that to accommodate this band... you should probably list that you don't have the pins."
3.0,"Although the quality of this jacket was nice, it wasn’t what I was hoping for. If you are hoping that this will fit the way Luke’s jacket did in The Empire Strikes Back, think again. This is not that Jacket! This is more of a regular jacket, inspired by Luke’s jacket. It is about an inch or two to long and the lines are different because of the pockets. So, if you want this for cosplay I’d look elsewhere. Having said that, I included some photos, and you can see it’s not a bad jacket. I’m 155 lbs and 5’8” and this is the small."
3.0,This shirt runs very small. I’m normally a small and ordered a medium and it fit like a small. Definitely could not wear once I start showing. Material is also pretty cheap and not elastic at all.
3.0,My daughter wears a size 4 and I had to buy and 8. The top was sagging and the jewels were falling off. I ordered three and they were all the same. It's a cute dress but cheaply made. and sized strange.
3.0,"Lovely design and waistline forgiving. However, unless you want to show your curves and knees I suggest you might want to pass on this dress. I am 5ft. 2 in. and 118 lb. and ordered a large.  The material is somewhat lightweight but fine for Summer."
3.0,"They are very cute. My size is 8.5 US, so I ordered size 39. The package had the label, 39, but the shoe size was 38. They were super small. I feel like even I got the size 39 ones, they would be tiny."
3.0,"Cute, but extremely heavy on your face. They weight on the bridge if my nose gives me a headache."
3.0,The material does not feel at all like that of an original Fitbit and kind of irritates the skin. They do send a cool tool to help though so it makes it worth 3 stars
3.0,"A bit large, it fits me just okay. Soft fabric."
3.0,Looks good but upon opening I realized the large is a short large. Didn't even try on before I saw it is way too short.  At 6' I get large or rarely xl.  But this is short in length for a large.  Return it goes!
3.0,I ordered the smallest which was a xsmall and it did fit me a size bigger then I thought. The quality and color is very nice and soft material.
3.0,Quality is great but runs wayyy small. I ordered a small & fits like a child’s size 14/16.
3.0,"Pants feel like quality material and like they would shed water easily. Unfortunately my normal size 32/32 did not fit me in the waist at all. They were very tight and there was no way I could make them work for me. As far as the leg room, they are slightly tight like I athletic/straight fit pant so keep that in mind as well.<br /><br />Overall I’d advise to get a size or so larger than you’d normally get (not sure if you can shrink these in the wash or not) because in my case they fit too small."
3.0,Bought these to make a hijab and cover my face mask. The patterns are pretty but the material is really thin. This is DEFINITELY a spring/summer wrap and not good for cold weather
3.0,Stones look cheaply positioned in stud
3.0,I really did not like these glasses. They were very big on me and very heavy. They looked cheap. I returned them.
3.0,I was excited cause then they arrived they felt nice and thick and tight! Then after washing them once they are super thin don’t have much compression...a good nice true black summer legging...
3.0,Very small for an adult wrist. They are pretty and can be worn by an adult but the elastic has to stretch quite a ways so it makes me wary.
3.0,Not realistic looking at all. It will do the job for a Halloween costume.
3.0,I didn't like material of pants they were different than top
3.0,it is made of good quality it just was too small. I am 5'1&#34; and weight 140 lbs and it felt very tight
3.0,The material seems a little cheap.  I'm hoping this wallet can take the wear and tear of my usage.
3.0,"After 1 hour of wearing, my feet were very sore. Not very comfortable."
3.0,It was a very cute dress and I got many compliments on it but it literally fell apart after the first wash. I washed it on delicate with cold water and it was in pieces!
3.0,The cords of the bracelets are a lot thinner than what I expected.
3.0,Lay of sleeves seems too puckered
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5876ccf10857216b0144d59f43b21304]] Hoping I can get another one expedited soon, needed this for a wedding,  the suit was too small. The material is great,  please remember to go up 2 sizes"
3.0,The cups were huge compared to rest of suit.
3.0,"I have big breast, so it really didn't work for me up top"
3.0,"Loved it but the large was too small, I’m 5’3 175"
3.0,"After only one or two wears, I noticed snags and other strange things in the material. Low quality material, but I use it as a swim skirt so I am not so concerned.<br />If you are considering swimming in this skirt, I am not sure I recommend it. Try something from wukogals or something more athletic material."
3.0,This item runs way too small. Received for a discounted price for a honest review.
3.0,Nice dress but the material is too thin for my liking. Note* I have received a discount for review.
3.0,Not the best quality.  But it looks okay on.
3.0,I loved this band. Then my skin started to react to the metal. I would 100% recommend if you aren’t sensitive to metals like I am. Unfortunately it made me break out. I ended up cutting off the metal piece and just wear it frayed at the end but at least I don’t break out now!
3.0,I love the pockets and length. The color is a bit off but still a great dress. Order a size down as sizes run larger.
3.0,"the fit and weight of this watch are nice, but i wish i would have gotten one without these metal finishes. the watch itself is inexpensive, but the metal really makes the one thing look cheap."
3.0,This was a really great Buy based on the amount of pieces that came with it for the price. But it is very gold looking. Overall if you are into flashy pieces this is for you.
3.0,This top is SUPER cute but SUPER tight on the arms!! I couldn't even raise my arms up in this top and I do not have big arms! Had to return
3.0,"It's very good looking and finish in modern design. every Ducati owner should buy it, but it's just too heavy for a bike key chain. I used it for my car keys now"
3.0,"After wearing this set daily since I cannot wear my original set do to massive weight loss, I have fount the finger is green under the band and peeling. I have not worn the ring in several days and the green is fading but not gone"
3.0,"Cheaply made but it’s a top, liked it but after some time the fabric got dingy. I don’t like shirts or products that get or look dingy after a little time"
3.0,to little
3.0,"The chains are slightly different lengths on either side so its a bit asymmetrical and they do not hang quite so perfectly on an actual person. Other than that, I love it. Very cute, and very nice accessory for a couple of my costumes."
3.0,"A little to thin when it is worn and stretched out. I enjoy the grips, however, it does stop it 100% from slipping."
3.0,I gave it away. Compression was nothing
3.0,Need to send back product is way too small order much larger in order for it to fit.
3.0,"This would be 5 stars except for the fact that the bows and elastics in the pictures listed are matching colors, as I wanted...unfortunately only some of what I received were like matching. (See pic) Also, the bows are a little uneven (longer on one side than the other).<br /><br />Otherwise good quality and the glue has held up! Too bad the picture doesn't fully match the product :("
3.0,This is pretty short so don’t bend over — ever! Also the under dress is very thin.
3.0,Cheaply made. Not entirely horrible though. They still look cute on.
3.0,"This hat comes in two sizes.  The smaller size was too small and the larger size was too large. I have a 7-1/4 head  and opted to keep the s/m (snug would stay on my head, but too big would be coming off if i bent over to  tie my shoes).<br /><br />I purchased this hat because it was listed as packable.  I tend to pack densely (a 21&#34; carry-on for two weeks including a lot for contingencies, like a  french press, coffee and heating device--you can never be too  prepared).  I did keep the hat rolled loosely the way you would transport a real panama hat.  Roll it up making sure to have no sharp folds.  It mostly survived the trip.<br /><br />My major complaint with the had is that the polypropylene material really resists any attempts at blocking.  When its shape gets off for whatever reason it is almost impossible to get it in a more desirable shape.  You might leave with a fedora shape, a Sydney Greenstreet (Maltese Falcon), an Aussie Bush hat,  or the loveliest gardening bonnet. This shape can and will change, somewhat uncontrollably. It is semi-packable at best.  Photo is not quite accurate.<br /><br />It is a mixed value:  Kinda pricey for polypro  with only two size options.  It is way less expensive than a true packable Panama made with fine toquilla. I have seen what appears to be the same hat online with more size options.  Amaze-on prime makes this worth the risk."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and assuming these are Asian sizes they sent me an XL. Was not expecting it to be so late he, it had shoulder pads and the strap was oddly a lot longer than it should have been and does not stay on with the clasp, you have to tie it and it hangs really low. It wasn’t fitted and did not look good on me."
3.0,"It's okay, just not as depicted in the add.  Not made for winters in upstate NY"
3.0,"When my 4 year old saw this Saddle Club set she had to have it.  She loves watching the The Saddle Club every afternoon.  It came in the mail very quickly, and she is happy to have it.  However, Lisa does not fit in the saddle and therefore cannot ride Prancer.  She can't even sit in the saddle.  Lisa is to big (too long) for the saddle.  She is now riding another horse my daughter has instead.  If you want to purchase this for the novelty go for it, but don't buy it to actually use as a set."
3.0,"It's very blurry to see through. There was no thin ""film"" to speak of that needed to be removed from the eyes as others commented. Straps were pretty tight so had to change those myself. The mask itself feels like a good quality though. Though actual snot seems more smushed than the actual OW character. Still though I do like it so I won't be returning it."
3.0,"From the pictures, I expected the case to be a bit narrower, but it works."
3.0,"I ordered two of these; unfortunately, one of them does not close cleanly and this results in irritation of my ear. The other one works closes much better, and I do like the design and look."
3.0,"The gloves came in a nice box & well packaged. The gloves themselves are very nice, soft & warm!<br /><br />However, the gloves size run a 1/2 to 1 size smaller, than normal. I say this because, I measured the way I was told & then measured an 1size bigger for comfort. When I got the gloves, I was barely able to get my hands in the gloves. I was finely able to get my hand in the gloves, the gloves are a tight fit & I am hoping that the gloves will stretch!"
3.0,very cute but it doesn't last very long it breaks easy
3.0,"I wish I had listened to the other reviews. The band size actually seems fine, but I should have gone up a cup size. No one wants any overages, if you know what I mean. Support is really great compared to the cheaper sports bras. I usually wear 3 when I work out, and this one is good on its own! It has some weird seaming in the front, so it looks odd over a t-shirt, but it's ok over my athletic tanks that have a built in shelf-style bra. I don't think I'd recommend this to a friend, but it's a great value for how cheap it was. I like that this bra comes in fun colors too! I hate that most bras for us blessed gals are always in boring colors!"
3.0,"Could be cute but I bought it for a coverup and it arrived seriously wrinkled, so I don’t think it would do well in a beach bag. Ordered a medium which is my usual size but it was a little big. Material does not seem like it would be very forgiving if it fit closely though."
3.0,Not Hav A Hank branded. They shrink unevenly when washed and take many washings so loose there stifnes.
3.0,"They seem to work ok.  I was very disappointed, as they were much smaller than they appeared & I bought 3 pairs, in different colors."
3.0,"Fits to size, except the boob part is kinda weird and doesn't stay closed so you have to pin it."
3.0,not really helping much about the glare and clarity.
3.0,Was completely see through. Not nearly as nice as the picture.
3.0,The string parts that are used to tighten and hold the ropes fell off within two days of use. Not good quality. Other than that they seem okay. Had to buy new laces.
3.0,Not as it looked in picture.
3.0,Negative: Left side zipper broke right before the first trip.<br />Positive: Great design. I took it on a 1 month trip and I could fit everything I needed in it. There are multiple compartments and pockets to hold stuff in place.
3.0,These are cute but small. I thought the spoon part was going to be bigger than what it is. All you can really use it for is to stir. It would take me forever to put my creamer & sugar in a cup. Won’t buy again.
3.0,The 3 knot cross midway on bracelet unraveled...a drop of super glue secured it...the prayer rope has otherwise been trouble free.
3.0,"Super cute and well weighted but wish they had been a tish less heavy, but nice earrings"
3.0,It's okay for a fun night out or for just a night party. They seems not of very good quality. I rather find them more like novelty clothing...however they do not look cheap when u wore them... but it's always good to have such clothes as well in ur closet.
3.0,"My boyfriend wanted these to help protect his wrists at work but it looks like we need to return them. They are flimsy, the straps are only connected by one rivet on one end so when you put it on your wrist the large leather piece slides out and doesnt look good or function. If i can find a better one I will return, if not then we will try and find some leather working tools to add a rivet at tge other end of the straps so thet dont move around"
3.0,There was a long and thick scuff on the medial part of the right  shoe. 😥 . My brother like it but will be exchanging this unft.
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of this scarf, though the colors are beautiful.  The edging and the stitching look a little cheap. The photo doesn't show how pretty it really is.  I bought it as a gift and didn't have time to exchange it. Hopefully my friend will not be as picky as I am!"
3.0,Frustrated because they are too big for a woman's face.
3.0,They have a nice feel to them but the size is really off. I bought am xl and it looks like a medium. The fabric is slightly slick if that makes since.
3.0,The color is more of an orange than a yellow.
3.0,These are giant earrings!  I was expecting half this size.
3.0,"Beautiful, but very small."
3.0,"Doesn't have exactly the same shape than the original obviosuly, but it works."
3.0,They are a little thin.... I have to wear really thin/lace undies lololol... but they fit well
3.0,"Disappointed it was so Fragile, it broke"
3.0,These run small. Order 1 size up.
3.0,"Was ok, difficult to figure out at first but it works"
3.0,"Nice color, decent quality but too short, returned item."
3.0,Good cleats But very narrow and hurt my feet
3.0,Build quality good but it took a long time for delivery.
3.0,"The sweater is quite nice, but I was a bit disappointed in that the color is not as bright as it shows on the webpage.  I expected a bright blue and the sweater is more like a grey."
3.0,"I thought the first on I ordered was defective, since it wouldn’t screw into the faucet on the side of the house, but the replacement is the same.<br />It’s probably a fine product, BUT DOES NOT ATTACH TO A STANDARD HOSE CONNECTION."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this dress. The fit & cut is great for my frame, but the pattern is much more bright and garish (cheap-looking) than the picture shows. Even the colors look different. It’ll do, but it’s not at all what I was hoping for."
3.0,Not happy with material. Rough not flown
3.0,"The top opening where you insert your foot is very tight, your foot does not slip right in, but once your foot is in, the size of the boots are close to the advertised size. The leather is heavy duty and very rigid. The overall appearance is good. I am hoping the top opening stretches/loosens overtime."
3.0,"I love the message of this beanie.  Unfortunately this beanie is fairly long & to get it to fit properly you have to fold it where either the dumbbell disappears & the term ""beast"" isn't readable.  I wish it was a little smaller like a typical beanie so I can have both the dumbbell & ""beast"" exposed.  It is still a great beanie, it won't keep you the warmest because it is thin material.  However it looks nice & fashionable.  I would probably buy it again even with the flaws of the printed items NOT showing up after you tuck it."
3.0,Size correction definitely needed!!!
3.0,I thought they were going to be bigger than the picture! There ok!
3.0,not the finest of sweat shop labor.
3.0,"This is a beautiful article of jewelry, easy to adjust. But my only complaint is that I've had this ring for about 3 days and it tarnishes very quickly. And turns my finger black. It's easy to clean. But what can I expect from the price , you get what you pay for."
3.0,This is a very form-fitting dress. It is very stretchy and that is the reason I give it 3 stars. I normally wear a medium and this was too tight.
3.0,Sleeves are an odd length and had to be shortened. Color is more turquoise than green.
3.0,Color is great but not really what I wanted.
3.0,Top was too big and bottoms were too small
3.0,"Bracket fit well and the very sweet 8 year old loved it! Wished it had looked more high quality, looked more like dollar store play jewelry."
3.0,"I love the look of this watch and its simplistic design. It is comfortable to wear and keeps good time. It is exactly what I wanted. The only thing I dislike is that the crystal that covers the watchface is dome-shaped (not flat) and highly reflective. When I look down to see the time, what I often see is the overhead light in the room, reflected as glare in the watchface. I have to turn my arm until I can get it at an angle that the glare reflects at a different angle and I can see what time it is. That said, I still very much like this watch and I am keeping it. I just wish the crystal was made of a less reflective material."
3.0,"I just received these in the mail and I'm kind of undecided on whether or not to keep them. They are a high quality beautiful boot, but the calf is very wide and they should be labeled as wide calf boots. They are loose in the calf area on me and I'm not sure if I like the look. I'm definitely bummed about this order."
3.0,"I've been in a ""skirt mood"" lately so I've been purchasing skirts left and right! I ordered this plaid skirt not too long ago and for the price, I think it's a good buy. It's quite cheaply made, and the elastic in the waistband gets twisted really easily. I think I'm going to sew a few knots around the waistband so the elastic doesn't move in the wash.<br />I ordered a 'medium' because I have a small waist but fuller hips. I could've easily ordered a 'small' and been fine."
3.0,"Great shoe... but Saucony are just really inconsistent with their sizing...10.5 in one shoe is to small, 10.5 in another is just to large... 10.5 EE are Extremely Wide, 10.5 E are no different than 10.5...<br /><br />All similar style Trail Running shoes from TR12/11 and these.<br /><br />At least these are better with cupping your heel and don't feel like you'd break an ankle with sudden change of direction."
3.0,Artículo de buena calidad pero no era el color esperado. En la imagen se ve de una forma y al tenerlo de otra
3.0,I love that this bra fit me and it’s very pretty. The lace isn’t scratchy at all either. The problem is the stretch. Comfy? - yes. But within a few hours the girls were hanging pretty low. It’s ok for a stay at home bra.
3.0,received the wrong damn color!
3.0,I really like how my name looks with the pink and heart. But if you have sensitive skin the chain will make you breakout. I have tried wearing it for a few hours to see if that would help but nope i still get a rash. I'm just gonna buy a different chain to see if that works.
3.0,"Not so beautiful, but it is ok...somewhat large"
3.0,"is pretty, but too thin"
3.0,This is a cute sweater that’s made of stretch material. I typically wear a medium but it runs big. I’d recommend ordering a size smaller. It also wasn’t exactly as pictured.
3.0,"Cute bunny/moon/fan earrings<br />The hanging plain chain is a little off putting, like an unfinished finishing touch."
3.0,Not bad but the mm aren't long enough to get good coverage so you have to be very specific on where you place it before you run out of wrap. Otherwise your bottom is exposed and only your ribs are covered. Or not high enough up the back.
3.0,"I am 5'8&#34; 145lbs...... cute dress, got tons of compliments, however be aware it is very very see through and because it is a wrap dress when the wind blows a little or you are crossing uncrossing your legs you may &#34;expose&#34; yourself, and due to how see through it is i couldn't get away with wearing shorts underneath because they showed to much.  nothing a safety pin couldn't fix though.  also very revealing in the chest area."
3.0,"The quality seems decent but it’s a light sweatshirt material, definitely meant for layers. I’m only giving 3 stars because the dots are embroidered and not the puff balls like advertised. I bought a skirt with puff balls to match, now it kinda looks weird, but it’ll work. Too close to Christmas for an exchange."
3.0,"I was so sad that these ran SO small, I gave to a friend who wears 3 sizes smaller"
3.0,One post was bend when it arrived but for the money nice.
3.0,"The fit was a little disappointing.  Way too big at the neckline.  Cute otherwise.  (Of course, the bow came apart in the washer but not a big deal.)  The instructions said to dry clean.  hahaha  Are they serious??  It did fine in the washer (except the bow)."
3.0,"With white outfits, sheerness is always an issue.  This one is not too bad on the sheerness but it is sized a little on the big side.  I am 5"", 105lbs and the small just was too big and baggy.  I would suggest sizing down."
3.0,"Its ok not crazy about how it looks, feels on my skin, not really flattering."
3.0,its ok used it only a couple of times material is simple not too great
3.0,I am a 34 waist. These shorts seem tight at the waist  Quality of material and the look is excellent.  I have kept the shorts.
3.0,Wish it was a little tighter... But for a one size product fits good.  Good quality material. Very comfortable.
3.0,"I like this dress, it fits nice but not crazy about the material"
3.0,"The size is very small. I went by the sellers size chart, which said ages 9-12. I received a small medium. I love the pattern and the quality."
3.0,Your head is fine everything’s OK
3.0,"Good looking watch, but feels unfinished. Had to return it."
3.0,"Cute water shoes, but flimsy. They'll only last a summer."
3.0,"Cute and fits well. Got a pair from Walmart for half the price though. So, shop around first."
3.0,This faded very quickly and the satin isn’t sewn on well at all.
3.0,Very limited directions in English. Did not remove smell from wristband
3.0,"The shoes are a bit tight as I am a true 8 with a narrow foot, and they are a bit snug. They look very nice tho. The first paid I ordered arrived used so I had to send them back for a second, actual new pair (hence the 3 stars)."
3.0,The rings are pretty but 2 of the 6 I got don't spin like they're supposed to. Like I can move them a little but they're jammed in both directions. The other 4 spin properly but I wish all 6 did.
3.0,I got these thinking they would also work for reading glasses but to short and rigid glasses would not hang down
3.0,These look pretty in the pictures but look much flatter wearing them
3.0,Fun pattern but it fits larger than expected. I wore it as a tunic instead of a dress because I’m tall. I belted it to make it not look so large.
3.0,"I love the size and look of the necklace. Unfortunately, it broke within 5 days of having it-when it wasn't being touched. I wish I could've worn it for at least a week..."
3.0,"Too cheap, kept falling apart before I could use it."
3.0,Cute but not waterproof.
3.0,I loved this skirt. It was light and comfortable for the heat of the south. The material shrunk in the wash the first time I washed it.
3.0,"Ok, arm lenght is very short"
3.0,I ordered my size and it was too small that is the only trouble with ordering online.
3.0,I ordeed a medium. washed in cold to remove wrinkles. Fit was a little loose.
3.0,I gave it three stars because it is a beautiful set. I can’t tell you much about washing it because it’s too small. I have a petite 17 month old niece. She can wear 12 or 18 months depending on the maker. I bought a size 24 month in this outfit expecting her to be able to wear it in the summer. She can’t even wear it now.  It is far too small. It would probably fit a normal size 9 month old or a petite 12 month old. My niece is 19lbs and about 30 inches. There is no way that the lbs in the description is correct
3.0,Doesn’t fit like the blue one did. At least it is lined.
3.0,"The stitching on the inside is so bulky it's very hard to bend fingers. Alltough the size s fits the palm, the fingers are too short. My fingers are regular length. Returning."
3.0,tarnished relatively quickly but beautiful while it lasts!
3.0,Not sure if shirt was meant to fit smaller than the size but it did not properly fit.
3.0,The stitching was off and not straight at all. You get what you pay for I guess.
3.0,Has a weird fit. The arms are very short but overall the cardigan is quite big.
3.0,Adorable shoes but run small
3.0,"The colors aren’t anything like in the picture. The style is... colors are just a lot lighter. It’s fine, I love it... fits perfect.... just colors are off. Not a big deal for me but that’s the only reason I’m giving it 3 out of 5. More like baby blue & baby pink."
3.0,"Larger than I expected but happy with the material. Neck and waist straps are useless, expect to change them out."
3.0,Good quality but it was too small
3.0,Purchased these for Crossfit.  I would have given it more stars if the back of them didn't creep down while doing sit ups lol.  Other then that they are comfortable and good for the rest of the workout.
3.0,Bought this online for my 50th Bday party. Got the XXL and it was still snug. Would have like if the print on the front had been either more textured or thread embossed.
3.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she initially liked the design the problem is that she is quite hippy but has a small waist and with the current design and the way the material is attached to the shorts it really pulls back across the shoulders when she bends forward more than about thirty degrees. The material is a light summer blend that she really likes but because of how it pulls back on the shoulders she's not completely happy with the fit .<br />The waist has plenty of extra material its just there isn't enough give in the design when flexing forward.
3.0,"It would have been great if it worked. The quality goes with the price butit is a beautiful bathing suit. For me the top a bit small even though I purchased an XL, boobs barely fit and the bottom piece sits kid of weird."
3.0,It's a gift for my wife and she loves it.
3.0,I bought it to my daughter because my husband gave me one and i am so happy with mine.  But this one arrived with some malfunction in the clasp.  It does not close and open properly.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Main: This inexpensive watch looks and feels like a high-quality expensive watch. It's not for accurate time keeping but for the show.<br />-It is a tourbillon watch with time, day, and date with a tachometer. +3<br />-The gold plated stainless steel looks like the real gold. +1<br />-The dial window is a thick mineral crystal glass. Beware of scratches.<br />-Well-polished frame. +1<br />-Highly customizable if you can work on watches; you may replace the glass with a quartz glass or $3-$10 mineral crystal. You may also make the dials fancy by making it luminous or replace its movement to the Swiss made ETA (size matches) and change it completely.<br />-Well carved dials and numbers.<br />-Automatic Chinese movement with 17 jewels (assume).<br />-1.5 years warranty for maintenance.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Main: I would say time fluctuates +- (3 to 10 ) min per day. This mainly happens during the midnight when the watch changes the date and day. I think it's a defect in all tourbillion models of low priced watches. Daily time fixing is needed. Once you set the time in the morning, you are good for the day. -1<br />-It is a little bit bulky and revealing.<br />-The material used in the glass might get scratched easily. -1/2<br />-Date and Day adjuster are a bit tricky at first.<br />-Sometimes it is annoying when you can’t see the date dial and number when it is at 1'o clock. -1/2<br />-I wish the 24 hr. the clock could be used as a second time-zone.<br />-Band quality is alright (might need replacement in 3 months if you wear it every day).<br />-Not luminous even though you may think it might be luminous due to its dial color.<br /><br />Personal Opinion:<br />This watch is a keeper. It gives you an expensive look without costing you $$$. Automatic mechanical watches are generally assembled by hand and even the lower tier, it could take weeks to complete. That itself justifies its cost.<br /><br />Please don't listen to people who say Chinese watches are the waste of money. It’s a cheap watch made for the daily use. Spending $35 dollars to have a nice looking watch every year costs less than to service your $500+ Swiss every 2 years costing from $100-$700.<br /><br />I also own a Seiko 5, and a Tissot brand mechanical watches. Now I can switch between my Seiko 5 and this one for my daily use while taking out my Tissot for some special occasion. I went to an auction yesterday, I got more compliments wearing this watch than I use to get wearing a Tissot. I told one of my friends it cost me $1000 and he believed it o.o.  Surprisingly, He had a hard time believing it was just $35 when I told him the actual price.<br /><br />People will ask you about its price. Best reply to the strangers would be, &#34;Men do not talk about their watch prices&#34; ;)<br /><br />Hope it helps."
3.0,"3 star product. Supportive compression, surpassed previous brands. Haven't seemed to weaken over time and are still appropriately tight.<br />I got the black pairs and they have unfortunately faded to a grayish black. If you're wearing them with black uniform pants, there is a distinct difference in black and this faded color.<br />Also (see picture), the compression fabric holds them folded in the washer/dryer. They have developed an even more faded fold line down the middle of each sock.<br />So if you want good compression and don't care if they fade or have a weird line, these do the job."
3.0,Super cute but kind of stiff. The arms were tight. I’m 5’8 and 165. Flattering and can be dressed up. Cute with leggings and boots or with flats.
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, but very small. Will have to return or give it to someone. 😕"
3.0,Great quality for the items but the baby dress and the mother dress wrinkle so easily!
3.0,This was not like the picture. I was disappointed.
3.0,It's super cute... But way way to big!!! I ordered 0-6 months and I'm pretty sure it is made for 2 yr Old!
3.0,Balls break a lot but you do get a good variety to choose from
3.0,when they say skinny they mean skinny - the taper at the bottom is a little tight. I don't think I could fit knee-high socks under these pants.
3.0,"It's well made and a fabulous idea, but it doesn't fit my handlebars.  I have a Specialized women's comfort bike.  I got it this winter (in Wisconsin), so I haven't had a chance to be outside and fiddle with it so I can use it as shown.  FYI, my handlebars are more like cattle horns on a Cadillac than the Glovebox accommodates.  I hope it works for you."
3.0,"The padding cups are super small and weird...it fits, but it's just odd feeling, so returning."
3.0,This is a very cute necklace and earring set.  Unfortunately two of the blue chips were missing from the set.  I found one in the bag and may be able to glue it in.  Will still wear the necklace set around house because it is a cute set.
3.0,I like these leggings but they are NOT for wearing in the public. I get a really bad camel toe with these leggings and wouldn’t dare wear these to the gym.
3.0,Strap was broken. I returned hat
3.0,Much smaller then what it shows
3.0,"I really liked these pants, but the fabric is see-through. I should have known, and what was I expecting with the apricot (cream) color? I thought about exchanging for a darker pair, but I'm afraid they will be too gauzy."
3.0,"This is a cute dress, however the material is a bit stiff in the skirt portion. Also it fits snug, especially in the arms so I suggest ordering a size up. It’s a great deal for the price but keep in mind the top portion is a bit short so if you have a large torso, I don’t, you will need to add an accessory to lengthen it."
3.0,Im a size 4 and 5'11 so i ordered a large for length. Skirt is to the ground with flat shoes. The waist is a bit snug. The top is short but too wide for my 34b cups. Arm sleeve hits at about 3/4. You can wear it off the shoulder too. Its flimsy beach wear. Very cute.
3.0,"cheap and price is cheap too, always crooked though."
3.0,"These were nice shoes, which I immediately returned without wearing them so my impressions are simply first impressions from trying them on.  I would not call them lightweight nor breathable.  The feel more like hiking boots than walking shoes.  They are certainly sturdy and well made."
3.0,I wear size 2XL but got these in An 3XL but still doesn’t fit. To small and to short. I’m 6ft. 280
3.0,Meets my need for white - wears well with white shirts
3.0,Did Not include the gift box as stated in the description... Not happy about that. Shouldn't advertise if not included.
3.0,Love the jewelry bundle
3.0,Pretty!! A little cheesy!
3.0,"I mean it's fine. Seems a little thin and stretchy and made more like a shirt than a hoodie. If you're looking for a thick warm hoodie, this is not the one."
3.0,It came on time. It is not the colors they show on their app. They show a bright yellow but nothing about it is bright or yellow. It is not a heavy well made pin. Disappointed!
3.0,"It's really cute on, but I don't like the material! Feels cheap and plastic like a table cloth😞"
3.0,Ran big but i have small arms.. Just wish it had more stretch. Had thumbholes which i wasnt expecting and since i wear gloves at work i could not wear these with my costume. Cute and just fine otherwise.
3.0,Ok when driving. However when outside there is a large amount or reflection because the sun glass is too far from the eye glass surface. When flipped down they should be closer. My last pair nearly touched the frames?  Annoying!
3.0,Changes color over time
3.0,"The boot is nice; however dealing with customer service and trying to return the boots for a refund were an absolute headache! Having to use 2 inserts to be able to wear the boot. I have 2 other pairs of Durango boots, both size 9, and this one is to big."
3.0,I just needed more room
3.0,Very big on top (even for being busty) the arm hole is very large so if you wear a bra it will show. Long enough though to be modest
3.0,I’m normally a size small in women’s. This runs extra small. I ordered a medium and probably need a large.
3.0,"The sizes was misleading, they were smaller than expected."
3.0,"Too big for my head, the description is not lying when they say oversized. Not why I’m giving 3 stars though. It’s the shape is slightly different than what appears online. They aren’t as round as expected?"
3.0,It was so pretty in the picture but very see through and sheer. Not quite workplace appropriate
3.0,"These pants are cute, however I had to hem the up 4”! I’m 5’8 and they were way too long. Cute enough for me to keep and hem though. I bought them for a trip to Japan and Korea, and they were perfect for comfort, style, and the hot weather."
3.0,"Nice vibrant colors, but ran at least a size smaller.  Bummer."
3.0,"The pendant itself is really nice. Stainless steel and slightly pointy, which I love. But the necklace is annoying and isn't as flexible as I thought it would be. It's kind of like a mix between rubber and hard plastic. like its not that it feel like hard plastic, because it feels like rubber but it's stiff. and it isn't that long so it's kind of uncomfortable, and as much as I want to replace the necklace (not the pendant) the hole on the pendant isn't big enough for the string to come thru.<br />Pendant = 5 stars<br />&#34;Chain&#34; = 2 stars"
3.0,"I bought size 7/8 for my 5 year old and they were a little big on her. Fine on the waist, but despite the fact that she has a very round bottom, it wasn't enough to fill out the cheeks. The material felt a little rough, but would probably be fine after a wash."
3.0,"Good bands, fit my Apple Watch great. I did not use the covers however since they did not work with the watch"
3.0,"One of them is just a cap,  there's no stem.  I'd like to give it 5 stars because they are adorable.  I'm going to put them in potted plants for interest."
3.0,"I was hoping these glasses would help me see better at night, but what they did was just minimize the glare.  I don’t really see that much better."
3.0,"Look better in pic than in person, gifted to cousin who enjoys them"
3.0,"I'm 5'11"", and weigh 195lbs, so wear a size large glove.<br />I ordered size large, yet these gloves slip easily when I use them, making it difficult to put on my compression stocking..<br />Order a size smaller for best results."
3.0,Very pretty but toggle bar is too narrow and slips out of the closing link.  I had to take it to a jeweler for conversion to a lobster clasp which cost me an extra forty dollars.
3.0,The color and pattern are nice. The material was on the thin side but doesn’t appear see through. I ordered a medium and a large thinking I would send one back but even the large was too small. Both went back.
3.0,These are very large for the sizing.  Cute prints though.
3.0,"Loose fitting top, fabric is more like a workout fabric but heavier, not sure I like the heaviness, may return."
3.0,The leggings were very thin and see threw. They were also smaller than expected.
3.0,"Update September 2019: Some of my earrings have begun to tarnish and I even had a green line on my ear the other day.<br /><br />Original review February 2019:<br />They’re cute earrings and I was going to come on here and leave a review that I received everything as advertised, but that is slightly untrue.<br /><br />As I was looking through my package, I noticed that one pair of earrings (see picture) came WITH A ROCK in the bag instead of me having the back part of the earring!! Totally random, whatever, I have other earrings so I can just steal the push back piece from a different pair. I just think it’s unprofessional to not inspect your products before sending them out.<br /><br />Also, ladies, try on and check all of your pieces before going out! The first pair I tried on had a push back that was huge, and way too loose to actually secure the earring in place. Again, I had to substitute the back piece of my earring.<br /><br />Other than having to inspect all my pieces, the actual design parts are legit (like in the advertised photos) and it’s cute. I was actually complimented my first time I wore them and nobody has ever noticed my earrings ever before in my life."
3.0,"Runs very small. I sized up so that it would be roomy, and even a size up it was tight. It was also on the short side for me, and I'm average height. Returned."
3.0,"This is a very cute dress, gorgeous color and lovely detail. The pockets are just an added bonus! It runs a little big and the way the top of the dress lays is slightly awkward, not sure what would make it not that way, maybe hollywood tape?"
3.0,Like the material. Shirt length can be longer. Doesn't come down far long enough over my chest.
3.0,"Had hoped the X-Large would NOT be snug but, unfortunately, it was, simply too small. That is a big bad for me. I expect an X-L to be a little baggy, but it's form fitting. If you like that, you'll like this sweater. I wear a 12 pants and am a little top heavy to give an idea of what snug is. The material was nice, the color sharp, the pattern good. It had 2 snags in it, but able to pull them back into the sweater OK."
3.0,Great style but poorly made
3.0,"Too small. I usually wear a medium but bought a large based on the reviews. It's more like a small size. Fabric VERY THIN, elastic around bust line twisted, sleeves way too short. BEWARE WHEN ORDERING!"
3.0,Tank top was good material. I sized up and it was still a bit small.
3.0,"The bikini itself was super cute, but I bought a 2XL and the top was just too small. I'm 36DD, 145 lbs, and I wanted the top to be snug and hold me in for support, but my chest looked smushed and spilled out over the top. I sent it back and got a 3XL which fit much better, though it pained me to purchase something labeled 3XL!! However, these are not normal American sizes. The bottoms fit well, not tight around the thighs as I'd feared. I got a TON of compliments once I got the right size."
3.0,"I got this vest in Small. Good fabric, real pocket, but the vest is a tight in the chest. My BF normally wears Small slim cut clothes, but the vest is cut in a bit of strange way. If he decides to keep it, I'll adjust the buttons. Also, the black vest I ordered came with purple buttons. It was for a Halloween party, so it might work."
3.0,Hat has a wire rim and felt flimsy.  Returned.
3.0,The neckline looks a bit awkward. If you have larger boobs it looks like a tent on you.
3.0,I wear XS and the SM fit too loose so I’m retuning it. Otherwise the dress is cute and fair quality.
3.0,"This outfit was adorable, however it was huge. The onesie is cotton so I was able to shrink slightly & make it work but the pants and bow/hat were massive, easily 3 sizes too big. I will be saving the pants for next thanksgiving. I would definitely size down."
3.0,Don't think it was genuine to be honest came in a cheap fake box and was not of the same quality as the band that came originally with my skagen watch unfortunately.
3.0,The sizing is technically correct but at the same time they fit a bit awkwardly.  Not the greatest of material.
3.0,"I've had these underwear for about two months now. I wasn't so sure about the fit because so many people mentioned that they ran big but ended up going with the medium (which is normally what I get for underwear) and they fit perfectly (I'm about a size 8 in pants). I'm giving these three stars because they're super comfortable and they look nice but they don't breathe. If you do any amount of physical exercise in these, they smell quite a bit more than regular underwear. If you don't really work out then these are probably fine, normally I wear them on days when I know I won't be doing much. But it kinda sucks to have to think about which underwear I should wear that day, we already have so many choices to make in our daily lives, I feel like this shouldn't be one of them. I'll keep wearing these but I would definitely not buy them again."
3.0,It’s not a very accurate description of the rings when it comes to how brilliant the colors are. They are not shiny like in the pictures the seller posted. My husband was disappointed but he happy he had 6 different rubber rings to wear to work showing he is married. That means more to him than anything.
3.0,After i purchased these for my husband for Christmas gift and he traveled a few times we have noticed some tearing on the inside. I reasearced for good quality and I thought thats what i was getting. A little sad it hasn't lasted long.
3.0,"I’m a female, average weight and this was big on me. The skull was then distorted. The adjustment strap was nice as it kept it up BUT it was able painful after just a few moments sitting tightly on my nose. It was perfect for my husband though!"
3.0,"It's ADORABLE, but runs VERY large! I ordered 5 rompers and ALL the mediums fit perfect except this one. I wanted to reorder in a small, but they've run out of smalls."
3.0,Quality not so good but fits too price
3.0,"I travel a lot on airplanes and this product is just OK.  I was looking for a carry-on spinner to go with my 25&#34; Samsonite Majolica Blue suitcase.  I wanted something that would slip over the handle.  It just barley slips over the handle of my 25&#34; bag, but is very hard to get you hand on the handle and maneuver the two bags together.  Also the colors are not the same even though they are listed as Majolica Blue.  It is a very small bag so don't expect to put too much into it.  There would be barely enough room for 1 night.  I used the bag on one trip and the snap broke on the inside so I returned the bag.  There is no way to lock the bag which I like to do when I leave my luggage with the concierge. The one good thing is that since it is a spinner it will go down the isle of an airplane.  Still looking for a small spinner."
3.0,"Pretty good but they seem to lack a bit of sparkle. It did not bother my ears, they look pretty good. They're basically just fine. If you look around I'm sure you can find something that is more than fine but if fine will do it is fine you have found"
3.0,Seems to be a good hat. It was a gag gift for my niece and she has worn it a lot.
3.0,Deer looks more like goat and way to big for size
3.0,"The braclet came alot faster than stated. Its super cure, but super cheap as well. I know my best friend will like it. I just hope it doesnt break anytime soon. I think it would be best for a child."
3.0,These are OK for the price but fairly dark for driving and some distortion.
3.0,Ordered oversize and still to small
3.0,Strings come out too easily
3.0,its a cute top but I've worn it just a few times...washed it maaaaybe 2 or 3 times and it looks OLD and will prob be tossed soon ;/
3.0,"The Pom is great. The fabric and construction are fabulous. I loved the outer fabric that doesn’t “pill” like knit. But the shape is awkward. The darts create a boxy fit. Maybe it’s just my head’s shape, but it seems that maybe just 2 darts would suffice - or even making them longer or shorter 🤷🏼‍♀️ I will look next year to see if this has been redesigned, because everything else about the hat was great, but I had to return it."
3.0,"I normally wear a small but sized up and ordered a medium due to other reviews. The medium top is loose but the skirt is so tight, its difficult to breathe when zippered, even when pulled up to the thinnest part if my waist. It would have been so much better if the waist had some elastic and was stretchier.  Might return and try a different brand."
3.0,"The bracelet is gorgeous, as advertised. Was disappointed to see there was no tool to remove links and adjust the length."
3.0,It looked very nice but it broke very easily ! It broke within 3 days of purchasing it
3.0,This is cute but I ordered a 4T and it came as a 3-4.  I was disappointed. It should have been listed as a 3-4.
3.0,Wont stay snapped. Pop off as soon as i start going faster.
3.0,Top is super small and not forgiving with the stretch in the back. Skirt is polyester and feels cheap and crinkly. Will be returning.
3.0,It`s okay. Build quality is good. But too tall for my taste.
3.0,its cute.but the necklace is very thin and pendant is small...
3.0,"This romper is not exactly as pictured. The front halter is not adjustable ( see photo) Fabric is soft and resists wrinkles.  The fit was comfortable on my curvy frame. A few suggestions for better fit:  It is difficult to pull up over hips, there's not enough stretch,( a thin band of elastic at waist) I barely got the shorts up each time !  A zipper in back would be very helpful. The back halter is adjustable with ties but the front is fixed in place, the armpits are a little too high because of this. I would have liked to pull the front halter top together more to free up underarms ( as shown in the listing picture) . The ties at waist are attached and not at the natural waistline but several inches above it. It would be better if the waist tie was one long and separate piece in order to wrap it around in a comfortable position according to different figures."
3.0,The watch looks nice and feels well made for the price however the band is machined in such a way that it is virtually impossible to remove links.<br /><br />In other words if this doesn't fit your wrist when you get it there's no way to adjust the size downward
3.0,We had to repair the draw strings right away
3.0,nice one bt lack in quality
3.0,Ok for the price paid..
3.0,"I did not actually receive a prink skirt that folded over. It does not fold over at all. However, I decided to keep it as I was looking for a pink summer skirt. I like the fit and it is easy to wash but I would not put in the drier. In fact, I don't put these skirts in the drier because I don't want to ruin them. Instead, I line dry them and after a few hours the skirt looks great. I am planning on purchasing a black skirt for winter."
3.0,"pretty, but the chain had to be repaired after 2 uses."
3.0,it keep braking
3.0,The flower is MUCH BIGGER than I expected. I sent it back
3.0,"Perfect for the price, a little transparent but great feel."
3.0,"Fabric and pattern look great, but I was definitely size up. Fit was kind of weird, almost looks more like just a shirt than a kimono."
3.0,Good material but it runs small.
3.0,"I bought this and they don't really stay on my feet without sliding everywhere. in summery, all the different strands kind of just clump together. if i position my feet and keep them still and position the footwear, then yes it looks like the pic. but in practical situations...doesn't look that great."
3.0,No need 4 piercing ears .
3.0,"Style and build. I would definitely give these five stars based on those two. However, glasses are for seeing as my grand pappy used to say. These bad boys do that rainbow glaze over screens like phones and navigation units. They seem to make things a little too dark and I find myself lifting them and just taking them off to see too often."
3.0,"Comfortable, light material.  Very Nice"
3.0,"Thin material.  Good for minimal perspiration, not fir workout sweat."
3.0,Looks nice. Tells time just fine. But isn’t great for a man who has a kid that spilled their chocolate milk on dad’s watch. Definitely not made to be worn daily or come in contact with any liquids.
3.0,I got lots of compliments when I wore this shirt. The words started to fall off after a few months. I wish it would have lasted a little longer. Perhaps you should hang it to dry instead. Fits well and hits just below the waist like I like.
3.0,I ordered an xs and I got a small….. like the product but because they sent the wrong size they get 3 stars. Also the shirt is thinner that what I was expecting.
3.0,"I like the style, but they were gold tone, not Silver like picture shows, and they ran tight. Order a size up. If they came in Silver metal Id definitely re order!!!! Liked the style!"
3.0,Looked really good. Chord broke in about two weeks of consistent wear.
3.0,"Good shape, fits okay. However these are polyester, and hard tp breathe through. No pocket for filter. Go for cotton and something with a filter pocket."
3.0,"These are definitely not tights. They are semi opaque stockings. Although they fit and worked well with my costume, that felt like the we're falling down all day. They are not support hose in any way. And because we f that they are comfortable,if you don't mind that feeling like they're drooping all day."
3.0,"It's a very nice dress, love the pockets. The color is great; and I did have to size down as the other buyers suggested. Overall, I would purchase again."
3.0,Material bunches up on the little finger of the right hand.. uncomfortable to ride motorcycle
3.0,"I am sooo torn! The quality is lovely, the cardigan is very soft, looks well made, fits true to size, and is very comfy. BUT!! The color is waaaaay off from the picture. I ordered apricot/beige, and Amazon picture shows this pretty, neutral beige color. What I received was a pukey-green tinted beige that's very unattractive. Such a bummer!! I will be returning based on this color alone."
3.0,"So small. I bought a large anticipating it to run small. It's very short at the waist. It's so cute and looks great on my 92 pound 12 year old daughter. A large! For it to fit me, I would need to order an xxxxl. I'm typically a medium."
3.0,Dress is very cute however very thin you can see clear through it thought the material would be a little Thick
3.0,Didn't like too much
3.0,They are OK as sunglasses.  Little to no change in lens photochromic lighting/darkening
3.0,Material is nice. Runs very small.
3.0,Average build. Work well
3.0,ordered medium but fit like a small.. size is not accurate
3.0,Be sure to take note of the way the beanie is constructed.  It's a tube that they didn't bother to trim to create a true &#34;dome&#34; top.  My wife and daughter think it looks ridiculous.  It does have puckers and ears on top.
3.0,"Stunning outfit, only the snaps are insanely hard to open and close as they aren't the normal metal snaps,  so hard that gently pulling,  I made a tiny tear around the snap.  No baby snaps should be this difficult sorry."
3.0,"I bought this bathing suit for an upcoming trip. It claimed in the bio that it had tummy control which caught my attention. Well I tried it on as soon as I got it. The color is nice, and surprisingly the XL fit me fine. But it did not have any tummy control or breast support at all. So sorry it’s not all what it’s cracked up to be. And you have to be careful of how loose the breast area is because my breast fell out. Buy at your own risk. No tummy control and no breast support."
3.0,"Front brim tends to flop down into the face of the infant.<br />Overall it was ok.<br />Nothing special, but wouldn't order another one like this."
3.0,Nice shirt just runs small.
3.0,Looks great. Only fit one of my smaller brooches. They should sell with extenders to cover the whole brooch pin or give size of product’s tube that fits over the brooch pin so we can decide if it will fit.
3.0,"Cable & Gauge has created a dress with some potential. It is brown (Mocha Toffee), with a zipper closure (stops mid-chest), and hoodie. It stops mid-thigh. I ordered up because I didn't want it to be fitted. That was a good call because this dress tends to run small.  However, I am not sure why this dress retails for $58. It is thin (really thin) and light. The fabric (blend of polyester, spandex and rayon) feels great against the skin. Overall, the design of the dress is cute, but I don’t think it’s worth the retail price on Amazon."
3.0,Made small. Not comfortable
3.0,"I sized up like the description recommended, and now I've got pants that are too baggy in the butt.  These are also the type that are cut way too tight in the calf/ankle area so the fit is real annoying since I went bigger.  Printing is rough and sticky, fabric isn't the softest.  Will not order more from this brand."
3.0,The quality of the material could be a lot better
3.0,"I like these, but they are super heavy. Don't know how often I will wear them. Might try to take off the bottom stone."
3.0,"I got these along with the black and white set. These connect similar to the original with no swing on the clasp. Don't forget a drop of machine oil and a good strong push up until you hear a little click and then you know they're on. The top doesn't line up flush as the original or the black and white replacement. It juts out maybe 0.5 mm, no biggie for me but I suppose it's the issue for others who said it fell out. The red isn't a dark red like to picture or the original but more of a lighter raspberry red. Doesn't bother me for the while, fits good and is very comfortable."
3.0,The picture makes it look more maroon but it is definitely red. Its also pretty short. I’m 5’8 so for shorter girls this would work but if I wear this someone’s getting a show.
3.0,"These pants are very very ugly but seem to be made well.  You can’t wear them with anything but boots because the pants are so wide at the bottom.  Let’s talk about the color.  the picture they look a little red, they are not, they are UPS brown"
3.0,Super cute but disappointed that they had a scratch on them straight out of the package. Will be returning.
3.0,"Took a LONG time to get. Looked pretty much like pictures. BUT... Doesn't last long. The faux fur and nose are glued to a grey plastic body base that does not stay adhered to properly. So it looses bits of fur, face, etc in chunks. Although I still think it was worth it somewhat."
3.0,"I bought this product believing it was a cheaper alternative to the cute Betsey Johnson nautical trend, which it is, but I was not aware of the reason why it was so cheap... It was made in China. Now I have nothing against China but I hadn't realized that when you buy something through Amazon from there it takes almost 3 weeks to arrive which was a little inconvenient. Also the product felt, as in materially, very cheap. I hardly wear it because of that and it's also smaller then advertised. I guess I got what I pay for."
3.0,"It definitely is sized more like a shirt than a cover up.  It definitely is not long enough to cover to mid-thigh like this picture shows, it is more like a long shirt and not as flowy as I would have liked."
3.0,I also purchased a big print bible thinking I could use this cover to protect it.  It did not say how wide a book it would fit so I could not use it.
3.0,the case is smaller than I expected and doesn't fit all my eyeglasses
3.0,"My daughter used the pants look good, fit right but after the 1st use the cotton pealed and had fuzzy little balls all over."
3.0,I had to buy new batteries for them as soon as they arrived. The lights did not work and the batteries cost as much as the lights did to buy.
3.0,I like how it looks in person but it did not fit. I got this for my daughter and went off the size chart and it was still too small. The medium wouldn't even get over her head and that is after loosening the straps. I doubt the large would have fit her either.
3.0,"Gloves very warm, but are not flexible at all and super stiff."
3.0,Not any better than any other thick socks...
3.0,"Super cute, but the  backing on these earrings  were very cheap. My 3 year old Lost one of her earrings because the back fell off. 😭"
3.0,"Really love this jacket but the 3xl fits like an XL but I was able to alter it to help it fit.<br />I suggest not getting this if youre looking for an American 3xl,item fits like xl."
3.0,"I’m 5’4” and 160 lbs. These are cute but definitely not high wasted. The material is a little thin. Arguably, these barely fit me."
3.0,Jewels fell out of then after a bit of time very nice fit
3.0,"Look great, but larger than size ordered"
3.0,"It fits well but definitely not the fabric I expected. I thought it would be silky, kind of like a see through fabric. It's more of a rough fabric. The sleeves are also longer than I anticipated. Doesn't match up the picture portrayed."
3.0,Abit small and logo no double sided.
3.0,Really not stylish enough for wearing except as note in headline
3.0,Very sheer. Too small. Returned. I liked the color.
3.0,"Shoes were fine, but they fit a whole size too small. I ordered a size 4 but they fit like a size 3 so we had to return them."
3.0,BE AWARE THIS IS TINY!  SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
3.0,Pedi talla S.<br /> pero más bien parece talla grande.<br />Es muy cómodo pero muy amplio.<br /><br />Recomiendo pedir 2 tallas menos de la que usan
3.0,Would have been great but several threads in the visor were messed up making it look like it was discounted by the maker to get rid of.  Wish I had noticed when I bought it.
3.0,It helped my back pain for a while but did nothing for my  weight.  Wast of money if you use it for weightlos.
3.0,"These are pretty stones and wire wrapping, however the chains are an odd too long of a length (they lay right between my breasts and constantly flip over to the wrong side) and cannot be adjusted to be shortened much at all. In addition, some of the clasps will not close when opened. This is highly disappointing- especially for the cost"
3.0,"Ran a little small.  Thought pull on meant no zippers.  Buttons were hard to use, holes were a little small. They were very long for capris"
3.0,"Enjoyed the jacket, the color and style. The pockets are loosely dangling inside instead of being attached to the jacket. Makes me feel bulky for being a husky guy around the stomach, which isn't appealing for myself. So it's a stay at home jacket."
3.0,"so many loose rope not sure how to use them all,  I do like the color and top bottom was totally not to size chart"
3.0,"This dress fit alright, what through me off is the smell (somewhat mildewed), and the material was damaged on the back of the skirt (loose threading, and broken threading.  Will have to send this back."
3.0,The zebra print could have been as big as the leopard one. It is to small to work with should at least be twice as thick.
3.0,I wanted to love this dress so bad.... but as an apple shape the pockets stick out and make the dress look like a potato sack.
3.0,Nice hoping they stretch a bit
3.0,"Fair quality but you have too be careful,  the chain broke after my daughter wore it a few times."
3.0,"I have small wrists, and the strap is just a tad too short. Materials are nice, but the rivets in the watch band are not centered by a few MM. Not a huge deal , but I can imagine someone more picky that me would not be thrilled."
3.0,"Stylish and great to use as a band when going out or dressing up a bit. Unfortunately it does not work well for working out. Every time I complete a 45 minute workout, my watch doesn't match it in completing my exercise rings. I've never had this issue in the past with other bands. I think the magnets mess with the watch some how."
3.0,This shirt has a print on the back that should have been more prominently advertised. The shirt was alsoVERY thick & therefore not comfortable for golf as it was too hot.
3.0,This bodysuit is very tight.
3.0,Little large in the heel
3.0,Its SO cute but it was WAYYYYY too small! I couldn't even put it all the way on it runs so small. Order 2 sizes up for it to fit.
3.0,Supposed to be Red Zebra but is Orange Zebra!
3.0,I did not like the blouse.  I usually am M size.  This XL was too small
3.0,"Looked well made, but very small.  My expectations were off, so its not fair to say anything negative about this product.  I was looking for a home shoe shine kit....full size."
3.0,"Received this necklace today. I have to say, that it was very cheap looking, it is a plastic &#34;stone&#34;... But what do you expect for the price? It is still cute enough to mix with my other necklaces & jewelry.... All in all, it's okay..."
3.0,"The sweater is ribbed, black, and knit as expected, but the material is super thin and kind of translucent because of all the gaps. The sweater is form-fitting so i can say good things about the shape and fit looking like the product images and the sizing is right, but the material is low quality and it is obvious in bright light. In low light it looks like a good sweater, but photos with flash expose the sheerness. It is reasonable for the price, but not a great gift because of the quality flaws. My partner wore it once, washed it, and on the second wear it was already looking pretty stretched at the elbows. Don't recommend if you're looking for a durable product -- this is a classic shape, but has a very fast-fashion feel to it."
3.0,Very comfortable and light but for almost $50 they didn't last long. I had them for 6 months and that was it. Tread is light duty and they just wore out very fast. Not a good value.
3.0,"Looks flattering. Fabric feels on the cheap side, and generates a lot of static electricity"
3.0,"Glad they come is bulk, they break easy so glad i have back ups."
3.0,Mi hijo los ah usado solo unas semana dentro de la casa y ya se estan rompiendo
3.0,Am I making a big deal out of it because bits too big?
3.0,"Good belt for the price, lasted almost 14 months before breaking. The reversible ones seem to have this issue eventually. Will try another brand but happy with belt while I had it."
3.0,After only one day of pranks the string broke. I know it doesn’t have to look exact but the hidden prank looks nothing like as it should
3.0,"Size was correct for torso, but the arms were incredibly tight, to the point of causing pain. The sleeves were also much too long, had to cut off about 3-4 inches , they were too tight to even roll up.  I am probably going to cut a splash mid bicep to relieve the pressure cutting off my circulation.  It's a shame, other than this serious design flaw ( I see others have had a similar issue)  its sturdy, warm and a good value."
3.0,I purchased a 2x for my husband...it was more like size large. Nice shirt! But runs really small!
3.0,"locket opens from the top, so you have to tAke the heart off the chain to open the locket, which is disappointing for my daughter"
3.0,"For the most part, this set is okay. The material is thin and comfortable but the stripes on the left leg are sewn in and do not have the same stretch as the rest of the material. Therefore, that area is slightly tighter and it feels strange. I am hoping it will loosen up with time & multiple washes. This would be good to wear for lounging in the house or a long car ride but looks more like pajamas on me than anything else."
3.0,Gloves are just ok<br /><br />Kind of cheap<br /><br />I'll keep them but don't love em
3.0,I bought it as a work shirt but the quality is made VERY cheaply !!!
3.0,They were shorter and thinner than I realized. I like them ok. Very shiny. I prefer a low luster silver earring.
3.0,Love the fabric and design but they are a very tight fit.  Size up one!  An XL normally fits me perfectly but not this one- so tight the back on my calves have sideways wrinkles. My hips are 42”
3.0,They’re decent gloves. But way too big for the size
3.0,The neck was larger than I expected but the shirt fit pretty good.
3.0,Mas o menos la tela no me agrada mucho.
3.0,I love the charm but the necklace is short. I bought a new necklace from hobby lobby and just used the charm.
3.0,Dress is a large and fits like a small
3.0,broke on the first day. glasses fell from table and broke in half.
3.0,The fur is bigger in width and the circumference is tighter than expected.
3.0,"S/M fits more like a medium. If you are an XS or S, I wouldn't really recommend it. The upside is that the fabric is very soft and stretchy."
3.0,Muy grande la esfera
3.0,The patches are not fully sown on correctly.
3.0,I like the sunglassess
3.0,Cute shirt but the large fits smaller than expected.
3.0,to big :(
3.0,This material has no stretch and the title says “oversized”. This product runs extremely small. Id say my XL fits more like an oversized medium. I’ll be returning this product.
3.0,"I loved these bracelets when I first got them, but after wearing them for only 2 days, almost all of the print had come off, leaving them just plain solid color bracelets."
3.0,"I ordered an Xl, which fit my DIL who normally wears a medium.  I would not reorder due to the questionable sizing."
3.0,The product is okay.  Would like to be able to add a slim pen and lipstick with ease.
3.0,"The fabric  is very soft and would likely be very comfortable for sleepwear.  What was really extra nice about this product though was that the seller included a postage paid adhesive return label!  Seriously, an excellent feature that should be included with all clothing purchases (and not just because I need to use this one).<br />Why am I returning?  Size.  Not even remotely close to the size chart size.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was a child's XL not an adults.  The sleeve length was off by several inches.  I expected K.Cole to be off size but this was too much.<br />Thankfully, the seller has protected me against this and included the return label.  Nice job!"
3.0,"they arrived much sooner than expected. however i didnt receive all 7pcs, the rings are ok."
3.0,They are super cute and feel great but they tore down the middle. 😭
3.0,Nice but not long enough like in the picture
3.0,Wasn't quite as good as I thought
3.0,"I like that it is a soft scarf and that it does not pull on my edges because it is not heavy once you tie it but the hanging ends are nowhere as long or as substantial as shown in the picture so when you wrap it, the bun is much smaller like the size of a golf ball versus the nice hefty bun shown on the model.  There is simply not enough material to produce that size of a bun. The picture has the ends hanging down almost past her waist but the one I received only hung to my breast.  I am going to keep it only because it is soft and it provides the coverage without putting weight on my scalp which is what I needed but had I was really looking for something that looked like the ad especially at this price. For what I received it should have been half the price."
3.0,"if you're a guy look elsewhere, they aren't to bad but for the price how can you go wrong. just saying."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these socks. Nice colors, perfect compression, some extra padding where is nice to have, washes well...  But the set I received had an issue with size consistency! Most pairs fir nicely, but 1 or 2 pairs were what felt like a size smaller! Very aggravating!"
3.0,The elastic is coming apart slowly strings are coming loose.
3.0,"nice bodysuit, but runs big"
3.0,These shorts are well made with nice fabric but the size is significantly narrower/tighter than other brands at the same size (XL). I would recommend you order a size larger.
3.0,I am a size 7 so I opted for a size smaller to allow for stretching. now if I don’t wear thick socks while wearing the slippers they fall off my feet. True they are warm and while it is cold I can use my thick socks but after I will not be wearing them anymore. I am quite disappointed with this product and they were not cheap!
3.0,"I don't know how well these socks will hold up over time, but they're okay for now. Very thin, and somewhat moisture wicking. So they'll be fine for running. But they are NOT plain white - definitely more of a cream color. Which might not matter to some, but I literally bought them to wear with my white running shoes, so I'm not very happy about the color."
3.0,"I like it but I have a small head so it's just slightly large, but it's still ok."
3.0,I order a large but fit tight
3.0,This dress is shorter than what it appears in the picture. The material is very good quality and heavy though. It just was not for me. It was not what I expected.
3.0,Because the ruffle hit about mid-bust vs under the bust which would have made it more attrractive I am sending it back. It seemed nice other than that issue. I am an XL and pretty full in the bust so this may not be an issue with everyone.
3.0,Nice necklace chain will break easily
3.0,It started falling apart as soon as I tried it on. The sequins fell off.
3.0,"Grey was not very attractive on, but I kept the black one in the same style.  I gave it 3 stars only because the fabric is a bit thicker than expected (polyester) and not really good for summer."
3.0,First you see a really nice looking pouch bag. Then you open it and your hit with this horrible smell.  I almost couldn't get past the smell to do this review it was so over powering. The leather feels cheap and rough. The buckle is probably the only thing worth spending your money on. I just can't express the how bad this belt smelt. And how cheap the material felt. Would not buy. I hope this has helped. Thank You
3.0,The color of scarves sent me were not beautiful.
3.0,I think it's cute and soft but really runs small. I put in closet and maybe I will lose some weight or give as a gift.
3.0,Overall nice quality
3.0,This shirt it very loose and big. The arm holes are very large which means you have to wear a bando bra with it unless you want your bra sticking out. Mine also didn't come with a tag on it and the tag on the inside does not say what size it is. Kind of confusing.
3.0,"Could hold better, the slightest of wind dislodges ball from holder"
3.0,"this item was nice but a bit on the clingy side for me, for a young woman it would be great. loved the color of the  the blue, the fit was as expected, not to small or large, so it ran true to size.."
3.0,"The mask, while adjustable behind the ears, does not fit well. It fits loosely under the chin and there is no way to adjust the fit."
3.0,it's a nice purse but a little small.
3.0,"I’m a top heavy woman, I ordered an XXL, it was tight.  Not that comfortable to sleep in.  Not long enough to come down to my hips. Colors are pretty though."
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, but very pretty."
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but when I took it out of the box the chain was in a huge knot. Still working on getting it out."
3.0,bigger than thought.
3.0,It's hard for me to review as it didn't fit so I'd say it runs small.
3.0,I like the scrub top but it was smaller than expected so I had to return it. Didn't get a chance to wear it.
3.0,"Cute, but much thinner than it appears in the photo."
3.0,Great item and I love all the room the only problem is when I got it. The wallet smelled like a dead animal
3.0,i like this suit alot but its really small. i ordered a medium.  i weigh 124 and am 5'2.5 inches tall. i usually wear a 10 but around the chest its super tight.
3.0,"It is cute but very thin material. Has held up, but it is not the quality I expect of carriage boutique. Especially for the price."
3.0,They are very pretty but the clasp is not very strong.
3.0,Material feels good.  Runs small and too short.
3.0,"I only paid 15 dollars...so I wasn't expected much.. the fabric is soft an comfy...the design look to be done by someone inexperienced, as some of the letters were not aligned."
3.0,"I had ordered these horns because the ones I got from Etsy were not going to arrive on time. The pros: it was comfortable<br />The cons: it’s made cheaply, made for one or two uses, came deformed, the foam was placed terribly so you can see it when wearing it. I wouldn’t recommend them."
3.0,Metal was cheap with some sharp spots but for how much I paid it isn't bad. They look very nice.
3.0,Not a big frozen fan. Seems to be too white in the print for my taste.
3.0,Needs better framing to keep ears up
3.0,These looked way better online than they do in person. They ended up being way too gawdy and chunky and they were definitely more on the “dated” looking side as well.<br />My initial thought when I first saw them was how fake they looked. The metal had that “overly shiny” fake look to it and they just weren’t what I had hoped for.<br />They were very lightweight though and did not weigh my ears down.
3.0,I love this bracelet!  I wear it every day.  But it's going to break.  Sooner or later that small section where the brass crosses over itself on the sides is going to crack and break.
3.0,I love it but it's didn't close the zipper right
3.0,Unfortunately this sheads tremendously and causes lint to cling to your garments. Expensive for poor quality.
3.0,"Cute nice quality tee, but runs small especially in the arms. I typically wear a small but got a medium based upon other reviews. I am 5'5 and around 127 lbs with broad shoulders and muscular arms.  Unfortunately, the medium's armholes  were very tight and the sleeve ended at he widest part of my arm which is not flattering. I am returning."
3.0,They are larger and more juvenile looking than I expected.
3.0,"IF this fit into my shoe, I would give it 7 stars based on (the perceived) quality.  That being said, it will not work for someone with (what I think is) average sized women’s feet. I wear a 7. This was described as working for men’s and women’s shoes. I could not fit it inside to use. Returned."
3.0,"El cinto está bien hecho,  solo q tiene un golpe olor muy fuerte."
3.0,my grandson loved it.
3.0,"This necklace feels a little on the cheap side, and it is HUGE. I knew it'd be big, but I wasn't expecting it to hang quite as low as it did. I actually bought 6 of these for my bridesmaids and ended up returning 5 of them. I had to keep the one I'd opened, but I did find a dress I could wear it with to another wedding, so that was fine. It's a good necklace for the price, just beware of exactly how large it actually is."
3.0,The glasses are very fragile. My son broke the ear piece the first couple days. The plastic is not very good.
3.0,They do not account for the average nose size. Very tough to put in I needed pliers and that to spread it apart once in pain to get out l. But really cute when u do.
3.0,"Nice pants, great pricing! 4 stars due to the medium being a bit snug. I'm 5'7/8&#34;, 138lbs, an &#34;M&#34; should be a bit roomier.  Otherwise, would order this brand again."
3.0,Cute mask but there’s no sparkle of any kind on this mask.
3.0,One of the stones fell out almost immediately after buying
3.0,"I got this for my husband so he could stop filling out the little paper ones every time we went to the airport!  He likes the durability of the tag and the metal grommet reinforcement. the only problem is that there is no removable tag to write your contact info on, it's just a rubber square which got a little smeared even after writing with Sharpie and waiting about 30 minutes for the ink to dry. He remedied this by putting a piece of packing tape over the writing, but we will have to see if it holds up during travel.  I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This in no way affects my opinion or review of the tag."
3.0,"I purchased some pasties and they were ALMOST perfect. At the end of the night when I found myself removing the pasties, they we're way too stuck on me. I say this because they were really hard to remove,  I tried lifting them up from a corner but they were just way too stuck on. When I finally lifted a part up, as I continued to peel it, it would literally pull my skin with it. My main concern with this is that eventually the pasties pulled off some on my skin on both sides. Although, I would love to leave a 5 star review, that absolutely blew it for me."
3.0,In one of the pairs of socks; one socks is missing
3.0,It's nice but the diamond cuts of the bracelet are a little too large making the bracelet look fake.  Also I'm having problems with the clasp.  Otherwise nice
3.0,It’s comfortable and great quality but they run a size smaller. I might need to order a size bigger next time but yeah
3.0,This is pretty good for the price. The magnets are pretty strong for the size. Unfortunately it’s so strong that it kinda hurts after a while and feels almost like it’s embedded in my nostril skin. My nose isn’t that sensitive. I bought these because I  wanted to see if I liked how a septum piercing looked on me before I just go and get pierced. These definitely helped me make my decision. (I’m getting it done sometime). They’re also super cute.
3.0,"good quality but not the right size for girls, way too big"
3.0,Not white.  Off white and tight fit
3.0,"The photo shown does give you the idea that it is more than it is, but it is a phot copy under epoxy. Beautiful, still and a nice piece for anyone that like Egyptian stuff."
3.0,"Bought for my 4 yr old son, he seems to like it but there is no mesh on the inside (would’ve been nice to know). And some of the material has been pulled. (See photo)"
3.0,It’s cheap material but it worked in a pinch so I can’t complain too much
3.0,"Good dress, I like this style of the the dress and it’s fit but I didn’t like the quality"
3.0,"I picked up these womens sandals from RoseFace in the black. I have bad feet and so I am always on the lookout for a good looking shoe that I can actually wear! These are cute and fit my wide foot, but I will be honest, they look better from a distance. Up close, they appear kinda cheap. The footbed is cushiony and comfortable, but it is certainly NOT breathable like it says in the product description, it feels very plasticy against your foot and makes a suction sound when your feet sweat. There is plastic wrapped around the toe post and the bottoms are slippery as well. They too are plastic and when walking on carpet or smooth linoleum you should take extra care! To combat this, I went out to the sidewalk and scuffed up the bottoms to add a bit of traction. Also, there is no arch support or heel cup, the footbed is totally flat. Bottom line, because of my bad feet, I feel like I need to take what I can get in the footwear department. These fit my foot and look cute from a distance, so I am happy about that. I just wish they were better quality.  This feels like the type of shoe you might get at that famous discount shoe store, the one where you might pay less for similar looking brands but will only get one season of use out of before they crack and fall apart. These I will enjoy while they last, but do not have long term hopes for!"
3.0,This is the size of a purse<br />Pretty but sent back
3.0,The masks looked ok and they did last with multiple washes. The problem is I felt like I was wearing a quilted blanket on my face. They were definitely too heavy to wear if you are doing anything besides sitting still
3.0,"Just barely fits my Fitbit in the holder, and I have to stretch the silicone to get it into the holder. Slightly bulky, and sticks to my skin of the wrist during daywear. I find myself fiddling around with the wrist band a lot more, twisting the band around the wrist for comfort, than if it were just a clip."
3.0,I thought it would bend more.
3.0,Held up good for awhile. Starting to come un-stitched. little big in the pocket too.
3.0,These aren’t the earrings I ordered but they are nice. The quality is okay
3.0,Great color and perfect sizing. The dress I purchased was yellow and the only complaint that I have is that it is revealing of any clothing you have on underneath the dress. The dress most likely will need to be worn with a slip.
3.0,"Quality seems good, but ""Marines"" on back prevents size adjustments.<br /><br />Also, ""Semper fidelus"" is barely readable.<br /><br />And I didn't notice before ordering, but it doesn't say ""USMC"" nor does it spell it out. That is disappointing... maybe dealbreaker Undecided if returning."
3.0,Been working fine.
3.0,Waist to small
3.0,It's much cheaper looking and feeling than I anticipated. But it is what I ordered.
3.0,my son have used this shoes..<br />oh my god !!! the roller of the left shoe was out of order.<br /><br />the rest of shoes is good.
3.0,Feels and looks like stained glass/ plastic. Just feels weird
3.0,It's so beautiful and exactly as described but it's just so bumig that it flips around my wrist
3.0,Made in china...very sad..
3.0,"I normally wear an 8.5-9 in pointy flats. So I purchase a 9 in this shoe and it feels like a 9.5! For the price, I should not have expected much, but these shoes look and feel cheap. I immediately gave them to goodwill after wearing them once."
3.0,"After waiting a couple of weeks,the item came and the size was too small even though I had ordered it in a bigger size..."
3.0,right sleeve was kind of smaller than the left. I'm still keeping it and will wear with a cardigan. Was disappointed though. Material is soft.
3.0,"They are ok but they look more like monster eyeballs then they do donuts. Everybody at my work thought they were monster eyeballs, nobody saw a donut"
3.0,"I think it’s a pretty design, easy and comfortable to wear. However, upon arrival, it seemed to exhibit some construction issues where the beads were overly tight and some were popping “out” and not laying down flat as pictured. I thought it may work itself out, but instead, they started breaking out and leaving gaps. Which once started, it becomes an endless battle to keep it from coming completely undone. In the end I think I got a dud."
3.0,"The shirt looks really nice, and it’s shiny and eye catching. It fits about like I anticipated, however there are some things I don’t like. First of all the buttons are on my left (which is more like a female shirt) instead of on the right. The way the buttons are pressed t line of puckers a little bit which makes it look more feminine too."
3.0,Good quality product but runs very small I ordered a similar pair from a different brand and they fit perfectly but these shorts were at least one to two sizes too small. I’m 5’7 and about 170lbs I would’ve definitely gone for an XL or XXL in these but am usually a large.
3.0,Not as sturdy a shoe as I'd expect from Nike. Support is fair traction very good though.
3.0,This is a nice sandal but it needs to have another opening so the buckle can be tightened. Loss at the top. I have a wide area where the buckle is and it is still to loose. Maybe a shoe shop can add another one.
3.0,"I originally gave these gloves one star because I bought them for my husband due to the Coronavirus pandemic and the gloves seemed very wide at the wrist so I thought they would not provide protection to the wearer.  However, my husband used the gloves today and he said they were not too bad. He said that the wide ness at the wrist made them easier to put on and take off."
3.0,Fits nicely on the legs but a bit big on the front area. Kind of thin but good for the price
3.0,"Already have a hole in one after only a year of gentle and sporadic wear. I have older pairs that have lasted forever, hope this is a fluke! Overall I have always loved the funky vibe and comfy wuality but the newer ones seem very different. Kinda slippery. I think the fiber blend is different."
3.0,Keeping cool in the heat.
3.0,"These sandals were okay for the price, but were much too large for my narrow feet.  I wear a 9 AA.  I thought they would be fine because the straps are elastic, but I was swimming in them.  I'm giving them away."
3.0,Shirt looks nice and quality is good but sizes are not accurate. Got an XL and it really should be a medium or maybe a large
3.0,Pretty but too thin and small.<br /> had to return it.
3.0,Cute but material isn’t that stretchy and the item runs small so go up 1 or 2 sizes.
3.0,"These were the most incredibly functional belts that I have ever had! However they are not as ""heavy-duty"" as they first appear.<br />I needed a belt that I could add and remove various attachments upon a regular basis. Was absolutely wonderful until the pin holding the quick release ""clip"" in place broke. Suddenly this belt became absolutely worthless!!!!!<br />First I tried a piece of wire to hold the swivel of the clasp in place. Then I found that I needed to keep replacing with a new piece of wire every few uses. The only thing that has lasted a bit longer is clipping a 16 gauge ""nail"" to size from my pneumatic nail-gun.<br />If the manufacturer could resolve this extremely problematic issue... you would have the ULTIMATE BELTS!"
3.0,Its exactly what is says it is
3.0,"the heart earrings: the glass pieces in the earrings are simply too small to reflect any light, it's almost as though they're painted in. Given the cost, I suppose that this was to be anticipated. 4 stars except as stated below:<br />the multicolored earrings:  I would have given the heart earrings four stars except that this system is not letting me review the two pair separately. The multicolored earrings are a complete waste of money in the sense that there is no color in the little teeny tiny microscopic-sized dots in the earrings; I'd give these 1 star because well I can still wear them it's just why do so if you cannot see their very purpose which is the multicolors?"
3.0,"Materiala a bit thin, but I guess its because of the price. Cute on first wearing."
3.0,"I am 5'4&#34;, 190lb and wear a size xl/16. I ordered a XL but its too small.  Looks more like a L or M. Quality of the dress looks pretty good however.... nice fabric and stitching."
3.0,These were a gift for my grandson and he loves them. Only complaint I have is it's a little tough changing the lenses but over all they a ok for the money.
3.0,The gloves fit well but the mitten part is extra long for someone with small hands
3.0,They were a little big but I cant really find the size I ordered originally.
3.0,"What do I say,other than it's just fine."
3.0,its ok looks better in the pic
3.0,They could have done a lot better with the fabric choice. It feels very cheap and thin. Not see thru though. Fits fine.
3.0,Material is too ruff. I need soft cotton.
3.0,"Fit my oldest too small, and my youngest too big"
3.0,I really liked the mask but the sliders fell off both earloops on both of my masks and neither are usable.  I am looking at buying new masks and its only been a little over month.  To be honest I haven't asked the company to replace.  I did try putting the sliders back on but not able to do so.
3.0,My kid loves this watch. I gave it 3 stars because he’s only had the watch 5 days and the band has changed colors. Don’t order the white one.
3.0,"It looks nice on the outside. The inside feels like it’s made out of papery plastic (easy to rip). My biggest issue is that it smells TERRIBLE. I’ve let it air out for two days already and it’s still bad. I’ll probably return it if the smell doesn’t go away, it’s embarrassing."
3.0,the bottom tie part is really snug and not adjustable!
3.0,Scratched upon arrival. It's a decent gift but husband has yet to wear it.
3.0,Small than exapected
3.0,The fit is strange.  It's wide but short.  My son still liked it though.
3.0,Super chiquito
3.0,It’s a no for me. Not good quality at all.
3.0,The lace is beautiful.  It is somewhat on the small size.  It could be just a little longer in the front and back and this would allow for a larger piece of elastic which would not be as uncomfortable.
3.0,A bit of a struggle. But once you get it to turn and twist it fits in place. Comfortable. ..
3.0,The rubber bands that hold these onto your fingers start to hurt after a shot time.  My daughter and her friends play with these during sleep overs.
3.0,"Sexy but flamsy. I wore it, enjoyed it, had fun, looked super sexy, but after 3 times it fell apart."
3.0,"Shorter than the size chart indicates, mine at least. Ordered this in the daisy print, which I love, but this dress in a 3x only measured out to 41"" long, I checked because it seemed oddly short. I'm 5'8"", it's too short for me. Great fabric and print, very sad about the length."
3.0,Nice shirt!  Runs big.  Gaps under the arms.  Will have to put a t-shirt under it.
3.0,The balls come unscrewed very often. I dont use them anymore bc I was afraid they woukd fall out
3.0,Takes forever to get here and it’s not what I expected. Very cheaply made and the graphic is disappointing
3.0,Very nice pendant. But awfully small. The measurement that the give is not correct nor is the depiction photo they post. It's very small. But it is nice.
3.0,It’s super large and fake looking. Looks more like costume jewelry.
3.0,Its not silky as shown in the picture.
3.0,"This is a beautifully  designed rash guard jacket and is  very sharp looking.  I know that rash guards are meant to fit close to the body which I don't particularly care for so I ordered the 18 petite.  First off, there is nothing petite about this jacket.  The sleeves are long and the body length is not only slim but long as well.  The 18 petite would fit a gal that was tall & slim and wore about a size 10.  My specs are 178 lbs, 5'8"".  I had to tug at the bottom to get the sides to meet so I could get it zipped up.  If the company can readjust their sizing, this is a great little jacket with nice details with the covered zipper and thumb holes  to keep the sleeves  in place."
3.0,"These house slippers are fine if you just want to wear them for a few minutes a day but if you want to wear them as actual house shoes, look around some more as they stretch out and get very big with wear."
3.0,"Very cute, but very cheaply made.  Broke the first night I wore it.  I still will give it three stars because it's so inexpensive I really didn't expect it to last.  Also, if you're a larger framed person you will need help getting it on, because it is SNUG."
3.0,"Nice glasses, still get glare from the sun even do they are &#34;polarized&#34;. They fit me but they are small.....got the black color model that by their description video supposedly had the highest protection.....yeah, nope."
3.0,"Had to return. Although I’m tall, generally the  sleeves are too short, which is ironic because the sleeves have holes for thumbs. The torso part is definitely not fitted as the picture represents."
3.0,"The only thing I'm unhappy about is that the watchband material seems too lightweight.  The watch slides into a position making it difficult to see.  To fix it, I'd have to tighten it too much for comfort."
3.0,"These capri's are pretty, HOWEVER..THEY RUN VERY SMALL! The seller refunded my money & told me to donate them to charity, which I will.  Save yourself the anguish & order them larger."
3.0,"This top is cute but the craftsmanship could be better. Literally out of the package- one of the gold adornments on the collar just feel off. I put it back on, but that was annoying.<br /><br />The belt makes no sense and is unusable because the punctures and the peg are on the same side- how does that work? Let me know if missing something here.<br /><br />I'll post more pictures when I actually get to wear the top, but so far I'm not terribly impressed. It does fit okay though, so that's a definite plus."
3.0,Screen light does not allow you to read the screen in the dark.
3.0,"The Women Crotchless G-String Briefs Thong Lingerie Knickers Underwear have a lot of descriptive words in the title that doesn't accurately describe the product. While I knew what I was getting via the pictures and product description, I feel like the title is misleading. For one, these are briefs, not a thong. For two, they are not crotchless. If you're expecting crotchless panties (as I was) these are probably not a good fit for you.<br /><br />On to the actual product. The panties are super cute but have a tendency to ride up. I like them to sit like boyshorts and have to readjust them every few minutes. They are a bit too short and ride down over my butt when they sit the proper way and show off my buttcrack. The tiny bow on the front comes untied easily and is not secured, I fixed this with a little glue but was shocked at first when I took them out of the dryer to find the bow untied. My final complaint is that they cannot be worn comfortably under pants, but show panty lines under a dress.<br /><br />I wear these panties as lingerie. They are cute and the strings on the side are secured well. Despite having to tug them down every now and again, I love the way the look, the way they fit, and the way they feel when I run my hands down them. I like that when I tighten up my abdominal muscles, there is a gap created. These are a one size fits all, so they may fit you differently."
3.0,Look good and worth the price unfortunately they was too small.
3.0,"Went to Vegas for my anniversary and it arrived on time . Did my full face of makeup went to put on top and pants , and the leggings had a hole disappointing right ? Well I made it work super cute other then that I order a Small"
3.0,I love how these subglasses look but they feel like they can break at any moment.  You get what you pay for so I truly consider these disposable.  I'm leaving them in my car as a back up pair.  These frames are also very wide so if you have a smaller face you might want to reconsider.
3.0,"Shorts are okay looking, neutral and narrow. They come with left & right zipper hip pockets, a waist drawstring and an inner lining. Ultimately these Running shorts are flimsy, that is often the nature of these, but I’m thinking these are not going to hold together for long.  Although flimsy, they seen to be made for adequate moisture wicking during excercise, surprising don’t ride up much while running,  they are also comfortable to the touch. Sizing: You definitely want to order at least a size larger."
3.0,".....this sweater was too small for me but the size was posted and I knew I was taking a chance. I thought the fabric might be stretchy since it's a sweater and I might be able to wear it but it did not stretch. The fabric is very strange and itchy or scratchy.... it may have some wool in it not noted on the description and, since I'm allergic to wool, that may account for the irritating fabric. ?"
3.0,The suit is very cute but runs very small! Size up.
3.0,Loved this!  Was exactly as described and just as pretty as the picture.. bbuuuuuttt it ripped in the first wash : ( I was so sad! Might buy another one and hand wash it only so I can wear it a few more times.
3.0,"These are cute and very lightweight.  Would have given 5 starts, but the seam ripped and I had to sew.  They weren't expensive so I wasn't expecting much.  Overall, good quality for price paid."
3.0,I didn’t like the lettering on the front that said “originally made in Korea” it cheapened the look of the billfold
3.0,"Soft fabric. I usually order a large so it's not tight. This is not a &#34;flowy&#34; as I would like, but still pretty comfortable."
3.0,"Upon opening the package, I saw that the case was cracked. The case was wrapped in an impossible amount of tape which made it difficult to open. The included tool is pretty cheaply made and bends very easily."
3.0,I bought one size bigger than what I normally wear. It still wouldn't fit around my shoulder area. Not meant for wide shoulders.
3.0,Rose gold isnt what i thought. I thought they were gold. They come apart easily.
3.0,I knocked these down to three stars because the bands are nearly impossible to get off once on!
3.0,"I love the look of these earrings but, unfortunately, I can’t wear them because the post is too wide and does not fit through my ears."
3.0,It's a very beautiful dress dress but I'm 5'5&#34; and it was up to my ankles. I wish it was long and touched the ground
3.0,These “pink” plugs are definitely not pink lol but I got these in 1g to make my transition from 2g to 0g less agonizing so I’m pleased. If you’re lookin for pink tho I would not recommend.
3.0,Product is too big for what I expected.<br /><br />If you want to buy it just remember to order one size down of what you actually need.
3.0,Smaller than I wanted unfortunately but thankfully I don't need them anymore.
3.0,Very hard to put in. I have still not masterd the trick. They have to much of a bend for my ear. I'm trying to put it in the upper cartilage piercing. The colors are great though. Just as pictured.
3.0,The material was not stretchy enough. I bought a medium and I had to order a different one in large and it still felt like a medium. But I like the material and the design.
3.0,"I wanted to love these because they fit like a glove, are super flattering, and the color was beautiful. However these are absolutely not squat proof. When bending over in front of the mirror to check, you could clearly see my whole butt-crack. I can only speak for the sky blue color, but I'm assuming they're all made of the same material. They could be okay for lounging, but I really wanted these for the gym. Returned :("
3.0,Nice looking but runs small.
3.0,"This product is very nice I will admit, Mine came very nicely packaged, and I was able to wear it immediately without breakage of the chain. But do be aware that when wearing this piece know that it does turn colors because its Faux. (not real gold) but I do really enjoy this product and I do get a lot of compliments. And yes it did take me a while to get it. Dont really understand amazon and its FOREVER shipping policy."
3.0,"I love the pants, I just wish they said they were cropped in the description and/or title. I'm only 5'4&#34; and these are definitely cropped.  I ordered them with the intention to wear them this winter but I think they're more a spring/summer jean.  The picture makes it seem that when rolled they're at the ankle but mine were much shorter. They are super soft, but very stretchy.  I could've actually sized down though when I got them the waist seemed tiny.  I plan to order more from this brand, but hope the descriptions will match what I get."
3.0,was a little tight in the waist despite ordering according to the size chart.
3.0,Seems like fine quality but comes very small . Order at least two sizes larger than you think
3.0,"It's a very pretty piece of jewelry, although it came apart when I first wore it."
3.0,They shrunk 2 sizes when they were washed and dried.
3.0,Did not know it was on a stretchy string band. That will break easily if you take it off and put it On enough. It was too tight for my wrist and there is no adjustment because it is a one size stretch band
3.0,"For the price of these gloves, I would not expect the sleeve/wrist to readily tear when putting the glove on. Would not buy again."
3.0,"This bag has a really cute design and was perfect for making my friend a bridal emergency kit. However, the zipper is so flimsy. When it arrived, it wouldn’t zip until a moved some of the prongs (they are oddly soft metal) and every few zips it gets stuck again. Not great quality."
3.0,Cute set but even with the amended sizing the top is probably a ladies medium and the bottoms are about a girls 16 so I was unable to wear them and gave the bottoms to my niece.
3.0,"I'm 36-38 C ordered XL. You gotta be kidding me! It measures 26"". Stretched out as far as you can it might make it to 32"" rethink your sizing. Looks like it's well made so I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"The charm is very thin and easily bendable, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Liked the top but the material is strange. It feels rough sort of scratchy on the outside and it is very, very thin, almost see through."
3.0,bigger than advertised.
3.0,"Nice color selection for the price, like the clasps, just too short for my liking.  Was hoping for a longer length with the clip pushed all the way to the end.  I'm an adult but only 5'1"" tall."
3.0,The mask came with a few dents and it is not the same blue as the image it came with a turquoise color.
3.0,"I can tell they are high quality, but they just didn't feel comfortable for me.  I ended up selling them on craigslist and buying a new pair of Bontrager Solstice shoes and they fit so much more snug and comfy.  I think the problem with these was that they were just too roomy in certain places to work well as a bike shoe."
3.0,"I wear a true size 8 shoe but these are closer to a size 7 or 7 1/2. I put them next to my size 8 Crocs and they are at least a half inch shorter. In spite of this I can still wear them--I really like the footbed which feels almost like walking barefoot only with arch support. After break in they should be wearable all day. Also, only one of the two pairs is one piece construction. The other one must be an older version as it has the cut out toe post instead. I would have given them four stars except for the sizing issue."
3.0,"The pants are fairly cute; however, the fabric is horribly scratchy and not at all soft or comfortable. I ordered a whole size down and the waistband is still really loose and puting my phone in the pocket makes them almost fall off. The elastic around the ankle is really tight and not very comfortable. They do look cute and all the pockets are functional so that is a plus."
3.0,I usually wear 4 and small size was too big.
3.0,Nice watch but was too small.
3.0,The product came in 3 sizes to small both times that we ordered. The product it’s self looks of good material.
3.0,"Now, I used these sleeves for active outdoor activities like gardening and hiking, so the pulls in the fabric are certainly my fault. But something to consider if you will be wearing sleeves regularly.<br /><br />I also question the actual UV protection offered by these lightweight sleeves. My arms tanned even though I was pretty religious about wearing these anytime I went out in short sleeves."
3.0,Beautiful! Just a little large in the bust.
3.0,Skirt feels very cheap and looks really wrinkly.  Am sending back
3.0,Fabulous material and great color.  The waist of the dress was a couple inches higher than my natural waist (I'm 5'3). The dress wasn't able to blouse over like I had hoped.  Returned it.
3.0,"I'm 5'5"" 130lb (typically size 6) and these one-size pants are just too big on me. I feel a little silly wearing them because they are so loose in the legs. I think for someone heavier they would work perfectly. HOWEVER I will say that they are very cute. They are very thin (not see through though) and lightweight, and this makes them the most comfortable and breezy summer pants. It basically feels like you're wearing nothing. I don't think they'll be terribly durable, but I wouldn't wear something like this for yard work or hiking anyway. Because they're so comfy and cute I will probably still wear them, just not in public."
3.0,"They are very long, too long for my belly. I just took mine out for pregnancy."
3.0,I should have got a size 6.  They definitely run small
3.0,the backpack is smaller than we think supplier must show the product with a person wear it to figure out size
3.0,"It's very attractive and well made, particularly the turquoise and bead breaks between the rosewood beads. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's too tight and doesn't flow well through the hands when meditating, which is why I purchased it. Best for draping around a statue's neck."
3.0,"PROS: I was so excited for this mask. The glow in the dark aspect works very well. I also love how the mask fits against my face, very comfortable. Easy to adjust ear loops. CONS: During the first time wearing it I realized that part of the design was peeling off. Very frustrating. Had to buy some fabric glue just to fix this, had to glue pieces from both sides. Hopefully no part of the design peels and falls off while I’m wearing it before I can catch it."
3.0,"Looking nice, glasses are nice, but have to be extra carefull"
3.0,Not a l9t 9f space for your hair.
3.0,Update:<br />I washed them and they still stain the sheets.<br /><br />Original:<br />It fits me very well and looks fantastic but it stained my sheets after a few nights of sleep. I was able to get most of the stain out but I haven’t tried them again since washing the pajama in cold water. Hopefully that will get the excess dye out and solve the problem. If I try sleeping with them again I will update the review to let others know if this fixes the problem. But I definitely recommend washing them first in cold water before wearing. Beautiful and comfortable pajama set if you want to take the risk.
3.0,"I really love the color of this chemise. I got the navy blue. The material is soft and silky and the item didn't shrink in the wash or dryer. It does have a chemical smell that dissipated after the first wash but the creases created when the garment was packaged were still visible. It didn't look as if it had been washed at all. After two washings, some creases are still visible. So I took a star off for that. I am 5'5&#34;/135lbs/34E bust and the fit was very good."
3.0,These run small. Wish I had gotten a bigger size.
3.0,This was a little bigger than others and the material is kinda hot compared to others I've used.
3.0,cute and heavy pendant but chain tarnished noticeably within a week
3.0,"After a few washes they kind of wear out. They're very good at compression, but I wish they would be just slightly shorter because I have to fold the tops down so it doesn't rest on a weird place on my knee."
3.0,I really like this material and the style of the shirt however I really don't like my belly hanging out as I need to lose 5-10 lb LOL. The material should have been extended a little bit for more coverage of the torso in my opinion
3.0,I bought these earrings and thought it was the cutest for my now 21 month old daughter until I realized the the earrings was cutting through her skin and when I tried to get it out it was stuck and my daughters ears started swelling up and she would not let me touch it. I iced it and finally after several attempts managed to get it out. Just wanted to let buyers know to be ware cause this may not be the right earrings for toddlers
3.0,This is a super cute dress and I love it! Except after 3 handwashes the stitching is falling apart and I'm really disappointed.  So if you want a great dress to wear a few times before it falls apart this is it!
3.0,They look great but way way too big for my daughter. She's a 5 and the pair of shoes r a 5 but it will be months before she can wear them:( they don't sell smaller :(
3.0,"Cute, but runs small, in my opinion. Material is thick. Doesn't have much stretch."
3.0,Jeans were great but super stretchy.  After a little while you'll find yourself constantly pulling them up. size down 1 size.
3.0,Got a small and it fits huge in the chest! I would return but there isn’t a smaller size. For reference: 36B 5’3”
3.0,"It’s a nice tie, it’s just not a skinny tie, so the description was a bit off."
3.0,"Well the bra fits correctly, for some reason it causes a rash type irritation. Not quite sure why."
3.0,"very cute ring, but the rose gold finish lasted about one month before wearing through to the stainless steel… I’m pretty disappointed"
3.0,"The outfit was way too big, I should’ve ordered one size smaller or two maybe. The material of the shirt was very soft though."
3.0,Not worth it it’s a good deal and decent quality but the bracelet didn’t fit and the keychain was misspelled
3.0,Break too easily
3.0,"WTF, silicon is a semiconductor. Please use spell check for those who are trying to exclude SILICONE from their searches."
3.0,"The laces look great, they are strong, and exactly what you would expect from a Kevlar blend, but the one huge downside is that the come untied often. The very thing that makes these laces so strong also makes them slippery."
3.0,pretty but kind of cheap looking too.
3.0,cute on pix but to sloppy in person
3.0,A little bigger than I would like them to be
3.0,"They were definitely smaller than pictured, but they are cute."
3.0,"This was not at all what I expected- but I dont hate it.  Its a lot thinner and the colors are more tanish/pinkish than expected.  I almost didn't even try it on, I was just going to return it... but once I tried it on I actually liked( not loved) it.  For the price I'm going to keep it."
3.0,I got these earrings in deal. I have wore both poeces though drop is my fav in both. They have good glaze but not the rose gold I was looking for. Overall decent pieces bot great. Quality is okay
3.0,Not as cute on my daughter as I hoped.
3.0,I like these pants BUT the waist band rolls and gets twisted. Other than that they’re good.
3.0,kinda bulky for traveling.
3.0,"The material drapes perfectly, but it is short waisted."
3.0,They fit kind of weird and it's pretty thin material. Not my favorite.
3.0,Bought for grandsons per their request.
3.0,Runs a little big. It is loose on the last whole in the band.
3.0,I like these.  They came in a box which is appreciated.  The size and clip are just like the picture.  I could not tell from the pictures that the discs do not have a truly hammered effect.  I thought they would be more matte and the rest of the earring more shiny.  Rather they have the hammered texture but are still as shiny as the rest of the earring parts.  I was planning to alter them a little anyway so they are still good to me.  Just something to keep in mind if you do not like mixing tones of gold or matte and shiny.
3.0,"Nice too. The shirt was big, but it's very nice. I would recommend getting a smaller size"
3.0,"This dress looks like a hotel bathrobe. Unfortunately, this is not exactly the look that I was after. The neckline is too low and the cut is slightly odd. Very loose at the bust and the heavy tie at the waist pulls down in a strange way. I had hopes of wearing this with leggings for a kimono style, but I don't think it is going to work. If you do want this look and decide to order this, do not size up because it is quite loose."
3.0,This hung a little weird but good fabric.
3.0,Stretches out and design is not as easy to see.
3.0,Great shirt! Unfortunately had to return because the only size offered was xx large. I need the x large
3.0,"These are good quality tanks.  The burnout style is exactly what I was looking for.  The sizing between the 2 colors in the package are very different though.  The white one was on the large and loose side, and the red one was on the almost too tight side.  I prefer my tanks flowy, so I won't get much use out of the red one.  The price was decent, so I'll probably give the red one away."
3.0,"These cat ears were super cute. I bought them for Halloween 2020 because I needed a Covid friendly costume. I wore them throughout a ten hour work day and then for Halloween the next evening. But while they were cute, they didn't last long at all. By the 2nd hour of Halloween, the pink fabric on the ears was falling off, even though I never really touched it. Since I only needed them for 2 days, it was fine, but I dont think I'll be able to use them again in the future. They were comfortable, but kept falling off if I bent over."
3.0,"shorter than expected.  very thick, heavy material, so good for winter tucked into boots since they are very short on me."
3.0,Gifted this to my boyfriend and within a week the elastic ripped.
3.0,"Mine came with a stain on it and the 3xl was way too big, which is the size I usually am."
3.0,Not for me. It looks huge on me
3.0,top is too tight for anyone who doesn't have bird legs.
3.0,"The quality is low, lots of loose threads. The fit is not very flattering on my body type. It is true to size I would say but not for every body type."
3.0,"First ride:<br />Weather: 29 degrees with a 13 degrees wind chill.<br />Fits like it should , feels good , on the ride it was good for the first mile or so but by mile 4 my balls felt like they were in ice box. Would recommend wearing eather  another bace-layer or something Els on a cold morning! Would I buy again only if it were for fall riding!"
3.0,"This necklace is lovely and was exactly what I was hoping for. It doesn't look cheap but it doesn't look expensive either. I wore it for about 6 hours and it didn't break my skin out, so that's a good thing. The claps appear to be solid, so it should hold up for some time. It came inside of a beautiful gift box -- as well as a pink velvet bag, it is so adorable. The double-layered necklace sparkles in the sun and is hard to miss. I so adore.<br /><br />Update: I am really disappointed, my beautiful necklace has broken after the 3rd wear. I simply touched my neck to massage it, and the necklace broke during the process. (Because the necklace broke in less than a week, I reduced the stars from four to three). it's a shame because the necklace is so pretty."
3.0,It didn't start fastened for me
3.0,Nothing special personally but maybe someone else would like it.
3.0,"Probably wear once, fragile. Snags real easy. Get what you pay for."
3.0,"Only problem I have with this one, as compared with the Pandora brand bracelet, is that it's much thinner which really made it too big for me to wear without it falling way over my hand, so I'm trying to fill it up with charms first and see how that works. Clasp was hard to figure out--luckily someone had posted some photos which made it easier--but once I got the idea of it, it really is much better than trying to work a lobster claw clasp. Just saying beware, if you have a small wrist like I do."
3.0,"Initially, I had to make some minor adjustments to get the band to fit properly--and replace a missing screw that holds the latches in place. Once the screw was replaced, I was able to attach successfully and I've used for several weeks without issue. The design is nice--though wear is showing were the band buckle clasps closed. I assume that the print will wear off with time--but at this bargain price, it's well worth a few months wear. I'd buy again--however, if the screw was an issue on the next, I'd return promptly as that's certainly a quality control issue and not a rare occurrence."
3.0,"Too large or the size was wrong, I ordered number 7 and is too big."
3.0,These are just meh.
3.0,"there is a lot of wire holding the plastic beads in place, but also mine was missing some of the pink pearls, they were just glued in and seemed to have come off.  I am now worried about the look of it cause I ordered this for my wedding"
3.0,"Very comfortable - good fit.  I like the spacers, they allow for a great fit.  I have Plantar Fasciitis and the insoles that come with it are not enough support for me, however, there is plenty of room for me to insert any other orthotic (after removing the insole it comes with).  Great for customization.  Very happy."
3.0,is nice but is missing the stones
3.0,Bought this to use as a COVID mask while exercising outdoors. It’s basically a very thin tube of unfinished fabric.
3.0,The shoes were cute and priced right but I had to send them back.  The fit was too short and narrow on my daughters size 2 feet.  They may have fit right if I had gone up one size but I was worried they'd still be too narrow.  Cute girls shoe though!
3.0,Style and material is top notch. Good luck getting your ID out of the ID holder without a crowbar though. I look like an idiot standing outside of bars trying for the 20th time to get my ID out of the wallet until the bouncers take pity on me and let me in.
3.0,cute top but thought it was going to be long enough to wear with leggings and its not  runs small across the shoulder and bust area  if your a busty women i would go up a size  im an 18 and the xxl fit good  giving it a 3 because of the length picture is deceiving
3.0,Ordered a med n it looks like an extra large
3.0,THere are other compression socks that are better- make sure you read the amount of compression- these are only 12-15 mm - others that are tight and provide support for 12 hour shifts are 30-40 mm
3.0,"Ordered for the 4th of July festivities. Sadly, the USA beads are backwards and unable to be fixed. Bracelets got but may be on the smaller side for those with larger wrists. I will eliminate some from the set when I where as I wanted a more adult look as opposed to a teen wanting emojis."
3.0,Dress was very pretty. Looks exactly like the picture. And we loved the how the back of the dress was a little longer and had a slight train (but not to the floor). My Step-Daughter is 9 years. We bought a size 8 and we had to take it in and pin it along the zipper in the back. The outer layer(tulle) of the dress with the embellishments was a lil cheap. But over all a beautiful. And she felt like a million in it! Lol
3.0,"the neckline has a piece of fabric folded and sewn so the pattern is broken up - the photo shows a seamless pattern which would have looked nicer, medium fits as a regular ladies medium and I'm petite so the opening for the tie is perfect"
3.0,Material is thin..
3.0,very nice but too tight on the wife
3.0,"I purchased three of these shirts.  The golf shirts look just as they are pictured.  Definitely not a summer top... recommend wearing in cooler weather.  They also run on the small side! I typically wear a 2XL, but I like my clothing rather loose fitting, so I ordered a 3XL.  (Normally a 3XL is ""swimming"" on me, but surprisingly all three of the golf shirts were still snug in the arms and chest area.) I recommend ordering at least a size larger."
3.0,"The bracelet arrived in great condition, beautiful, but as the days went by, it started to lose shine and turn dark"
3.0,warm but difficult to wear
3.0,Good quality for the price. Recieved wrong size and instead of returning just gave to a friend.
3.0,Headline says it all and now I have 2 prs of goggles laying around.  The goggles themselves seems to be good quality but the don't fit under the helmet and the cost of shipping them back makes it not worth it.
3.0,Kind of small. More for like a younger girl or teenage sized neck
3.0,"This bag is perfectly shaped and works very well for me mostly. This is the second one I have purchased, and the first one lasted years of abuse before the main zipper finally gave out and I ordered this new one. The main zipper has already given out. I’m still giving it three stars simply because the first one was so great. They changed the zippers to metal and I don’t know why, but they aren’t as good now."
3.0,This is a very nice little charm. Emphasize LITTLE. If you have not personally seen these charms before please know that no one of a certain age will know what is being depicted here without magnification. These charms are really very small. I am told it went on the bracelet well with the help of the little tool sold separately.
3.0,Not individually package as an earlier set I bought through Amazon.<br />I got mine fro EastVita.<br />Doesn't make a good party favors when you have 40 loose single-finger lights.
3.0,"I've been measured & fitted as a 40D & decided to order the XXXL just to be safe size-wise. When I tried this bra on, it was a bit tight but not too bad. But, not only is the padding too small, it isn't anchored down in any way so it folded up while I was putting it on & it was a little awkward to try to straighten them out.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to wash & dries nicely in the drier. It's also nice & soft.<br /><br />All in all, while I will use this bra, it will not be a go-to for me."
3.0,It's was just wat to small in the arm and I consider my arms to be Chicken arms
3.0,This is Easy to change out and is durable.
3.0,To big maybe try to trade for smaller one.
3.0,"The fit is like a sweatshirt, kinda boxy, but good on cold weather days"
3.0,There okay
3.0,Decent quality but definitely runs small.<br />Order a size up.
3.0,Love color and pattern.  True to size: just wish material wasn’t too thick.  Prefer a thinner maxi dress for summer wear in Florida.
3.0,"Reading reviews everyone said to get a larger size. This was not correct. It was too big. While it is nice for the money there were a few problems with the stitching, trim tubing not cut short enough. Ended up returning it"
3.0,Good for the price. Comfy fit but do not buy if you are looking for medium to high support.
3.0,like the design.. but I have larger wrist so its a squeeze.
3.0,So when i got this in the mail i was so excited but when i went to put it on the first time it broke... i was very disappointed but lucky for me i use to make jewelry so i dug out my old kits and fixed it but i would not buy this product again because i dont want to have to fix it again other then that it was awesome material and the look of it is gorgeous
3.0,"I knew this one could go either way — with sparkly stuff, it's all about the fabric and the tightness of the weave, the softness of the feel. It's either fine-knit and silky / soft, or it's kind of...crunchy? Well this is the latter. And the crunchy type always look very low-end to me, in addition to not feeling great on the skin. This one is going straight to the donate pile, unfortunately."
3.0,"I do like this bra but I don't love it at all. I believe I ordered a XXL but it wasn't enough to cover my 32DDD breast. My nipple would always come out of the sides when wearing. However, it is very cute and I got married in it. Just tied the back and prayed it would hold up!"
3.0,"Ok yes I was looking for a replacement for the Old Browning Kangaroo boot of years gone by/ close but no cigar! First I have no idea how anyone says these come big! I ordered the 11 EE -- they fit like a normal 11 --- not marked 11ee Marked on label and box as 11W -- when got them before even putting them on I could see they looked narrow compared to other boots I have in the same size! Put them on and sure enough they feel narrow! I am going to give them the 30 day try in hopes that they do in fact stretch! (THIS COST THEM THE FIRST STAR) --NOW they are of exceptional quality or at least look so, But for $300 bucks you would think they would be resole able when they wear out -- NO I don't believe they are...just like everything else now days disposable!!! $300 DISPOSABLE -- (THAT COST THEM THE SECOND STAR) SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE BOOTS OF YESTERYEAR THESE ARE NOT THE ONES! I WILL WEAR THEM AROUND THE HOUSE A WEEK OR SO AND SEE IF THEY START TO STREACH -- WHO KNOWS THEY MAY BECOME FAVORITES! I give everything a chance! This is why I only buy from companies like Amazon, Cabelas or LLBean .... if these boots do not come up to standards expected and advertised back they go!!!! OH PAY NO ATTENTION TO THAT ORDER SMALLER STUFF BECAUSE THAT IS NOT AT ALL THE CASE! I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW  ACCORDINGLY ! PS NOT OUT OF THE BOX COMFORT YOUR GONA HAVE TO BREAK THESE BABYS IN!!!!!"
3.0,"they are smaller than expected and they did shrink a bit in the wash, still wearable but would not consider again"
3.0,Pretty but larger and longer than I anticipated - a little too big for everyday office-wear
3.0,I would order 2 sizes bigger then your regular size
3.0,Nice but cheaply made.
3.0,"Washed, but line dried to prevent any shrinkage.  Like the fleece lining - at least as long as it stays intact."
3.0,"Really pretty. Really poofy. Really sparkly. Comes up a little in the back. A little short. Wear leggings or tights with it. It fit my 11 year old sister and 9 year old sister. Super cute. But it smells. REALLY BADLY. Sprayed it with perfume and left it in a cold room. Nothing. Still smelled really bad. Thankfully no one noticed. (Or at least nobody complained about it.) I'd rate it a 5 if it weren't for that awful smell. Also the shipping was great. It arrives folded neatly in it's own little plastic package that is super easy to open but not easy enough to where it would open during shipping. Also, though packed tightly the folds did not leave any creases that I noticed."
3.0,They are very hot to wear and too large and fall off my face.
3.0,First i have to say these gloves are good just not -20 good. I would have sent them back if i didn not use them because the wear was goin to 11° with a negative wind chill needless my hands were freezing but they do block the wind so thats a plus.  I wear a medium so i decided to size up and get the large they are still tight and no room. Im hoping the will loosen up and and be worth the money i spent on them.
3.0,They are much smaller than I  anticipated  even though they are very cute. I wish the sellers would list the size in their description. I put in my search ethnic earrings which from my experience tend to run large are hang long. I tend to wear my hair long or in an afrocentric style and the smaller earrings don't work with that look.
3.0,"Initially I would be given these pants 5 stars. They fit amazingly, they fabric looks high quality, the color is great, and they are so comfortable. However, I’ve owned these pants for just over 2 months, and probably worn them 10-15 times in that time frame, and the inseam is starting to fray. I only wear them for a few hours at a time, so I haven’t even washed them but once, maybe twice, because they don’t get dirty. So, buyer beware. These are awesome, but when it comes to quality you get what you pay for."
3.0,"It was really cute but when I washed them, the lace bunched and the elastic threads started to show if that makes sense. It didn't hold its shape at all so that was disappointing."
3.0,"Well made and good quality, just to snug , would be better with a pouch design"
3.0,I love the color & fit but the zipper lasted 1 day. I still wear it because I love it!
3.0,"I’m size 6.5. Cute and nice quality knit, but rubber pads placement on the toes is too low. So I don’t get proper grip, sliding a little.  I’m returning."
3.0,"The color is gorgeous. Although a little heavy, a cute shirt . Would recommend getting one size smaller than usual ."
3.0,"The bean is ok, the sound is good, but my biggest issue is the bluetooth, it keeps disconecting, when it pairs if i put my phone screen to sleep to keep listening to Spotify or YouTube, it gets unpaired, and have to redo the pairing several times to actually hear it for longer time"
3.0,"She loves it, but wont be wearing it very long.  Well made and cute,"
3.0,"I’m 5’5 155lbs for reference and I ordered a large. The material feels kind of cheap — it’s really thin, not as soft as I like my tshirts, and the stretch feels kind of stiff if that makes sense. I didn’t want this crop top to be too snug so I ordered a size up and I’m pretty happy with the overall fit. It’s a good length too. I was worried it would be too cropped and show off my midriff area but it comes right to the top of my jeans which is exactly how I like my cropped tees.<br /><br />I probably could’ve ordered a medium in this and still had a comfortable fit."
3.0,It doesn't fit well. I Bought this to my wife and she couldn't wear it.
3.0,The paint peeled off after a month or so.
3.0,"Very nice size crown, easily fits on adult head. Did come broken the center stone on top. I might glue it on, but it looks good without it as well"
3.0,This color was gorgeous & looking at the shirt I was excited until I put it on. Really no stretch and a lot smaller than other shirts that I buy in exact same size. Bottom line size up or you’ll be disappointed.
3.0,The wide end is about 1/32” larger than the actual gauge diameter.
3.0,"As stated in other posts, zipper pull is on the left side and is not a “double” zip, it’s either up or down. It is pretty warm and has a good length, just wish I could adjust the zipper up when sitting down, instead of having to unzip it."
3.0,Quality is excellent and design was perfect. Just way too big. I have ordered this jersey 3x’s now to get the correct size. So disappointed! I keep being sent a youth small which is way too big in stead of the 3 extra small I have ordered twice.
3.0,Tarnished pretty quickly. Remove if you're showering or heading to the pool (which defeats the purpose for me).
3.0,Glasses were a little big for my face.  And why did it just ask how the shoes were to be rated?
3.0,"Overall: My favorite pair of footed pajamas of the three is definitely the Del Rossa pair. They were by far the softest and included a lot of nice touches that the PajamaMania and Forever Lazy pairs did not.<br /><br />Forever Lazy: A year ago, I purchased my first pair of footed pajamas, the Forever Lazy (green), which was nice and warm, but felt like it swallowed me whole because of how wide it was. I liked the idea, though, so I continued to use them. However, it was not the softest material. I actually ended up turning the pajamas inside out because the outside was the softer side, but that made it difficult to use the zippers, and the pull tabs on the zippers were uncomfortable. In addition, they were not very good looking at all, because they are made so wide. So, eventually, I went looking for another pair. Despite all this, I would rank these as number 2 of these three pairs I’ve had.<br /><br />PajamaMania: My first purchase was the PajamaMania pair, because I thought they looked a little tighter than the Forever Lazy and I didn’t use the hood much. (I’m 6’1” and only 150 lbs, so finding a right fit was hard). I ordered a medium, same as my original pair, but found them to be too short for me. Regardless, though, I wasn’t happy with the fabric. It felt quite cheap, and was thin and not every soft. For this reason, it might be good if you don’t want something quite as warm, but I returned it after one day. The softness is the entire point for me. However, I do think that these pair are the best looking of the three, so if you will be wearing these with other people, I’d say that could be a deciding factor. Personally, no way would I be seen in any of these, so that wasn’t a problem. I’d rank these last for me, because I am looking for comfort.<br /><br />Del Rossa: After I returned the PajamaMania ones, I actually ordered a pair from funzee, but they got lost in the mail. I’m okay with that because it caused me to buy the Del Rossa pair. They are exactly what I wanted. Other reviews cite poor construction, but I so far have not had any problems, other than a thread I cut off. However, I think the feet on my pair are on backwards, but I didn’t even notice until 4 days later, so it didn’t really matter because they stretch. What really mattered was the fabric, and this was by far the best: it was extremely soft and warm. This company showed a little wisdom and put the softer side on the inside, which seems like a no brainer that the other two companies overlooked. In addition, the hood has drawstrings and the feet can zip off, two features which just put this pair above and beyond for me. They, like my first pair, are quite wide, but I’ve actually come to appreciate that, so they don’t get bunched up while laying down. Finally, these things shed pills everywhere, so keep some tape nearby. I rank these as the best.<br /><br />Note on Pictures: They are displayed in order of listing on this review."
3.0,They are comfortable glasses and you can see clearly through them.  The band is too thick and causes your ears to push out a bit.
3.0,Looks a little cheap. But it's ok.
3.0,"I was super excited to receive these socks!...until the first wash. The non-slip material is already cracked and peeling off after one wash, and that was before they were dried! I hung them to dry, but still, I think the buzz is all for naught. Thumbs down."
3.0,There slightly better than nothing there okay
3.0,"I ordered a 38-I wear a 38D bra, and the bust area triangles are small! Full figured girls be ready to bear a lot of boobage! Also the bottom part is a little high cut, so my cheeks hang out quite a bit! But it does have a flattering cut. My advise order a little larger than you usually wear. I should have known bathing suits in general run a bit small."
3.0,Shrinks a little. Material is itchy against skin. And the gray is much light the photo onli e
3.0,I thought for some reason this was going to be more like a sweater.  It's more like a tee shirt material.  Still cute and well made!  Just not what I expected.
3.0,"Cute, smaller than expected.  The back fell it and almost lost the earring."
3.0,"This jacket fit in the shoulders and in arm and waist circumference.  But it was too short.  The waist came up above the waist of my pants and the arms were too short.  I am 5'5&#34;.  This may mean I should have ordered a size up, but I decided to return it for another brand."
3.0,"Case is not Army issue and is grey. The earplugs have to be chinese, trash. I'm giving 3 stars cause what I wanred was rhe case. Won't recommend. Ask somebody in the Army, they will get them free for you."
3.0,Early tarnish ... wear it and toss it after a couple week . Would be great for vacarion
3.0,"the material of the fabric is like the fabric of shirts, and it looks like a nightgown, and if you are thick arm you will be tight"
3.0,"Top seemed a little small for the bottom. Built in bra does not seem proportional to size. I purchased a size XL, I wear a US 12 and 34DD. Bottom fits well, but seamed edge rolls/curls up, and again bra does not fit at all. I'm going to remove the bra, I'm pretty sure it will be a nicer fit without it."
3.0,Very Stringy!!! 🙁
3.0,I bought these to workout in. I liked them because of the T back design but they are not very flattering on me. I use them to workout so who cares right?  They are OK I guess. I bought them in a Medium.
3.0,"When I saw this shirt, I really liked it, so when I saw it was being offered at a discount to review, I was excited to try it.  I received quickly and was so happy to see the light blue color was exactly as pictured.  It fit great until I got to the third button from the top, the one you button to cover your bra.  When I buttoned that, it really made my chest look misshaped and odd, like the button was in the wrong spot. It did not look right.  Everything else about the shirt was great, the fabric, the quality, I loved it.  But the way it was sewn in that area, you would have to have absolutely no chest, I'm not even very big, I have a small chest and it still wouldn't button right.  I may see if I can get it fixed, then I can wear it, because it is beautiful except for that bit."
3.0,There is a little indentation of the words and symbols so it is still looks ok. Def stainless steel too. Think it’s totally ok for $12!
3.0,"The sailor hats are so small they look more like beenies on your head. Couldn’t wear it with our Halloween costumes. The captain hat is much better, but also not great quality. Would have given 1 star for the sailor hats, but the captain hat is good so gave 3."
3.0,"Looks great but the fit is off, there is also little chunks of metal that make it look damaged"
3.0,Socks shrunk when they were washed.
3.0,"Not sure where the fault lies, as I ordered the XXL for my Sister who is big. Measurements seemed to be right on the page description or in the pictures but we received a SM-MEDIUM. I will note that the bag was not properly marked in sizing, and there is NO NECK Sewn in Tag for the Amazon Workers to See to Pull the correct size. SO who here made the error. CHINA...As no SIZING TAG being visible. I am sad I have to return this as this is SO SO CUTE. My Sister that did get to See it absolutely fell in love with this as she is a big cat person. I Love the Fabric and seems to be well sewn. I am a Seamstress and check the seams. SAD it was the wrong size. NOTE TO CHINA MANUFACTURERS: If you want us here in AMERICA to be Happy with your Products then for our sake  RE-Make your patterns to FIT US...."
3.0,Plastic backs did not stay on.
3.0,"It runs small,  short in the toros, thong is crap,was more like a shirt that being said still sexy and cheap"
3.0,Es demasiado grande.
3.0,"Pretty pointelle knit, lightweight and looks a little fancy due to the slight puff sleeve and open knit. After washing and fabric softener the knit still isn't quite as soft as I'd like, not rough or irritating in any way, just thought it would be softer."
3.0,"Good-looking glasses, huge coverage (too much for my face and prescription glasses).  My Cocoons are over glasses, and they are much more compact than these."
3.0,Runs small!! Go a size up for a fitted fit and 2 sizes up for a looser fit!
3.0,"My kid so wanted to love these, but they ended up being huge.  So, design is great, but they just don’t work."
3.0,Nice but not great  Quality  hinge broke after a few days  of normal use
3.0,The neck was much too wide.
3.0,The actual product is much lighter in color like a light blue. Not bright as one shown! Hope wife likes it? Quality looks good tho.
3.0,"The material is seriously stiff! I specifically bought it because it was linen and I needed some linen dresses for my skin, but this dress is so stiff and itchy it totally defeated the purpose. I washed & dried it hoping that would help, but no luck! Otherwise it looks just like the picture & to be of decent quality."
3.0,Looks great but not sturdy enough for me
3.0,"IT'S DONE ME WONDERS AFTER 3 KIDS👶👶👶 NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE IM ALREADY NATURALLY CURVY BUT THIS CINCHER ENHANCES YOUR CINCHED WAIST LOOK. I DON'T NEED IT FOR WAIST TRAINING, AS I STATED BEFORE THAT I HAD 3 KIDS AND I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO BOND MY AB MUSCULES TOGETHER (THIS IS ALSO USEFUL FOR POST-PARTUM BINDING BTW) THE ONLY ISSUE IS IT'S SIZE IS NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE CHART. IT IS A BIT SMALLER THAN THE ACTUAL SIZE IT GOES BY. I RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE AND CINCHED IN, THEN I SUGGEST YOU GO UP A SIZE. ALSO (LITTLE CONFESSION) I HAVE MOMMY STRETCH MARKS WHICH IRRATATED MY STOMACH AND MADE ME ITCH, SO THE FRICTION AGAINST MY STRETCH MARKS AND THE FABRIC IN THE INNER PART OF THIS WAIST TRAINER DOES NOT DO ME JUSTICE. I SUGGEST MOTHERS APPLY A FIRMING, SLIMMING, OR REGULAR BODY CREAM TO YOUR TUMMY AND SARAN WRAP IT FIRST THEN APPLY THIS WAIST TRAINER FOR THE BEST AND LESS IRRITABLE RESULTS AND BE THE QUEENS THAT YOU ARE!👸 STAY BEAUTIFUL💋<br /><br />ALSO FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM @angeliquepagan"
3.0,"These PJs are perfect, but run a little on the large side.  I ordered a Large for a friend (who's around 5' 9"" and 160 lbs), and it fit him like an XL/XXL.  The arms, feet and upper chest area were especially baggy.  I haven't purchased a Medium yet, but I assume it may fit him better."
3.0,"Fast shipping. The quality is nice and as far as the design, it was accurate and looks cool in person. I got a 3T. The top fits perfectly and as expected. But the shorts fit really weird. The waste is an accurate size, the the shorts them selves are really long and saggy. I wasn’t expecting that. My son is in the 97 percentile for his height, and he’d fit him almost as pants. For hat reason, I personally won’t put them in him."
3.0,A. Little to high on my breast  but ok
3.0,The pants are pretty decent. I hoped they'd be a little bigger but the were cut regular. I liked the pockets.
3.0,Very classy.  Order a size up than what you wear.  Material is form fitting.  Had to return but will def reorder.
3.0,So when I open my package it was awesome. Love the shirt and pants. Pants fit great. The blouse around the head was a wee bit small but maybe my kids gas a big head. The fabric isn't stretchy which is helpful for most kids. She said wear the set once. It the shirt shrunk and does t go over her head. Other then that I do like this set.
3.0,This is very small and barely fits my septum. It's cute and is better for a workplace but it is small and there is no clasp to close it so you have to bend it to open it enough to get it through your nose. If you look you can see a small gap.
3.0,I wish they left the gold out it looks very cheesy
3.0,I usually wear an xl..wishing I got an xxl.
3.0,I bought 2 packages of 4-citrine-pack. 4 out of 8 stones were white. Citrine is supposed to be yellow.
3.0,"There's nothing really wrong with it, but the dial isn't illuminated."
3.0,Nice shirt just runs small in a large.
3.0,"Chain was nice and solid, but the links were not sealed.  Looks like you can just pull them apart."
3.0,"Nice dress, but didn’t work with any of my bras and I didn’t want to buy a strapless just for this."
3.0,"I ordered this shirt for my granddaughter who is very picky, but she loved this shirt. The item arrived on time and it was neatly packed. Unfortunately it runs a little on the small size and I should have ordered one size larger. Otherwise great shirt for the price. Nice material! I would order again from this company."
3.0,"My daughter loves them, but I'm not very impressed with the quality for the price paid. We'll see how long they hold up."
3.0,"This dress was a miss for me. The fabric was very thin, and the fit was a little off. I returned it."
3.0,"I got the pink in a XXL because I wanted over size, well it’s not over size but fits nice, it’s not lined so it’s good for a cool day or night, very light weight, the color is just like the picture Pink, I was happy about that, it is soft and fluffy, I have not washed it yet as I just got it yesterday, it arrived on the date it said it would so no time at all, I’m happy with it and would recommend!"
3.0,I liked the fit just the word mom was really small could hardly see it.
3.0,"Meh. These were advertised as being &#34;boxers for women that prevent chafing.&#34; Since they're not clingy like Spanx, they ride up... So the chafing problem is still there. I gave them a few stars because they come in cute colors."
3.0,Platform part is too high
3.0,"You need to stretch the socks as much as you can.  They fill better when you wear them as many times as possible with out washing them?  Amazon sells a black sock Yamador(spelling questionable).  These are over the knee but this is not noticeable in the wearing.  They are very comfortable, priced well and do a good job for folks with big feet and calfs!  Let me finish with 2 observations:  1. I have order 5 different socks and only  1fit nicely & 1 so-so;  2.  The sock plastic put on sock cuff with rope handles is great for putting on compression socks.  I also after many years have come to understand the Chinese know nothing about 2XL/3XL!"
3.0,"The material is great and the fit was okay; however, it was not long enough. I was expected the pants to reach my heels as in the photo but it reached my ankles."
3.0,"Nice, but thick and heavy. But I'm not aware of other glass lenses for this price. Smith techlites are at least twice as much, maybe. Seems like a good solid company though. They make replacement lenses for many other brands i think."
3.0,"This top runs really large and could almost be a dress. I ordered my typical size medium, it’s not very flattering but the leopard print scrunchie that came with it is adorable"
3.0,"Thinnest material ever, the different colors are actually different pieces of fabric connected with seams. The material is comfortable, but also VERY thin (see through in the sunlight). It is very cheaply made, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Good fitting just as expected
3.0,Thin see through material. A cami underneath will do the trick. I like the style of the shirt and how it fits.
3.0,Good comfortable material but wrong color Sent and came late!!
3.0,"I spent 5 dollars for a dress, that is what I got.  The only issue is how the neck fits.  I have a large neck and it fits very snug- I can’t wear it.  It is very thin.  I would wear it as a top."
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because it snags on everything.  A lot of rough edges.
3.0,"While the watch is attractive, it has limitations that I assumed would be on it!  There wasn't an instructional guide with it!  I guess the price is indicative of its limitations!"
3.0,"It looks cheaply made, I hope I’m wrong. The clasp and locking mechanism are rather loose as well. I’m going to give it a day or so and see what happens. Fingers crossed 🤞 my husband bought me a similar one for Christmas a few years back, I broke it, unable to fix it or locate one like it. This is the closest I’ve found so far."
3.0,"I bought this for my husband when we found out we were expecting and our newborn wore it home from the hospital. The fabric construction and snaps seem totally fine, but I noticed the printing separates if it is stretched at all (it is not too small on our baby, he has plenty of room to grow into it). I've worked in and done screen printing and know this shouldn't happen and is usually a result of low quality inks. I use very gentle laundry detergent and don't think that would be the reason. Overall, I love the design but wouldn't have spent $15 on it after seeing what happened after just one or two washes."
3.0,It looks okay but it is very delicate. Cannot wear it everyday.
3.0,I really loved this product the brooch is beautiful but the neck tire portion is too small even when it's move to the longest setting is very tight on the neck.
3.0,The earrings were cute but not did dangle long enough pass by earlobe.
3.0,"It is not elegant, neither is it pretty, but it is a useful addition to my overweight purse. I thought I needed<br />inserts for 12 cards, but usually one does not. In any case it does its job and I am happy."
3.0,Is nice looking and large but the magnetic closure is not strong enough.
3.0,"Looks red In the picture, but when it arrive it was a almost pink/light orange color. Other than that these shirts are amazing in quality"
3.0,Didn't work for me but it was an easy return...
3.0,My Daughter just turned 12 and is small for her age and the straps were way too short to go over her shoulders and fasten
3.0,Posts are not good. Look cheap.
3.0,Run a bit small for my wrist.
3.0,it was cheap and it is cheap lol
3.0,Literally THE most uncomfortable bra I've ever put on. Can't wear it for more than 30 minutes.
3.0,Neat looking but glasses keep falling off his nose when you put them on cat figure. Nose should be upturned a bit.
3.0,"Description says ""White+grey"" is actually black. Tomato, tomahto ...."
3.0,"These run big...I know a lot of reviews mention it, so wish I had listened...I’ll just use mine for lounging underwear, but if you want them for every day size AT LEAST one size down:)"
3.0,smaller & shorter than picture or size description
3.0,It was what I expected but I didn't like the feel of the wallet.  It felt very cheap and the zipper is of low quality as it sticks when I try to zip it closed.
3.0,"The value of the boots could have been sold a little bit cheaper than what they were, but there still looking amazing."
3.0,It’s a cute top but it runs small. And VERY SEE THROUGH. Not worth the money.
3.0,Top fit fine.bottoms were way to big
3.0,"Definitely not for the fashionistas, but I accidentally washed it twice and it still works. The band, however, did not have such luck. It creased and broke easily. Still makes a good pocket watch, especially for the price."
3.0,"I was hoping this was the jacket I have been looking for.  When it arrived I thought that it would be great for warmth with wind resistance.  Unfortunately, within the first hour of wearing it, the main zipper split open from the bottom.  It is not a double zipper.  After several tries I was able to get it all the way unzipped and zipped up again.  I walked for another hour without another mishap, but now I don't trust it and don't want to keep it only to have more problems later on.  I am usually a size M but ordered L so I could layer.  It is a little loose and I agree with other reviews that the sleeves are long.  I think I could have gone with the M but it is no longer available.  If it weren't for the zipper I would keep it."
3.0,Runs really small.  And I went up a size
3.0,I returned this because it made my wrist sweat more than the silicone factory band.
3.0,"Such a cute cut, but material is sub standard."
3.0,"The beige fur is somewhat rough to touch.  I bought the Royal Blue too, and THAT ONE is to die for..different material"
3.0,Too long and not tight enough. I'm only 4'11&#34;. Return  process  SUCKS!<br />I refuse to pay 6.50 for a shipping label. The order was less  than 15.00! I'm stuck with them.
3.0,Too thin although it did fit well. Returned
3.0,These masks are smaller than the normal mask making them uncomfortable.
3.0,"Runs small, especially if you're a little curvy. The material is not stretchy at all so it's hard to take on/off to use the restroom. Also, the material wrinkles super easily. It's cute for the price, though -- just not the most comfortable or convenient to wear."
3.0,"Very pretty and such a unique fun design. However, when I tried them on for the first time the biggest point at the bottom of the earring has a big crack in it and is threatening to break off of the rest of the earring. They also pinch a little when i try to secure them in with the post. I love them, in theory, but I’m disappointed with the reality."
3.0,"Good quality swimdress. I bought the 24W which is my usual size. I wear a 44D bra and the top is looser in the boobs than I'd prefer but should still be fine to swim in, I probably could've used one size smaller on top but the bottoms fit perfect. 2 pieces are difficult for me cause I'm heavier in the stomach & bottom than top. So if you are the same body type that could be an issue."
3.0,"Too small, and cuts my boobs in half but it is what is.. if it fit right it would be great... but runs small,beware order bigger sizes than usual"
3.0,"The button clasp is very sturdy (I couldn't bend it) and the look of this tie chain is really nice.  I've only worn it once so far, but I did get a lot of compliments on it.  What I do not like is that the chain links are very close together (think of a flat chain) so they are not very flexible.  I would have liked a chain with a bit more movement, but these did what they needed to do and still looked nice.  I would recommend them as a cheap option if you're not picky on what your chain looks like."
3.0,The design was as described but it’s huge and hardly made for a child’s face.
3.0,"Pretty low quality but I guess that’s what you get for the price. I personally did not like that not all the parts of the piercing were detacheable. It makes it harder to put it on (in my opinion). Most of them only the top ‘ball’ came off, others only the bottom."
3.0,"Literally my only complaint is the length of the fasteners. It directly affects the way the strap/fasteners lay. On toddler glasses, the this strap was fine. We had to get my son new frames for his giant head and because we had to size up the frames, the arms of the glasses are made at a different angle, more like adult arms. This ended up making the fasteners on the strap tip forward super far so that they press firmly on the backs of his ears.<br /><br />To remedy this, we flipped the strap upside down when we clipped them on. Looks a little dorky, but his ears aren't getting rubbed raw anymore 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"I'm 5'3, it is too long for me."
3.0,The material is pretty thin so they need to be barrel with what you wear under these. I realize that white isn't the best gym color for shorts but these are very see through.
3.0,I read some reviews said these work well even on a large chest (i am 38 DD) they are very good quality and the stickiness is great but there’s just no adhesive strong enough for DDs hahaha smaller chest probably works perfect though.
3.0,Quality was not the greatest. Nothing stamped on it indicating the quality of gold. Only thing stamped on it was &#34;Turkey&#34;.
3.0,"Very thin material, the seams are surged, and it's not as long as I hoped. But it fit well and served the purpose, so I'm fine with it."
3.0,"These socks for ok and feel ok if you're looking for a athletic dress sock. They most definitely do not feel like a regular athletic sock and most definitely not a work sock. Thank God for vipon, my disappointment only cost me $4 and not full price"
3.0,More mid calf and for smaller persons
3.0,Cute but fits pretty loose on me
3.0,"They are cute, but a little heavy and a little cheaper looking than I had hoped."
3.0,"Wish I had only bought one of these dresses instead of 2...fits really odd...the pockets stick out in a way that I don't like, also not as long as it appears, going to try to stretch the length some."
3.0,Cute but very large keeps sliding down off shoulders
3.0,"The dress seemed well made, but it was sooooooo large. I usually wear a Medium and I ordered a Small knowing it would be flowy. Forget it. Even an extra small wouldn't have worked. Had to return :("
3.0,"I ordered the size I normally wear ( XL ) and they fit like a medium to large. They're pretty and soft other wise, but would order a size up or two for ultimate comfort."
3.0,I got this item today and although the top fit perfectly the bottoms were huge and looked very awkward. I'll be wearing the top with another bottom
3.0,Sizing is inaccurate.
3.0,kind of tight. good quality
3.0,"i used this product for airsoft and shooting, both instances the mag pouches are incorrectly sized. the ""7.62"" size pouches are nice enough for 556 mags. but overall not a worthy repro. keep looking"
3.0,"Got these for my toddler son, but it was difficult to thread through the small holes for shoe laces & the clip and slide tensioner are large for smaller shoes."
3.0,It was order a size too large so I think we should have stuck true to size
3.0,"The Damper I received appears to be an older model than the one in the picture.  The red button is the give away that it is different from what I received.  It seems to fit in my SuperMax PBR Lefty fork.  But, it feels like there is some stiction and the beginning end of the travel.<br /><br />It's also important to note that this does not come with the 2 spring upgrade (or any springs for that matter).  They are not shown in the picture. But, I did not realize they weren't a part of this kit until I got it.  So, if you are replacing an old damper, hold onto those parts."
3.0,"Im 5&#34;3 140ish pounds I got a medium. Idk if its not my size or whats the problem, but everything fits me. Where I seem to be having problems is on the crotch it seems to be tight."
3.0,The item doesn’t fit.. I’m not sure if I can still return it because I’ve had it for while. I’ve been so busy that I forgot to try it on.. I recently tried it on and wished that I sized up.. If you have a large bust size up.
3.0,"The size was larger for my husband who wears size M or S depending upon the brand, but this in size S was big for him so we returned it"
3.0,"I wore this only a handful of times due to having issues with the three magnetic connectors that connect to the apple watch face. The middle, silver, connector at first would loosen and I would have to push it back together. After tightening it twice so that I could change the watchband, the middle silver connector completely popped out and now the band is unusable."
3.0,would like to buy larger sizes
3.0,They are very cute for a PJ party but if you're looking for comfort swipe left. There's no padding what so ever and they are very hot
3.0,"I like the print, and I like that the red is brighter than pictured. However, the stitching is off so I have to roll the sleeves to hide excess hanging thread and the collar looks like it hangs lopsided because of the sewing and print placement. I'll also have to belt it, so it doesn't look matronly. I probably should have sized down and im sure the stitching issue isn't common.  But the material is soooo comfy! I don't have the means to send it back so I'll be making the best of it, there are more pros than cons!"
3.0,fades and shrinks in the wash. I used a gentle cycle and bleach free liquid soap. After the first wash the dress was clearly a faded black and the white is now more like a light gray.
3.0,"Maybe I just have a huge neck, but the rhinestone part didn't go all the way around.  The necklace id's pretty.  It's pretty good quality.  I did notice that satin material totally stuck to it though, so it could snag some clothes.  The hanging down part is cool and looks nice."
3.0,"Ok. First off, this dress is super cute. Great material, loved the pattern and colors. But what?! Lol this is a small. I’m a petite person, but not unusually petite. ( 5ft, 114lb 32-25-38) so I’m not sure if the size tag is wrong or if this dress is meant to run nearly 2-3 sizes larger."
3.0,"I love this dress and get so many compliments when I wear it, but it started to pill after just one wear."
3.0,"Ni e coolers but not that snug on the upper arm, it works for narrow arms and to bulky"
3.0,I loved the shoes but after 2 months both shoes have holes by the ankles. None of my other shoes have ever done this- so it’s not how I run/walk.
3.0,Gloves are nice quality and size was true to size.  The only thing missing was the cushion/gel. I needed something to help with the pressure while riding
3.0,shoes looked good kids loved it but had to sent it back it was to small
3.0,Fabric is nice but the robe is not true to size.  It runs smaller so you will want to go one size up from normal.
3.0,Love these but two came with no clasp
3.0,They are very thin which o don’t mind but they stretch out to much and then won’t stay on my face. I may end up using them as headbands and hair ties.
3.0,Short...not flattering
3.0,THE TOP RHINESTONE WAS MISSING.  I REORDERED THE EARRINGS.
3.0,"It’s…..alright. Incredibly hard to open the clasp, I have to use a pen to get way underneath it and force it open. Definitely not as bright or colorful as the picture looks. Not sure about quality yet as far as if it’ll last very long or rust or anything. So, for now I say about 2.5-3 stars."
3.0,"Didn't care for the clingy, see through material.  Sent the top back."
3.0,tight af around the breast area please get a good shaper i should of got a 3x  because  of bust area in 2x..cute dress its tight and short. this is a club wear dress
3.0,"This was my 1st purchase of 365 sleepers.  The earrings do not fit through my ear piercings.  They do make, however, great row markers for crochet projects!"
3.0,Did not last in the wash after two months.... Item tore
3.0,"The watches arrived on time and look great.  I would have given 5 stars, however, the reasons I did not is, because the tool they supply which is used to take the links out broke and I stabbed myself. Bleeding all over the place from being poked was not fun.  Finally after getting my own tools from my toolbox, I was able to take the pins out holding the links together.  Upon looking at the pins closely, they looked old and water damaged, kind of decrepit looking.  I purchased 3 of these watches and all the tools broke and I stabbed myself 2 times, Ouch!  Hopefully the watches last."
3.0,I have an average sized 11 year old and I got his normal size. These fit fine in the waist but were too tight through the hips and thighs. He can’t wear them.
3.0,"Beautiful print, great customer service, horrible material. The colors and design are gorgeous - rich and have great detail. Unfortunately, the material feels horribly synthetic. I am not sure what it is made of, but it feels completely unnatural - not even close to silk. There were no care instructions - I know some materials soften up with washing, but I'm afraid to wash this since it does not feel very durable. The customer service is great, but unfortunately the scarf itself leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,More like a size 9 and not stretchy.  Returned.
3.0,These plastic die broke so easily. While trying to screw them on and even after the fact.. hubby lost one after a couple of days and has never lost one before.
3.0,"This was a gift:  &#34;It looked so nice! Until my skin turned green&#34; :(  I don't know if anything was wrong with the necklace per se. She would've given one star or less. Pros: it looks nice. Cons: It turned her skin green. But I'm not there to see what happened. Nothing happened to the necklace... as in, flakes of paint came off (ew). 3 stars."
3.0,For my chest .
3.0,You can get better $10 sunglasses at Target. These are not made well and mine broke after a month.<br /><br />The company has offered a replacement pair so while I’m waiting I’ll up my rating by one star. If they come in and I like them I’ll write an updated review.
3.0,Socks are super cute but fit a tad tight on my foot. I wear a size 8.
3.0,"Had to go back to the donut, not good for my daughters thick hair."
3.0,They hurt my ears. Cute packaging though
3.0,"I wear a size 14-16 and bought a 5X. Still too tight, especially in the chest. Would fit much better for a B or C cup. DD was way too big for this design. Really cute dress otherwise."
3.0,I ordered an XS based off the sizes assigned per the sizing chart. Sizing is definitely offset somewhat. Not sure how they're gauging the sizes... definitely doesnt fit with most instore brands.
3.0,Great except the string in the hood unraveled in the first wash. Had to cut off of other clothes and re-tie.
3.0,"This top looks so cute, but it runs large. I wear an large /extra large and the extra large was too long in the sleeves and overall too big. I think in the correct size it would be great."
3.0,Just dosent fit me well.
3.0,This is very comfortable and fit great but it is all pilly after just 1 wash so that I don’t like.
3.0,"Really cute little dress and my daughter loves it.  The ribbon on the waist is way big and gaps.  It's fixable but who wants to sew on a dress they just bought?! Also,  it came out of the package really,  really wrinkled.  I hope they come out with an iron.  If I know my two year old,  ske will wear this dress every day until it falls apart.  I'm hoping that it will last!"
3.0,"Look nice, and like they would keep hands warm and dry but didn't work for us. My kids' coats have interior cuffs, so the cuffs of the mittens were too long to fit over the jacket cuffs and under the outer layer of the jacket, and also too tight to go over."
3.0,"I've ordered a few Patty Boutik tops before and they always arrive in a zippered plastic sleeve and have at least three tags--the one in the back of the neck with the brand on it, the one in the side seam with fabric content and care instructions, and a loose hanging removable brand tag that indicates it's a new item. This top arrived with zero tags anywhere; they look like they were all removed and the top looks a bit used. I don't know how to wash it and wonder if someone already has. The style was cute, but I want a new top, not one that someone has already chopped the tags out of and worn."
3.0,Really cute but the sizing was wrong<br />It runs small
3.0,Disappointed in material.
3.0,needed more buttons for better positioning
3.0,The mask is great! It is a super fun costume. The only issue is the cloak is an awkward fit. I had to make some adjustments so that the mask strap didn't make my head look funny. But other than that I am happy with it.
3.0,This shirt ran a bit small and unfortunately out daughter was only able to wear it once after I washed it.
3.0,"Nice chain and heart. Center stone looks a little cheap. Gave it to my daughter as an inexpensive gift. She was pleased with it. Overall, it is pretty and looks reasonable considering the price."
3.0,It was to BIG! I felt frumpy in it.
3.0,It's goos product.  I can't complain since it does what it's supposed to do.  Very convenient for travel use.
3.0,Too heavy and not thick enough
3.0,Not flattering what’s so ever. Cheap material and overall just not q flattering top like the pictures
3.0,Like the price and comfortable to wear. The front clasp would be easier to use if it was a little larger or easier to clasp closed.
3.0,Love the fit of this!  I am a Small / Medium and I got the medium size in this product.  But it is very see-through and gauzy.  If you are wanting something to cover up something then this is not for you.  Very thin and very see-through.
3.0,The black dye in the black suit bleeds into the orange & white ruining the suit when wet‼️
3.0,The sweater is cute but I should have sized down two sizes.  This is not something I can wear to work since it is so huge.  Looks okay with skinny jeans and a tight shirt.
3.0,"I love this watch band and I wear it everyday! And since I wear it everyday, its not the most durable. I'm actually getting ready to order a new one. The stripes have started to fade after only a few months, but for the price I don't mind get a replacement."
3.0,"If you're under a size 8, this will probably be okay for you"
3.0,I'm happy to say one size does fit all...I wear a 16 in jeans. Taking off two stars for white elastic on a black tutu. Fun costume element!
3.0,"So I chose these for my son because of the grippies, but they still slip on our hardwood floors"
3.0,"Bought this for my husband seemed like the ideal situation solver for when he cuts his hair, however putting it on made him feel trapped and awkward. Lasted less than give minutes"
3.0,"It looks good, and the material is fine.<br />The issue I had is both of the buttons that hold the chain for the cape came loose.<br />I had to sew them both back on.<br /><br />Other than that size was perfect."
3.0,This band is ok but the small is too big for even small wrist and very stiff and hard
3.0,"nice shoues but runs small, half size up"
3.0,I bought this as a gift for hubby. He looked nice in the pajamas.?Comfortable material but tight in the shoulders.
3.0,Nice but too early to rate quality
3.0,"not true to size, bought a size 7 and it fits like a 8."
3.0,I don't like the fabric.
3.0,"They fit well when  I  first  got them.  But  the more I  washed  them, the smaller  they got.  Not your normal  shrinkage,  but to the point  they now look like shorts for a 10 yr old."
3.0,Something is wrong here. I think perhaps there was a normal magnifying lens that then was curved. Makes me ill when readers don't.
3.0,The smell and directions
3.0,I didnt recieve the outer belt
3.0,"The mesh band is fine as far as comfort goes but it slides off sometimes when I take the watch off. I think it might be because it’s gotten dirty now? The watch itself if fine though. It can be set very precisely if you have your phone or something else to watch at the top of the hour becuse of the separate seconds hand. Also the crown snags my gloves at work sometimes and pulls out, and I have to reset it."
3.0,"very large, hard to get secure fit"
3.0,It was way too small! and I am a thin man.  I gave it to my 14 year old neice.  The quality seemed fine.  Fabric was very thin though.
3.0,The black looks faded and can bother ears sometimes
3.0,"It's absolutely beautiful. But, the sleeves are made to be too tight up top and you cant really move your arms much. And the ""boning"", if you can even call it that, is not very sturdy. It's a dress up item essentially, not really made for all day use or for wearing more than to take pictures."
3.0,"I guess i have a small head but it didn't stay in place. They were well made, lightweight but dont really work for me"
3.0,Materials were as advertised. The buckle slips and doesn't grip very well
3.0,"Really like this shirt, but it is sized waaaay smaller than regular men's sizes.  Bought it for my husband for Christmas, and he looked like Uncle Eddie in a tight shirt with his belly peeking out.  Size up!"
3.0,"I normally wear a 6.5 boots, but this is a little tight and narrow."
3.0,"I bought this as a christmas gift to a friend but  it got lost in transit and i had to contact the seller for refund, they were very nice in the process but liers they promised me a $5 dollar xtra credit for the inconvinience but i didnt got any just the refund of what i paid. As for the product it is well made very well sew. But the fabric its thinner than i expected its like a very light t-shirt."
3.0,"It came apart and I had to put it together!  Also, the lobster claw clasp didn't work.  Otherwise a nice design."
3.0,"My original review was a 5 star. I'm downgrading it to a 3 star, as I've used this purse 3 times and the clasp holding the shoulder strap just snapped off. It's adorable, it's a huge bag (which I love), the color looks faded (which I also love), but come on...breaking on the third use?? Ugh!"
3.0,Very soft material but fits very very tight and the material is very thin. It shows every inch of the top part of your body.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7012949cdef17004ae82b8031e7c1b5e]] NOTHING WRONG WITH 3 STARS!! Don't let that scare you off.  I just happen to have some 4 and 5 star sunglasses that cost A LOT more than these and trust me, these aren't that.  That being said, for the price, these are great glasses.  You get 2 pair! They work great and look okay.  Watch the video for a closer look.  But yes, 3 stars because they are good, average, shades."
3.0,"I was surprised to learn just how hard it was to find a dress appropriate for a wedding. It took hitting store after store to find everything was either too casual or too fancy. Luckily I had come across this dress in my search and had kept it as an available option. Just a few days before I decided this would be the dress I wore to my friend's wedding. While not ideal, it definitely did the job.<br /><br />I first ordered this dress in an XS. Given in most brands I'm a 0 or 2 (I'm 5'7&#34; approx. 125-130), I thought an XS would be perfect. Wrong. It was SO snug up top (I'm not well-endowed in the least), I couldn't even zip the thing up. So, I next ordered a small with only a couple days to spare. Luckily I was able to zip this one up.<br /><br />As for the style itself, it fit a little awkwardly. Like I mentioned it was quite snug in the chest/arm area (even having ordered a size up), while from the empire waist down it was EXTREMELY flowy. Like, almost maternity-like. It would have been nice if it was a little less large from the waist down.<br /><br />Having said that, I did get a lot of compliments on the dress. It was the right length so it was easy to dance in, and it was appropriate for the occasion. I'd recommend this dress if you're in a pinch and need something for a similar occasion."
3.0,"Like it, but don’t love it. I expected it to more on the blue side,  like the picture showed. What I do love is that it does not have the magnet."
3.0,"I love this shirt, but after washing it there are large, weird, circular, oily stains on it."
3.0,"I love the quality of the Geode, but the earring clasp broke within seconds of wearing, the geode was too heavy for it.<br />I went and bought my own earring kit and remade them, and now they are beautiful, I wear them all the time."
3.0,everything fit great. I don't have large arms and the  sleeves were too tight
3.0,not very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
3.0,It looks good but It fits small.
3.0,Nice soft material didnt fit my but too well
3.0,"I wanted it to be a little heavier material so that it would hang like it does in the photo.  It's Linen, and very light - nothing wrong with it but not what I needed.  i am returning.  Thanks"
3.0,"I love the concept of the bathing suit and it fits well (medium) but... I ordered the black which is more sheer and my nips are out of control lol. I put black nipple covers underneath and double sided tape to contain them; but the minute I moved... my lady lumps were trying to escape. I don't know if I want to return it because I still like it... but, I fear I may be quarantined on my cruise for indecent exposure if I wear this in front of other women and small children."
3.0,Transparent from side angles
3.0,This sweater is very tick! I was looking for more of a light sweater that I could wear in 50-60 degree weather. This is not it! This sweater is made for a very cold place. The product description isn't entirely accurate. I think it is pretty heavy on the wool and not as much on the cotton.
3.0,"One size fits most, but not all, not me. I'm 5'4&#34; so it's always been a problem getting a housecoat because they don't come in different sizes."
3.0,"The ring itself is comfortable and fits as expected. I don’t live the brassy good color and the stones don’t glisten like I thought they would. It looks like a cheaper ring, but we will see how long it lasts before the color fades on it."
3.0,"Good for the price, but somewhat small and fits weirdly."
3.0,pretty but very difficult to manage the glass beads on the ends
3.0,4 of the light aren’t working
3.0,"Like it,  big better than to small.  I can at least wear it."
3.0,"This shirt  runs large to personal measurements,  daughter inherited!  Pretty colors."
3.0,4 out of 5 bras fit as expected.  The all black one was 2 sizes too small. Very disappointing.
3.0,They fit fine and make you sweat but they are noisy rubbing together. I wish there was a quieter fabric lining the outside.
3.0,Color is beautiful but....stitches weren’t neat or straight and the ruched side was more wadded than gathered. All in all this blouse was a major disappointment and in all honesty it really doesn’t deserve three stars
3.0,"a bit pricey, but... it is what it is I guess."
3.0,"I expected them to be longer. Took me awhile to get used to them at the back of my neck.<br />Better for kids or athletics.<br />Also, very hard to get them on the arms of my glasses."
3.0,"Cute baby shoe, arrived quicker than expected, nice leather.<br /><br />I am giving these three stars, because my son wore these twice and the stitching has started to come out (my son is not walking yet, only wore them while crawling).  This is the white stitching around the base of the shoe that connects the sole and the upper.  I believe I will be able to repair the loose stitching, but for what I paid for these I expected the craftsmanship to be a little higher quality.<br /><br />They are definitely a wide shoe as well - not for babies with skinny feet!"
3.0,They were a little too small but my husband decided to keep them. We need to make sure they have the size for men in the US shoes size. Not the UK
3.0,Why no pockets at all?
3.0,They are easy to use. However they do not block the sound as well as we had hoped.
3.0,It was squeaky in the hardwood floor
3.0,Barely fit M frame and had to bend them to fit and still fallout sometimes
3.0,"Very cute earrings, but they come flattened in a plastic baggie attached to paper. I had to bend them to get them back into the correct shape. I’m worried that they’ll end up breaking because of the bending and weakening of the attachment point. And I had to make my own holes in the paper to stick the earrings through after I straightened them since I purchased these as a Christmas gift. Not the best presentation for a gift."
3.0,"I ordered a 2 picture print shirt, the one on the back was perfect, but the front image is as dark as the shirt is, the image is not clear at all, I understand that I might have sent a dark image, but the printing was too dark and they should have contacted me to either replace the image or brighten it, but overall I love the material and will wear it nonetheless."
3.0,Really cute on but runs very small. I ordered an XL and they were a little tight. I normally wear a size 4 or 6 in American Eagle jeans.
3.0,Fits smaller than expected and than others in its similar category/style. Buy a size up. Quality is wonderful however. But unable to wear mine as was too small.
3.0,top is pretty but the fit is awkward...the bottom is very baggy but it is tight from the chest and shoulder area. weird fit. planning to return it
3.0,Nice jeans but Ripped the first time I wore them.
3.0,"A bit disappointed that pictures and description show that a stand is included (a niceity for setting it on your desk or night stand) however all you'll receive is the blade itself, this brings down the rating to 3 stars, unfortunately it will just have to lay on your desk or wherever you choose to place it which makes the whole item just seem like a piece of clutter."
3.0,"I tried using this to soften up a cow hide I got from Morocco.  It did not do what I expected it to do.  The hide was SUPER hard on the back to start with, but still.  I was expecting it to relax a little.  It did now.  And I used the entire container."
3.0,"This is actually two reviews as I have two minds about the product as I received it!<br />1. The band, the band I like a lot, it's actually why I give it three stars, it's much better then the rubber\neoprene band that came with the fit2.  It breaths well, and is relatively flexible (it doesn't really stretch, but it does move with you) it exactly like the old timex band from the watch I got in Basic training.  It so far appears strong, and I have not noticed any fraying or defects in the material.<br />2. The adaptor connectors, the things that hold the band to the watch, they suck... I mean really suck, the slightest pressure on the release causing the clasp to release causing my band to open and all from my wrist, if I did not wear  the watch tightly to begin with, I would have lost the unit.  I attempt to sleep with the watch, and it comes of in the course of the night, this did not and still does not happen with the original band... I'm going to attempt to get different\new locks\clasps\adaptors and see if they are better"
3.0,"this is somewhat satisfactory, but the waist on pants is too small. my husband is very trim so that should not have been a problem. we're going to have waist altered as there seems to be enough material to do so."
3.0,"Get it while you can.  Although it might need to be resized due too your height/shortness.  Leather suspenders/braces show off your shrinking/shrunken abdomen, and, you'll be pleased."
3.0,I ordered one size larger because of the reviews and it's sooooo long. And I'm 5'6&#34;. It's a lot longer in the back than it is in the front. Hits below my butt and just looks weird. And the neckline is really low. I'm not really a fan. It might be good as a swimsuit cover up but not as an actual shirt. Ships from Asia so it takes a bit.
3.0,Fit is great. They not as as sheer as I would have liked. I wear knee highs under my casual and dressy slacks.
3.0,The sunglasses were super cute i used them for sunny days!…but the case was smelly and the pas thing took off overall its a kinda bad..
3.0,"Good quality, good price for what it is. Seems smaller than actual Trollbeads. Doesn't look exactly as the photo though, looks more like an EKG pattern compared to the swirly pattern in the photo.  Still a great value and good looks."
3.0,The bag has a beautiful design. Great price. But I was disappointed that it was not thicker material. Very very thin.
3.0,"My 4 year old daughter loved them, saying the inside is so comfortable. However she wore them for 3 hrs outside and the sides are already ripping in the “leather”. They don’t seem as if they will last for long :("
3.0,This was a good dress. The armholes are a little close together though so you can see the imprint. I do like it alot though. Wore it to my wedding reception
3.0,"The colors in the fabric are true to the photos and the dress is beautiful. However, it is made very small. I ordered a 3X and it fit my friend who normally wears a large. I was so disappointed."
3.0,I am usually a small or medium- I wanted these pants to be a little more baggy so I got a medium the medium was too tight only on the butt and thigh.  But just note to get a size up.  Besides that I like them.
3.0,I returned this because it was not rose gold and the contrast was not working.
3.0,"They said this was narrow, but it wasn't.  Great quality though."
3.0,These are a little more clunky than they looked in the picture. They will work though. I am taking them on a trip and don't want to risk losing my good sunglasses.
3.0,"The jeans were pretty, a small flaw on the inner thigh, but waaaay too small. Size chart says 2x is 18-20. I couldn't get these over my hips. I would say they are closer to a 14."
3.0,Used my measurements and dress was to large. I gave to my sister-in-law and it for her perfectly.
3.0,Stones fell out from the beginning. Really cute though and wearing anyway.
3.0,The hat is super cute but very small. The package fit in my mailbox..In an envelope… that should’ve told me all I needed to know. It fit my 3 year old nicely (a little big on her but a much better fit for her then my big ole head I guess).
3.0,One of the leggings ripped right down the butt after ONE time of wearing it. Not even 2 times. One time. The other 2 I got are holding up well... so far. Only time will tell.
3.0,I didn't feel they were really true to size. They are comfortable with socks but not so much alone.
3.0,"Came in as described.<br /><br />Color is same as posted.<br />It folds as intended.<br /><br />But I had to return this as it feels it’s not that sturdy. Frame feels flimsy so I didn’t try wearing them around.<br /><br />Honestly I would have given this a shot and use it but I kinda felt weird with my vision when I tried it at home. Hence, the return.<br /><br />It could just be me and my eyes but I feel that for it’s price it’s worth the try."
3.0,Nice lookin band and quite inexpensive. The reason for the 3 stars is that it does not look anything like pictures. Way slimmer than shown even in review pictures.
3.0,Comfortable<br />But only a 3 star because they aren’t zip off legs as described
3.0,"Good quality construction, plenty of padding without feeling like pillows, thumb is too tight though"
3.0,"While this product does serve its purpose, the adhesive is not as strong as I would have hoped. For the price, however, I was satisfied."
3.0,too big and bulky....found a thinner wallet at resale shop for $5 what a bargain...will donate this one to the resale shop
3.0,It is as photographed. One just has to realize the material is thin on this despite double layered. Not truly understanding the ribbon that comes with. I guess as the photo shows one can tie it on the garment. I most likely will use as a hair tie. Its a roomy piece so don't be afraid of sizing (fits me loose).
3.0,"This will not fit as an ankle bracelet on the average women, it's too small. I will have to wear it a bracelet or see if I can get an extender to wear on my ankle."
3.0,"Perfect for work socks but wanted to keep my feet warm in the winter. The toe seam digs into the toes so I turned them inside out. They are OK as far as soft but cannot feel anything of the wool, the main reason for the purchase."
3.0,Hair was not curly or wavy as advertised. Had a weird smell and tangles easily
3.0,"Pretty dress for the price but sizing is very small, especially the waist area.  I ordered an XL just in case and I'm glad I did. It fits more like a US medium so keep this in mind when ordering. It is a little on the thin side as well. It is very long as pictured."
3.0,"My eight year old son, who is the size of an 11 year old, could not wear them. They were way too big."
3.0,Beautiful colors - too small for me.
3.0,"I bought two of these for Christmas gifts for snowbirds. They were a big hit. Nice size and they really sparkled. Great gift for anyone who loves Florida.<br />UPDATE...I loved this pin so much, I bought myself one. The very first day of wearing it, the clasp broke and I noticed when I got home it was no longer on my coat. I was very upset. I still had the clasp, but no flamingo."
3.0,"The scarf is definitely sheer. Definitely not as long as I thought it would be so, I CANT wear it like the picture shows because it's just too short. I will probably wear it a couple of times, but I will have to find me a different one to wear it how I would like."
3.0,"I bought these for my 6 year old for a beach vacation to protect her feet from hot sand and to calm her fear of crabs pinching her toes. For that, they worked perfectly. She wore them for 2-4 hours each of the 5 days on the beach. The insoles are torn apart already. I’m not happy that these lasted 5 wears- even for the price I expected to get the summer out of them."
3.0,Not crazy about the material- a bit heavy.
3.0,"This is a very nice shawl.  It is a good size for anyone and has very soft material.  However, there was a very bad smell to the package.  I'm pretty sure it will dissipate in a day or so.  If not, I will send it back.  Makes me wonder where it was stored."
3.0,Buttons fell off the first time I wore them but cuff quality is nice
3.0,"Love the cut and feel of the shorts, unfortunately I was sent a color I didn't order"
3.0,"I purchased the Army Green Camo in size 4-6.<br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />Waist across 15.5""<br />Rise 10""<br />Inseam 33.5""<br />Thigh across 10""<br />Leg opening across 8""<br /><br />I typically wear a comfortable size 6 in American Eagle jeans and the size 4-6 in these pants was a pretty good fit. Not tight or biding in the waist or butt, relaxed through the leg. The rise is kind of high and comes up to my belly button. The inseam/length is a few inches too long for my 5'6"" height but there is a tie at the ankle to cinch them in. Loads of functional pockets. Fabric is midweight and feels durable, no stretch. Overall I'm happy with the fit and quality.<br /><br />**Update: cold wash and hot dryer with a small amount of shrinkage. Waist 15” and Inseam 32.75”.<br />Also, the pocket flaps creased and warped during washing and won't lay flat. The press snaps hang on the ends of straps/laces which are too long. Even with the pockets all wrinkled up, they easily reach to snap closed but the pockets are gaping open. Even when the flaps are ironed flat and snapped closed they hang loose and are not securely closed. I can stick my hand in the pocket without having to unsnap them. I believe this is only a problem with the camo colors as the solid colors appear to be a different style. I originally rated these 4 star but dropped a star because of this issue."
3.0,In 5'0 and bought these in a large .they are way to. Big and they dont even fit line cargo pants. Maybe I got the wrong  order of pants but maybe I'll try getting them altered. Very disappointed in these because adar is an awesome brand.
3.0,"Its a pretty shirt, I wear it tucked into a black pencil skirt. I agree with the other reviewer, after I washed it it went from long and wide to short and wide, which was ok with me since I wanted it to shrink a little. I am normally an XL-1X and I ordered the large and it was roomy, after washing it it fits perfectly. Be warned, rayon wrinkles like crazy."
3.0,They fit well but in the picture they look like weathered leather and in person they are not weathered and look like something from payless. Kind of bummed about that but I will where them.
3.0,This dress is cute but not on me.  The material was nice but it just didn't fit right.
3.0,"These sweatshirts are cute and made warm, however the sizing is way off.  I bought a size larger than needed to allow for possible shrinking and I could not move in it.  Sizes are way too small"
3.0,The shorts are longer than the liner and the fit is very wide through the hips and thighs. They wouldn’t accept a return but they did issue a refund so thank you for that!
3.0,"I bought the small and it was too big so I had to return it.  I'm not tiny, I'm am 5'6 and 126 lbs."
3.0,Pretty but very thin material. Pockets are nice.
3.0,"Nice watch, battery runs out a little too quick though"
3.0,Only used the screwed ones but liked them<br />Tho
3.0,Beautiful looking but i didnt realize how thick the sides would be. it looks ridiculous on me.
3.0,My granddaughter loves her watch
3.0,I love my bracelet but it broke very easily so I had to fix all the clasps and that wasn't fun
3.0,It's a really cute shirt and I love wearing it but the fabric is not breathable at ALL. I get really warm wearing it for too long.
3.0,"Bag is green, not softball yellow."
3.0,"The socks are not the quality I expected. They are also not consistent in size. While putting them on you can get tangled up with your toes in the material. I think they are okay, but I would not buy them again. The material feels cheep."
3.0,"My 4 year old daughter is a skinny minnie so I bought her the smallest size. The length is nice (knee length) but it was a bit wide (not fitted) on her waist. Would probably fit nicely on someone of average size. I give it three stars because while my daughter likes it, I find the quality of the Elsa image really horrible. You know how you go to swapmeets and see bootleg merchandise? This is exactly what the image looks like. It's like a copy of a copy and just tacky looking to me. I suppose that's what I get for the price I paid. Next time I'll just stick to official Disney branded merchandise."
3.0,You get what you pay for it didn’t cost a lot and it worth what you pay
3.0,The picture on the mask is blurry so not necessarily the effect you expect.
3.0,Fits just fine but I have large bust so I recommend for us busty girls to go up a size or two 5’1 147lbs. 36DDD
3.0,I love the glasses. However I was only sent ONE pair!!
3.0,This skirt is very strecthy and ran somewhat big. Nice material. Length was perfect for me. I ended up returning.
3.0,"Nice color, fit was a little smaller. What size you typically wear I would order a size up."
3.0,"Great idea, well done for younger girls are 8-10. However, the actual material for the mane is not what is pictured. The material you get is a spandex type material solid color, not rainbow. Cute but definitely not as shown."
3.0,"Upon trying this on I was hopeful, easy on/off, didn't pull on my shoulders like most sports bras do, really like the color red.  After working out in it once I think that it isn't meant for high impact work outs, I was only walking (fast but still) I was definitely moving around more than in my under armour bras.  But still it was ok for weight training, yoga and lower impact work outs until I washed it.  After washing it once the elastic band got very twisted and turned around where I can't un-twist it and it is pretty useless now.  Not only did I waste $20 on a 1 time use bra but I can't even donate it or reuse it.  Gonna keep looking for a new sports bra..."
3.0,The neon green is nice & makes it easy to spot my child on the beach. He's 6 & I ordered the Small. The tag says size 4. It's snug fitting & challenging to pull over his head. I would go up a size.
3.0,"Great price, fast shipping!"
3.0,Cute shirt but the neckline is very awkward and I just knew I wasn't going to feel comfortable if I kept it and had to return
3.0,this thing is tiny. just be aware of that before you purchase. in hindsight i would have gone for a larger watch.
3.0,It ok. Craftsmanship is not the best but it's not the worst either.
3.0,for me they were to big...might work for someone else just not me.  I did like the color though.
3.0,While good for the price...looks can tell!
3.0,Beautiful dress. Perfect fit it was delivered 2 days early which was awesome<br />only problems that I had  was when I opened it to look at the dress before I tried it on I noticed there was this rip here in the sleeve was not too happy about that /:  and the bottom of the dress looked like it had been ripped as well I see yellow strings on the bottom so had to cut them off<br /><br />Other than that. It’s beautiful
3.0,The ba and is smaller than expected.
3.0,Blouse is nice and not too sheer.  I usually wear PM and ordered Large and it fits ok.  I ordered white and it is not true white - more of an off white or ivory.  Quality seems nice - just disappointed with color.
3.0,Pretty. thin fabric..light weight.
3.0,"It's hot and I'm 38 weeks pregnant, so I'm making these shorts work. But I have an athletic build and these do not do anything to hide my cellulite. I'm not an overweight person, but like any normal person I have cellulite on the backs of my upper thighs and these shorts did nothing but enhance that. I have to wear with a longer shirt with them, so I'm making them work. I gave three stars because I think this might show less if I bought a darker color (I bought the light purple and it's beautiful, but I think maybe you can see more with a lighter color). It's great that there are pockets, and like I said they will work for summer, but the fabric isn't thick at all. So if that's what you're going for either size down or pass on the lighter color."
3.0,"It's a dark green not what I really expected. Also it had an awful smell. Hand wash it since it colored the water when I washed it, you dont want to wash it with other clothes."
3.0,"All the photos seemed to show a longer inseam.  Disappointed to see these so short!  The rest of the products seems okay, no stretch, and needs a good ironing!  Came balled up in an envelope.  May keep for just around the house instead of resort wear!"
3.0,"It was not a flattering style on me. If you don't mind looking more broad shouldered than you are though, and you size down, it could be cute on the right person. I have no complaints about the quality for the price."
3.0,Fits nicely but adds a lot of extra weight to my already heavy glasses. The tint is starting to peel as well. Great if your looking for a quick and cheap fix for some shade
3.0,The zipper broke before the first wear.
3.0,"I am 5’2”, 112 pounds and ordered XS and it fit perfectly except was a little long but it’s perfect with wedge sandals.  It is not see through and hangs nicely. The elastic looks a little cheap but I put a belt over it and loved the look.  It’s not often I find XS in Amazon clothing so this was a nice surprise.<br /><br />I am returning it though because the color is not even close to the picture. The orange is the color of a traffic cone and the bottom half is also much brighter than pictured. I do plan to order a different color though."
3.0,Very thin not lined but still cute
3.0,The peplum hem is much higher than shown on the model . It looks like a babydoll top and a pregnancy shirt in one on me.  You will also need to wear a tank top underneath. It will work as a pajama top.
3.0,"I really like this set, but the bra is low cut, and not as supportive as other workout sets I have gotten off of Amazon. I wouldn’t recommend it to workout in if you need more bra support, but it is very flattering."
3.0,Lamentablemente no son fijos y safan con facilidad
3.0,"The cut is cute, but the fabric is thin and clingy like a t-shirt.  The picture implies a more polished product"
3.0,"Image is kinda fake. I ordered purple color and i was little disappointed..the purple color is wayyyy too bright...other than that, it fits perfect"
3.0,"Handle broke after 2 weeks but maybe it was my fault, I put a 5lb laptop in it."
3.0,"NIce and comfortable.... love the size of the face.... It stopped working yesterday(March 28, 2017)... it has not been 2 months since I have it .."
3.0,"This is actually a VERY cool toy. My son and his friends were obsessed with it, but after a few hours of play it stopped making its sounds and the lights were blinking erratically. So I returned it."
3.0,My wife travel a lot so this was the perfect gift for her. Looks to be a quality build.
3.0,Shirt runs way too big. I suggest you size down. Other than that material was great and it’s exactly as pictured.
3.0,Just really cute and soft 💙
3.0,While this watch is very pretty and I love the color it was somewhat difficult to set and the instructions were hard to understand.
3.0,Picture of the color is not correct these are yellow lenses
3.0,this dress was very short
3.0,"A bit snug and uncomfortable, so I sent back. Pretty though."
3.0,Don’t expect greatness but the price/value is pretty good on this bracelet.
3.0,"I’m so bummed about this. It’s ridiculously short, like only comes halfway over my butt short. & I barely have a butt lol. I got a medium. I’m 5’7, thin with big boobs. The top half fit nice, very tight, but it’s supposed to be form fitting. I’m torn between returning it, & cutting it into a shorter tank top, since it’s literally just a long tank too lol."
3.0,"I bought this purse in March, I had been looking for the a purse like this for a long time. When I got it, the smell was pretty bad.  But I loved it until just the other day, I was walking into work and the Strap broke and all the contents of my purse spilled on the sidewalk.  The main reason I bought this was the strap/handles.  I see there are many comments regarding this.  I think you should take it off the market until this issue is resolved."
3.0,"Did not care for once purchased.  Not as sturdy as I had hoped it to be.  Not bad.  May put it to use later, or re-gift it."
3.0,"Much larger than expected, but very pretty and still light enough to wear comfortably for the whole day. I'm happy with them, but do wish they were smaller"
3.0,The color was more of a magenta than a deep purple. Sent it back because that’s not the color I wanted.
3.0,The buckles clamps come undone some times.
3.0,I've always had good luck with Nike sandals. This pair at a size 11 should've fit well. They were rather tight and began to come up. This happened by only using them in the house. Unfortunately it was too late for me to get a refund.
3.0,"It works great when I don't want to carry a purse. But, the zipper doesn't open all the way. So, it's hard to get a card to fit because of where the fabric falls. Other than that, it works."
3.0,I bought the wireless version of these bras. The fit is fine. My only complaint is the material... they are a little stiff. The straps are also a little tight.
3.0,Not flattering on me. Price is right for the quality.
3.0,It's a nice shirt but does not fit like in the picture. The straps go a little funky the cross straps indicate they are the back. I did get confused lol had to check the picture to make sure which side was the back.
3.0,"it comes in a beautiful package, the material is soft and silky and strong, it runs way to small. It came with an extension thing in case it runs small around the back. Never in my 48 years have I had to add an extension to a bra. if it runs small just say so in the description. I'm returning it for the size, the quality is good though. Its a bra for hanging around the house or running errands ."
3.0,"bottom half fit fine, top half was small for a 38 G"
3.0,"This 100% cotton shirt is very itchy, if you are sensitive to wool, etc., this is not the shirt for you.  This is a nice looking shirt that looks as presented."
3.0,The material was not good everything sticks to it the lint even though drying.
3.0,"The frame is very thin,  but they're nice looking"
3.0,cute but a little too big
3.0,Runs way small!
3.0,I absolutely love the color of this purse. I did think it would be a bit larger but that's ok. I love it anyway.
3.0,The shirt is good quality but it fits small.
3.0,"Material is very thin, and opening in front comes up higher than the photos show.  This is not for someone that wants to be covered in the front, rather it's for someone that is comfortable wearing short dresses."
3.0,I have to admit this was my first time ordering tie clasps. They work great. (Hinges and clasps) They were a little smaller than I had anticipated. I tried to buy the largest ones I could find. My husband is happy with them and they do their job. They have a very simple design not to distract from your tie or appearance. Packaging was very nice (box and velvet bag) and they arrived in a timely fashion.
3.0,I like the design. It arrived and was upside down as far as wearing it. It attached fine. It was comfortable. After 7 days of wearing they wore off.
3.0,This size is is more like size 12. I luckily have another younger granddaughter they will eventually fit<br />You need to fix your sizes. My grand daughter was extremely disappointed.
3.0,"We didn’t get one good use out of it, definitely get what you pay for"
3.0,"These are the usual low-quality spandex masks, with a highly curved front contour but no nose wire (so no good for glasses fogging). The ""kids"" size in the 2-pack is absolutely tiny, probably good only for kids less than 8yo or so. The ""adult"" size is more like a large kids' size or an adult small, and didn't stay on my (very average-sized) face very well for long, feeling like it was tugging on my ears the whole time. The masks say ""New York"" in black and orange so they'll work for Mets or Knicks fans, but they don't work very well as masks."
3.0,"Doesn't quick away sweat, as is hoped."
3.0,The fit was small and the skulls are some sort of sticky iron on deal. I have an enormous head though. On a small head it would probably be fine.
3.0,"Wanted to love this, but it was so short and the band around the waist was so tight.  The rest of the jacket fit nice and generous,  but the band was usually small. I usually wear a large and ordered a large.  I could have gone with a medium for the top part."
3.0,I wish I could wear my prescription glasses with them.. I really don't think there worth the price I paid for them
3.0,"beautiful dress, good quality but too short"
3.0,Like all the credit card holders.
3.0,I bought this as a present for my 8 yr old niece. The pendent is heavy. Its beautiful but the chain is too long for a child.  But the pendent fell off the necklace while she was walking around the house.  Not running walking.  The pendent has a poorly designed clasp and it slid right off the chain.  I tried clamping it down more.  She hasnt worn it since shes scared she will lose it.
3.0,It is a bit cheaply constructed and too big for my 6 and 9 year old daughters.
3.0,"I bought this to use as a bathing suit coverup and probably would only ever wear it as such.  The positives: It is a beautiful romper, the colors are vibrant and it looks exactly like the photo. The material does wrinkle easy but is nice and flowy and drapes nicely over problem areas.  I was concerned about it being too short but it covers everything appropriately.  I wanted to love it but it does have a few flaws.  Flaw #1: the fit. I don’t have an exceptionally long torso and I’m only 5’6” but ever time I would lift my arms the romper would ride up in the crotch causing me to constantly pull it back into place with any minor movement.  Not a deal breaker, just annoying.  I also found that the top gaps and is very low cut.  This is fine with my bathing suite on but when I wore it with a bra I found that my bra was constantly exposed in the front.  I am a 38B for reference.  Flaw #2: the zipper.  The zipper is in the back of the romper, I had my husband help zip me up when I first put it on and didn’t think anything of it.  A few hours later when I went to the bathroom I couldn’t get the zipper undone by myself.  After 5min of twisting and multiple yoga like poses I finally was able to let myself out.  However, I couldn’t get it rezipped when I was done and had to walk through the restaurant half zipped to have my husband once again assist me.  Because of the zipper issue I don’t see me wearing this like I thought I would.  It’s a nice product and I recommend it if you have somebody nearby to be your zipper buddy! I got the large and am 5’6” 165lbs."
3.0,I had to return this dress as it was tight across the bust and hugged the curves in other places too tightly<br />I had ordered a large according to size chart but.......I am full busted and it was only a bit tight
3.0,"Fit small and not winter coat , maybe fall at most"
3.0,Was a gift for my mom. She loved it. The gray was darker than expected making the image more difficult to see than appears in picture.
3.0,"This band seems well made.  But its too short for a mans wrist,  its more for a boy or a woman's wrist."
3.0,"Color was NOT ACCURATE. However, it still looks and feels nice for the price. I'll just gift it to someone else since it doesn't go with my wardrobe at all."
3.0,Not very supportive. My daughter said they were uncomfortable
3.0,The price and delivery were great. I am only disappointed with the quality of the finish. It already starting to peel off.
3.0,Charm is cute but I ended up returning it for something thicker. Charm is somewhat masculine despite the shape
3.0,No back print
3.0,"These boots look like just what I wanted. I got the camo print. I like that they are a little clunky and edgy looking. They arrived on schedule, and I couldn’t wait to slip them on. I measure between a size 6 to 6-1/2, but I usually get a 7 or a 7-1/2 because my feet are a C width. I opted for a size 7 because I didn’t want my feet slipping around in them and giving me blisters.<br /><br />These boots are pretty narrow in the footbed. That’s ok, they stretch a little, and then wearing them isn’t uncomfortable for me. The fourth or fifth day that I put them on though, there was a pop in the heel area of the right shoe. Now everytime I put them on, that pop happens. I can’t see any damage inside or out, but I’m concerned that whatever it was will worsen with time. Also, I need to use the pull tab at the back of each boot every time I put them on. No matter how careful I am, I have to pull the tab hard to get my feet into the boots, as I have a higher arch and instep. I am hoping the tab will remain intact and not tear. I really love these boots, and I’m hoping they will last a long time and not disappoint."
3.0,"I really liked these sunglasses. They are stylish, and I received many compliments on them, however, I only got to wear them twice before they broke.  The temple (which connects the glasses to the ear piece) seemingly broke off for no apparent reason"
3.0,The snaps are very difficult to keep snapped.
3.0,didn't like how after a couple of months it started to tear and fall apart
3.0,Not a fan. The band is hard and uncomfortable. Don’t stay latched well. Hurts when you put the strap in place.
3.0,it was a good shirt but it had a typo on it
3.0,"I like the look of the XLoop Men's Sports sunglasses. I like the look and the color of both the frame and the single lenses. The first time I opened the arms and put them on, I discovered two important things.<br /><br />Firstly, this pair of sunglasses offers unprecedented field of shaded view. There is no &#34;frame&#34; per se and, therefore, nothing to break the view from side to side. It keeps light out very well. There is maximum vision in these. Additionally, they are very light and rest easily on the nose.<br /><br />The second salient feature I noticed was that, upon opening, how fragile this pair of sunglasses really is. As I carefully folded out the arms, the glasses flexed outward to the extent that I was concerned that the single lenses would break in half.<br /><br />I like the unobstructed view one has in these XLoop sunglasses, but, to be honest, I am concerned that they will break in short order. If I had known this, I probably would have chosen another style. Objectively, I have to give these sunglasses only three stars."
3.0,"I like the feel and fit. Though I find the legs ride, and I thought they wouldn't do that."
3.0,"The print on this item was cute, but I wasn’t a fan of the fabric. It was shiny, almost satin-like, and I didn’t think it would be appropriate for use in the kitchen. I could imagine it getting dirty, oil stained, etc. very quickly."
3.0,Just a large scarf. Not the material I expected.  Thin.  Nice pattern.
3.0,My granddaughter is a very small teenager and it barely fits even with a lot of work
3.0,I like it but too see through and the material looks so cheap.
3.0,"Pretty dress, but way too small."
3.0,I like the colors but I did not like the fact that my boxed got cracked is that how you deliver the package to  customer by having it cracked like that
3.0,"I ordered this to wear to work, but it's a little see-through, and ill-fitting. I ordered my usual size, a small, and it's just a little too big in some areas. So I don't think I'll be able to wear it to work, unless I'm able to find a slip or something to wear underneath to make it less see-through. The material is also a little thin, so it shows everything (so there's nowhere to hide my big bum etc.).<br />However, this dress is a nice length. It comes down below the knee, which is a good length for work. It has an attached ribbon to tie it around the middle, but only on the right side. I wrapped the ribbon around the back and tucked it in to the loop on the left side. It cinched it a little, which partially helped with it being a little too loose, but then it wrinkled and tugged at other parts of the dress, so it was hard to tell if it helped with the overall appearance.<br />I really do want to like this dress, but it has enough problems that I'm not sure if I'll be able to wear it anywhere, definitely not work. But maybe the darker color options don't have the see-through issue. But to conclude, if I had tried on this dress in the store exactly as-is, I would not have brought it home with me."
3.0,Love that this fits water bottle as well as incidentals but really wish it had separate pocket for cell phone either outside or inside.  Phone drops to bottom.  Separate pocket would provide much easier and quicker access to phone
3.0,"They are super cute, but one broke in half while it was in my ear."
3.0,alot longer than the normal bra tops from VS.. like a foot longer
3.0,"They are ok earrings.<br />The CC ones come with the 2 Cs detached and tangle up easily so I had to use super glue to attach them together to get the designer look.<br /><br />The GG ones are actually CG, and I don’t believe I’ll wear them.<br /><br />Overall they look like they should cost less than the price listed."
3.0,This Keychain is adorable but fell apart after using it for less than 2 months.  They are replacing it.  Hopefully the second one will hold up longer.
3.0,"When I first got it I was in love with it. The black lettering is rubbing off.  I take if off at night and I do not get it wet.  The silver is also changing color.  You get what you pay for,"
3.0,"Says it comes with two, I only received one. Great for running and it fits great around my arm."
3.0,"Meh this didn't fit me too terribly, however I am a slender 5'9&#34; with a C cup. I just think the straps on the front look weird in person. I am a fan of the strappy look but there are cuter strappy-front bralettes out there. I should have just spent the money on a high quality one I've coveted from better retailers with all the money I've wasted on cheap ones from Amazon. I've found maybe two cute ones on here that I actually wear in my day to day life, this isn't one of them."
3.0,"It's beautiful and a really soft silky fabric. Unfortunately, even though I typically wear medium to small clothing, this is too small."
3.0,"The fit on this is decent. I’m 5’11”, 185, relatively athletic build with 10 pounds to lose. The Large was ok on the sleeves: tight enough but maybe an inch too long. The shirt tapers down from the top to the bottom, but maybe not as much as in the pictures. Probably better suited for more body builder types like in the pictures, or buy one size smaller than usual if you’re thin but muscular.<br /><br />Unfortunately the material is pretty thin. I got white and it’s somewhat see-through. You can easily see your n*pples (not sure if Amazon censors if I spell it out). If you’re wearing an undershirt you can see the undershirt clearly, and you can see the pants where the shirt covers them. Maybe the colored shirts are better, but I’m going to return the white."
3.0,It is a nice product!
3.0,"The fit was small.  I religiously wear a medium and I have ordered several other dresses like this from Amazon.  It was tighter than the other mediums I've ordered and significantly shorter as well.  It was too ill-fitting to keep.  The colors were pretty, though.  The material on top was a little thin, but doable for the cost.  I returned it for a different style/brand."
3.0,Disappointed.  Quality is marginal and fit is not true
3.0,These blouses are really beautiful but they are juniors sizes maybe I'll get one for my sis .They package them in a beautiful clear bag. I was upset I had to send mine back I'm to broad shouldered from age. I'd rate it a five if it fit. Thank you.
3.0,These are very comfortable and great to wear for work. However the reason I don't use them is the straps don't stay tightened.  Will continue my search for a professional looking mask.
3.0,Very soft and stretchy. It shrunk slightly in the wash though.
3.0,Discoloring on the white trim that goes along the zipper. Also a few of the zipper pulls fell off. I wasn’t expecting a ton for $17.00 but I was hoping for more than that. I can fix the zipper pulls but not the discoloration. I ordered blue and red.
3.0,La blusa es hermosa pero esta muy reducida.
3.0,Difficult to install.  Slightly smaller than original lenses.  Seems like an okay product.  I think I would buy the originals next time.
3.0,"I sent a review on an another suit , this one the skirt was too long. I am 4foot 9 so it looked awful  I did keep two of the other suits I ordered."
3.0,The colour is match.
3.0,It's a normal chain nothing to be exited about it. Don't expect a great quality neither. Nice price thought! Thanks
3.0,I ordered a medium. It said M on the tag but it seemed large. I like my clothes to fit. I don't compromise. Sent it back.
3.0,order bigger than you normally wear.
3.0,I would’ve liked this product if it actually fit it’s really nice quality. If you order the triangle front top the triangle is almost unnoticeable and small.
3.0,Ordered for my grandson he loves Super Mario. They looked small but it says it should fit snugged.
3.0,"The frames are a little flimsy, but the lenses really work well.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for sunglasses."
3.0,"I generally like 90 Degree pants--they're great for the cost, but have noticed the seams usually have some longevity issues. After one wear and wash this pair had the fabric separating at the back seam:("
3.0,"Dress material is okay, but is not what I expected it. Looks longer but it was shorter i really did not like it that much"
3.0,"It was funny and the bag is strong and durable. I was really disappointed when the design started to peel up, probably because the edges of the design are made to look tattered."
3.0,i really like how the shoes look like but they are very stiff and i know new shoes are usually stiff but these are abnormaly stiff. maybe that would have been fine to deal with but the shoes seem very narrow. my son complained anytime he had to wear them and he doesnt have wide feet. so maybe get a size bigger?
3.0,To big and loose.
3.0,"Beautiful top. I'll be honest and I didn't notice their size chart somewhere in the listing. Because of my size, I just bought the biggest size it came in.... that was a JOKE. There is 0 stretch in the material, which made it even more of a challenge. They run in extreme asian sizes. I don't know why they don't just alter their size names to the correct names they should have. It's misleading IMO. I loved that shirt so much and wish it could've fit. I apologize for the blurry pics. I was rushing to take the shirt off me to prevent breaking it. Their size guide states XL is for those with a 15&#34; waist... that is mind-boggling to say the least. Mind you, my waist is about 35&#34;.  Even if their large/e-xlarge is &#34;supposedly&#34; a medium whereever they are... I have never ever seen a medium waist in clothes be 15&#34;. Medium waists are usually about 28&#34;.<br /><br />It's funny because that day I was so mad but now all I can do is sit back and laugh at these pictures lol. I hope no one else has this issue."
3.0,Material was thin and inexpensive.
3.0,It was WAY too big for me. It was also cheaper looking than the photos.
3.0,Got these because I had a pair that broke and couldn’t find the exact ones I had . So I bought these. They work but still like my old pair better . A little big for me but it works
3.0,Just a mask peeps
3.0,The chain was way too short.. But other than that great.
3.0,"its not a soft, pretty gold like is pictured, its very brassy and chunky"
3.0,"I am giving this three stars because these aren’t exactly “no show” as they were described. These aren’t as visible as regular underwear, but I was still expecting them to be no show. Now, for the good. These are very comfortable and do not chafe. They fit very well (true to size) and are breathable."
3.0,"Very pretty, but does not have a pocket to insert a filter"
3.0,The edges were sharp .
3.0,"The thing that makes the more breathable is the open stitching of the arms. This is not lightweight as described, as the yarn itself is thick making this a heavier knit sweater. I was hoping for something lighter and a little bit slinky. It is also not soft, and actually a little scratchy. I would say it is true to size but maybe runs a hair small. I'm between a small and medium and the medium is *just* right - I wouldn't want it to be any smaller."
3.0,Like but they tend to shred the stitching at wrist band area.  They do keep you  cool.
3.0,"I didn't even bother trying it on. It was way too big even when I followed the size chart. That's just how it is with online shopping, you win some, you lose some. That's why I always make sure that there is a return policy before purchasing online."
3.0,Very pretty dress but the “bling” are actually sequins and not as pictured. Fit was extremely large but all in all it is a very pretty dress. Had to return due to size being way to big and the sequins.
3.0,It was such great quality but it was too flattened and wasn't wearable.
3.0,"I ordered the small ones, and they do fit, but since I have arthritis and live in a cold climate, I need to have room for another pair of mittens underneath for the coldest days. I wear them for dog walking.  Also, one of them had lumps in the seam that felt uncomfortable as my fingers go all the way to the end. They are very soft, nice mittens and I did think about ordering a medium and assume there would be no lumps in an other pair, that must have been a fluke. For now, I'm just going to return them. They arrived promptly and look like what I expected."
3.0,Strap falls<br />Off<br />Shoulder then hits ground
3.0,"Rose gold in color, not yellow gold- quality is decent enough, but definitely don't expect what is pictured."
3.0,"They are really cute but my five year old cannot snap or unsnap them herself because they are SO HARD to do.  I even struggle a little.  After a few months of wear the snap actually broke off (from the need to use always excessive force, I assume)."
3.0,"It's pretty and pretty made, the chest area is weird and doesn't fit right. Seems way to pig and bulky. There was also padding line where it wasn't  sewn correctly"
3.0,Fabrics not good quality. Design is good.
3.0,"The dress is very light weight and the color is the same as advertised. Just be sure to wear something underneath, It is on the sheer side."
3.0,Light weight and definitely comfortable just wish it had actually fit my face. Was unable to use it as I intended because it was too big.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium however, this shirt was way too big.  Order a size smaller."
3.0,It wasn’t like I thought when I bought it. Not only is the clasp flimsy but the material feels like cheap woven thread. Not surprised subdue both bands feel this way.
3.0,it kept rolling up to my waist which I did not like
3.0,I love these but 2 of the 3 fell apart within a few days of use. I like how they are adjustable and my 4 and 7 year old can both use them.
3.0,Fabric reminded me of my great grams sheer curtains<br />Very synthetic
3.0,"Cheap scarf,color wasn't quite like the picture but it is still pretty."
3.0,"When you are a true 9 1/2, this shoe is way to long and wide."
3.0,Son muy duras para el pie del bebé y no parecen tan abrigadas.
3.0,"A little too short for my age. I would not consider it work attire, better for hanging around the house or yard."
3.0,Its an off white colour and very see through. I like the dress overall but will need to wear leggings or something else with it to protect the lower region. :)
3.0,"Get a size bigger for sure if you buy this. I bought this for my daughter. I measured her and went by the measurements and it's a bit tight in the hips. So I would suggest going a little bigger. The top I would say is even a big small. It's a cute suit, pretty decent material. I don't think it's a suit that would last long. But if you have a daughter who likes mermaid it's a cute suit."
3.0,"En la fotografía muestra el vestido con un cinturon, el que llegó a mi casa no lo tenía y hace ver al vestido un poco diferente de lo que esperaba. Y la entrega fue 3 después del día en la que lo esperaba"
3.0,I know it's not an expensive watch band but it's very different from the picture - the photo depicts a more traditional bright tie dye but the one received is darker in color and more blotchy in color that tie dye. One of those situations where it's not really as expected but also not worth the trouble of returning. Sometimes the risk you take.
3.0,"This was a gift for my little sister, and while she loved the sentiment, it wasn’t the color I ordered, and it was too small for her wrist."
3.0,the sleeves were to short so i wear it as quarter sleeve and it wasnt long on the back like it was suppose to be it barley covers my butt other that that its fine i guess. you get what you pay for. im 5'4/5'5 and weigh around 150-160 and got a large.only problem is that sleeves were to short and it wasnt as long as I expected other than that it fit fine
3.0,My son is a size 9-10 I got the 9.5 and they are too small..so ima return and order an 11. They are very cute tho just too small so order 2 sizes up
3.0,Just ordered this and was shocked at how big it is.  I was ordering for a 11 year old girl -- and this is way too big.  It is of nice quality and the patterns it makes are lovely -- but the size is XL.
3.0,These were great quality and just the style I was looking for for my daughter. I was so upset to get them because they actually run big. I’m super sad because other than sizing these sandals are the cutest. I ordered a toddler 9 and I should have went a size down for perfection.
3.0,This dress is so pretty.  I really liked it but the sequins in the armpit area dig into your skin.  I returned it for that reason only.
3.0,"I bought these in the black and red frames - looks nice, quality is appropriate for the price. In terms of sizing, these are comparable to a medium set of Knockaround Premiums that they were replacing. My previous Knockarounds have lasted for years with careful use, and I'm optimistic that these will as well.<br /><br />I've owned these for a month, but they still reek of ""new plastic smell"" every time I wear them. I don't know if it is unique to these frames (black/amber gradient) or all sets, but they make my eyes water if I'm in a poorly ventilated area like my car."
3.0,"I’m a 38dd and the bra top was way too small, the shorts and the jacket fit fine. I’m 5’5 190 and it fit comfortably."
3.0,It's very pretty but it's very hard to put on so I returned it..  But I'm knew to the nose ring so maybe it's me but I couldn't get it  through my nose.
3.0,I ordered my item in my size and it was too small. Order it two sizes larger.
3.0,Top was thinner then expected. Bottoms are nice.
3.0,"For the price they are decent boots , a bit tight at first once they are broken in not bad to wear on my bike or around . The soles are slick until they have been worn for a bit."
3.0,Shoulder strap (the metal latch) broke after about 60 seconds of use. Otherwise nice duffel.
3.0,It’s just creeps up a lot
3.0,The quality not very good  expected more.Its very light weight.
3.0,They are too long. I had to clip the ends and try to shorten them. Sorry the money otherwise.
3.0,very cute bracelet although it is pretty small and it broke pretty easily
3.0,I really wanted to like this product.  There was some fogging reduction (I did not expect it to completely eliminate fogging but I expected more and for what fogging there was to clear faster.  but it did not perform up to my expectations.  I will continue to use it until it is gone but I will nit be re-ordering.
3.0,"Cute pattern, soft material but not a flattering fit.  Just like a men's Tshirt."
3.0,I need a bag that will lay open and flat in my luggage.<br />I gave this to a friend and found what I needed elsewhere.
3.0,"I love these dresses....  I have three.  They are not the greatest material but it will fit the bill for what you need it for....  I have the gray,  blue and. Coffee.... All for weddings and everyone loved them"
3.0,Cute but the bottom of the cake topper arrived damaged and couldn’t be used and it enough time to get a replacement. Also missing eyelashes for the cake and the unicorn horns for the cupcakes are much larger than expected. After spending so long looking for the perfect topper and cupcake decorations I feel a little disappointed in these. These are just cute print outs on paper not 3-dimensional like I thought from the pics.
3.0,I thought cropped meant shorter leg lengths. I’m 5’3. The mediums went to right above my ankle. Perhaps cropped means something else. The picture is accurate.
3.0,The product came in on time and I like it but in the middle it was to soft where it got caught in anything it will break when it came in it was twisted thanks
3.0,Fit a bit too close hate the fabric
3.0,I took one star off because I think it can use a handle strap for those who do not carry purses. It holds a lot of cards and money. However it does not hold my Samsung s9 plus. I took another star off because there's a sticky like glue substance that rubs off between the stitching.... I don't know why.
3.0,"LOVELY SET, however earrings were broken, however the necklace is a real FUN item"
3.0,I shouldn’t have listened to the reviews and bought a medium like I usually do . I would’ve returned but my daughter threw out the packaging !!
3.0,Not a fan of the fit but the color was beautiful. Order smaller than you are.
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality. It was not worth $36, maybe $10. Made in China right on package."
3.0,"Kinda small, extremely tight fit if using your glasses case."
3.0,smaller and tighter then expected
3.0,Color wasn't as pictures and it was a lil too large based size chart
3.0,"Necklace i received was not the pictured one with scrolling art work and little bug charm attachment bead that chain goes thru.very large moon and can barely tell its a frog in picture, very cloudy. its was only 4 bucks but would of liked product in picture."
3.0,Really cute and hold really well but theyre thicker than Id like
3.0,I don’t feel 20’ cooler all over.
3.0,"I bought 3 of these masks and 2 of them worked great. The goggles stop every bbs shot at them but they are not good for when it gets dark because they have dark lenses. The mask themselves stop a lot of bbs, but sometimes the bb explodes and the little pieces go right through. One of the masks broke when the elastic strap came out of the back of the mask. Over all the goggles are great during the day, but the masks are not very protective."
3.0,"I like the band and the color, however after purchasing a similar product in another color I was expecting the case to cover the face of the watch like the other. This one will still require a screen protector to prevent scratches, cracks, etc.."
3.0,Looked nice but didn't feel right.
3.0,Meh...a bit smaller than I was expecting.
3.0,"I liked this dress. The grey one I purchased has a nice, thick material. The only issue I had was that the hem length listed on the sizing picture isn't 100% accurate. This dress did come up on the sides, so the length given is the measurement for the longest part of the hem (middle of front/back). It's still a very cute dress, but I could no longer wear it to work as the side hems being a little shorter made it look a little too short for the office. I'm about 5'7&#34; and I ordered a size small. I do think the overall sizing as far as width seems true to size, just not the length of the hem."
3.0,It’s a super cute bracelet but it came broken 😔 I’m going to try and get it exchanged because I really love the bracelet!
3.0,"I really love the print and fit but I am a little disappointed because right in the front about 4 inches below waistline, it has the letters HC ? I'm not sure why? It's kind of an eye sore."
3.0,Light weight and good manufacturing unfortunately very small measures. This garment is supposed to be worn over your shirt so it has to be bigger. Size XL is the equivalent of size M.
3.0,"My 7 year old daughter loved them. But after wearing them to school for 2 days, some of the lights are already out."
3.0,"Cheap made,cheap look"
3.0,I loved everything about this except the arms are just so tight. Uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,The bag looked a lot bigger on the picture… But when I got it it was very small… So please realize it is smaller than expected
3.0,"Ordered the 2 rings at size 12.  Received one, size 12, the other is a 9.  Now, not available....nice weight, pleasantly surprised,  just not happy with sending wrong size."
3.0,"Comfortable but a little small for cross body carry.  The zipper seams are interfering with opening and closing the inner pocket area and have to use two hands, one to steady or hold bag in place and one to pull zipper.  Would suggest the manufacturer sew the seam down like it is on the opposite side of zipper.<br /><br />I also would suggest different colors available.  And not just black or camouflage, make it so you can carry it for CCW and not be so noticeable as a CCW carrier."
3.0,"Bought 2 same size and color (pink), but they come in with two different shades of pink.<br />Though it's a slight difference, it can tell the quality consistency."
3.0,I like it and I use it to work
3.0,Disappointed the image on the front of the hat is barely readable much less recognizable at a short distance.
3.0,Boob sec does not fit well unless you are super  huge
3.0,"Why does everyone make these products for only twinks?  Not everyone who is gay, has a tiny little wrist!  These bracelets are made for SMALL wrists!  Total circumference when tied = 7-8 inches.<br />The maker should consider making the tie strings 3-4inches longer (the extra could always be cut off by the wearer)  Keep that in mind when ordering them.<br /><br />Also, the bracelets are not very well made; the strings come detached and un-twilled easily.  Although a couple dabs of superglue usually fix it."
3.0,Glad I ordered a large because it fits smaller especially around the shoulders.
3.0,"I definitely didn't like the style on myself but I'm sure it would be cute on others. The material was very soft but looked a little cheap (but hey, you get what you pay for). The length is perfect if you're on the shorter side. I'm about 5'2&#34; and this dress was a really great length for me."
3.0,Cute! But ordered 6-12 months and would fit a newborn.
3.0,I like the look and ease of putting on.  They are a bit flimsy and you need to be aware when putting in your ears.
3.0,Mailed back it was super small sizes way off but fabric and style was awesome &#62;&#62;&#62; I wanted it to fit
3.0,The material isn't something I would have went with for a face mask but overall it's okay.
3.0,The pants are kind of Tight I ended up getting out 2x which is the size that I wear but they were kind of too small and then the top doesn’t really fit at all
3.0,"As described,  worth the money, you will need to buy insoles but nice design."
3.0,Looks cheap and didn't even come with a battery
3.0,"Very cute print, but not very soft fabric. For the price it's a good deal, though."
3.0,"Very cute design and soft breathable material but the zipper has poor functionality, I have to stuff my sons legs inside the zipper and pull them out one at a time.  Stuffing both his legs through the bottom zipper is the only way I can get him in and the weak stitching tore part of the zipper out.  Once he's in the outfit it fits him fine so I don't think it's a size issue... Definitely not convenient for frequent diaper changes but he looks awful cute in it!"
3.0,"Mine arrived yesterday but doesn't have a belt like the photo. Listing doesn't specifically say it is included so I'm not sure. Also, this is super heavy, not at all what I expected but I'll probably keep it."
3.0,Too small and since it’s thick it’s difficult to breathe
3.0,Cute shirt just super see through
3.0,The gold trim is a little shiner than I would have liked but it's very nice for the price.
3.0,"The ring is decent but smaller than the photos let you to believe. The quality is okay, the gold started to fade after awhile, would not purchase again."
3.0,"Bought this at the Amazon wholesale , site.... The smallest suitcase, has a problem. one of the inside hold down straps is torn away from the side of the suitcase. This is most likely the reason this was returned. However, i will keep this luggage set !! This is way better than my 45+ year old luggage !!! lighter weight ( means able to pack more stuff for a trip ) ..Thanks for a Great deal !! Amazon... Tho now not to pleased as there is NO WAY to contact the luggage manfacture  ( I can not use the med size bag, as the lock was set by the person who returned it  ).. so i can not use and or lock the med bag...Only 3 stars...Unless coolife has a fix for this problem and cares about customers.."
3.0,Prettier then expected!!
3.0,"Kind of messed up with printing, but she was ok with it."
3.0,"The fit was good, but not better than a t-shirt I could have brought off the rack for much less."
3.0,"Not the most fashionable belt but has lasted a long time so far.  It shipped fast from the seller.  I would probably buy a nicer belt next time around, but I got what I paid for here- a simple belt that holds up my pants!"
3.0,"Band looks and feels nice, but it was the wrong size so I cannot use it.<br /><br />Listing says it should fit 38/40mm Apple Watch, but what I got would fit the 44mm Apple Watch.<br /><br />So, my overall rating is based on disappointment over the wrong item sent, not actual usage since I am not going to be wearing it.<br /><br />Not sure if I am able to return this since it the item is no longer available and my order was placed so long ago."
3.0,"The yellow isn't yellow, it's closer to a peachish tan.  I returned it. I may try a different color because I really do like the sweater."
3.0,"Product Okay for contractions pants wearing, I will definitely not suggest for combat/cancel or shooting competition wear. Belt its to flexible for that usage. Price nice, but no thank you. I purchase belt for over $60 COBRA brand and Im happy with."
3.0,I wear a 40DD so I bought in my size which is available. When it came it had some wild sizing I’ve never seen on which tag and it was INSANELY small in the cups. So either I got sent the wrong size and can’t tell or the sizing is wildly off.<br /><br />I will say tho. It was crazy comfortable and seemed like really great quality. So if your smaller in the chest and don’t have to worry about spillage I would absolutely recommend this. But I would have no idea how to size up! Numbers and letters seem completely arbitrary.
3.0,"I originally liked the band , great colors but as I used it my watch would not recognize it on my wrist, had to put passcode in many times during the day, so I sent it back! It would have been better if you could adjust size of band so their was no slippage! Maybe it would work better for someone else!"
3.0,"The scarf is lovely and very soft!  I only gave it 3 stars because the photo doesn’t match what I received. I purchased this particular scarf for someone who loves yellow!  If you’re looking for yellow, as shown in the pic, you’ll be disappointed.  I would consider it more of a beige tone.  Very nice scarf though."
3.0,I'm not satisfied simply because they don't fit as fitted as the picture. But I mean That was kind of expected everything is made for fake bodies now days and big buts it's hard to find things that insinuate my petite body and frame I have butt but not silicone but 😂😂😂😂but the shorts are pretty much as described! Just know that you have to be thick to get the perfect fitting !
3.0,"It’s very cute, just really small."
3.0,Hands where tight
3.0,"I measured my head and I saw the measurements of the hat, so I ordered it as it looked like it would fit. But when I got it, I put it on and it didn't fit. It was too small. I have to return it. Good quality but it doesn't fit me."
3.0,Nice umbrella but I won’t be packing it to travel.  Too heavy….
3.0,"I purchased this top in XXL. I normally wear a 20/22. The top fits, though it is a little short for my taste. Not short enough that someone will see your belly when you raise your arms but close.  Weird to say but this it feels like it would be great if you have a narrow back and a large chest. The front is very roomy, but the arm holes are a little small. It's almost as though they're cut too far to the back of the shirt. I washed the shirt in the washing machine and tumbled dry. The shirt fabric feels great, isn't sheer, and the color is bright. I received multiple compliments when wearing. I would never buy again, but I don't regret purchasing!"
3.0,"Very comfortable material, but the buttons don't stay closed."
3.0,It was cute and I bought this dress for a wedding I unfortunately didn't end up going to. but I feel like the design of this dress is slightly off as well as the color. I feel like the skirt part in the picture with the model was more full but the actual dress was just basic fabric. I don't hate it but I didn't love it enough to keep it.
3.0,It's okay for the price...  A little flimsy but okay for occasional overnight trips for kids.
3.0,Good shirt but would advise anyone who plans on purchasing one to order it one size up.
3.0,Very very very boxy-tight in the bust and under arms.
3.0,Left handed difficult zipper. Fits but I can hear stiches pooping in shoulder s arm when I put it on and off.
3.0,"I wear size 8/10 and I thought as a shrug it will be a good fit, but I was wrong. It is really big and the shoulder sags all the time and I am constantly pulling it over. The crochet is very good."
3.0,Material was thin and seemed a little cheap.
3.0,"I like to wear men's flannel shirts instead of sweaters in the house when it's cold outside. (Women's shirts never have long enough sleeves.) When I received the shirt, it fit loosely over a T-shirt with room to spare, absolutely perfect size and very comfortable.<br /><br />Then it was washed.<br /><br />Now the shoulders feel snug and if I button it, the effect is full ""stuffed sausage."" The shrinkage was considerable. At least the sleeves are still long enough (they were overlong at first).<br /><br />So do consider ordering a size up."
3.0,"Despite the fact that this sweater looks more stylish in the photo than it does in real life and I wish it had buttons or some kind of closure, I will wear this quite a bit I am sure. Color is as expected. . .a cool beige."
3.0,No son lo k pensé.  Son muy incomodos
3.0,Cute but a tad bit tighter than anticipated
3.0,Came with a scratch. It was really cute on though. I love the blue and pink gradient. The scratch was not from shipment or packaging though. So it leads me to question quality assurance prior to shipment. But everything else was great.
3.0,Don’t look at the picture and think your normal size will look like this. I bought a size up and it still didn’t.  I gave it to my daughter who is 3 sizes smaller and looks good on her but still doesn’t look as cute as picture.
3.0,"My son dressed as the BFG and wore the ears. It is impossible to put them on. My husband used scotchtape. The ears themselves are pretty cool looking, reason for the 3 stars."
3.0,"I like the style of this,it being a three piece<br />I also like but not so much the material. It's a thin stretchy material and despite getting my size it was too small."
3.0,It's a nice shirt but it does not look like the one in the picture. I got the one that was white on top and faded to black. This shirt is pretty much all black the top is slightly lighter but you can't really tell. And it has a really odd smell that I hope comes out when I wash it.
3.0,Case is to thin to keep in your pocket
3.0,"Love the way ot fits, just wish the color in the picture matched what I got.  I got the taupe color but even though the label on my dress said taupe, the dress was a much lighter color than the pic."
3.0,I bought for a 70's costume but it was unflattering fit on me and thin fabric.  I wear a 10 blouse or shirt.  I am 5'7&#34; and 150 and have broad shoulders and 36D Bra...it would work well under a vest or with a peasant skirt. The blouson look with jeans just didn't flatter me.  It would probably look nicer on a thin boned or petite shouldered woman.
3.0,"Fit well. Gems were coming off the day it arrived, still wore it. After unpacking from event there are a few more gems starting to fall off."
3.0,Gift for my boss who loved them...but the ittle bitty screw fell out weithin a week...I was embarrassed!!
3.0,"Not impressed for almost 50$  they are just a pair of nylon gym pants with quilted stitching,,aka. Absolutely no insulation value."
3.0,"Knew it might be too good to be true at the price.  Very small, very thing, no stitching on the sides so its like wearing a poncho or something.  Beaches are windy and I wanted something that will somewhat stay close to my body without getting hot.  Oh and line dry that baby because it will wrinkle up and shrink if you dry it even on low heat."
3.0,The material is nice and the shirt is very cute bit it runs extremely small so I can only give it 3 stars. I even sized up! I would suggest going up 2 sizes
3.0,"The fit is a bit awkward, it should sit just a little bit lower. My size is weird, and I take that into account when I buy pants, skirts or dresses, my waist is a US 10 and I always have to size up to a 12 because of my rear and thighs. So when I bought a size that should have fit my bum, I was disappointed when it was the high waist of this skirt/dress/suspenders thingy, that didn't fit me right. The material is pretty decent, I don't have any complaints about it other than the size is smaller than it says it is."
3.0,I can barely see the blue stones. I am a bit disappointed but I didn't pay a lot for it so it's fine for now.
3.0,The dress would be cute as a beach cover up but I found the material too flimsy for actually going out to a cocktail party.
3.0,Was looking for solid color for a long time. The navy is perfect. Like material and length. Would buy again but not in black! The black fabric was heavier and felt very different than the navy. I sent it back. I would try another color however because I liked the fit.
3.0,"I like the wallet but the front snaps do not work, even empty, they do not hold closed"
3.0,A little too small on my hips.
3.0,I have 7 5/8 head and found this to fit unsecured shifting forward a lot.<br />Maybe more narrow head would fit fine.<br />Color was not the Yellow base. Scroll through images and see that the base is black.<br />This has 3 inflatable zones for better fitting. 2 sides and 1 center.
3.0,Nothing to scream about
3.0,These pants are a nice fabric but are not true to size. They barely went above my hips. I normally wear a size large and the 2x were too tight. I give up on trying to figure out an accurate size.
3.0,The wrinkles didn’t go away and it wasn’t as soft as I would’ve liked
3.0,"I like the sentiment expressed, and it would seem some of my neighbors appreciate it as well, because I do get compliments on it. Giving it three stars because, hey, it's a face mask and I don't like wearing it. If it were possible to give a COVID mask a high rating, I wouldn't be the kind of guy who buys this mask."
3.0,"I read all the reviews so I order the dress to fit per the chart listed, which said for me to order it large that my normal size, the dress I got did not have a size on it But it was Way Way Too Big. However I had it altered and It Look Stunning."
3.0,This didn't fit anything like on the model it was a skin tight spandex shirt which made the ruching at the side look out of place. If I had gotten an XL instead of my normal medium maybe it would have been a more flattering fit.
3.0,"Only 3 stars because the 'term' 2-Piece Leather German Octoberfest Lederhosen is misleading.  The buying public, such as myself, thinks the 2-pieces are the actual brown leather lederhosen and the 'white shirt' (EMPHASIS added with the single quotation marks).  In reality, the 2 pieces are the suspenders and the shorts themselves.  What is the remedy - change the description so that the buying public (such as myself - the customer) knows that the shirt is sold separately and is not considered part of the 2-pieces OR change the description to read &#34;shorts and suspenders are the 2-pieces&#34;.  Just my .02 cents worth.  I would not have spent $159.99 IF I knew the shirt was not included.  For the money spent, a shirt should be included.  Sincerely, Donald -Don- Hendel.  9/2/2015"
3.0,These things ride up on you like a cowboy does a bandit.
3.0,"The photo is deceiving.  Item is very pretty, but too flimsy for the needed use.  Was a birthday gift for my mother, but have returned."
3.0,Ordered a small and the fit is good. But it’s sheer. May use as a cover up.
3.0,Didn't like the fact that they were so small. Thought they would have been the same size as the leaves on the necklace.
3.0,"I don't know if the suit is weird, or my body is weird. I'm a 36DD and from reading all the other reviews I ended up ordering a medium. Being big chested it's always hard to get swimsuits where you can't mix and match the tops and bottoms. So the top ended up fitting ok, I wasn't spilling out or anything, but the bottoms were huge, it looked like I was wearing regular shorts, they went up almost to my belly button and just looked like a diaper (I'm a 3-4 in pant size, athletic build). The quality of the item is fine, but I had to return it since there was such a huge difference in sizing between the top and bottom. I wish I could've gotten a medium top and small bottoms, oh well."
3.0,I wasn’t overly excited or unhappy. It’s kind of a ok product.
3.0,"I have this mask in the “1023” option, which is as bright and colorful as it looks in the pictures. The mask has 2 layers which don’t feel suffocating, though they are on the thin side. The shape of the mask fits around my face well. There’s no nose wire though, so air tends to escape in that area and make my glasses fog up. Unlike most masks I’ve tried, this one has a strap that goes around the back of my head instead of my ears. It’s nice to have the pressure off of my ears, though I find it a little tricky to find an adjustment that is comfortable and doesn’t feel like it’s going to slide down. The straps also slide easily through the adjuster, so they sometimes loosen when I don’t want them to."
3.0,Nice but fit a bit large. I think there are several different types of shirts listed here.
3.0,Not as polished as I hoped but good quality. Did not fit my ear and I was unsure how to put in. Looks good on others.
3.0,"They fit a bit big, but they make you sweat."
3.0,"Cheap feeling, def look plastic. Black was the only color my husband would wear."
3.0,The tail is cute and my 7 year loves it! The top is way too big and she refuses to wear it. The top is made for girls with boobs and she's 7 so she can't fill it out. Wish their were more choices for the tops.
3.0,"Just plastic wire, but for the price it's OK.  My 9 year old granddaughter thinks it's stylish 'tho I'm not overly impressed"
3.0,No me gusta la.tela. pero la camisa está bien confeccionada.
3.0,I spent the extra money because these were supposed to be unbreakable and soft touch. They feel the same as the sunglasses that came in a ten pack with beach balls I bought as party favors for $20.
3.0,Quality seems nice enough for the price but I can't get mine to stay up on my ears as shown. Mine fall down and hang below my ears. Don't know if there's a secret to them because I've tried to crimp them tighter to stay but then they hurt my ears. Hope they work better for others
3.0,I had to send it off to the Dry Cleaners it had a funky smell.  But it looks good and fits great.  Whoever makes this should really do something about that smell.
3.0,It's ok but not really something. Would buy again.
3.0,"I'm happy with this dress. I'm 5'4 , 32 DDD, 140lbs, I normally order a small, which i did. I think it's tighter than normal across my 32DDD  chest. Material not thin. Great quality. Overall 2 thumbs up."
3.0,"Nice looking and light weight but lenses are very loose & rattle, returning"
3.0,I ordered this a size bigger and it was way too tight still. Maybe because I don’t like my clothes skin tight. On the other hand it is cute!!
3.0,I'm normally a small/medium and I ordered an XL and still could have gone a size bigger.
3.0,Too large Order 2 sizes down. The stretch is insane
3.0,It is a pretty coat. However sizes on the coat are big.
3.0,"Its beautiful but too large for me, good quality"
3.0,"It’s very pretty but it’s  difficult to close the lock which also feels flimsy. I’m not certain how long it will last with regular use. For the price, I’ll keep it."
3.0,Purchase for my daughter fit was awkward.
3.0,Looks nice but fits smaller than expected on a stocky body type
3.0,We bought up a size and it got wider but not taller. It pulled away at the middle seems due to the fit being too tight in the crotch. The fabric was very soft and it was a great costume.
3.0,It is a great looking watch but it comes with a Womens watch box!
3.0,I wanted to love this but each one I bought had an oddly cut hem. Otherwise it’s adorable.
3.0,Not as shown the band is vey thick on the picture it looks thinner and it looks like it has blue side stones very bad picture
3.0,"Decent shirt, color and,material not as pictured but I still like. Fits as expected, and it is cute."
3.0,NOT ONLY WAS THE SIZE SMALLER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT IT WAS CHEAP AND TACKY.
3.0,"Very danty and easly bendable. Unfortunatley one was bent. I can remove some of the bent, but not all.  They are very pretty, just wish they were made with a thicker grade of silver"
3.0,This product was a better quality but the size in the arms was very tight and not long enough in the arms.
3.0,"The dress is cute, true to size and as pictured but when it arrived it was clearly used. The tulle had hair in it and the inside of the dress had chocolate stains as well as a few areas on the outside of the dress where it looked like it was wiped down. (See photos). Regardless, this dress would have gone to the cleaners but returning for a smaller size and hopefully an unused dress."
3.0,"I liked the case when I received it although it is a bit drab.  It was working well when I used in on our family trip to Disney.  However on the last day, I stood up and it got caught briefly and the strap broke off.  I knew this was a common complaint from reading the reviews before buying but I figured I'd be careful.  The thin leather connection is just not strong enough - poor design.  Just glad I knew when it broke so  I didn't lose everything.  I'm looking for a new case/wallet now."
3.0,I loved this key charm. But it lasted three months before the loop holding it on the key ring broke off.
3.0,"I expected from picture to be like a crew sock, but only a few inches above ankle..."
3.0,Returned. I didn't like the split in the front. I felt like they should have kept it in the back of the dress below the knee . Looks Much classier that way.
3.0,The charm was really cute. The chain it came on was not very high quality though
3.0,"It's a pretty dress but was not quite right for the occasion.  The dress arrived on time and nicely packaged.  I would order from this seller again.  I am 5-5 and it was too long in the length (not surprised) and also strangely long in the torso.  Tight in the waist but loose at the shoulders.  I am an hourglass shape, not a typical problem for me."
3.0,Short front shows midriff. Did not want that
3.0,Really nice shirt but is see through
3.0,Stretches out of shape quickly.
3.0,These masks are ok they just didn’t work for me.  I am a smaller adult and these were just too big and I couldn’t get them adjusted to where it wasn’t pressing up against my mouth.  The material is decent quality but the inside layer that holds the filter in place didn’t seem to be sewn in just quite right.  The colors are pretty and the designs are cute.  Shipping was on time.
3.0,not the greatest  but gave to the homeless  shelter  they loved it
3.0,"The top was okay, but the pants and head were really low quality. The headband was also large enough for an adult, way too big for a toddler. Disappointing."
3.0,I got a 2XL and it was like a 4XL it was huge. I would suggest buying at least one size smaller than normal.
3.0,Leggings look great and pocket is just what I needed...but they don't stay up!  Just walking around and they slip down.  Not sure what will happen when working out.
3.0,I like the dress but it fit loose on some areas that shouldn't.
3.0,"I actually bought this for my hairless guinea pig. She's similarly sized to an adult rat. It's a cute sweater, but it doesn't stay on well. The sweater itself is basically a straight rectangle and doesn't account for the curve of the animals body. I had rats before and I know this wouldn't have stayed on any of them either."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:4f4b79206373973b6ee8b878bf2549a5]] Granted I know this is a knockoff version from the one the lady was originally selling but that's besides the point this is too small for me. What I mean by too small is if you are short or have a short torso this would be great for you if you are tall I'm 5'10 with a 16 inch torso so wrapping it around me it cuts off pretty quickly but I do like how firm it is now I  ordered the other one and that is too short for my torso as well. it's just not wrapping right it rolls it slides not comfortable. I don't know what to do about that there's no way I can change my torso. I'm just going to be one of those people who are not going to be able to wear those of these. also the 3m threads are already framed and it's already trying to rip so I would say not the best craftsmanship either but if you can get past that and you have a short torso or at least one that isn't above 14in then this will be fine for you be gentle with it cuz it could rips
3.0,"Love the print! Whole reason I bought it. I went a size down after reading all the reviews saying you should do so and in my case, I shouldn’t have. I’m trying to lose weight so hopefully it’ll fit better as I lose more. Otherwise I love it and feel confident in it."
3.0,Arrived damaged had to get a replacement.  My friend loved it though
3.0,I loved the hat but was very disappointed when the ball fell of the top. It was not attached very well. other than that awesome hat.
3.0,"I love this brand and have been using it for years. Branched out from the traditional flip-flop style and although it is still just as comfortable, the fit wasn't the same. It was a lot more narrow and as you walk it squeezes your foot out and you constantly have to stop and readjust them. Very frustrating. Great if you have narrow feet!"
3.0,The bad looks tacky. The bag lacks an 'oomph' factor but is serviceable.
3.0,Product is good but ir should come in different sizes
3.0,"Material is thin.  Strap broke with only 7lbs of packed items. If TSA has to search, the zipper allows for everything to be exposed. Not worth the money paid."
3.0,I got my cufflinks finally. They look fine but a bit on the toyish side. They're pretty light for cufflinks. They do look like made of plastic.
3.0,"Very dainty and pretty. Run a little on the small side. The seams fit snug around the toes. Other then that, they are very feminine and I do like them."
3.0,I wear size 8 for tops like this (not stretchy) and so ordered 12 because of all other people's review saying &#34;too small&#34;. But it was way too big for me after all. I didn't bother to return it because it was still wearable but it makes me look very fat due to the extra room that gives me. I should have probably ordered 10 or even 8 could have been okay. I wish this product was true to the size.
3.0,"Runs very small, had to return.  Cute skirt though!"
3.0,Just received it and love it. Nice surprise that it also came with a case. I would give it a 5 but just realized it isn't polarized- disappointed since that was what I searched for- LianSan Fashion Oversized Women Uv400 Protection Polarized Lady Sunglasses Gold Flower Full Frame Sunglasses Gd103 says it is polarized but description says it isn't-  Is it or isn't it??
3.0,Didn't care for the look once received. The ruffles seemed to be extra long and gave the illusion of a saggy upper region.
3.0,"It looks nice, but the fabric makes it slide up while sitting"
3.0,A little to big but love it
3.0,Very thin cotton material that started to de thread the 2nd time I wore them. Not well made
3.0,"Threads hanging everywhere, sleeves unfinished, far far too small (I normally wear an extra small but ordered a medium).  Darling print, soft material, great cut.  Wish I could fit in it!"
3.0,The logo/artwork is great. The description said Cotton but the actual material is not. It calls for dry clean only.
3.0,"I was so disappointed, really liked the design and the feel of the fabric but it was too small and didn't come in a larger size."
3.0,"Would have liked to try a larger size, but breast area was too small for my 38DDs. Not sure material will be flattering after getting wet because it is sheer."
3.0,the pants fit wonderful disapointed  in the top
3.0,"Definitely does not fit like 2XL. Sizing is more like large at the shoulder and bust. Material is heavy and winter weight. Nice shade of gray. I'm going to keep it despite the tight fit to wear under sweat shirts because the qualityof stitching and material is good. *Fingers-crossed it doesn't shrink. I'll be washing it in cold water, stretch, and line dry."
3.0,"Luggage really did well, except it is made of some type of plastic or polyurethane it all scraped very deep during loading and unloading of plane!"
3.0,"It's a great looking wallet, but it is super stiff. My old wallet used to unfold nicely to allow easy access to cash. This wallet doesn't open as easy and it's a little more difficult to take out and put cash in. I don't think it's a wallet that will break in either, it's very stiff."
3.0,"These fit well enough, and they're nice & thick, but they pill-up really bad, really fast. They're only good for around-the-house wear after one wash."
3.0,It will keep you warm
3.0,I don't get the sizing. In the picture is a nude colored size 2x I ordered directly from the Genie Bra site. The pink is the 2x I just purchased from Amazon which is way too small but I washed before I tried it on assuming it was the same! Argh!
3.0,Way too loose at neckline
3.0,"If you are looking for a regular cheap sweater to wear casually then maybe this would work for you, but not for $30. If you want it for a costume then keep looking. The pictures are very misleading, if not completely inaccurate.<br />-The sleeves are too short and tight<br />-The hood is hilarious. It’s tiny and doesn’t even fit over my head without stretching the whole torso. Forget about any draping you might’ve hoped for. Like a big ol condom on my head.<br />-I actually like the way the lower half fits and if it didn’t cost $30 I could justify it. Otherwise it’s way overpriced for what you’re getting.<br />I’m planning on trying to replace the hood and add some bell sleeves but I’m a novice at sewing so we’ll see how it goes. The fabric is quite thin and doesn’t seem very sturdy so it may not even hold up to much wear anyway. I will try to take some good pictures to post.<br />I’m 5’9”, 145lbs and ordered the medium. Probably could’ve sized up but I don’t think it would’ve fixed the issues entirely."
3.0,"They're really sturdy, don't break when pulled on i have a 1 year old lol. But they turn more of a darker white over time."
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is shorter but muscular than I am in an extra large. It fit so snuggly that it was uncomfortable for him, which he is a 34x30 at 5'6"".  So I am instead wearing it and it is snug on me as well. I'm not sure I'll get much wear from this since the pants barely reach my ankles now,  I'm 5'9"". Maybe purchase 2 sizes up instead of 1 size."
3.0,"These are good in the fall or the Spring but not during Winter. They are too thin for Winter, my feet still get cold in them."
3.0,I ordered this skirt. It seemed well made and it was a good length.  I returned it because it made me look fat n frumpy
3.0,a little small for xlarge
3.0,"These slippers are small.  I wear a 6.5 and should have ordered the 7/8 size. My toes slide off the front.  Other than that, they are comfortable but not like Isotoners or some of the other more expensive brands.  I love the pink color and of course I loved the price when I ordered them but probably would not order these again.  I have purchased another brand and size and will use these for camping/backup."
3.0,Very cute. I am tall waisted so wearing as a tunic with leggings.  I read this runs big but not the case for me it just fit. I  also read that it was very warm.  It’s not thin but I wouldn’t say very warm either.
3.0,They are pretty but not enough she’ll in them and somewhat heavy.
3.0,"The product shipped really quickly. Looks like the description but the fit is off. I’m usually a small in t-shirts, a medium if I want a looser fit. I ordered a small. It’s very wide and short. Just hits below my belly button but is baggy. For someone taller (I’m 5’5”) this might almost fit as a crop top.<br />Nice stretchy soft material."
3.0,It's not perfectly symmetrical but I think I'll live
3.0,"I think this bag is average for a few reasons:<br /><br />The patch, handles and design tell me this bag is basic, well-stitched and secure. It is an average bag good for a variety of uses. Water resistant. I wish they would reinforce the straps with some cushioned padding.<br /><br />I like to provide open, honest and transparent reviews on products I like to try. I was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope this review has been helpful to you. If so, please click the 'Helpful' button to let myself and others know that it has helped you."
3.0,"This is definitely on the smaller size. The ties aren’t as long at the end either, so it’s a snug fit. I would size up. It was soft material and comfortable though. Color was a little deeper than I expected."
3.0,I liked the feel and look of this shirt but it did not fit. It was too small. I measured myself closely and found my chest is 46 inches. I ordered the shirt using their chart for a 46 inch chest and when I got it it was so tight that it poofed out between the buttons.
3.0,They are ok.  Cheaply made.  Get what ya pay for.
3.0,The actual pant had room and fit comfortable but the waistband is way too small! Almost as if they have taken a waist band from a pair of pants too small and sewn them on. If you have any kind of belly puge beware! Returning!
3.0,"I rated only 3 stars because I ordered two gaiters with ear loops and received two gaiters without ear loops. The gaiters are good quality though, and I am using them as back up face covering when I am changing masks. I will keep them and order the other style at a later time. Update 10/7/2020: I ordered the gaiters again and they are still good - BUT - No Ear Loops! Please remove that wording from the description."
3.0,No butt room and rides  down have to keep  pulling  them up
3.0,Pretty bag ! Poorly made zippers
3.0,Way too small. I’m a 36DD and the large is no where near big enough. The quality is pretty low too and the fabric feels like urs coated with something. Not a fan
3.0,"Barely bumped my wrist on a fridge handle , and it broke in half. I got this to support my friend going through breast cancer treatments and am disappointed. Ok for people who never accidentally bump their wrists, I guess."
3.0,"It’s just as pictured but it runs small. There’s also no support for your chest, so be aware."
3.0,XL is 48in long. Returned and ordered Large.
3.0,Pretty but not a good fit for me
3.0,"I like them and they are as pictured. Perfectly comfortable to wear. For being polarized, I don't think they do all that great of a job of reducing sun and glare."
3.0,"Good metal, good value. But only one ball is removable on the bar bells, which makes using them for industrials difficult. And I've yet to even get an end of the studs to come off."
3.0,Great looking belt. My only complaint: it creases and dents fairly easily. Keep this in mind when you store it or wrap it up.
3.0,"ll, ordered a large and very tight, and im fairly skinny ( 6'2, 180)"
3.0,"Like the design But,  you can see your prescription glasses thru them. Not that happy"
3.0,"Light weight, picture on one side"
3.0,I think my boobs are too big for it. Small boobs would work better w/this. But still cute
3.0,The quality was cheaply made
3.0,"The quality of the hat was really good. Looks just like the picture. However, I was not pleased with how long it took to arrive. I ordered it in November 2020 and it took until the middle of January 2021 to arrive. There wasn't any explanation as to why it took so long either. At least I got the product tho."
3.0,These are very nice. Didnt work very well for me was hard to get them on and to stay up.
3.0,Disappointed that two of the ribbon roses had come off.  Will have to try to re glue  them.
3.0,These were not expensive and they do the job.  Not very heavy duty.  I do like the colors.
3.0,Can't  shut off 12 hour alarm and beeps every hour tried everything.
3.0,"I really wanted to love these gloves but they just missed the mark for me. I bought these for work and while they have served me well, I can't help but be a little disappointed. First off, the touch screen capability is not so great. Sometimes it won't register at all so I end up taking off my glove to use my phone. Second, while these are very water resistant, I hesitate to call these completely waterproof. I was working in a mix of rain and snow and my gloves ended up soaked. My hands were mostly dry but there was still moisture getting through. Third, these gloves don't keep my fingers warm. My palms are nice a toasty but my fingers are still freezing."
3.0,They fit great but the war fall off very quickly since they are only glued on
3.0,"Liked design, but too long"
3.0,Their great but the the charm looses the color within the first day
3.0,"The booties themselves are cute and well made - however, I bought the 0-6month size and they are 2 or 3 times the size of the 0-3 month booties I bought elsewhere - which means they are WAY too big for my child, and by the time he grows into them it will be too hot to wear them."
3.0,So cute but the chest and shoulder areas run small for an XL fits everywhere else.
3.0,like..but is not my size
3.0,"Buying cheap clothes on amazon is always a low key game of Russian roulette. This vest wasn’t a complete win. The inside sherpa material is rough, not soft, making the vest look and feel cheap. The faux suede material on the outside is better, and the color is rich, which is why I’m keeping it."
3.0,They’re ok. The flare part is massive. Like it’s not just a little lip to keep it from pulling through your ear. It’s more like a trumpet or something. I wouldn’t order them again. I also am only an 8g so the larger gauges might be different.
3.0,"This product is exactly what I was looking for. It's made of a very thin plastic and I'm not sure how long it will last, but it's somewhat flexible and easy to clip on and off the glasses. There is no installation required of any kind, it just attaches to the sun visor on one side, and glasses are hooked on the outside. It doesn't take two hands to open the clip. The glasses can just be attached in and out with one hand. Very convenient and it keeps my glasses out of the console and glove compartment and within easy reach.<br /><br />Update:<br />As I could expect, this clip didn't last very long. It broke after a month or so (not the spring but the plastic hook). I still like the design and the purpose, however it should be made of some harder plastic rather than the thin clear plastic considering that it's for a daily use. I wouldn't buy again unless quality gets improved."
3.0,"La tela es buena, pero la talla no es exacta"
3.0,"I got this for my husband expecting a regular t-shirt, but was very disappointed when it arrived. The quality is more what I would expect from a cheap woman's shirt rather than a men's in this price range ($27.98). The material is very thin and doesn't seem like it will hold up to heavy wear or more than a year of wear. My husband did say that it was very soft and comfortable though.<br /><br />As for fit, while this is true to size in the body, it also doesn't really seem like it was made for men. It was very tight in the sleeves for him and had an oddly unflattering fit thanks to the slightly-more-fitted bands around the base of the sleeve and bottom of the shirt.<br /><br />Overall, this shirt is one that I would recommend skipping. It's very expensive for the quality and has a very awkward fit."
3.0,Like someone else said in another one star review - most of these 5 star reviews posted within few days in August 2016 are fake.  I bought the product and got it one with loose buckle.  The product would have been good if it was assembled properly.  Note that the width of the belt is more than normal US standards.  I am returning mine as I can't use it anyway.  I would have kept it if I could fix the buckle.  The packaging was impressive.<br /><br />Update:  I was able to fix the buckle by tightening the fallen screw in the box.  Looks better now except it is bit hard to wear with some pants/jeans with smaller hoops.
3.0,"Since these were all the rave around Christmas time, of course my 5 year old grandson just had to have them. I really didn't see the what the big fuss was about and only ordered them to please him. After a second shipping was needed to replace a defective pair, I finally gave them to him and he seemed happy. So I guess they were ok."
3.0,"This Leather is almost paper thin. If you're looking for thicker leather, I would recommend looking somewhere else. It looks somewhat shiny. It didn't look like that in the photos. Not what I expected."
3.0,After a week of casual use kinda beat up. But it’s great for the price.
3.0,"the top of the dress was way big! This was the only thing I hated about the dress. I ordered my size Lg and it fitted my hips, the material great the dress flowed and I received tons of compliments on the dress.  I'm afraid if I had ordered a med then my hips would have been tight and the top would have fitted... lol... however it is a pretty dress."
3.0,its very pretty but a little small
3.0,It got stiff what's a flexible
3.0,"It was described as a flannel jacket, was very disappointed when I opened and it was a still material with a scratchy backing. The color was beautiful but I did send back."
3.0,"To be honest, I find this insulting.<br />If this is supposed to be ""two inches"", then I must be hallucinating. Without the loop/hook, this is Barely 1.25"". Even with it, the length is only an additional .5 (Maybe).<br />Nearly $100 for this? I would say that's kind of overpriced, even for .925 silver. If it were pure gold, then yes; I could fathom that price (and then some). But honestly, this is kind of an embarrassment.<br />I would return it, but I don't even think I could, for one. And for two, I just don't see the point."
3.0,"Beautiful piece, but it must have been designed for child sized necks. I had to get an extension piece just to get it to fit."
3.0,"Fit well, fabric isn’t the greatest and when stretched you can see through it"
3.0,These glasses had a weak frame that busted with regular use.
3.0,It us a but bulky and the gold finish begins to rub off after not much time
3.0,Y'all should post the real picture of the item u selling to the buyers. Thanks
3.0,"Very nice material, beautiful colors, just made very small.  I always order xl.  Too tight everywhere....fit more like a medium."
3.0,At first they were thinner than I had hoped. But the quality holds up well. These are not for sub zero Temps.
3.0,Not good support for large breast girls
3.0,"I am short...5'2 so I needed a shorter tummy cincher. This was the perfect height but it does run REALLY small. I got a medium, my normal size but it was way too tight so I just use it at night to help shape my waist while I sleep."
3.0,So pretty but to small
3.0,The necklace is very pretty. And looks the way the description described it and the picture had shown it to be. My only complaint would be it does not glow like description stated. I had friends warned me about ordering it stating that they had gotten similar items from the same company and others that stated they would glow and they didn't I took my chances and I must say I'm disappointed in that it does not glow at all no matter how long I've left it out in natural light and artificial light it will not glow and that was my main reason for buying it. Craftsmanship is decent it's not as well-made as could have been if you catch the tips of the Moon on clothing or anything it will bend very easily so you do have to be careful in that manner but overall the look of it is very pretty. If it would glow it would be very gorgeous to see but as it doesn't in my opinion the seller should have to remove that out of their posting due to its false information.
3.0,Super cute!! Good quality but it was so large for my 7 week old baby.
3.0,It served its purpose but fit small and the fingertips had a lot of left over material that bothered. Wasn't able  to wear them for long.
3.0,"Great looking watch, but the quality  is sub par.  The band that holds the strap down broke off,and the watch band is fraying at the edges.  The watch itself also loses time quite frequently."
3.0,"This is a very large fit.  I will be able to wear it with leggings, but only until that's no longer in style."
3.0,These run short. I m tall so this is always a problem. Wish these company would list length.
3.0,"The vest is an ok product itself, but we ordered an XL, my husband is typically a Medium, but we new to order up. Honestly, the XL was like a Small on him..so if youre a medium, order like an XXL!"
3.0,The post ruins the earring with a big fake rhinestone.
3.0,nice shirt- sleeves are a tight!!!
3.0,Delivery was good but product different from pictures.
3.0,"I ordered this product based off of my measurements compared with what they suggest. The top fit fine. The skirt was huge! I pinned the skirt and made it work, because it was still cute and doable. However, I wore this for less than four hours and the front of the skirt started to come apart.  All I did was walk around in it and maybe 5 minutes of dancing so that was disappointing.  The only downfall to the corset is I wished it was lined better in the breast area. Especially for busty women."
3.0,Cheap  material
3.0,Unfortunately I bought this for a friend's birthday gift. I loved the design. But the shirt does not fit right in the chest area. I recommend layering if you wear it outside your house.
3.0,These were cute and my sister loves them but one of the little leather straps on the side is coming loose already. :(
3.0,I loved the purple dress design print.  But when I tried it on I realized that the fabric was similar to drapery fabric that tends to have a stiffness thus the dress didn't drape well.  It made my hips look big and I don't have much hips.  In addition the sleeves had a puffiness on top so whenever I brought my arms up there was a standing point above my shoulder.  I was hoping to use this dress for dancing but between the stiffness of the fabric and the Eiffel Tower on top of my shoulders I returned the dress.
3.0,the stones are blue not black and one of the teardrops not connected! You get what you pay for!!
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the white loop earrings.  They look like they were sprayed very sloppy, therefore making them look cheap."
3.0,"This is EXACTLY the same short as the Baleaf Women's Cycling Padded Shorts Black UPF 50+, but $10 more.  It even has the leaf logo on the left leg, which doesn't show in the photo."
3.0,I wear a large 12/14 I ordered a XXL - is a MEDIUM - I CAN PUT IT ONE AND IT LOOKS AMAZING - AS LONG AS I DO NOT WANT TO MOVE. IF IT FIT WOULD BE AMAZING.
3.0,I'm 5'4&#34; 140ish. I generally wear a 6 pants. But it's was too tight in the waist to zip up. And a little longer than I anticipated. It was nice quality though. I might try again in the shorter version.
3.0,Small but looks cute as hell
3.0,"It’s super cute, stylish and not too clunky. However it does not fit tinier wrists well. Had to puncture extra holes to get it to fit."
3.0,"The pictures make this clip look really nice. In reality it's fine, but not quite up to the expectations. I expect the paint will chip and the leather wrap will start to separate very soon."
3.0,"Looks just as advertised, but the main issue I had was one of the feather charms came off by only day 2 of wearing it."
3.0,"It's pretty but the material is cheap. The straps are really long. Don't buy this swimsuit if you have large breasts, there's no support."
3.0,Bought to wear when in a family vacation.  Not the greatest fit.
3.0,Overall this is a great costume but the hair piece sucks. We bought a wig from Amazon for like $6. Totally worth it.
3.0,Flimsy buttons
3.0,I wanted to love this suit but it didn't fit me.  I ordered the small and it fit everywhere but the top.  I am a B cup and you probably need to be a C to fill it out.
3.0,"I do wish the mask were a bit taller. It covers my nose and mouth, but it often uncovers when I speak to someone."
3.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This top is very comfortable.  The fabric is soft and stretchy.  The neckline is comfortable.  The shirt is very loose-fitting and flowy.  Unfortunately I find it to be too oversized and overwhelming on my body.  It just hangs on me and the armpits are too low.  Not flattering at all.
3.0,i was looking for compression socks to wear with sneakers. i have trouble with almost all compression socks so my disastisfaction with this is probably more my problem than the sock. it's generally fine and the fabric is comfortable. i loved them for a few minutes- but then the top felt like it was diging into my skin and i had to take them off
3.0,"Cute bracelet! Perfect for a night out, a little to fancy with the size of the stones for everyday wear."
3.0,"These chip clips are super cute, but 3 of them cracked within the first week of use, and we aren't tossing them around or anything. Glad I bought them overall, but could be better manufactured."
3.0,"I really like the style of this backpack purse. I get lots of compliments. I didn't give it all the stars because after a week's vacation one of the seams by the straps is coming apart. This is disappointing because I haven't owned it that long, and I was really impressed by the quality at first."
3.0,"Well made, but runs very small.  I wear a Large and order an XL to be safe, but even that is way too small.  Gave it to my daughter who wears a junior's medium."
3.0,Received a used item with someone’s sock in the foot part
3.0,I  had hoped for a  women's watch with female speech.  I  do not care for the male boice and cannot change it.  I  am legally blind.
3.0,Pants are VERY small.  Almost like it was a smaller size.  Shirt was fine.
3.0,looks good and working fine
3.0,Meh. Little five year old hands can’t really get the clasp done or undone. And the stretch material is too heavy duty for a small child to be able to stretch it. Like the adult version for myself much more.
3.0,"It's a little big, but I got it for comfort. It is very comfortable!"
3.0,fits but doesn't do its job well. good thing its comfy.
3.0,"The watch looks and feels great but here are some flaws in the design, in my opinion.<br /><br />- In timer and stopwatch mode, minutes are shown on the secondary little dial, and the dial is too small, so it is difficult to see how many minutes exactly it shows. It gets even worse if the main hour or minute hand (which are quite thick actually) covers part of the secondary dial. It would be better if they used the main dial for these two functions.<br /><br />- The light does not really help see the whole dial, it light only a little corner of it.<br /><br />- You have to unscrew the crown before you can use it. And the manual says that if you do not screw it in after using, the watch loses water resistance. I think it is way too easy to forget to screw it in.<br /><br />- The mobile phone app lets you use the stopwatch and the timer functions, but if you have and use your phone, when why do you need your watch as a timer ?<br /><br />- I got the watch during winter time, when there is not much sun light and I had really hard time to get its battery charge fully. I had to put it at the window for 2 days to help it reach fully charged state. Although I have not run out of battery charge yet, I worry about it a little."
3.0,I ordered this for postpartum support. Maybe I ordered wrong but the band keeps rolling down and creasing. It is pretty thick and seems sturdy.
3.0,I thought it would be much longer but didn’t quite look like the image. The item came with a hair net to go with.
3.0,I returned this one. It was stitched  crooked
3.0,Overall good quality but did not come with the face tattoos/stickers.
3.0,The color was pretty and the fabric of a decent quality for the price. I would say this isn't the best dress for those with a fuller bust. It technically fit but wasn't as flatting and caused the dress to ride a little higher.
3.0,very good quality. But size is running way too big.
3.0,larger than &#34;standard&#34; - nice fabric though
3.0,The dress is soft and flattering.  The pattern I received looked nothing like the picture and I had to return it
3.0,This was considerably smaller than projected and templated in the pictures.  It seems to be cheaply made.
3.0,"As a taller female, I opted for the men's cut for additional length. While the length IS good, I would not consider these &#34;compression&#34; shirts whatsoever. The material is comfortable but extremely thin, and &#34;ordering a size up&#34; proved unnecessary in my experience. Perhaps look elsewhere (or order a size smaller) if you are looking for the advertised compression aspect."
3.0,The bodice was a perfect fit. Just couldn't stand the neck area...
3.0,It's a baggy fit however the fabric is very coarse and somewhat like a rag. It still is flowy and I would recommend it because it's very cheap for the price it is offered at.
3.0,Myself and a friend tried to attach these to the luggage but were unable to get one of them open to attach.<br />I  like the design but if you can't get them open there not worth having.  Returned
3.0,"Sleeves are a little tight, but the rest of it fit okay. Fabric is flimsy."
3.0,"They stick as designed. But HEAVEN FORBID you have to relift a tiny portion to readjust; because once it sticks and you lift, it doesn't stick again. Def lower quality pasties I've used, even of the single use variety. Either way, worth the money paid for these since they were inexpensive."
3.0,They look awesome. The problem is they are just too big. They don’t stay sinched so you have to either knot them or constantly retighten. They may be cute on an ankle though.
3.0,Not sold on it yet- has a &#34;odor&#34; so hopefully in time it will go away- I love the color so for the price it works.
3.0,The gaitor is fine. Pretty stretchy. They sent me the wrong color. Ordered standard blue like what is pictured received a baby blue one.
3.0,"design makes cups way too small for larger girls. the other bras, that are not racerback are perfect! i love them. will order more of those."
3.0,"The clasp was already broken so that is a bummer. For the cheap price I'll just use it as part of our fairy garden setup for my child, but its a shame that the clasp wasn't working.  It lookes nice and antiqued.  cool aged brass color chain."
3.0,"It's an OK shirt, but nothing particularly special. It fits as expected, a tad loose. It's tagged, which is NOT a good thing. I don't know if I'll buy another. I'll have to wait and see how it wears, and washes, over a fair period of time.  I bought it because I need some new shirts, and I like raglan sleeves."
3.0,"I’m pretty sure this company is on the smaller side and has to bootstrap a lot of their development which definitely shows. It’s great that they are trying to provide a product like this and look forward to future versions. As of right now this is pretty half baked.<br /><br />My one MAJOR gripe is that in addition to the shock factor, I was looking for something silent that wouldn’t wake up my wife when I get up at 4am. The silent mode, IS NOT silent. Even with the beeps set to OFF in the mobile app, before it zaps you, there is this ever increasing in volume/pitch sound/hum that sounds like something is about to explode. It’s great for me and my adrenaline, not great for anyone else in the room trying to sleep.<br /><br />The zap strength is good but like others have mentioned, may not be strong enough for people with a pretty high pain tolerance.<br /><br />Ended up having to return it. If you go on their website, they have a Version 3 which looks promising. Bummer it’s a whole hundred bucks more."
3.0,It's ok. Sleeves wide
3.0,"The item image is deceptive, when I ordered this item i was expecting something nearly as large as a book but upon receiving it it is TINY maybe 2'' when fully extended. It still looks nice and functions as a telescope (albeit a weak one) but I was upset with it's size (that's what she said!) Anyway it's not a bad item in itself but the picture is deceptive, make sure to read the product details and don't purchase this if your wanting a full scale telescope!"
3.0,Sleeves are a bit short (I'm 5'7&#34;) and one of them has a hole in the seam. It is a very flattering piece if you are thin.
3.0,"I love the Melissa line, but this one may be a dud. When I saw them I was excited. Rainbow colors! Perfect for a six-year old. When I showed them to my daughter, I could see immediately she had reservations. Yes, they did have rainbows, but there was something bulky about them. “Just try them on.” I urged. She did. “They’re heavy, Mom.” And that was it. I knew they would have to go back. Despite having rainbows on them, they were nothing like walking on a cloud"
3.0,"I've owned this bag for a year and a half, and while I love the size and the feel of it, the look is now awful.  Both sides of the bag have picked up blue dye, I think from carrying it while wearing jeans.  I don't know whether the bag simply wasn't sealed properly, or what, but I've never had this problem with other purses or briefcases.  I've not yet figured out a leather cleaner that will remove this dye.  So great bag with respect to design, but not the greatest finish on the outside."
3.0,"There were a few very nice beads. One was an authentic Pandora bead which is very pretty. A few others were nice enough to fill my bracelet till I can get higher quality beads. I did receive duplicates of one bead,and a few others were very poor quality. Not bad for $20 with free shipping for prime members. I doubt I would repurchase, but I'll keep what I received."
3.0,Cute—not sewn vey well. Motor fell off after five houses of trick-or-treating. Luckily we had duct tape on hand!
3.0,This hat fits okay but not as shown.  There does not seem to be as much material to get the look that is pictured since it fit me more close to the head all the way around.  I kept it anyway.
3.0,"Description says it's 10mm diameter, but they fail to explain that's the width. It's 7mm top to bottom, which will not fit my septum."
3.0,I ordered the womens sweats as it says and these are like parachute pants and more fitted.
3.0,"Looks great and fancy but if you want to go for a quality, I would say it’s a no"
3.0,"pretty, the glue showed on the rose so I had to color it in with a red marker. In the lighting at the party I wore it for it wasn't noticeable. nice for the price."
3.0,"The shirt was way too small (I ordered an XL).<br />The material is thin and stretchy, so unless you have a perfect figure or you are going to wear it under something else, this is probably not the best choice for you."
3.0,I’ve always wanted a pair of these. Yes they are comfortable... BUT the pair that I received you can see the glue on the toes and I don’t like that. Also the Velcro piece to hold the laces in place fell off. All I did was try them on smh..
3.0,The waist band was too thick for me. It was a huge strip of uncovered elastic.
3.0,Not true to size at all but the price was good if they actually fit.
3.0,"I am not a fan of cotton underwear...and I knew that purchasing, but thought I would try another set.  They fit as expected though and are cute.  I have washed them at least once and only 1 pair loosened at the seem."
3.0,It is teensy. Check sizing before purchase.
3.0,"While it is a nice color and size, and I like the feel of the leather, I bought this for the RFID protection.  Nothing in the packaging explain which parts were protected.  I can guess that the inside pockets are protected (??) but what about the outside pockets?<br /><br />Overall if you are going to say that this is RFID blocking, you should clearly state which parts are covered."
3.0,The words have bubbled up a bit and I’ve only wash it twice. Size is true. Sweatshirt soft.
3.0,"the suit is cute, but fits in a way that not super complimenting in the back.  I thought the whole point of a suit like this was to compliment a shape that is not bikini ready"
3.0,too small i sent them back.
3.0,Like the earrings. But back I'd too small.  Hard to hold and place on post.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she really liked them. They look just as cute as in the photos, they look a bit small and we had our doubts but fit  perfectly on my girlfriend's feet (she's 7½), however the left panda sandal tore just one week and she had to sew it."
3.0,Too small around the arms. It’s also made in China which isn’t a plus either.
3.0,"Measured weight is 7 g.  Seems quite overpriced.  The length is a few mm longer than the very similar Ti-EDC carabiner, but slightly more dainty.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Ti-EDC carabiner is a better buy.  Search for ""Ti-EDC Titanium High Strength 41mm Quick Release Keychain Carabiner Snap Hook (2pcs)"".  The Ti-EDC weighs 6 g and is rated to a much higher load.  The quality control on the Ti-EDC is not as good as the BANG Ti though, and it is not as nicely finished."
3.0,"Got this for my son's Charlie Brown theme birthday party. The shoes were a liiiiiittle wide. But since they have laces, you can kind of bridge that gap on top. The material is soft and he got tons of complements, but as a previous pester stated, he only wore them for one day, maybe 5 hours and the material was already coming off. From afar I though it was just dust/lint and then I realized the material had rubbed off. Not a high quality faux suede"
3.0,"decent product, but they tend to bag out and lose their shape/fit after a short time."
3.0,Wanted to like this bra but it gives my chest a weird shape and doesn’t look flattering underneath but clothing.  I’m sad to say I don’t like it.
3.0,Several did not work upon arrival- for the price I didn't care much- but the ones that worked were great for little party favors!
3.0,Nice looking but too small to be practical.
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, ~125 lbs and 34A. I first ordered an XS. The material is very clingy, especially around the hips, so I returned that one and ordered a small. This is a comfortable fit, like pajamas. While my office is very casual, I would not wear this to work. It's a little long, but I think flats will still work. I ordered the &#34;blue&#34; which  is really an eggplant/purple color. The fabric comes out of the package very wrinkled. I hung it up and most of the wrinkles fell out overnight."
3.0,"I got a bigger head so I like my hats to be a bit bigger too, this hat is great quality but it feels way too small for me"
3.0,I liked the feel of this dress but it just doesn't lay quite right.  Good enough for a funeral I suppose.
3.0,"Is absolutely huge.  Make no mistake, it seems to work well, is light weight and durable, but the face might as well have eyebrows and a mouth.  I would have no qualms about calling it gaudy and excessive for something that's supposed to go on your wrist. Other than that, pretty good."
3.0,"Pretty, decent quality for the price, but the lace on the top flipped forward, making it awkward.  I had such high hopes too. I returned it.  Bras are such a personal thing, it may fit different on another person."
3.0,It's a little flimsy. Ok for the price I guess.
3.0,"I am a pear shape so the bottoms fit, as expected. However, the top was ridiculously large. Due to the other reviews about the top being too small for most, I thought this would possibly work. Unfortunately, the top looked like Madonna cones more then breasts. The bottoms fit well but didn't do much to accentuate the natural waste as I had hoped they would. Overall, the design and product seemed nice but I would urge you to reconsider if you are not hourglass and encourage getting individual pieces for the suit."
3.0,We tried to order a toddler.  BUT he loves it wont take it off lol
3.0,"I have a size 12 men's foot (american) and some of the socks fit fine, while others were slightly too small. The smaller ones that I had to stretch out a little to get my foot inside, all ended up with holes in them at the big toe. This didn't happen until about 4 or 5 months after purchasing the socks. For what I paid for, I guess I shouldn't have expected the best quality. To end on a positive note, they have silicone grips on the insides heel portion of the sock to prevent them from slipping off the heel and under the foot. They worked great."
3.0,Very cute and chic but oh so short! Size 8 woman’s is a large!
3.0,"I bought these for the aviator “style” without the nose pieces that get caught in my hair when I put them on my head.  Overall they are great, but the lenses are closer together than regular aviators, so the look is off a little."
3.0,"It's pretty, but ran way too large."
3.0,Such a cute look
3.0,"Black dress<br />Ordered a XXL (normally wear a 16/18) and it was snug, but still fit fairly well.<br /><br />Blue dress<br />Ordered a XXL (normally wear a 16/18) and it was way too small. However it fit my daughter that wears an 8/10 women’s."
3.0,Cheap lenses that distort your image. Instant headache.<br /><br />Edit: They are super cute and after wearing them a few times I’ve gotten more used to them.
3.0,Was great with the size was not crazy about the flower pattern.
3.0,Not real impressed.  My son had a hard time keeping them on.
3.0,"My stepson loves them, came earlier than expected."
3.0,Im usually a small so I purchased in a small. Didn't fit well around my hips. Would have had to buy it in a larger size but then it would have fit too big up top. I returned it.
3.0,I got the biggest size because it looked like a fashionnova model and their clothes are always small. I WAS RIGHT! Waist is the perfect size and they are long enough for my legs. I thought they would be made of thick cotton but they are really thin and synthetic. I still love them though. I rolled down the waistband just because I don’t like high waisted stuff but I always do that.
3.0,"It is a nice top, but didn't like the fabric. all wrinkled after washing it, and was very hard to iron."
3.0,A little too tight to be comfortable. Made for smaller head than mine.
3.0,Cute but cheap you get what you pay for!
3.0,Comfortable and resist odors. Takes quite a while to dry on the trail and definitely creates uniboob.
3.0,"Looks nice price is Great but it's a little narrow even for a regular faces watch the what I mean is the band width doesn't cover the pins to fit flush with the bottom of the watch face and I had to take it to a jeweler to get the clasp adjusted($15.00 more bucks) toget it adjusted Its nice it just needs some tweaking, The clasp itself was is the real issue, its tough to close, very tricky.  Not sure I'd buy again though."
3.0,"This is a very well made costume; however, for me the proportions were a little off which is why I had to make the return. Definitely make sure to measure yourself and do the custom sizing option if possible."
3.0,"decent warm gloves,  just seem to get wet quickly"
3.0,"It's fine, and does it's job. It's made of this cheaper than polyester elastic stuff. Besides that, it's fine. I could have made it myself though, given the cheap materials used. Honestly. If I'm going to buy a harness, I want it to be because I couldn’t just go to micheals and buy the stuff to half asked hand sew together.<br /><br />It's okay though. I can't be angry because it was awfully cheap<br />Fine for what it is"
3.0,Baught a 2x the size of a 4 x esxected it to be stiff due to material type and it is but they run ver big if you are a 1x get a large
3.0,"I loved the material and the way they were made, but they run almost two sizes small."
3.0,It's ok but not what I though it would be.
3.0,Cheaply made. Just what I expected with paying so little.
3.0,They are nice looking athletic compression socks  with good support.  I can feel my circulation improve when I am wearing them.  My only issue is that after about three or four hours they start to pinch me around the knee.  I'm wearing them to work out mainly and then change into something else when I'm done.<br /><br />I do like the black and bright blue color.  The construction is sturdy you won't have holes in the toes or heels after three or four washings.  Something with the fit just doesn't agree with my body type as after a few hours I feel that pinch around the knee.<br /><br />Still for the price I think its a good value.
3.0,Runs SMALL. Might be duable to wear under a skirt or pants. Very pretty however.
3.0,Kind of grandma looking
3.0,"I ordered a size SMALL. I thought from the pictures that this dress would appear to be more vibrant. Personally, the flowers just didn't look as bright and colorful as I had hoped and it ended up looking more like a maternity dress on me. I am an athletic build, with a small waist (29&#34;) and broad shoulders. It fit everywhere except the back didn't allow for any movement and I couldn't raise my arms comfortably (like if I was driving) if that makes sense. The length and waist were perfect (I am 5' 5&#34;). The V-neck was a larger so I would have needed to safety pin it or just make sure the wind didn't blow the wrong way. If I would have gotten the medium the V-neck would have been way to big."
3.0,Zipper on opposite side and poorly made. Runs small
3.0,Weren’t as thick and soft as I imagined. Good selection for the price.
3.0,Gloves didn't come in sizes.<br />Too big for me. Kept dropping my glassware. 😊
3.0,"I liked the fabric and the fit of these jeans through the legs. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the rise. These jeans are meant to sit way below the waistline which is not acceptable for me to wear this in the office. I have since noticed that the photos for all the &#34;PamajaJeans&#34; show them sitting well below the belly button. If this manufacturer would offer the same style with a longer rise, I would happily buy them."
3.0,"If you thought this would be a flattering shirt I want you to know I did too but we are both wrong, you see this shirt has short sleeves and it's kinda short lengthwise so for whatever reason it makes your torso look shorter<br />If it wasn't for the shortness of it the material is otherwise good and durable but yeah , won't wear it"
3.0,"I loved this sweater, but it's like child sized....like SMALL child-sized. I'm tiny... 110lbs 5'1&#34; and I ordered a small or xs. ... I like crop tops but this was uncomfortable, didnt even want to see how small it form of a washed it.... Not a. Comfy enough fabric to have that tight.... It came up to my upper ribs. I may buy this again if I get a medium ONLY mind you i wear a 0/2 and xs on the reg"
3.0,They are made of a cheap plastic and the wood definitely isn't the same color as what it appears in the picture.. All in all you get what you pay for and their not bad for $8-10 just wish the wood was a little darker in real life. I chose the amber color lenses and I like that part a lot.
3.0,Not for left handers
3.0,I thought this wallet came with an adjustable neck strap but I guess I confused it with another one. This is bothersome and I'm disappointed that it doesn't because how can it possibly be safe to use if you have to carry it with no secure strap of some time. I may have to return it. I'll have to take a better look at it when I get a moment.
3.0,Nice looking and form fitting so you can feel feminine and not like you're wearing a garbage bag. Material is very lightweight and has not stood up well to dog nails.
3.0,This is NOT silver. It is a pretty piece of costume jewelry though and for $2-3 it's enjoyable.
3.0,Cute but the holes on the sleeves are way smaller than on the picture. And its tight around the chest area
3.0,I use support socks for my compression to my legs.
3.0,Looks cuter without arms thru sleeves! Cheap material..had to steam it like crazy
3.0,"I like this sweater a lot, but the reason it's only three stars is that they use a terribly pathetic zipper that comes apart too easily. Zip-up sweaters are worthless if the zipper isn't strong enough to hold together. I had a leather jacket with a weak zipper once, but that was hundreds of dollars, so it was worth having a better zipper installed for $50. This is $36, so with a weak zipper it's just a waste if time and money."
3.0,I have only had the band for about a week and so far so good. The only reason I gave it only 3 stars is because if u use the watch covers that cover the entire watch this band don't fit properly unless u cut the covers so as the band will fit properly.
3.0,Loved these glasses. I like the oversized look so these were perfect for me used them everyday. A little tight but didn’t mind. Giving 3 stars cause it broke after a couple months
3.0,"I wanted to like this bikini, but since you can't mix and match the sizes of the top and bottom, it didn't fit well. The top was WAAAAY to big, but the bottom was just right.<br /><br />Size 16, bought 3XL"
3.0,I should have looked at the measurements. It was a little longer and larger than I expected it to be based on other clothing I have purchased at an XL. I felt it needed to be tighter around the waist. It is still a cute top though. The arms fit well and the neckline is good.
3.0,A good heavy weight close knit sweater but a little small for me and short sleeves for my long arms
3.0,"Adorable, pero la tela es un poco dura"
3.0,"When I was reading all the reviews, they all seemed to say to order up a size or a half-size, so I did.  They are too large.  *SIGH*  But, they are comfortable and easy to slide on and off my feet, so I'm wearing them.<br /><br />They don't have a lot of cushioning in them, which is really what I was looking for, but I do like the rubber soles (so I can wear them either in the house or outside)"
3.0,Looks fake but with style
3.0,No me gusto porque me quedo grande y tuve q mandarlo arreglar pero lo disfrutamos mucho el día de Halloween
3.0,"They are ok, cheap pair for work or wearing out to the store. Not very stiff and sturdy, don't stay tight to my head when I have them pushed up like my previous set. They'll do the job until they wear out and I'll upgrade to a slightly better quality"
3.0,"Pretty cheap quality, but it serves its purpose. I had a little trouble putting it on, but once I did it feels comfortable and light."
3.0,"Mines came with 7 rings not as described but they refunded my money and I reordered them and the same issue, the rings are cute but I can’t wear them due to nickel allergy.  Customer service as far as responsiveness is good but either don’t check product before shipping or it’s a false description."
3.0,Runs abot small. I'm 5'4 120lbs
3.0,Today is the second I am wearing this t-shirt and I lost one button already.
3.0,"It was a bit too yellow for my taste, and the whiteness of the rhinestones was not as pronounced as it appeared to be in the pictures. But overall it’s okay."
3.0,"Looks great, however this version is too heavy.  I purchased the shorter/wider version of this bag and it much better."
3.0,"I ordered it in white, they sent it to me in black.  I just decided to keep it though, it grew on me."
3.0,I sent it as a gift for my daughter to use to contain all her water exercise equipment. I actually never saw it. Her only remark was that it was not big enough.
3.0,"I have a large wrist so didn't fit comfortable,  but gave to friend who loves it."
3.0,I love the necklace but the earrings tore up quickly.
3.0,The material is a little thin but it works.
3.0,These socks do not stay on my feet
3.0,"These are cute, but definitely cheaply made. They are a little flimsy and I'm worried they will break."
3.0,Wonderful wallet. A little annoyed that the zip gets stuck underweight. But just what I needed
3.0,"Pretty color.  Shinier than I expected.  It turned out to be too scratchy for me to wear, but I might give it to someone else who has less sensitive skin."
3.0,Love the dress and material and it arrived just in time. I need it for a wedding so exchanging it at this point was not gonna work.  I will just say that someone if there is a quality control isn't doing their job. I'm just glad that I know how to sew!!
3.0,Pierden color al lavarlas
3.0,"Very thin material,shrunk after being washed."
3.0,"Ok shirt, baggy in the back requiring substantial tucking and pulling---continuously.  Tie is cheaper, but fine enough for casual wear."
3.0,Interesting design but cuts small around the hips and I got a large and am a size 6.
3.0,Not real jersey material... a bit disappointing but it does the job.
3.0,Lost diamond out
3.0,"I had to order 2 sizes up because they run small. And also, you have to wash it in a delicates bag  and you cannot put in dryer or the lace will get ruined. Other than that, it’s nice thick material, so soft and comfortable to sleep in. I ordered all the colors except red"
3.0,"If you want it to fit as shown, order larger. The main fabric is like a tshirt"
3.0,Very cute! However the beads falls off and the peace sign does not stay in the chain!
3.0,Returned- Suggest you order one size up.  Would work well as layer.  Very thin material but it's soft.
3.0,I had to order the next size higher. I'm usually a 7 1/2 - 8 and I had to order the 8-9.
3.0,"Cute and comfy, but too ripped to be stylish"
3.0,The belt smells horrible and the buckle's locking mechanism is iffy.
3.0,Strap broke about month after I got it.  🤔☹
3.0,Look great I ordered one size larger and it still ripped at the seams in the seat but I still like the looks and feel so I’ll resew the seams. I did order a<br />Lambskin jeans before and they ripped the first time I wore them. Overall cheap thin leather and very poor sewing but if you never sit down it would be ok!
3.0,They do not fit wide ear curves
3.0,Will wear as a shirt. Product was not represented well in the photo
3.0,Would order a size larger for waist comfort
3.0,"Quality is much better than the Invisibelt although at $28, it is still  too expensive for what essentially is an elastic band with a metal buckle."
3.0,Definitely size up AT LEAST 2 sizes. Quality is cheap for sure. It's not even worth the $6.99 I paid for it... :(
3.0,"These pants are super thin, they definitely not sweatpants."
3.0,very cute. It was a little thinner than I wanted but I like it
3.0,The rings run kind of big so they aren’t really middie
3.0,The embroidery on the chest leaves surrounding fabric permanently wrinkled...
3.0,"These socks offer slight padding on the ball of the foot and  and keep your toes cozy and protected. They are a lighter color than depicted in the photo, closer to a color called Nude. Will keep the socks, but in the wear test with a mary jane slide the socks rolled down over the toes."
3.0,"I ordered this as a ‘try me’ and am not totally sold.  The small leaf piece doesn’t fit on my ear as the photos show.  I am sure it is going to be different with everyone.  The overall look is cute, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
3.0,So...No complaints about the features. Bought to make survival collars for my dogs. Clasp unfortunately is located just right to be opened almost every time the dogs scratch at their necks. Problem solved with a zip tie. Great product for a man. Bad idea for a dog.
3.0,The material is a bit heavy and not very soft.
3.0,Thinner than most gaiters.  Arrived with hole.
3.0,"Mostly this blouse fits well, except in the shoulders. The poofs sit a little low on my shoulder, which doesn't give the nice look I was hoping for. I do really like the shirt except for the shoulders."
3.0,Love the way it looks me
3.0,"This skirt is nicely made and it fit me well but the fabric itself was much more stiff and shiny than I was expecting. I'm 5'8&#34; and it hits just below my knee and I ordered my size based on the sizing chart provided. I will be returning it because I don't like that there isn't much movement in the fabric, but that is only a personal preference of mine. Overall it's a nice skirt, just not what I specifically wanted."
3.0,"sized wrong, A 7 5/8 is an XL, a 7 7/8 is a XXL, this is according to the Bureau of Weights and Measures."
3.0,Not the tr90 lightweight glasses I ordered before . Big nosepiece and very heavy
3.0,This backpack is amazing it has a lot of room to store babies needs. It was delivered on time the only reason I give it 3 stars it because it is a huge backpack I was looking for something smaller like a medium size but this backpack it so big that I am embarrassed to go anywhere with it other then that it perfect
3.0,1 came broken
3.0,"Very light weight and flimsy, were not mirrored like suggested."
3.0,It's a nice looking watch but really heavy. There's a stopwatch component that was nice for taking vitals....while it worked. I have only been using it 3 days a week since purchasing it a few months back so it's disappointing that didn't work longer. Changing the date on it is a giant pain so I don't bother. The regular second hand is accurate though and it has held up otherwise to the beating I have given it.
3.0,Material is alright but silky and i was expecting it differently. The length was too short on the bottom and the torso.
3.0,Fits well.... love the dress... but it is completely  see thur.... and by it being the length  it  is . ...it will be hars to find a slip that will fit it.... still  working  it out
3.0,This dress is very short. If I lift my arms the bottom of the dress comes up past my butt cheeks. I am 5'6&#34; and got the size small. It is very comfy and I wore it with tights to minimize the cheekiness but then it kept getting stuck to my tights and riding up. It's still cute but I think I will have to wait for spring weekends to wear this.
3.0,"its not exactly a swing dress as pictured. Chiffon material with built in slip. Non-elastic waist. Somewhat large. If you wear size 12 dresses, Large will fit, and about 1/2 inch wider in waist. If you wear size 10, then medium will do you. flowers on yellow dress are not bright, but more gold yellow,. Belt comes with dress; but no  belt loops. I will keep."
3.0,"Sizes must be men's sizes? Still seems big even for men sizes tho. Way too big to wear for us. Much bigger than other ones we've bought on Amazon. Other than that, it looks as expected."
3.0,I think in stead of M should be an L
3.0,It was a gift and it is liked a lot
3.0,"I love the red color since I am an Ohio State football fan and the warm weather likes shorts at this time!  I discovered the right hand pocket was not sewn well at the bottom edges, left a big hole in it...no place for car keys or money and my cell phone is in the left pocket. Glad I know how to sew to fix this problem! The cuff on the leg area looks bad and not constructed well...not able to fix this area! Will not buy again!"
3.0,"This is a two piece and I didn’t not like the slip. Made the dress not flow as nicely, my boobs were being cut off from the slip and didn’t care for it"
3.0,I really wanted to like this sweater. It is cute but not oversized like advertised. If you are looking for a batwing shirt and don't want it oversized - it's for you. The material is a bit see through as well so you will need a tank underneath. I revived this at a discount for my honest review.
3.0,Not happy with the fit of the top.
3.0,Cute but several pieces were not glued together
3.0,"Beautiful, good size.  I got compliments on them.<br />But...the plating has already worn away on one earring, and I am sensitive to the metal underneath."
3.0,"Top is too small, the seama<br />In the bottom are not properly finished."
3.0,It's ok...im 6'1 a size 18/20  and busty so it hits right below my stomach....which is fine. Nothing special just a cozy cape
3.0,Just really thin.
3.0,Had to get it tailored to take in the sides and the length. The heavy zipper down the back caused the light fabric to hang awkwardly in the back.
3.0,"Too long for my wrist, The brown one is cheap leather like material"
3.0,Wasn’t exactly what I thought it would be!
3.0,"Suit is not lined, and cut narrow on the backside bottom area."
3.0,I've had these bands for 2 weeks and one is already broke.
3.0,"This bag is beautiful. Very well made. Roomy - great as a carry on. The only problem I had with it was the odor. Still today, I can smell the bag from a distance."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:6c68d00d26780ba0a1869f36d97c2c73]] Runs small. Couldn’t fit typical size even though it has elastic in back - does not stretch much.  See video. Order up a size.  Shorts have a slightly grey hue. See pic. Nita’s blue as most jeans.  95 lb 4’ 8” daughter could not fit in small.<br /><br />I received this item for free but the opinions are my own and are honest.
3.0,Very short for being 5’5. Had to return.
3.0,"It's a nice dress for the price. My issue was how the dress's pattern stretched unflatteringly at my curvy hips.  The material stretches but the diluted material at the sexiest part of my hourglass made it look a bit cheaper than I was comfortable with.  If you are less curvy, like the model, I say it's 5 stars. But my body made it three stars."
3.0,"Runs VERY small. I got a plus size XX to be on the safe side and it doesn't fit.. It's like a regular medium, even small I'd say."
3.0,longer than I wanted it to be
3.0,This product runs small and does not stretch!!
3.0,I have a regular face maybe even leaning to the smaller side.  These masks are still too small for me....donate them to children
3.0,The zipper only lasted a month!
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  It looks fairly cheap on close inspection, but from a distance it is really pretty.  Received it with one stone out, but I glued it back in and voila! It probably is with the money if you're not expecting it to be something long term in your jewelry box."
3.0,It's a little bit to big
3.0,"OK for the money I have paid, but if you are expecting super high quality you might be somewhat disappointed with this product."
3.0,You get what you pay for here. They’re cute but began turning my ears green the first wear.
3.0,Nice shoes for the money<br />Not real leather so they scuff easily though.<br />The sizing is right on!
3.0,So It was an okay fit and it was also really pretty. but the shipping took like more than 3 months! luckily the price is not very expensive.
3.0,Looks nice but strong chemical smell. Had to return
3.0,Love the suit it was a little tight at first but after I got in the ocean 🌊 it stretched some which made it more comfortable. Love the front zipper which made my boobs look amazing!!!
3.0,Loved the wear and fit of this band but the band would pop loose where it attached to the watch part pop would pop off
3.0,"The silver clip has a long scratch, ending in a 2x1 mm spot where the silver is scratched off."
3.0,"It came quite wrinkly, and it is fine as a swim suit cover up, but the arm holes were huge, so if I wear it with just a regular bra, you can see the bra as it goes around my ribcage. I could certainly put a cami under it, but it would be weird, since it is already two layered, and that would add a 3rd.  So I don't reach for it much.  Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Very thin material and quite “inexpensive feel”. Don’t feel durable either.
3.0,"The first time I used it, it ripped"
3.0,"The reason I bought these is because I wear my snowboard pants above my tailbone padding. Although they appeared to be working, the grip on the front is not the best. Whenever i need to stretch and there is pressure on the grip, the right or left suspender will come off."
3.0,Shorts are cute however if you have big thighs or a big but these are probably not for you because the ruffles on the side will look weird and stick out.
3.0,It was a great looking charm.
3.0,"I previously ordered the Leggings Queen half sleeve tunic and LOVED it. I ordered this, hoping for the same shirt with a different neckline and sleeve length.<br />It was completely not what I expected. The fabric is totally different, almost like a gauze, and is fairly sheer. I ordered the same size as my previous shirt, and this shirt was much tighter. The hem is also much shorter than the other shirt.<br />I'm fairly unsatisfied but am going to keep it anyway. Hopefully I will grow to like it more!"
3.0,Bought these glass for my kids who are 3 1/2 years old.  They're great glasses but made for bigger kids.  They were a little big for my kids and kept falling off.  With that said kids come in all different shapes and sizes so they may be right for your kid.  I'll keep them for when my kids get a little bigger.
3.0,I wore the beret and bracelet. All the pieces are a different print almost a different color really. I’m a cheetah girl so I’ll find use for it. Not bad for the price just really wished they matched more.
3.0,"I was disappointed with the garish print, but the bag is sturdy enough to carry a good deal of items.  Previous purchases of this type of shoulder bags were much more attractive."
3.0,The quality is very nice but the cut is a bit awkward for me personally. It squeezes too tight on my waist and shows a little too much skin.<br /><br />Purchased small<br />Waist 26”
3.0,The skirt fit beautifully to my size 16 body however the top was too small for my 40DD bust... I ordered a 2XL otherwise it was very sexy loved the cut returned for a size up hopefully that works...
3.0,"This is so cute! The length in the photo is shorter then when you put it on. When I tried it on it came 5-6 inches below my knee. It just too big all over, I'm 5 foot 127 pounds and I ordered a small (what I always wear). It also makes the hips look much larger."
3.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 125lbs. 34C. I ordered a Medium and it fit well.<br />It was made kind of sloppy, though. There is a zipper along the side that flared outwards near the armpit. I had to sew it straight (closed it) and the other side seam was not sewn near the last 1/2 inch near the armpit. I had to sew that one closed. Overall, taking in both side seams near the armpits was helpful because it flared outwards as if it was too big, only in those spots. The dress is stretchy, so I was still able to slip it over my head after sewing the zipper shut in order to straighten out the sides.<br />Wearing a bra is difficult with this. The back is open in a way that you can't wear a plain bra or one that has straps that cross in the back without the straps being seen either way. I resorted to wearing a strapless bra. Yuck.<br />It's a cute casual dress, but not something I'd wear to a nice event. :("
3.0,They’re cute and all and serves their purpose but there’s smudges on them.
3.0,"Beautiful dress if you don’t have boobs.. ordered using provided sizing chart. The buttons were pulling away from each other at the bustline.  The rest of the dress fit fine.  I’m a 36 D and 5’6 for reference.  I can’t wear this dress and it makes me sad, because other than the fit at the boobsnit very nice."
3.0,"No filters, why it says you will receive them with the masks but not me!"
3.0,"The halter mesh part was really the only part that was too big, The torso fit perfectly and i'm sad that the halter part is too large, unless I can find a way to fix it, I will be returning it."
3.0,"These are good, not great. They don't stretch so essentially they're just 550 cord holding your sunglasses. I still use them if my stretchy ones aren't available as they still get the job done but I still prefer the stretchy ones..."
3.0,Not as flowy as I expected
3.0,"They are OK. They are cheap and thin. For light sweat they are OK. On a positive note, they fit under a hat great."
3.0,Not attractive.  Returned the item.
3.0,So  far so good. I have not even taken out of the package yet. It is a Christmas gift and it's not for me.
3.0,Comfortable but not particularly warm.
3.0,"I asked for a pink and received red, which end up okay as it was a gift. It did come quickly."
3.0,Decided not to kerp them because they did not match with other pueces if jewelry
3.0,"Damero is working on their product, and listening to their customers!<br />Upon leaving my first review after I bought the first purse and sent it back, Damero contacted me asking if I would be open to reviewing an improved version of the purse. I figured why not, I'll give it a shot.<br />The purse arrived within 5 days from their confirmation email. Very well packaged, wrapped in a protective foam, plastic bag and inside a sturdy box. The color is brown which is nice and warm, think milk chocolate brown.<br />Material is leather and it's obvious is a good quality that won't tear easily.<br />I am really impressed by how Damero as a company chooses to grow and build clientele and impove. I like that their focus is on accomodating the needs of their potential customers.<br />However the reason I give 3 stars is following:<br />The removable insert that comes with the purse, although good quality is much smaller than the purse. So you have this purse that is matching your expectations on the outside, and yet it gets cramped inside. Don't get me wrong, I think it's brilliant to have a removable liner that can be washed as we all know bottom of a purse can get quite gross. I just wish it had a better design. Plus, once the insert is removed, the purse does not have any zipper or any other way to close to stop pickpocketing or losing its contents.<br />If at there could be couple snap-on buttons added or something,  that would be a step in the right direction.<br />Overall, I like the bag."
3.0,"You might wonder why I gave this 3 stars, because I gave the comfort, easy to install and durability 5 stars. This band is supposed to be pink. The color in the picture is light pink. The band I received is not pink - it is a light peach. The color is pretty, but I have to look through my summer clothes before I decide if I'm going to return it. I have very few clothes that have the color peach in them."
3.0,"You can't see in the photos but this bra top was way too big for me. I ordered a large but should have gotten a medium but even then? There's no way my 34 B could fill a medium. I wish there were more suits without pads or removable. I'm 5'5, 110 lbs, 26 waist, 34 hips n 36 thigh width."
3.0,nice buckle for a child/to small for adult
3.0,"It’s cute. If you want it to look like the model, size up.<br />I think it’s darling with leggings."
3.0,It’s super cute and I get that it’s not a real pandora charm but it definitely tarnished :(
3.0,"This necklace came as ordered, but the chain broke in about 3 hours of wear."
3.0,It feels like the old polyester
3.0,"Key is cute, but the chain broke immediately."
3.0,"Its a good cotton mask, but wearing it at work is illadvised.  Makes my face so sweaty.  And very uncomfortable"
3.0,The fabric pills easily even with handwashing only in cool water inside out. Also it's a lightweight fabric but doesn't breathe so it feels hotter.
3.0,Not the best quality or fit.
3.0,Wasn’t the color I expected ..
3.0,these shoes are about two sizes bigger.
3.0,The quality was fine and it wasn't see through. The dress itself was much larger than I expected even with the picture showing a looser fit.
3.0,Great quality but they run small.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, these are not as cool as the pic, but fit well, I have narrow feet, a little roomy but socks could be worn although that's not really this style of shoe......Definetly a 1 season shoe.. Not well made.Thin..."
3.0,"Cool, comfortable knock around dress."
3.0,"It’s way too long to be an anklet, but it makes a cute necklace."
3.0,I liked the style but was disappointed with the color. It was more brown than grey
3.0,Nice looking product and magnetics hearts work well they just fall off after a while.
3.0,The Ultra low cut socks are high quality and comfortable but repeatedly slip off my heel during wear. I ordered the small and my foot is a size 5.5 or 6 and is wide. I missed the return period. The company sent me another style to try but they are not low cut enough to wear with most flat designs I own.
3.0,A tad bulky and not so attractive.
3.0,"This dress is quite pretty. I got it in the rosy pink color, and it appears exactly as pictured -- the shade is very pretty, in my opinion. The cut of the dress, however, is not the most flattering. It’s cut in a pretty shapeless way. I also dislike when velvet clothing pieces have straps made out of curled velvet. It makes the strap seem flimsy and breakable.  Mine haven't broken yet, but I don't have much faith in the durability of this dress overall. This dress is more of a special occasion piece, and not an everyday dress. I do still wear it. 3/5 stars."
3.0,I didn’t have any of the logos that this shirt on the ad had and thought was dry fit
3.0,I liked it other than it turned my finger green
3.0,I wore these for about a week before the whole shoes started falling apart. Theres absolutely no thickness to them. It's like walking on needles once they break down. Absolutely ridiculous. They run too small. I wear a 7 normally and I ordered a 8 1/2 and they're still too small. Waste of time and money.
3.0,Bulky around waist and material is stiff but very cute overall.
3.0,"Its extremely hard to fasten, tie and lock the bag to a stationary object such as a bench, chair arm, etc. Tying it requires the nylon string with the ring to go around the object, align with the two grommets and the number lock to be inserted and locked through them. Pulling out the grommets is a herculean task, aligning them with the ring with the nylon string wrapped around the object is another challenge and the lock needs to be inserted thru them while the numbers can easily shift making it very frustrating to set up all this. My wife just gave up after trying it a few times - i was able to lock after a lot of perseverance. Once locked, its a good setup that offers peace of mind. The bag needs a lot of improvement in tying and locking experience"
3.0,"Bought a size 8 ex wide men's and it is tight on my size 7.5 women's  feet.  So, add to ad that the sizing is for tiny feet!!!"
3.0,"I loved the look of this watch in the pictures. In real life, it looks very much like the picture but I would say the band is just more clearly a leather-like material (and has a bit of the wrinkled-leather look to it). I loved wearing this watch as it has a great modern & professional look to it. Unfortunately, the watch stopped keeping time correctly after a few weeks of owning it. Pros-The watch looks great, it is affordable, I love the style, it is comfortable, matches many outfits, great for for, and not cheap-looking.  Cons: The watch stopped keeping time correctly (it tics still but after a few minutes or hours when I check the time, it is completely wrong). I am not sure if it is just a battery issue, but I am going to look into it because I would like to start wearing the watch again. Also, the band did not stay in perfect condition and had a bit of a wear and tear to it after just a few weeks of wearing (and I never got it wet. Can't say how that might affect it)."
3.0,"Very cute for the price! But, the sizing is way off. Ordered 12-24mo for my daughter that wears 18mo and it would have fit 3-4t."
3.0,"Very cheaply made but comfortable, large in side pocket and very thin"
3.0,It's a nice enough product for its price but i was expecting a soft cotton outer material
3.0,Don't care for the fit.  Looks like a maternity shirt
3.0,Quick service but sizes run small
3.0,Product is longer which is what I was looking for but it is too small for my Xlarge size. I will end up giving it away as a gift.
3.0,"This is not what I expected at all. This sweater fit so small, and I got an XL. I suggest to anyone that is going to buy this, to buy it 3x bigger than the size you're trying to get- trust me!!!!! If I was paying full price for this, I would expect to get the size I ordered, and make sure it actually fit otherwise it's a waste of my money. It's good quality material, and is super comfy on the skin don't get me wrong, but my boyfriend nor I can even wear it so it is useless to me.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this was given to me at a DISCOUNTED price in return for my honest review. This is 100% honest as I am not entitled to give a good review."
3.0,"I bought it early on during the pandemic. When we were all trying on different mask styles. It turns out this style isn't great for people who talk a lot. I'm a teacher so I'm running my big mouth pretty often and this mask isn't big enough or contoured (form-fitting) enough to stay put. If you stay quiet and still throughout the day, it's a cute little novelty mask. The image is funny and gets people's attention. But for me, it's in a box with the other masks that didn't make the cut during the last 9 months."
3.0,"I did not notice the material at the waist line that bunches up. Produces an unflattering look. material is not Cotton, it’s more of a polyester. looks cute in the photo online but it is cheaply made and does not fit well"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:6bc0138fadce854e10d55f486fcd13ca]] I like the bracelet, I wanted the color that I thought I was buying…."
3.0,They're cool
3.0,"A step up from the old sunglasses I wore. These give a big, clear windshield that keeps things out of my eyes and blocks the sun well. The bad part? The nose pads are incredibly uncomfortable. Maybe it’s something I have to get used to, but they cut into my nose and are almost sharp. That part needs a redesign."
3.0,"this product fits as expected but is very unflattering for anyone with curves, it does not lay right if you have any curves"
3.0,"For the price you pay, it is obvious that it is not real fur. But it is not bad for this price."
3.0,"The material on this dress was much better than I expected.  It's thick and nicely made.  However, the fit just wasn't my style, I'll be returning it."
3.0,"Scratchy material but it looks great. It's 70/100 flattering but I returned this because of the scratchy factor. Who wants to be itchy & uncomfortable? If you are sensitive to certain fabric or tags, give this a miss."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2ec24be1cdcdb98bcc78d8824f1995a5]] Disappointed! I was so excited to receive these earring and had planned on ordering multiple colors because loved the design. The tassel is different sizes. The left is far larger than the right and the loop portion on the top is larger on the right in comparison to the left.
3.0,"I ordered two. They are hardy, but one came with a pretty large stain on it. The other wasn’t made properly and doesn’t fully close on one side.<br />I was able to “bend” the hinges so it closes a little tighter and I do use it to hold my glasses at night."
3.0,It’s colorful
3.0,"Jacket runs small.  I will need to order the next size up, but didn't have the heart to take it back from my grandson.  He was thrilled!"
3.0,It doesn't fit snugly and material is the type that kind of stretches out and hangs. So she has droop. Ok texture. I'm hoping with a wash they fit a little better or perhaps I needed to size down.
3.0,These work fine for what I'm using though for which is at work but I can see that the thread is starting to come off on one side so I don't know how long they will last. I have no idea if these will float a pair of glasses. I use them at work and they fit nicely around the collar of a polo shirt when I'm not wearing the glasses.
3.0,As soon as I took them out the package the little pom poms fell off
3.0,"I originally got the black and white stripped one as a gift, LOVE IT! So I thought I would order additional ones in different colors (solid blue and burgundy) unfortunately the material is different then the stripped ones. If you love the way the stripped ones feel stick to the stripes!"
3.0,Just a little larger then i expected
3.0,Somewhat body hugging tshirt
3.0,These are a nice quality but the sizing is a bit off. I ordered my normal size and they were probably 2 sizes to small.
3.0,The paper sticks on the logo and it's hard to peel off.
3.0,"It is super soft and comfortable like the others. I love this brand of masks. The only issue with the green shield brand is I've order 4 masks all ""mediums"" but they are so different in size. This blue mask is way too big for me and I'm annoyed since the dark blue and blue in the photos are apparently both Medium."
3.0,The band was just okay. It was a little to long for the watch but still worked.
3.0,I bought this to get some stains out of suede seats. It faded them somewhat but can't get it completely out.
3.0,it was kinda cheaply made.
3.0,"Being a hand grenade we assumed it would not only play music, but would make the sound of blowing up after a time interval.  It ONLY plays music that stays on for 10 seconds each time you press the handle, whether or not the pin is pulled from the grenade.  It was a disappointment , but cute."
3.0,Not very padded or comfy at all...
3.0,"Not so lose like at the picture not so much fabric.<br />I usually wear M, so ordered M.<br />I am 5'8 and 120 lb, it fits ok.<br />Cleavage is too deep.<br />Will give it to somebody."
3.0,"The fit was fine, but the color doesn’t even resemble army green. It’s really more of a brownish color. Pretty disappointing for me."
3.0,"Starts piling after the first wash, not of good quality, definitely not worth the price"
3.0,"It is a heavier material than I expected, so it ways down a bit on the top and pulls the front down slightly more than I would like. I also cant tell which side is SUPPOSED to be the front, I suppose it doesn't matter. Overall I like the look and love that it has pockets!"
3.0,Loved the bottoms but the inside of the top wasn't comfortable (scratchy).  Still wearing the bottoms though.
3.0,Too thin. The compression is nice but the foot part is much too thing and I couldn’t use for running.
3.0,These sunglasses are good quality. But I thought the spring hinges would allow the arms to widen past the open position. I have a very wide / Fat head and these sunglasses do not fit. I can almost only wear very wide glasses or a pair that allow the arms of the sunglasses to open past the 90°  open position. Beside that there great.
3.0,I thought I was ordering an Extra Large US but the tag said size 12 US.
3.0,"Nice fabric and details, loved the color. As others mentioned, it tends to run large, especially on shorter people."
3.0,Love how they cove the whole shoe and I could adjust it to any kind of shoe I have.
3.0,The ring is cute and comfortable but yellowed in 2 days.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Junky chain and fake gold necklace. Would never pay $8 for this. Maybe $3. Cute to wear for a few hours, but can't wear for days on end without losing its metallic color."
3.0,Actually had to return it unused as the size was too small for my large wrist.  I wish they had it in exiling
3.0,"Okay, but thinner than sweat shirts were made in the past"
3.0,"Nice deal, but earrings were too small to see."
3.0,It’s rude to wear these to Oktoberfest in Munich but these are awesome for US fests.
3.0,"These are nice but, order a size larger than you think you need, they don't stretch to accomodate."
3.0,"These pearls are quite lustrous and very nice. I just wish there were a few more of them. The necklace is very small, almost a choker. The bracelet is small as well... not for large wrists. However, the sliver clasps are quite nice and the way they clasp keeps everything secure. While these are nice for bridesmaids gifts, they would be nicer if they were a little longer..."
3.0,"The rutching on the waist of the dress wasn’t sewn well. There are strings hanging out everywhere. Overall, I am only slightly disappointed in the dress, but not enough to return it."
3.0,Not as easy to install.  Didn't get it on
3.0,No micro fiber bag came.....
3.0,I though the chain was included so it caught me off guard. But otherwise it is an ok pendent. The price was right
3.0,Comfortable dress and true to size. Easily dress it with accessories.
3.0,I didn't pay attention to the thumb.  Not worth sending back.  Just gave them to someone who wear these types of gloves.
3.0,"I really like these earrings but they have a small flaw.<br />They look very nice and sparkly but, either, there's a  stone missing or one stone is yellow.<br />I noticed this as soon as I saw them.<br />I was really excited about these earrings since they appeared to be so nice, once I was ready to wear them I notice the small flaw.<br />Other than the flaw, these earrings are really eye-catching (all the more reason for them not to be missing a stone or have a defective stone). If it were not for this I would give it 5 stars."
3.0,"I wear a size 4 chest 34”, waist 30” and hips 40”. The shoulder is just right. If i went a size down it would be tight. Chest slight loosely fit which is good the buttons won’t pop out. But the waist is a little loose. That’s fine bc I will tuck it in. But the quality is not like as shiny as in the picture. It’s just simple polyester or rayon. Love the neck frill just like in the picture. I didn’t arrange the frills properly in the picture. Over all ok."
3.0,"The material is way too stiff for me but I can imagine that it could be perfect tying a certain type of shape or for making a large bow that will stand up and hold its shape. I wanted material that is much softer and a little stretchie. The weight of this material is more suited for colder months. I like the colors, they are beautiful."
3.0,I should have looked at the material description more.It arrived in a small bag and was extremely wrinkled.At 10 dollars and change I should get enough use out of it.
3.0,It didn't seem to hang right and I attributed it to the fabric.
3.0,"Item ships from China. One pair arrived damaged. No communication, no way to return it. However glasses are so cute. Great for Florida & Lily Pulitzer dresses."
3.0,Was given as a gift and the dangle fell off the first.  A little awkward feeling.  Was not able to fix because when the dangle fell off it broke.
3.0,"Cute dress, nice fabric. However, the chest and shoulders are EXTREAMLY small. I usually wear a medium sometimes can get away with a small and am small chested but this medium was painful to get on and even worse to get off. Sizing so off I don’t want to bother with ordering size up."
3.0,"ITs way too small for an extra large. I normally wear a 38B, but this is really tight. Too bad because the colors are cool."
3.0,"These are too large on me, and I typically wear oversized lenses, but these have an odd oversize shape.  I am a female, and believe these are unisex, so, that may be why they don't fit that well.  These are pretty nice looking glasses, but darker than I like (my vision is not great so it is harder for me to see with them on).  I was most disappointed at how much light gets in on the outer edges of the glasses.  I know it's not wrap style, but I have plenty of sunglasses that are not wrap style, and yet do not let the light in as these do."
3.0,It is a bit thin in fabric and doesn't come to full down to the waist area. But it was ok.
3.0,"They were for my grand children, One of sirens didn't work so I had to cut the wire on the other one to make it the same . It's ok they still love them."
3.0,after about 5 months of use the pink started to fade but still works
3.0,"It is quite thin and not leather, for the description I was expecting something better."
3.0,"Too small, rough material. Would not buy again."
3.0,The watch is actually more beautiful than pictured however in less than a month it stopped keeping accurate time. I've never exposed it to water. Very disappointed.
3.0,I wish the band wasn't so long :(
3.0,Fabric is cheap and flimsy.  Bought a cotton onesie to wear under the sleeper.
3.0,"I was really hopeful for this dress because it’s got such a cute print but I ordered a little too big for me. I am inbetween the L and XL so I decided to go up for the Xl however when it got here and I put it on, I was drowning. If I had a larger chest it might have worked but since I am only an A cup the dress was too slouchy. Also, since the material is so thin, they sewed on extra fabric to the bust so you don’t see your bra but they put the same print behind so that print shows through to the front looking like the dress is on inside out. I was pleased however to find a sewn in slip which I was not expecting. I’m glad it was there since the fabric is so thin. I am going this dress a 3 due to the print of the underlayer showing through to the front."
3.0,I hope it will shrink a little because it is a bit large
3.0,Cute but wore off quite quickly.
3.0,Ok quality but runs big
3.0,"This is advertised as 288 pieces, which is accurate, but deceiving. I received the package today, to find out that there are only 144 PAIRS of earrings, not 288 which I originally thought."
3.0,It is a nice product with good workmanship. But I had to return it as was heavier on ears then I thought..
3.0,They are definitely cheaply made but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I love the idea of this case, especially the necklace section.  I think it will work at keeping my necklaces from getting tangled while traveling.  I also love that the case locks, preventing it from popping open.  The case is a little larger than I thought it was going to be, but would still fit in a large purse (I never pack my jewelry, always carry it on me when traveling).  Having said that, the case seems to be made of cheap plastic.  I don't know how long it will last."
3.0,"Quality was less than expected considering the other positive reviews that I used to determine I was purchasing this product.  The bottoms fit slightly large, but the top is what is extremely too large.  It will have to be altered to fit.  The color of the suit is nice and bright.  I am 5'7&#34; and 140 pounds and I usually have problems with bottoms being too small to cover the rump.  I ordered a medium and the bottoms are full coverage (which is nice because mediums usually are not).  My bust is 32 C and top is just too big for a 32 bust.  It is made to fit what measured would be close to a 36 bust."
3.0,"Ok, not fantastic"
3.0,I’m a size 8 so i went with the 7-8 and they are ever so slightly too small. wish i would have sized up… also wish i could replace with a size 8-9
3.0,The glasses are comfy feeling but im not a fan of the style. But great shipping and everything went well
3.0,I really like the shoes but they are a little large for a size 5.
3.0,This product is not short girl friendly gonna have to do a alteration so the bottoms are not dragging to much
3.0,"I can only give this three stars based on the fact it was too small for me.<br />I comfortably wear a fitbit size large band. This VIWO band states &#34;One size fits all&#34;.  I would say it is about 3/4&#34; smaller than the fitbit large size.  I could get it buckled, but there was not enough band left to slip the 1/4&#34; overlap into the two retaining straps.<br />The quality appeared to be OK, and it did connect to my fitbit properly.<br />If you think the size will be OK for you it is a decent product given the price, and the fact that the fitbit ones are criminally over-priced."
3.0,Kind of cheap looking and the band is very awkward to fasten with one hand.  It does fit my new Samsung Note 10 plus fine.  Was easy to put on.
3.0,Pockets are way too low
3.0,This item worked for about 2 hours and didn’t even make it to Halloween. The two little arms kept getting stuck and wouldn’t go down.
3.0,"The glasses are too big, they keep sliding down. Would be fine if you have a huge head."
3.0,This top was very light for a waffle top.  I expected a heavier weight it would be fine for summer.  I also felt thatbitbran small.
3.0,My son is only 6 and these fit so tight they left marks on his face. They do not cancel out very much noise. I will be looking for a better pair for my son to watch drag racing.
3.0,It was just too small to cover my boobs and I’m not that skinny and have insecurities to say f* it and wear it. But the quality is thick enough and not flimsy. Super cute though. I was gonna wear it and wear a cardigan or Jean jacket<br />Too bad I had to return it
3.0,Cute top. Runs 2 sizes smaller.
3.0,"Not exactly what I was looking for since I like to be wearing a hat. If you don’t wear a hat with this, it would probably work out well for you."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress - and almost did. But it's a tad too clingy through the mid-section. The dress is fairly thin, so it would be a nice summer dress. I usually wear a XL-2X in dresses. Ordered the XL and it did fit - so it's probably very flattering on a different shape. I'm 5 5 and it came just below my knees. It was very comfortable and I wish they made a larger size that I could try."
3.0,Color and quality very nice but just not as loose as I would have preferred.
3.0,"I’m 5’6 240 lbs, I ordered a XXL, it’s too long and also big. I’m going to return for a XL"
3.0,"It is black and some of the inner white material shows on the chest part of the bra, so it makes it look kinda cheap. Also, bottoms are a little tight and gives the ""Miley"" look on your bottom. Also the white liner fabric comes out of the bottom of the bottoms. I bought the small and I am 5'2 and 115lbs"
3.0,"The place where I got this had pants that were polyester, so when I got this pair I thought that's what the fabric would be.  It turned out to be viscose and hemp which is not at all what I expected.  They are nice so I kept them, just be sure you are getting what you expect."
3.0,"Super-cute bubble, but quality was definitely lacking.  Stitching was haphazard, seams were crooked in several places, and both bows fell off in first (delicate) wash.  Still cute enough for some photos, but..."
3.0,I've worn more comfortable ones before but they do the trick for the price.
3.0,"I ordered the pick ones first and love them.  I ordered the same size in the lime green and they are MUCH longer than the pink ones.  I'd say approximately 2"" longer!  I have to fold the green ones over.  I was hoping that they would shrink but they didn't.  I was really expecting them to be just like the pink ones....not sure why they are not."
3.0,"The blouse is very see through si an under shirt or something will be needed, but I’m mostly disappointed that the colors are not as bright as picture on their ad, still very nice but they’re dark and dull."
3.0,"Too big, not fit for pocket and beats against tank while riding. Only good for the looks but not practical."
3.0,"The lace end of one of the lace pieces was hanging off/not sewn correctly when I received it. Other than that, the material was nice and it was comfortable."
3.0,The inside is really itchy. Otherwise fit well and is cute.
3.0,"Like the necklace and it suits my needs. The problem I have is that it is not smooth and tends to irritate my skin. Also, I've only had it a short while and only time will tell if it keep its shine."
3.0,Smaller than I thought it would be. Seemed in  picture like it would be a little thicker and when I opened it look like a child's size but once I stretched it to get it on it fits nice. Just wish it was a little thicker.
3.0,Very cute dress but the sheerness was too much in the light navy-stripe color I purchased. Fit was fine but it’s snug and maybe in a darker color it would’ve been better.
3.0,IT WAS A PLASTIC I THOUGHT IT WAS THE REAL ONE THAT IS MADE OF CLAY THE ONE'S FROM THE FLOWER POTS THAT IS A HAVY ONE AND GOOD. ONE BUT IT WAS ALRIGHT AND SEND Y'ALL AND OTHER ONE....
3.0,"Love it, but the clasp and pendant Lost. I have a nice rope around my neck.<br />Wore for 2 hours and the pewter clasp stretched  and lost pendant."
3.0,grain of the wallet was not that great. It looks cheap and worn.
3.0,Tight in the waist area
3.0,The fit at the top didn’t work for me. The color was beautiful
3.0,It's a pretty band but the clasp is difficult to open/close.
3.0,I got this dress in a small when I normally wear a medium. It was very see through and it fit weird around the armpits. They were almost baggy. I unfortunately returned it because of that. It fit amazing everywhere else though and was very soft.
3.0,Smaller than I expected and quite basic but the price is fair.
3.0,Very little stretch to the fabric and smaller than most medium pants :( they were kinda high waisted on me and felt comfortable at the waist/hips and stomach. The crotch/groin area was super uncomfortable though. It was also very tight on my rear as well but fit perfectly for my length 😭
3.0,A couple of them came broken
3.0,It is good however it does roll up
3.0,Very warm but not too heavy. Size a little small but worked well for me because straight fit
3.0,I wear a size 10 1/2 sneakers.  These socks fit perfectly. Only problem is that the material is a nylon blend and you tend to slip alot on wood floors.  also the nylon blend is not the most comfortable for me.
3.0,I would have loved it but the sleeves are oddly very short!
3.0,use for patches. Somewhat large
3.0,The shirt runs a little small but I like more room in my t shirts
3.0,The cloth was very rough. Kids felt itchy and irritated with the roughness as almost all kid T's are soft.
3.0,"As I've learned with some of the clothing purchased on Amazon...it's hit or miss.  While this fabric is good quality and the design is like in the picture.  You can absolutely not wear this off the shoulder as the neck cutout is just like a regular t-shirt.  I guess you could stretch it down and take a quick pic with it off your shoulder but it's going to ""snap back"" up your shoulder as it is just a tshirt opening....disappointed."
3.0,"Runs a little small, but it's cute."
3.0,The Sunshine cloths do much better in sterling silver.
3.0,"They are beautiful as I ordered them for my bridal party. Out of 7, five were damaged and I had to return and order 2 more. Hope they come unbroken."
3.0,"The gloves were very warm, bulkier than expected because I wanted a work glove, and when wet,snowy did not grip well."
3.0,super super cute!! but it broke very easily!!
3.0,"The satin leotard shirt is perfectly shiny but a lil too much shine for me. It gives off a dance hall, party vibe. I ordered it for business wear but i will be wearing it to a party or bar. It has a perfect fit to my torso, no stretch nor drape. It also has 3 snap closure. I love the feel I weigh 178 lbs and 5’4’’. It’s"
3.0,"These shoes are ok. The plastic is very hard. My son has wide feet and wears a size 3 in his tennis shoes, but he can't get these on. Had to order a different style for him."
3.0,"I just bought two of these, and other reviews are not kidding: it runs very small. I'm a size 12, so I ordered the 6XL, which says it's a US 14, and it's a very tight fit in my arms and around my chest. I'll just have to wear a cami under it. The other thing I was a bit disappointed in was the length. It falls right to my hips and doesn't quite cover my butt, so I'm not sure I can wear it with leggings like I'd planned. If you wear anything above an XL in US sizes, this shirt will not fit!  Otherwise, it's an absolutely darling shirt. It's extremely soft, and the colors pop even more than they do in the pictures. I would give it 5 stars in a second if only it fit me properly."
3.0,"I don't like the color, it's gray and not black although the tights are nice, I'm not happy with the color"
3.0,Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size and had to return it. It runs on the large side. The material was light and would be great for summer.
3.0,"Does the job, mom can use it with no complaints.  Frame at the joints broke on one within a week.  Don't have a lot of hope for the rest.  I'll need to look into getting her something more durable."
3.0,Nice. Decent design but fell off while biking on my second wear.should be more secure. I make these all the time myself and they last a year at a time.
3.0,The product seems nice and all but I ordered a size up as some people reccomended and its a little baggy on me now. It is a good product though.
3.0,Colors are nice they are just not super fitted like I expected
3.0,"While they fit well, and I love the darkness, after 8 months, one of the arms broke. There was no dropping, no impact, it just broke, almost in half. I am currently wearing them taped together, and am trying to figure out a more permanent fix."
3.0,Run too small for my husband
3.0,Small fits more like a extra small. Very tight
3.0,"The fabric is somewhat shiny, and runs large. The small fit me more like a medium, I'm 5'9&#34; and the pants aren't long enough to wear heels."
3.0,"This ring is beautifully made; however, I ordered a size 9 and received a ring sized at a 10.25. There is also a split in the back of the ring that you are unable to see in the pictures that makes me wonder how sturdy this would be if worn regularly. Beautiful ring though!"
3.0,Did not like the orange color.
3.0,The large was very small. The quality is not great. It felt like costume clothing. Extremely thin and rough.
3.0,"This is a cute wallet, but it has some random writing engraved in it.... One says &#34;cheer up! That's the way it goes. It's not the end of the world. It was very nice seeing you again&#34;.... Like wait, what?"
3.0,"Let me start by saying this scarf is adorable! I love the chubby little birds, and the color is very flattering to my extremely pale, warm skin. I absolutely love that aspect of this! However, this is the thinnest scarf I've ever owned and rips easily<br /><br />COLOR<br />Very true to my monitor. Vibrant and so, so cute. The pattern is just precious<br /><br />SIZE<br />Big scarf! I like wearing it with the scarf pulled so it's full and long. It looks really great and I think the scarf is just about the PERFECT size. Not too big, not too small, and light enough that it won't add too much bulk on a petite frame but will still flatter a larger frame. Really quite versatile<br /><br />QUALITY<br />Unfortunately lacking, which is why I give this product three stars. I had no problems with it the first several times I wore it but it did catch on the edge of the table and snag terribly. I was so gentle with it! I've had other scarves and snagging is, unfortunately, the #1 predator of silky scarves. However, other scarves I've had haven't torn and snagged this easily. Additionally, it is really obvious that it has a big snag in it. It's so cute, which is a shame.<br /><br />PRICE<br />The only upside to the cheapish quality is how darn inexpensive this is. I received it at a discount in exchange for a review, but even still, the original asking price of ten dollars is really not bad for such a cute accessory. I'm definitely still going to wear my cubby bird scarf until it falls apart or starts looking bad (the snag can be pretty easily hidden amongst the other material and people probably wouldn't notice unless you pointed it out). When it bites the dust for good, I will probably just pick up another one.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />This scarf is worth it if you love the print. Do not expect a really long-lasting accessory with this product, but it's so cheap you could pretty easily replace it. Other than the quality, I have no negatives about this product. It's cute (SO CUTE. I got lots of compliments!), lightweight (a good summery scarf), and one of my favorite accessories. I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a cute, inexpensive accessory you don't mind replacing."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this bag. Pockets are more for decoration, not useful. The inside of the bag, where dividers or pockets would be helpful, has nothing except for a small one sewed into the lining. So a very large open space with nothing to keep belongings from getting lost in a large void. Btw, this is not 12 inches, it's actually more like 13.5 inches, and that's without the water bottles added. This isn't a shoulder bag -- it's a satchel. You can practically put a laptop in it. I might keep it for an overnight bag -- but it's definitely not going to work for every day use."
3.0,Cute but not so comfortable
3.0,Has the potential to be cute but the straps are just a tiny bit wonky and my normal sized boobs looked like Dolly’s in this shirt. Had to return it.
3.0,"It's okay, not very good quality more like costume quality.. which is perfect because I got it for a beetlejuice costume."
3.0,The &#34;red&#34; is hot pink. It's a little too &#34;little girl&#34; for me
3.0,"The solution is good, but I think the brush could be a little softer. Be careful and go slow when using on fabric surfaces - pilling can occur."
3.0,"I bought this watch for my son as a gift before he went off to boot camp for the marines, and I was a bit disappointed that the writing on the back was not straight. Over all the watch itself seems ok, but I was definitely disappointed about the lettering on the back. I probably would have exchanged it but I am one of those people that wait to the last minute for everything and I had no choice but but to give it to him."
3.0,"I bought the size D, (normally I wear a size C bra)it doesn't completely hold you up enough to wear it on its own so I put this bra on then wear a bralette over it otherwise I feel like it would come off."
3.0,"Be prepared to wind it and set the time if you haven't worn it in a few days. Also, the strap broke after a year. It was only worn twice a week, about 3 hours at a time. My husband had to wind it each time because he didn't wear it daily. After the strap broke I replaced it with a traditional battery watch instead."
3.0,"I'm going the give it a 3 because the quality is really bad. I feel like I'll rip it if I handle it to rough. The measurements dont match either but it did say that in the description. On top of the mesh part of the bags there's a little rubber piece, it's falling off and I fear it's going to rip the mesh when it does. It says 7pcs but there is only 6. So if you don't read the full description you'll be fooled. I just hope it makes it through 2 trips for the price."
3.0,Super cute and I always get compliments but it’s already stretched out and moves too freely on my wrist.<br /><br />The metal latches don’t fully lock either and concerns me that the Apple Latch can go flying if you fling your arm. My suggestion is finding something that fully latches onto your Apple Watch as this does not. The metal bar will slide side to side with the Apple Watch and then get caught on things and further slide out.
3.0,"As is often the case, I bought these clod hoppers without thoroughly checking all reviews. They looked very appealing, but structurally stiff, uncomfortable and easily lost when walking at more than a snail’s pace. I’m keeping them as a reminder, “don’t buy cheap.”"
3.0,I ordered it to be loose.  it fits snug
3.0,"It's a beautiful necklace, however three of the stones had to be glued back in."
3.0,"Ok, while I understand that these are gloves that when used in warm water for an extended period of time will cause some sweating I didn't, based on reading reviews, expect for it to the this bad. My hands are just as wet and pruney as if I had no gloves. The only saving grace is they do act as a barrier between my skin and the soap which was getting to my hands. I do wish I could find a way to keep my hands dry tho. It's reaking havoc on my nails and cuticles."
3.0,"I really love this dress. It's very hard to find a maxi dress that's actually long enough for me. Hoping the size stays the same after washing it. However, it came with a stain on the top. I planned on wearing it for family pictures and don't have time to return it and hope a new one arrives on time so I'm hoping we can hide the stain in photos."
3.0,"Way loud for me, don't love the animal print."
3.0,"5'5 160lbs and I ordered a large. This dress was cute but it was cut weird at the neck line. It wasn't the blue I wanted, more like a powdered baby blueish. Material is very stretchy and was super soft. Liked everything about it except for cut at neck line and the color being off."
3.0,"The hat was just as I expected, nice color and fit as expected.  The only problem with it was part of the brim had become unstitched (or wasn't properly stitched in the first place) leaving an opening about 2 inches long.  Because of this I returned it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:96871d084532e87460c37d7df69b8294]] I purchased the one with black fur ball in black inside they sent hat with grey fur ball grey inside. Cute!! Does not match my coat tho. Only 3 stars because they sent wrong color!!
3.0,"Not bad...don't swing the flashlight around too much (I use it nightly when walking) and it *may* hold up.  Mine broke, but there's a batch of them in there for back up."
3.0,"Great shirt, but was smaller than expected."
3.0,It's advertised to fit the moto 360 but I'm still having trouble with the size of the links being too long. I haven't worn my watch since taking the old bands off so I need to try again. I put 3 stars because if I can get them on it will be great because the quality of the band is really nice.
3.0,No tiene el corte en la parte delantera para poder miccionar con mayor facilidad.
3.0,This suit is not made for large breasted women. I had trouble keeping it staying up and basically covered only half of my breast. If I went swimming I’d be better off going skinny dipping because the girls would def pop out. And I’m not talking about movement I literally stood in the mirror and the suit slid off. Other than that the suit is really cute and looks just like the pics! I’m just salty it’s not for large breasted women cause it’s already so hard finding suits.
3.0,"These are fine for the price when you don't need to wear them long or talk much with them on.  When you start talking, they end up going in your mouth."
3.0,"The dress was way too long in length and way too large, but I gave it to a friend who is much taller then me and she loves it."
3.0,Not for the plus sized and BBW girls not too positive if it's for the curvy thick girls either tbh. Anyways the ends do not have the fabric folded over to stop the harness when it reaches the end so that sucks. It came with what appears to be hair on it given the nature of this product I'm not putting it on. :/
3.0,Nice design but it is a low-end quality. I would recommend buying a scarf similar or alike elsewhere for a low cost.
3.0,Exactly what I was shopping for EXCEPT the white collar lining.  Also the large was too tight in the hips.
3.0,"Completely see through!! It’s cute, but definitely needs shorts underneath!"
3.0,"Not what I was expecting, too small even i choose too sizes up"
3.0,The graphic on the shirt wasn't quite as vibrant as pictured. It looks as though it was run through as washer one to many times.
3.0,The kevlar thing is a gimmick...  These bootlaces lasted about 6 months.  I'm replacing with the same laces because they look good.  Maybe the previous failure was due to a sharp edge on my boot speed hooks.  Filed them down a bit.  We'll see how this pairs of pants holds up.
3.0,"Vision was great, but the frames are very lightweight and fragile. I was too scared to wear them, but sadly I can’t return them???"
3.0,Fits as expected but quality of fabric is just fair
3.0,"I liked the concept of the design.  The buttons should have been  set  with a button hole, not a loop as it leaves a gap.  However you can put a camisole under it and it still looks okay.  The waist portion does not give at all so be careful if you are kind of  busty.  Overall a cute top and I received compliments on it."
3.0,"Worked great the first 5 uses, now water keeps getting into the left goggle. Not bad of a purchase though."
3.0,"I ordered a grey pair of these shorts for my husband. He likes baggy shorts so I thought this was perfect. The seller said to order two sizes up..so I ordered him a 40. The package did come in a day which was sweet but nothing was correct about my order. The shorts do not look like the picture, I ordered a grey pair we got a dark green, and the size was a 42 instead of the 40 we ordered. My husband did end up keeping them (which is why I gave it a 3 star), because they did fit and he had no shorts lol."
3.0,"the shoes are smaller then 37, but i do not have a choice to return it. I will try to wear it like that."
3.0,"It's not really what I expected, but it's really comfortable so I'll use it as a nightgown. Doesn't really function as a shirt for me."
3.0,"Love the colors, but for being extended sizes, they're pretty short on my feet."
3.0,Super cute out of the package but after wearing just a few times it looks really worn and I won't wear it again!
3.0,"All of these blouses are too narrow at the bottom. They have exactly the same measurement at the bust area as well at the bottom. They need to be more roomy at the bottom at least 2 more inches so the blouse can have a little of flowing but instead they look like a tube.<br />for some one who has bit thighs and big butt, there is no way these blouses would fit.<br />I bought 5 different colors and I am disappointed at the fitting because they are too tight at the bottom even though, I have no big butt nor big tights. I give 3 stars only because I like the colors and the fabric is soft. They feel loose at the top and tight at the bottom.  Disappointed particularly that I bought 5 of them."
3.0,They're OK. Fit kind of tight. Small/short pockets
3.0,"Kinda broke, but i fixed it, and it is also very loose around my wrist but i still love the look of it."
3.0,A 2X usually fits perfect on me. This fits like a tent.
3.0,Pretty flimsy. The ear piece broke within a week.
3.0,"For fit and breathability, this mask is fantastic. The adjustable elastic holds it in place and, unlike disposable masks, the air flow doesn’t feel restrictive.<br /><br />However, I run a lot for the military and I train for distance. Once I start labored breathing, the white inner lining collapses over my mouth with each breath. The material is breathable, but that doesn’t change the suffocating feeling with every inhale.<br /><br />I like the fit of the mask enough that I bought silicone frames that can be worn beneath the mask and over the nose and mouth. It keeps the mask from collapsing and makes running in the mask tolerable (no one WANTS to run in a mask). However, the product gets 3 stars because I shouldn’t have to buy a third party product to effectively use a “runner’s” mask."
3.0,The fabric is very thin and every stitch in your bra will show.  The top is not symmetrical and you can't use it shoulder down because this is a crew neck.  I gave it 3 stars because I contacted the seller and I got an immediate refund.
3.0,Bought 3 sets as additional gifts for my nephew's. All 3 sets have a raw edge on one side. Too late to return. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"It’s kind of cheap. I’m 5’8” 140 lbs, I got a small and it doesn’t fit snug on my body."
3.0,Necklace fine except ear was broke off when we got it.
3.0,These were smaller than expected. Two sizes bigger than normal size might be a better fit
3.0,this is just a canvas jacket it is not very thick
3.0,"This bracelet is an adorable basic and a very good price. II didn’t think this would fit at first but it is slightly adjustable. I can manage to squeeze it over my wrist and it is comfortable to wear once it’s on! It’s a little snug on me but I have big wrists. It’s a pain to get on forsure but it gives you the bangle look. You can see the little pinches on my skin from sliding it on but those go away in a couple minutes…not the best scenario but it works. For reference I wear size 12-14 in woman’s adult clothes. It should fit most people decently. The quality is okay, it just feels like a lightweight jewelry but it looks pretty nice stacked with others. I just love the bamboo design it’s so unique"
3.0,Cute material and shape.<br />But This style was too long on me.<br /> I am 5’4”. It’s gpod for a taller person.
3.0,"Little disappointed in the quality - they have very small little dots for the grippers - and seem to rotate on my foot - They do what I needed - working from home they keep my feet warm, and if I make sure to check them before walking - they stop me from slipping my the floor"
3.0,"This is a pretty cool toy, but the quality sucks.  I bought it to use for a game of a dance-style game of hot-potato at my nephew's Fortnite birthday party.  Unfortunately it broke immediately after opening so we weren't able to use it that way.<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers, the whole thing is plastic except the chain, which is totally fine for the body and maybe even the pin itself, but the ring on the pin should absolutely not be plastic as kids need to yank on it to pull the pin out. I pulled it once and it was fine, but a kid pulled it two times and it snapped in half.<br /><br />What I should have done was brought a metal keyring with me to replace the plastic ring, but I didn't think ahead to do that.  What the makers should do is replace the ring with a metal ring...  It would be a super cool toy if they would make that minor change."
3.0,Nice but wish it wasn't velour.
3.0,gave to my son
3.0,Verey good
3.0,"Arrived quickly and in tact, however the mushrooms in my bead do not exactly look like mushrooms, if you know what I mean."
3.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, but the middle part is not long enough to go all the way through my piercing!<br />Sad day for me."
3.0,Liked style - bought the 2 tone summer one as a 1X and it cuts off circulation to arms and crushes chest.  So bought this one as a 2X and it just hangs!  I know they are different styles but I doesn't fee like I can get this right.  Am going to try this again as a 1X.  I don't have a waist line to speak of and am looking for something cool & comfortable.
3.0,"Nice, but I didn't realize how small it was."
3.0,This would be great if it was smaller. I followed the size guide and it was still huge on me. I would definitely recommend going a size down if possible.
3.0,"Not durable, stone fell out with 2 weeks"
3.0,"was told two day delivery, got it 12 days later. Needed cleaned and shined."
3.0,I followed the comments on sizing and the medium was way too big. It has not been washed yet so I am hoping it will shrink. The tail is down around the knees it is so big. Lol. I got a medium for my teenage niece. She will still wear it even after the family laughed at how big it was. Lol. Material is very thin so not a onsie for warmth. The kid loves dogs so she is still pleased.
3.0,Stone fell out in about 2 weeks.  It was pretty while it lasted.
3.0,I intended to use as a cake topper. Imagined the light and sounds would stay on for a little longer than a few seconds. As much as I’m not into noisy toys I expected this one to actually be noisy lol it’s cute though
3.0,Cozy but run large.
3.0,Looks great! It fits my son's hand perfectly. The only problem is that the stones popped off after about 15 minutes. Not a really big deal as I just took some Gorilla glue to them and put them back in place. Looks fantastic in the light and even better in the dark! Please know This is shipping out of China and will take a while to get here!
3.0,"I love the pockets on these, but they are not as comfortable as I had hoped. And I always feel like they are sliding down and I have to keep pulling them up. They don't feel quite as buttery soft as some of the other leggings I have though seem fairly well made (so far no rips or holes or anything)."
3.0,"Love the rings, but after a month or so all the black paint wore off and now they're silver colored."
3.0,Used sizing chart and even order a smaller size. They came and were so huge that they fit his older sister. The only reason we didn’t return.
3.0,I went of the specs and they ended up being too big and the waist area goes way above the belly bottom - They are comfy and I love the colors. I will be using these for lounging and buying a smaller size to fit better so I can wear to roller skating
3.0,very nice although it came folded leaving creases on both side of the brim. turned it inside out to try to get rid of the fold marks but still there
3.0,"The stone is pretty, but the hole is very small. I purchased it to wear with a gold chain (not the black cord it comes with). I have bails in various sizes to accommodate, but none of them would work with this small hole, so returned the item."
3.0,Do not like around the top of the undies. Looks like panties.  Other than that I love this product.
3.0,"There are some things that I am not satisfied about. 1. Not Cashmere. It's not even soft, or very cozy feeling. 2. This is NOT wine red! It's crimson red. 3. All in all, this is false advertisement, which I find not okay! You guys really need to actually say what fabric, and color it really is. I was really looking forward  to getting a nice CHASHMERE and WINE RED scarf. Not okay! Other than that, It isn't a BAD scarf. However, unacceptable with the color and fabric."
3.0,"The quality of the material is pretty good. If I were wearing it for a costume party or Halloween or a Con, this would be acceptable. Unfortunately, it is two pieces, and the jacket portion is too short for my torso, just barely skims the pants. I bought the costume to wear for a dance performance, and I realized that if I lift my arms even a little bit, I start showing a couple inches of skin. If I lift my arms over my head, I'm showing way more than that! Otherwise the fit was good, it and looked good if I kept my arms at my sides. Sending it back because it won't work for my needs, but I'm a little sad to see it go.<br /><br />Oh, and it's very warm. Stay hydrated."
3.0,"I tried so hard to make these shoes work but my foot is just too wide. I normally wear a 10W and can sometimes get away with a 10 or 10.5, but even with the adjustability, it didn't work. They are super stylish and I love them, just didn't fit."
3.0,"People must not know their real size. I believed the sizing info and ordered a smaller size as everyone was saying these shirts run big. Boy am I an idiot! Ordered a M instead of a L, and got a shirt that was too small! If you're looking for an oversized shirt, buy bigger. If your looking for a fitted shirt stay with your size and you won't be disappointed as I was."
3.0,"I like the feel and the fit of these bamboo socks but they're thin enough that you can see light through them easily, which may fit the current standards of clothing manufacturers but it's not worthy of five stars.  They won't last long"
3.0,Super cute and felt great but it was a bit small. I would order a size up
3.0,"Watch band great, the Air pods case only fits older ones, not the new air pods."
3.0,I ordered a large based on the size chart but it was a bit too tight across the bust.. :(
3.0,"Doesn’t fit exactly like tights, more like a slim slack otherwise fine"
3.0,My hair doesn't really get caught often but the ball fell out and I lost the earring randomly.
3.0,Pretty normal durags but great for the price.
3.0,"I really like the style and quality of this nose ring, but it was way too big for my nose. There's a huge gap so you can see it hanging in my nose. If I closed it myself, I doubt I'd be able to get it back out again... I guess I should have bought a 2 dollar one to try out first!"
3.0,"Love the design.  The crystals have nice sparkle. A wrist larger than 7&#34; won't be comfortable in this bracelet.  The clasp on mine would not stay shut, and I dropped the bracelet three times in one day."
3.0,"They are very soft and cozy (comparable to Lularoe). The ankles are a bit loose. They are not very breathable; as a result, I overheat pretty easily when wearing them."
3.0,"The design on this suit is very pretty.  It's not a high quality swimsuit, but I expected that before I bought it.  The cups that come in the suit top are very weirdly shaped, they looked awful, so I took them out.  I'm pear-shaped - I have wide hips (size 14/16) but a thin rib cage and chest (34B). I ordered an XL to accommodate my large hips. The bottoms fit well, they don't cover all of my butt but they cover most of it.  The bottoms sit low, like low rise jeans might sit. The top is pretty loose, it fits like a crop top shirt instead of a tight swim suit. I didn't need an XL top but you can't mix and match sizes.  It's not so bad that I can't wear it in public, but I might have to make some alterations so it looks nicer and doesn't fall off when I jump in."
3.0,"It's perfect for a Halloween accessory but depending on the size, it might BE uncomfortable for the rings."
3.0,The fit is snug but not as snug as the nylon ones. I based my purchase on one I got last year that was the same size and very comfortable. Getting a size large doesn't help because then it is too big on the shoulder area.
3.0,"I really wanted to love these boots. I am a 6 1/2 but they only came in whole sizes. I thought they might work if I wore thick socks but they are way too long in the toe. Also, the top severely creases while walking which will most likely become permanent. They probably would have worked if they came in 1/2 sizes."
3.0,This looked good but there was no way to make it tight enough to fit around my daughters head. We ended up having to cut the red part off and rig up something else.
3.0,"Love the face, numbers, contrast. The hands, to me, are perfect. The illumination is excellent! However, it's heavy, it's chunky and the packaging is ridiculous (it looks like I ordered a tool set). I want the packaging to protect my purchase, but it could be more repsonsible."
3.0,Not as pictured. Again
3.0,Not as effective as I was expecting.
3.0,"I loved the design of these face covers, however they were too small. They were almost too small for my kids to wear. Otherwise, they would have been nice."
3.0,"They run small and don't cover the whole lower portion of your face. I only use a face mask to make others feel comfortable so I guess they work well enough. I'm not when I wear them, not breathable but if you only wear then for short periods it's  fine"
3.0,"Super cute, quality material, but smaller than it said it would be."
3.0,"Looks nice, very disappointed with size barely 3/8"", hardly visible/noticeable, have to see how my grand dau likes.  Earrings themselves look pretty with crystal, they just should have put letter size in their size description area, I re-checked that area that said size and no mention of 3/8"", don't know if I would have bought if I had known that and have since bought another one for another grand dau, same comments for that one too?"
3.0,It’s very cute but the earrings are way too heavy for little girls to wear. It pulls their ear lobes down and might tear through if caught during play.
3.0,Ok but smaller than I expected and did not seem like typical Filson quality. Still nice though....
3.0,These are really cute but because they are cheaper the silver will turn more of a copper colour and the nickel might turn your ear green so be careful!
3.0,"BEAUTIFUL... BUT... the way it is designed because of where the shoulder strap is connected to the rings on the side of the purse, the purse doesn't open wide enough... and THAT isn't good... so i had to give mine to the salvation army.  otherwise, the violet color is beautiful and the leather is amazing... great purse for the price... expect for the design.  So sad that i couldn't keep it.  :-("
3.0,Runs a little small in the kegs.  Very soft and comfortable fabric
3.0,Much smaller than shown.
3.0,"This band was too small to use, more like a kid size than adult size. I probably missed that in the description."
3.0,"I absolutely love the colors of these leggings, and most of all that they are a cheaper alternative to the famous NVGTN leggings that I want so badly but never purchase in time. They are very comfortable and have a great stretchy material, but also give you a slim look as the elastic waist band cinches your waist just enough to make you look 10 pounds lighter than you really are. So you may be asking yourself, why did she only rate them 3 stars? Here is why:<br /><br />1. First star deduction. Two words. CAMEL TOE. As I pull these leggings up in the gym, they give me a pretty conspicuous camel toe once I’m done with a set. Consequently, they force you to pull down the leggings after every few movements.<br /><br />2. Second star deduction. I am very easily embarrassed so this might not be a deal breaker for everyone. I almost done with my workout when I look in the mirror just to remind myself of how great my butt looks and BAM, butt crack sweat. I quickly pick up my things and practically sprint out of the gym in hopes to keep the shred of dignity I have left. These leggings are squat proof, however they still have a bit of sheerness to them which make them a perfect home for sweat to show through.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing any more of these leggings as I am an anxiety-ridden woman and camel toes and sweat peeking through my butt are very big deal breakers to me, however, if you don’t mind the average camel toe or sweat showing through your leggings, these are a great product for you. These also might be a great choice for you if you’re not planning on doing much physical activity while wearing them."
3.0,"Gave to a friend, as they were too small for me."
3.0,"So...we bought these as replacements of our son's light-up Skechers. We thought they would be about the same thing. We we were not prepared for the USB cord provided, or for the need to CHARGE these sneakers. To be clear, he LOVES them. However, we'll probably be getting a separate set for school to avoid the unnecessary drama.<br /><br />Also, note, these are very bright shoes and not for the shy or retiring. They definitely call attention to themselves.<br /><br />On the other hand, they might be just the thing for night camping."
3.0,Charm was perfect but the chaun was junk
3.0,I can’t wear this sports bra because it was not true to size. I recommend ordering two sizes up!!!
3.0,"The clogs are super light weight. They also seem very durable. Length wise the fit great, but they are way too wide for my daughter’s feet. Can’t return, packaging has been discarded."
3.0,The sizing was perfect but I expected these to add a little lift or push them together (clasp) it did neither. One pro is that they did stick very well to the skin
3.0,"I really wanted to like these shoes, but the material is a little cheap and I could tell after a few hours that I would develop blisters."
3.0,"T-shirt is too large, I normally buy LG to fit slightly big, but this shirt came really bit too large and I didn’t want to go through the trouble of returning. Quality was good."
3.0,Good enough jewelry for daily wear
3.0,"Very nice coat and I love the fast delivery of the product. Unfortunately, the buttons are all coming off the coat and my daughter never even buttoned her coat."
3.0,nice product but order 2 sizes larger than normal.
3.0,Precisely what I expected
3.0,"The stones are awesome. The construction, not so much. The braid in the middle started to come apart the first day I had it on. I had to repair it in order to continue wearing the bracelet."
3.0,I did expect for it to be larger to keep from bending boarding passes and etc.
3.0,It's a bit short for me and the straps break off easily if you adjust it too much or like a tight fit. I do like how it looks though. The pockets aren't good for anything either. Things can easily fall out. Definitely an apron for show not for working in a high volume restaurant.
3.0,this is an OK wear.!
3.0,good not too bad
3.0,Very flimsy material. See through
3.0,"I like this band enough to keep using it.<br /><br />It looks great & feels pretty good when wearing it.<br /><br />My three biggest complaints about it are:<br /><br />1. It's a little tricky to get the band on. Threading the end piece through the opening, especially since it's magnetic and when the band sticks together, it can be a pain. My workaround is I pre-thread the band at its largest size and slide it over my hand and wrist, then adjust it. That works well but also helps exacerbate the next issue.<br /><br />2. Often times, I say anywhere from 30% to 50% of the time the button on the Blaze is not aligned properly with the button on the band. This requires either sliding your finger underneath the watch and pushing it up to align the buttons or taking it off to align it. There are times it's aligned & stays aligned for a long period and times it doesn't.<br /><br />3. The good news is the magnet is strong and holds. The bad news is sometimes your fork or a metal mixing bowl will stick to it. Doesn't happen a lot but a little bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Overall I world recommend this band.<br /><br />I like it.<br /><br />Just know, you might have to start it and slip it over your hand, adjust it so the Blaze buttons are aligned and your fork might stick to it once in awhile.<br /><br />To me, the upside of the band outweighs this three things<br /><br />To others it might be a world catastrophe."
3.0,"Though this is indeed a pretty piece of Malachite, the piece I received is as thin as a penny, whereas the pictures displayed rather thick albeit tiny chunks. Still looks like."
3.0,"I'm about 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs, I ordered a small and medium because I was unsure of size. The medium fit but my torso was surprisingly a little too long. It shows more cleavage than I would like. I do plan to wear it just not when I'm with my daughter. The fabric is decent for the price!"
3.0,Good to throw in your purse but not much else. I could not wear these long-term
3.0,Nice bracelet. It is a bit small. It would make a nice gift for a little girl. I would not recommend it for an adult. I have a small wrist for an adult and can barely get it on.
3.0,It was very cute looking but did not look that cute on. It was very baggy looking with no shape . It is too short for me to wear as a dress . I should have returned.
3.0,"Verr pretty and good value for the money.  Unfortunately, it's cut very slim."
3.0,Kinda small i prefer a bigger one but can't return it. Very solid. The clip is the main issue.. It doesn't clips easily..
3.0,Not for people with big feet. Socks are beautiful there are definitely 12 pair here but most of them are the low-cut socks and frankly so tiny they would fit a woman or child but not a grown man with large feet. So take the size thing as an approximation because I personally have 13.5 size feet and they say the socks fit size 13 but only the crew socks would remotely fit me. The rest look like children’s women’s socks. So not for everyone
3.0,"Good quality, but takes a long time to arrive."
3.0,Sized for little people. Be careful about up-sizing!
3.0,"Love the tools,  don't like the cheap chain"
3.0,"I could hardly wait to get this bracelet, but when it came it was two separate bracelets.  The main reason I'm returning them is the Everything Happens For a Reason tag seems so much smaller than in the picture.  That was a disappointment because this is something I truly believe in, and wanted to be able to look down and see those words, but they are way to small for me to see!  I'm returning them for this reason.  Thank you."
3.0,"Cute, but too small and I ordered up a size."
3.0,Much larger and wider than I expected. I can't imagine what this size would be good for.  I returned it.
3.0,Cute and light maybe good for the beach. Kinda see through. The middle ruffle looked a little weird like making a pouch for my tummy. Maybe just not for my body.
3.0,I like the quality and color but it's a little small for me.
3.0,"It isnt the photo that is a little blurry, it is the actual print on the dress"
3.0,"too small, very thin material, I'm 5'10 130 and I ordered an XL and it goes barely pass my butt. &#34;burgundy&#34; Is more like a crimson red"
3.0,Its ok is kinda right. You really have to look at the size and put it in perspective. looking at the pic it seems the chain is a nice size link but when you think of the size of the cross in the description its a  REAL dainty chain. Still like it because the person gettng it is dainty also. So I guess Im satisfied.
3.0,"The top and skirt are fantastic, but the gloves are awful, the arm warmers need to be tighter, and the armor is very cheap and falls apart on you. It was great in a pinch, but it could be better. People will at least know who you are."
3.0,Well made.  Purse opening too small to be useful.  Cute bag but not practical.
3.0,"Very pretty. Fit was as expected. However, I ultimately returned it because there was no slimming fabric worked into it in the tummy."
3.0,"It’s so short! The product photo is misleading. This is a necklace for a child, or it’s a long choker (it sits at the base of your neck). Otherwise it feels sturdy and I think it’s cute. Sadly the length is a deal breaker for me. I might gift it to my kid when she’s older."
3.0,I have a mixed opinion on this dress.<br /><br />Pros: The pattern is as shown in the photos. I'm 5'5&#34; and weight 125 lbs with a 34D chest. So finding dresses that fit isn't always the easiest. This dress fit well with the adjustable waist you could easily be another 30 pounds heavier and still fit into the Small.<br /><br />Cons: It has an extreme plastic smell. I've never had clothes come that smelled so badly I had to let them air out for a day just to be able to try them on. After a couple days the smell has only faded slightly and I'm concerned it won't come out in the wash. The stitching also shows in the top over the green leaves. It wouldn't be an issue however they sewed it further away from the hem then I would have liked.<br /><br />I haven't decided if it's worth the risk to keep yet. I'll update my review about the smell if I do so you can know if it comes out in the wash.
3.0,"These are very pretty and don't hand down real far like some do.  However, they are extremely hard to fasten in the back.  I bought them for my MIL, but she was unable to get the clasp secured."
3.0,"This sports bra runs small, at least on a large chest.  I picked my typical size but it was too tight.  The orange color that was sent to me is almost fluorescent. and I didn't like it at all. The fabric was nice and thick but is not something I liked."
3.0,I got a medium & it fit as expected. The bottom ripped the first day that I put them on.
3.0,"The scent  lasts the day.  But the white beads are turning ""dirty""  from the oil.  They are not pearly white anylonger.  MOre dull chalk like."
3.0,"I was expecting a more khaki color and when opened were closer to mustard and very bright. They are constructed well, but sizing recommendations make them seem to run large and there is no way to tighten.  I've determined they will be a good lounging pant for around the house."
3.0,It looks so pretty.
3.0,"Very see through, definitely need a slip under the pink dress."
3.0,Appear well made but color is not bright and light as shown in photo. In the photo they appear clear. The back is solid.
3.0,Decent glasses for the price. They keep the sun out of my eyes for sure
3.0,"These large pearl earrings are just okay.  They aren't very heavy and are easy to wear.  The pearl does look very artificial and the overall effect is not that impressive.  I think they just weren't designed all that well.  Still, just okay if you are looking for something to make an impact."
3.0,Soft with adjustable earloops. I would have given this 5 stars except the filters does not fit well in the pockets. Also the filters end up creased when i put the mask down
3.0,Not totally thrilled .In the picture it looks like a fabulous yellow but in reality it is more mustard than yellow. After a week it grew on me though
3.0,"I like the color and it is cute but I must be a fatty because there was a gap. The choker is 11 inches from hole to hole and my neck is 13 inches pulled tight  so I can not wear it with the laces facing front, not sure I can wear it at all and it does feel cheap."
3.0,Fades after first wash
3.0,Lenses too close to eyelid. Returned.
3.0,Pretty decent for the price. Had trouble taking it on and off but overall you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Best pick a name for your beautiful new pet owl,<br />Cuz you will share so many laughs with him when you open the package to find he’s actually the size of a small baby owl! Surprise! You won’t want to wear your new friend as a necklace, wow! he can watch over you from any window casting a beautiful stainglass  affect  across the room! Or if you are looking for a work out tods him around your neck like a baby carrier and head on out! But make sure to wear safety sunglasses to protect your eyes from the reflection off your amazing new friend!!"
3.0,"I’m giving these 3 stars because I couldn’t unscrew half of the earrings. Impossible! I bought them mainly for the black, rose gold and rainbow colors. I couldn’t get either one of the rainbows to unscrew nor either of the silvers and only one of the rose gold and blue one.  When I contacted the seller about this issue, I never received a response. Very disappointed!"
3.0,Expected each to have their own box. Small token was the goal for distribution.
3.0,"Cheaply made, barely has weight, tarnishes quickly, I was not impressed and definitely  was overpriced."
3.0,"Love it but not thick at all, light lining."
3.0,"Love the suit, great quality, how ever if you are a D cup or larger top won't cover. Very disapointed."
3.0,"Not 45&#34;! It's 43 inches, and barely gets around my 41&#34; waist with pants. I'll use it as incentive to lose a few pounds - but very disappointing."
3.0,To tight for an xl
3.0,"Have a tiny friend that MIGHT be able to use it, but note... thes a reason they don't show a photo of this being used as you THINK it should be... it's too small to be used that way!!"
3.0,"Looked cute, but broke easily."
3.0,Draw strings were missing
3.0,"First of all, the quality of this bag is very good for the price point.  The size is as described and fits my 11"" iPad Pro perfectly with a folio case.  The strap is comfortable and the sling bag style is convenient and practical for a bag this size.  There are two negative items that I feel must be addressed and are the reason for my three start rating.  First is the lack of a second zipper slider on the main compartment (or any of the zippered openings).  The zippers appear to be of really good quality and have metal sliders and pulls, but the lack of a second zipper means that when the bag is closed, the zipper slider is always on one particular size.  One big advantage of the sling bag is quick deployment when swung around to the front of your body, and while the shoulder strap is left/right swappable, the zipper obviously isn't with only one slider.  This might seem like a small thing, but I've found it a bit difficult to get over.  The second item is that the swivel on the shoulder strap is a snap fit plastic part.  The shoulder strap should arguably be one of the strongest parts of a bag, and this bag has a quality strap, but a weak swivel connection.  It has popped off (strap completely disconnected) several times almost causing me to drop the bag - fortunately I caught it both times before it hit the ground.  The swivel fitting snapped right back in and felt as sturdy as ever, but I can't trust it anymore.  For a casual trip to the store this might be okay, but I have to find a replacement that I can trust with a bit more versatility and thought put into the zippers and strap swivel point."
3.0,Rings are a very soft material and are ok. I got the incorrect size and when I tries to return them I was charged more for the shipping label then the actual product. Not happy about so it was not worth returning them. Bad service.
3.0,"Hold under nose, I could easy just repair this but after paying alittle over $40.00 for this item I don’t want to take any chances that the other threading will come loose as well.<br />Daughter disappointed, this was her Halloween outfit, she was supper excited to dress as her favorite pet hedgehog. Frustrating but company did allow me to return the item for a full refund so I will update once that is taken care of.<br />As the product itself, the material is thick and heavy. Would be amazing for a cold Halloween night but extremely hott for a warm day."
3.0,Great watch but add said came with original box did not receive the box
3.0,"I assume, it should be for kids, right? however, it is even large on my had :)"
3.0,Too long for my sister. A size smaller would have fit better on leg itself but still would have been WAY too long. Wish they had a petite option.
3.0,It looked cheap and the material did not look like good quality.  It had a spot on it when I got it. I returned it
3.0,It looks good when you see it in the picture and still in real.. but I bought it as a gift for my sister and it was big for her. Might be good for someone else if you like big glasses.
3.0,Would have fit my body better if the straps were longer. Wish they simply had the adjustable straps most dresses have.
3.0,Buy a bigger size. Our 6 year old is on the little size for his age - 56 lbs. After washed it did shrink in my opinion. Next time I would buy two sizes bigger for him. The size we bought was for “7-8 years”<br />We were able to put letters on it easily. The first picture is him wearing it when we got it and the second picture is on Halloween after washing.
3.0,The glasses are really small I ordered them for my 8 and 10 year old and they are  to small. But the shipping was fast.
3.0,Such a cute shirt but Sizing runs big.  I wish I ordered a size smaller.
3.0,"Great look and feel.  the clip works great for money.  But, the business card option is hard to access/use.  subjective if you will like it.  I will neither recommend purchase nor dissuade purchase."
3.0,Good value for the price.  The dangles fall off after a few days.  Great if you take them off and on but not to put in and leave in because the dangles end up missing.
3.0,"Got this for a bridesmaid dress while pregnant--definitely accommodated baby bump. The one ""meh"" part is the waist band, which looks a little cheap satin-y, so I ended up covering it with a piece of the florist's ribbon at the wedding. Is a little more cotton-candy-ish than blush, but it worked fine among all the other interpretations of ""blush"" at the wedding."
3.0,Worked great the first couple times I wore them but after just a few washes they no longer stay up.
3.0,"Was not the color that I was hoping for, but will keep it."
3.0,"Keeps good time, band easily adjustable with instructions and tool provided. Watch fairly heavy. If they can give you a glass crystal, why can't Casio, Timex and Seiko?"
3.0,Would like them to have a bit more stretch. They slip off my feet
3.0,Gets the job done & is a great price but very thin & cheaply made!
3.0,"I'm not gonna lie to you guys. I bought a mens hoodie because I am always stealing mens hoodies from men and I tried to be responsible and just buy my own. It fits weird. Probably not weird if you're a tall skinny guy; Itd fit you perfectly. But it's very long. The bottom of the hoodie is tight and clings to you, so it looks weird if you're not pulling it down all the time. Which is a look you might want. But for me, I wasnt a fan.<br /><br />I don't know where you men buy your stealable hoodies. The search continues."
3.0,Small for my wife.
3.0,very cute. underwear fits well and comfortably but top small. will be giving away
3.0,"Big earrings!  Wish description had included the size, but designs as noted."
3.0,"For looks, they are the absolute cutest slipper-slides out there. I waited for months for these to get in stock and was so excited to receive them. However I can tell that they won't last long.  There is also this really weird hump or bump that runs right across the middle, under the arch of my foot (it's definitely not arch support, it is a thin hump that runs horizontal across the shoe). I guess I'm getting used to it because it seems to be wearing away as I am wearing them. And they do run big, which I'm thankful that the top is adjustable. I have it as tight as it will go and it fits well like that but the velcro already seems to be loosening after only a week, so I will likely need to reinforce that part soon. I'm a size 7 and purchased a medium. Should've went with a small probably. I also feel like the cushioning in them will wear down soon too. I wanted to love these with a solid 5 stars based on their looks, but I just can't based on how they're made and how they feel."
3.0,"Argh!  These are for props in a play, and I need them to fit on larger heads.  They do not fit on my head.  Frustrated."
3.0,Looks great.....smells like cheap plastic
3.0,It works and fits
3.0,Not a good quality..
3.0,It was very cute but it fell apart after one day.
3.0,"Reviews dated may 9 2010 and Feb 7 2011 are accurate. My watch seems to be partly broken (produces no sound, one of the buttons is hard to press, and the seconds hand does not align well with the tick marks, making it confusing to know what exact second it is), which I might be able to get fixed under warranty, but I'm surprised that the watch has no illumination for the digital portion (the phosphor for the analog portion is adequate). The so called countdown timer is of a very strange design, made to count down to a date, with no way to specify a time. My watch also arrived with dead batteries, which I understand is accepted practice, but still a tad annoying, and finally, the nice wooden case showed sings of breakage and attempted repair."
3.0,Noisy rubbing on my ears
3.0,it's a nice bracelet.. a bit loose but nice.
3.0,"This is a very cute knee length chamise & it fits well. I purchased a large. I'm about five feet tall & weigh about 105. I do wear my nightgowns a bit big, but this gown must run a lot smaller, as the shoulder seams hit in the right spot. There is no slippage or sliding. It has a one button closure & the ribbon bow is non-functional, it's for looks only. The elastic around the neckline and arms is pretty thin. I don't think it will stand up to years of use and repeated washing. The biggest issue is in the description. It was presented as 100% cotton. It isn't. The tag says it's modal, which is a cotton substitute made from beech and/or eucalyptus trees and some pretty harsh chemicals used in processing of this fabric. The overall texture is more like Rayon. The breathability of real cotton is just not there and causes a great deal of perspiration that doesn't dry or ""wick"" away.<br />The fabric is fairly stiff, but will probably loosen up after washing. It's worth the $10- I paid for it, but had it cost any more than that, I would have returned it. Overall, I'm disappointed. I wanted to love this garment. I doubt I'll wear it to sleep in, but it's something easy to throw on after a shower or to lounge in, as long as the weather is on the cool side."
3.0,I am usually between a medium and large and based on other reviews went with the large.  That was a mistake and returned.
3.0,Pretty but hard to clasp on your own.
3.0,These are alright but aren't made very nicely. One side is longer than the second one and bows aren't that cute either
3.0,These are actually decent glasses. My only issue is that it seems like they are only made for people with very large heads. They do not fit my head or face like I need them too
3.0,Clip is missing
3.0,"disappointed no side pockets, but does keep you warm...\not the best coat i ever bought due to the lack of pockets."
3.0,"Unfortunately, one chain came loose right away, had to repair.  Definitely cheaply made, but for the price... oh well.  Thx"
3.0,"Little large for US size comparison, would recommend buying one size smaller. Not bad for the $."
3.0,"I would like to give this product 5 stars b/c of it's great look and feel, but I can't for these reasons:<br /><br />- I've ordered 2 of these and both have broken within 1-4 months of normal wear.<br />- The price has fluctuated from very low to very high, and I don't appreciate that as a consumer; it makes me consider not re-buying."
3.0,not much support
3.0,"They are too small,  have form of protection from  outside air, have no place to fit a filter.<br />They are beautiful,  but I would not recommend them for protection ."
3.0,"Love the design, very cute. Comes a bit short and wide for my particular body type. Would have gone up a size"
3.0,I love this dress. I’m 5”3 230 I’m very thick especially around my chest and butt area. This is my go to dress whenever I want something cute as casual my dressy. Colors are bright on the dress. It buttons all the way down. However after a few washes it faded. Considering buying it again.
3.0,Kinda cheap but at the price it’s ok
3.0,"They aren't as form fitting as my previous leather gloves and not as nice, but those were Armani, you get what you pay for. Definitely nice for the price."
3.0,Cute but the flower didn’t last. We ended up j St pulling them both off and using the shoes for backyard play.
3.0,Disappointed that the color was not as vibrant as shown.
3.0,"These bralettes are very cute and after one wear seem to be well made, however the fit isn't the best for me. I should have listened to the other reviewer who mentioned the same complaints. I wear a 36DDD and ordered the XL. The cups are too small and don't offer enough coverage as I have some spillage, however at the same time the band is a little too loose. I'm still going to wear them though as I was really just looking for something to wear at home during quarantine so I feel slightly more put together for work zoom meetings. Spillage notwithstanding, still pretty comfortable to wear."
3.0,Nice belt but has to few holes.  I had to put a few holes in the belt myself.
3.0,Material is very thin and start to come apart at the seams and fre even though it fit fine after just 2 uses
3.0,"My fault, I admit but I’m annoyed with how this product is listed. In Dec 2018 I purchased the burgundy long sleeve dress. I just came back to amazon, hit purchase again to go to the listing to purchase a navy one, found the navy option and boom it’s at my door, now washed dryer and ready to go. That’s when I realized it was the short sleeve version and not what I wanted at all. Again, my fault for not double checking but I hate when different styles are under one listing."
3.0,not much tummy control going on with these...I was looking for more compression and these are just like yoga shorts.....
3.0,Just ok in texture and function. Not as soft or stretchy as I hoped. Good length and thickness for warm winter socks. Wish they had a bit more elasticity so they don’t slide down so easily on the calf. Boasts of rabbit fur/hair used to make them but can’t really tell.
3.0,"bought these for a 4 ea old for christmas who LOVES disney princess but i thought disney's shoes were costly and i found these and it comes with SIX pairs! all different all super cute and packaged together nicely. they haven't even been wrapped for christmas yet but i took one out and it seems like pretty duralble plastic, there are also little rubber slip guards on the pad of the foot and heel on th bottom of the show which is nice and they don't seem like they can fall off or rub off.and the top of the shoe is a flex rubber which should be fairly comfortable, the bows are actually sewn on to this flex plastic so no more super glueing!and the heel is about a 2 inch rise :-)"
3.0,It's too small on me
3.0,Good for the<br />Rice
3.0,"It arrived within a week of me ordering it, which was great. It seems to be made of quality material but it is a tight fit. I have it stuffed and now wish it was approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch wider. It has a strong snap and lots of places to put credit cards, which might be the problem, I filled up everything. I would still recommend it, but think about the overall size."
3.0,The design is pretty but its kinda shiny and too big. I did not like how it fits.
3.0,Nice fit. But cheap material
3.0,Cute comfortable outfit but mine came with marks on the shirt that I can not get out
3.0,Thin material. Reminds me of a nightgown; in fact she used it as a night gown instead of wearing it out as a dress.
3.0,"I bought the 2XL so I can have a loose comfortable fit.... it's skin tight like a medium size would fit. Plus, you feel everything through them, if the blankets are cold, you feel it. If you are walking around in your house and it's a little chilly, you feel it. But, it is a comfortable sleep, not to hot or cold once your body warms the sheets. They are very comfortable but I would suggest wearing a robe or hoodie until it's bed time."
3.0,The penguins don't show up as crisply as they do in this photo. Perhaps it's because black on dark blue doesn't provide much contrast and the print itself looks very textured. But a penguin is a penguin when gifting...
3.0,"I'd have to agree with the other reviewers who said it was thinner than expected and smaller than expected. This could work for some outfits, but not for my purposes."
3.0,"I wore these shoes for less than a year.  They are very comfortable, stylish and fit as expected.  The only negative is that the shoes just didn't hold up as long as I would expect.  The rubber on the front of the shoe is very thin and cracked.  Also, the stitching broke in a couple of areas on my shoes."
3.0,I’ve had a couple wallets very similar to this one. This one does not want to stretch out at all to hold my cards. I’ve had this wallet 6 months now. Still won’t stretch out. Good quality I guess but a pain in my ass
3.0,"The belt is nice but, The medium is 44 inches long and then stretches to an insane 58 inches long. I have a 37 inch waist and the medium doesn't work for me. It fits me on the last hole but then provides absolutely no support. I don't even know if the small is going to work, now I have to decide whether or not to waist my time to return a 10 buck item. Just pisses me off."
3.0,Nice but runs very small and no stretch.
3.0,"This is the 3rd pair of Telsa's I've bought in XL.  One is now too big, one fits fine, and these are so small they were see-through.  NOt sure about the sizing issues."
3.0,The velcro part of this shoe is extremely difficult to keep clean. Shoe size on the small side.
3.0,In the 6 pieces i have got 2 dmaged pieces
3.0,It's not cute like other sashes.  It's like a long piece of cloth
3.0,WOULD LIKE A LABEL FOR ITEM TO BE RETURNED
3.0,Straps broke easily
3.0,"The style was great, but the fabric was thin and see thru."
3.0,"I could make this work  and it does help to shape and sculpt, but it is too complicated to easily place exactly as I'd like.<br />The velcro was strong and will hold.<br />Not quite right for me, but I'm sure others will love it."
3.0,"Too thick, and very expensive. For some reason I thought I was getting a pack of three for the price. Also, they were much bigger than I wanted. I should have sized down, or even better, bought something thinner and lighter. I was looking for a breathable running sock and these are more of a cushioned veg around the house sock. May be good for hiking?"
3.0,not sized as advertised. Had to give it to my daughter instead of my wife.
3.0,fabric is on the cheap side and the fit is clingy.
3.0,"I got all of them, the only one that I used so far is the one with the ying-yang symbol on it. I noticed that it was crooked when I looked in the mirror while wearing it, went to go move it over a bit and it snatched right off. Now I'm currently going to fix it myself and hopefully I can continue wearing it. This makes me hesitant and cautious to wear all the other ones."
3.0,Esta bien bonito... Soy large con los vestidos y este me quedó suelto nada que ver como la foto así ajustadito en la cintura y eso... Pero la tela es muy buena y el estilo y color bonito... Ya saben pedirlo un tamaño menos.
3.0,Somewhat cheap material
3.0,"I was expecting the fabrics to be kinda ""heather pink"" like in the picture with the brown haired girl. But it's totally not.  Scroll thru and find the pics/vids of the blond girl wearing the shirt in order to see what the shirt actually looks like.  I thought I was getting the shirt worn by the brown haired model so I'm a little disappointed."
3.0,"Super cute shirt, just very small. I normally wear a L if I want a tighter fit, or an XL if I want a looser fit. The L was way too small, both in length and size. The XL definitely fits more like a smaller L. The material is also different. Not like a tshirt material. It’s not as soft as a normal tshirt."
3.0,sewn oddly
3.0,I did return and got a prompt refund.
3.0,"This swimsuit works. I don’t like how the padding of the top just moves around in a way that makes one look a little caddiwompus up top. It also comes in at the shoulders a little weird. However, it works and has a good length."
3.0,"This was my second order for this dress.  This time the dress fit, but the belt was to small.  I really like the dress and so wanted it, but I've returned it and decided not to order it for a third time in hopes that it will be correct."
3.0,Material is thick and uncomfortable.<br />Sizing runs small
3.0,"Too large for me, and the calves want to fall off"
3.0,"I bought this on a whim. I found the material to be thin and it to fit a bit odd around the chest and bust area. It might work well for anyone who is very thin, but if you have any curves I would either size up or look elsewhere. The material was thinner so be aware of that as well."
3.0,this item was missing the belt so I ended up sending it back but when i tried it on it was cute
3.0,"I felt comfortable in this bathing suit.  It was a bit big, but I did purchase a size larger than usual since most reviews warned about the bathing suits running small.  My ONLY real issue with the bathing suit is that the color bleeds when wet.  Pink dye everywhere!"
3.0,"It would be very nice if it were the right size. It only fits 6S plus, tho it says 6S/6S plus. I should have noticed when there was no option to choose 6S or 6S plus."
3.0,Pros:<br />great silhouette<br />cost-efficient<br />light-weight<br /><br />Cons:<br />need to order 1-2 sizes up<br />cheap materials<br />should've sewn flap around the bottom so it would close properly.
3.0,The outer butterfly fell off within days of the first use and the watch has the tendency to be itchy.
3.0,the quality of the crown and the hinge is not very good feel loose but okay .
3.0,"Its a great color, it fits kind of snug, and the sleeves are really baggie and long.. but nice material."
3.0,Watch button is blue not red. Not happy.
3.0,"The shades look very sleek, But!! Was out in public and one of my lens fell out twice! 😳😌 first time wearing them!"
3.0,"you can use it for decoration of a hat, but it is painful to use as glasses"
3.0,Great KS necklace but the color was not as expected.  A little too neon for my taste
3.0,It should be compared to something such as as a coffee mug to show the size. Nice detail but a little too small.
3.0,small and hard to see what they are.. yellow dogs would show up better.  This will be part of a raffle prize - I was hoping they'd be a bit more visible or show better what they are.
3.0,"They do what they are intended to do and are a good length, but the material they are made of  makes them not 4 or 5 star worthy. When lacing them they have a slip factor to them and when used for a short period of time they get lose and need to be retied.  Will be looking for a different type when I order next time because I don't like having to retie them numerous times during a skate session."
3.0,"I was Very hopeful for these earring. I recieved 9 sets of earrings, 2 of which are exactly the same, in style and color.  The backs do NOT fit on the posts, So I will have to get new backs if I want to even wear them. I was not given the colors that were shown, a set that was supposed to be rose gold, is actually yellow gold."
3.0,Product cheaply made. Broke easily.
3.0,Strange cut and not as pictured
3.0,"I ordered the mask with pink gems and instead I received one with the silver colored ones; however, I'm really happy with it. It's super cute and I can't wait to wear it for prom!!"
3.0,Band is very thin and stones are small. Picture makes it look bigger. A little disappointed.
3.0,So the watch itself is gorgeous- I move around enough at my job so the fact that it's not battery-powered is fine. I haven't taken it off since I put it on three days ago. Literally- the clasp is stuck.
3.0,The trimming and fabric is nice
3.0,"Comfy pants but after a couple wash, it looks old."
3.0,"I had returned a pair because one leg was shorter than the other, new pair is the same way just not as bad......"
3.0,"I read the reviews. I knew what I was buying. I ordered larger than I needed but, these are not 9s. The stretch is ok. They're pretty thin. I got them just to do yard work or mow etc. Order two sizes up.<br /><br />You get what you pay for."
3.0,I love the look of this bathing suit but was unable to tighten the straps a little (bc they’re not adjustable) and the seat of the suit is narrower than I would like. I need more buttock coverage at age 52.
3.0,Cute suit. Too small in areas and too big in others.
3.0,Cute but definitely smaller than expected
3.0,"LOVE the necklace, I got SOOOOO many compliments on it, unfortunately it's cheaply made and one tug from my toddler and the whole thing came apart, still bought another one though lol"
3.0,Doesn't hold up for long.  Spring fails to hold the clip in place. But what can one expect for that low price.
3.0,Shrinks alot! I washed again and stretched it out to dry.
3.0,"This scarf is beautiful but it sheds everywhere. If you wear this with anything dark, you will be covered in puffs of scarf. I hesitate to wear it as it makes a mess over all my pants and shirts."
3.0,"the wallet is absolutely beautiful,  but on the product description it says it would fit 3 passports. unfortunately it didnt work for me. the wallet wouldnt close when 1 placed the 3 passports in. i will have to return it just for this reason."
3.0,These sunglasses are cute but seem to be for a larger head. They slide off constantly.
3.0,Cute but WAY too small. The model in the picture must be 5' tall and 95 lbs.
3.0,I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter. She loves them!
3.0,"They are not very comfy on the nose.  But I got them to keep the glasses from slipping,  which they did a good job of.  That is until they start to move around.  They don't stay stuck in place,  and they leave a trail of adhesive goop."
3.0,"I got this dress for Christmas, I was so damn excited! Out of the box, the fabric was nice, heavy, not see through and well made.<br /><br />The problem came when I tried it on, it was super long, I got the one with the long sleeves and the sleeves were weirdly wide at the wrist!? Wth. Additionally, the bottom skirt part was super big to the point that it made  my stomach look huge and my butt look ridiculous.<br /><br />So, top half great for big boobs and not see through. Bottome half enormous.  Plus side? If you are a big booty girl or have a bigger tummy, I am surr this would be a great dress."
3.0,"This is not a tiny back pack.  it is medium to large sized.  The plaque with the name on it is crooked, and it has gibberish written on it.  No discernible words, just random letters.  weird.  Overall, It does look cute, and my daughter likes it."
3.0,I followed the sizing chart and the dress is two sizes too big for me. Wrong size chart
3.0,string broke after two weeks of wear.  ended up attaching the mittens with clips instead.
3.0,Good quality but pockets are huge which makes dress stick out
3.0,"These are nice looking, but I don't see much difference between these and regular sunglasses."
3.0,This is beautiful af first but then shrinks Like crazy when you wash it. Soooo bummed!!!!!!!!! Can’t return it since I washed it😞
3.0,The cross body strap broke but I made it work also. I love my purse .
3.0,Had to return  ran so small with very short sleeves
3.0,Do I think the protectors serve a purpose? Yes.  I've thrown away many cables because of the cord breaking from using my phone while charging.  Do I think these are a pain? Yes.  They are nearly impossible to put on and I can't get these to work on all my cables even though 99% of them are apple cables.  The ones that do work have been placed in areas that I'm more likely to use my phone/ipad while charging.<br />Would I recommend? Sure. I guess for a few bucks it's worth it.
3.0,3 1/2 months on an 11 yr olds feet and they disintegrated from the toe to mid foot. WOuld be an awesome buy if they were made to last a bit longer under average wear.
3.0,"I buy PJs too large on purpose, for comfort.  I take them in as needed.  And then I cut off  some length and hem them shorter.  .<br /><br />These have frustrated me.  The fabric is very difficult to work with.  It slips and slides.  Even with a new and very fine needle in the machine, the thread bunches up, so the pajamas do not look good.  I have worn myself out trying to fix them and will just have to make the most of a bad job, even though I hate giving up!.<br />."
3.0,The cuffs frayed pretty quickly but it is very nice looking
3.0,It Does not look as nice in person.  I would not have purchased if I had seen it in person.
3.0,Purchased and within 1 month the bars on one side broke. I would not recommend you purchase this if you are looking for great quality. Very Cheap for a Big Price.
3.0,Designed for taller women
3.0,fit is a little small
3.0,"I'm a 53 year old triathlete looking for a swim goggle that doesn't leave deep raccoon marks for the whole day after a morning swim.  I've been swimming with the Speedo Vanquishers (great fit, no fogging or leaking, but ugh those MARKS!) for years and decided to try something new after two co-workers in one day asked me if I was okay.  After some considerable on-line review searches, I ordered these.  They feel fabulous and the basket is soft and they stay on my face without a tight strap fit.  They are optically awesome, these lenses made the pool seem bright and clear and I could read the pace clock just fine.  Unfortunately, they did not solve the problem of the goggle marks.  Gonna keep them because they feel great."
3.0,Love the quality of the shirt but it runs small. I will buy another but just a larger size.
3.0,"To be honest, I just couldn't find anything better.  The case for my sunglasses is huge.  It just takes up way too much room in my purse, so I was looking for a way to carry my sunglasses either inside my purse or external to it.  This bola is certainly better than nothing, but I am concerned that the glasses will fall out of it, especially when I bend over."
3.0,"I ordered an ‘XL’, size is closer to a larger or medium.  However, I am loosing weight so will keep the once I bought.  Nice fabric and large oks to be well made.  Size was the only issue for me."
3.0,I like the product but I think the size run large
3.0,This is a good shirt to run errands in but do not dry it as the lettering will come off. Also the &#34;m&#34; at the end of mom is positioned weird.
3.0,"It is fine. Fits fine, looks fine. The fabric is just so bad. It is super thin, luckily it is dark so you can't see through it. Other than thin fabric, this is fine."
3.0,"It looks like the pictured image and is comfortable, though on the smallest setting it sits with visible gaps on the sides of my head. Unfortunately I will be returning it as it's too big for me to use, but the color and the style were just what I was looking for."
3.0,Cheap summer wear
3.0,"The item is cut weird,  really wide and it doesn't lay nicely around the shoulders."
3.0,This raincoat is great. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because it did not come with the carry bag that was advertised.
3.0,Size is significantly smaller that what it says.... From an adult medium it looks and feels like a youth small.
3.0,Not bad for a cheap pair of sunglasses. They are polarized but not as well as my $10 Walmart specials. Still worth it as a back up I guess.
3.0,Very pretty but hand wash because they are delicate and the part that has glue on it will come apart..
3.0,"I want to write an honest review!<br />Though I didn’t like it, it is not entirely bad product.<br />The only factual complaint I have is that the chain looks crooked and misplaced at the two unions as if it had been joined/ attached incorrectly.<br /><br />The rest of the bracelet is fine. My other comments are biased because of other stainless steel bracelets I own and the unfulfilled expectations I had about this one."
3.0,The B cup is more like D or DD.  They are nice but there’s a lot of open space in those cups!  I could hide a couple of cantaloupes.  I bought them (4) to wear with tops where the colored bra strap will show.  They work for that purpose but it’s a bit of false advertising that I am that well endowed.
3.0,But it's flimsy.
3.0,Awesome. It is just very flimsy and delicate. I have had it for a while and it hasn't broken but I would just prefere it to be more durable.
3.0,"Fits great but can't take straps up , they fall off shoulders!"
3.0,The company sent us the wrong size... but we love these shows. They normally run pretty big so we size down
3.0,Definitely a super cute bathing suit I ordered a medium since I am not a heavy person it fit but the back clip pulled me a little too tight which made it uncomfortable so I did return it I wanted to re-order but they did not have a large in stock for the color I wanted but definitely super cute for cheap. In the future when my size comes back I would probably order again
3.0,There are molding spots on the sole towards the front of your feet that hurt to walk on.
3.0,"This dress is pretty eh. I'll be returning it. The fabric is soft but stretchy and shiny kind of like Nike dri-fit, not soft and cuddly like the perfect t-shirt. The fit was a little big but the material had sooooooo much static cling it kept sticking to weird parts of my thighs."
3.0,These are pretty but terribly small.  I guess I didn't read the fine print cause I wasn't prepared for them to be child size.  Will  have to do a better job of reading next time.
3.0,I do not like the material. Too Shiny.
3.0,"Definitely way smaller than expected. Even after ordering two sizes up. It just fits, but I wanted it to be much bigger and drape down more. Cute cardigan, very soft. Also very thin. Would have given 5 stars had it actually felt like an XXL. Just felt like a regular small cardigan."
3.0,My little one weighs about 22 lbs and this was a rather large.
3.0,"Cute sunglasses, but they aren't polarized as advertised. For that reason, I returned them."
3.0,"I am pear shaped so it's big on top and it was some what big on the hips and butt. I was hoping to wear it this weekend, too bad. I'm 5'1 and 150 lbs. I carry majority of the weight on bottom. Also the sleeves are too long."
3.0,It fit way too big.
3.0,The bottoms fit like the picture looks.  It does run small  I’m 5’ 1” and 103 lbs. ordered a large by previous reviews  The top does not fit like I would like. The shoulder straps could be about an inch longer. I will make it work.  Material is nice
3.0,Material is good. Just short in lenght nothing like the photo. Falls off shoulders.
3.0,"Cut very small, short arms"
3.0,A little bit cheap and don't really shade my eyes.
3.0,"I read lots of reviews and went ahead and ordered a size up, big mistake! I am usually a size L or XL so I decided to order an XXL having just given birth and still have some of that pregnant belly. I am 5'10 and 200lbs at the moment...this dress was too big, and too long to my liking so I sent it back. A size Large would have been just fine for me. The material is very stretchy which I liked and it's the reason why I think a Large would have been fine. Overall I did like the dress and would've ordered it again but decided to go look for dresses at stores seeing that I had an event coming soon."
3.0,They were just ok! I didn’t like the fact that they were a little over stretched to different sizes. I also noticed they would loosen more when I would put a little too much oil by accident.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is very soft and comfortable; but, it is not as shown above. There is no secondary 'shirt' layer with a collar underneath as displayed; it's just the sweatshirt with the hoodie. I'm keeping it because it is comfortable; and, have a 2nd on the way in a different color. Just commenting on the difference in appearance."
3.0,Perhaps the upper portion of my shoe is too thick???  It seemed to work great but I was walking around the house and lost one.  So maybe I put it on wrong...I found it.  Put it back on.  Then  the second day when two of the fittings popped off.  I have Nike shoes and surely it is a standard eye.  This seems like a great idea but as soon as u lose one u look stupid and ur shoes are loose.  I also got the locks and cut the ends of the strings so not sure what to do now.
3.0,These are stretchy but are too small. I suggest ordering one size up
3.0,Way smaller than I expected
3.0,"The lenses were OK, but the frame was not 'oversized' as I expected. Good for the price---as back-ups."
3.0,I loved the detail in the skull and it is a decent pocket sized keychain. However I didn’t like That after a few days the screw attaching the chain to the head snapped in half. Not sure if I want to drill another hole in it to attach another chain or just keep it on the shelf as a conversation piece.
3.0,"Unfortunately, the yellow material was more thin and sheer, and the cut didn’t work for my body type in such a bright color. The color, combined with how form fitting it was, just wasn’t flattering at all on me. Made my belly the most apparent, which was the last thing I wanted to highlight. I might try ordering in a darker color, but with my shape I think the dress just won’t really work for me. I’m 5’3”, and about 145 for reference."
3.0,The fingers are to long
3.0,"This is a very petty necklace, but it is not very giftable. I assumed this would arrive in a box. It did not. It can in a black cinch bag. I got this for my Mother in law for Mother’s Day. I was disappointed, but did not have the time to return and wait for something else to arrive. If you plan on getting for a gift for someone else I’d reconsider."
3.0,"it was cute but very, very small"
3.0,Pins were a bit short
3.0,"The picture is of shoes, but it was actually a face mask that I have as a gift to a friend. Seemed like she liked it, but don't order it if you're in a hurry."
3.0,materiel okay...size fit
3.0,"4XL ordered for my daughter, fitsmy daughter who's an XL with a little bit of room to spare."
3.0,"the straps are too thiny i think it will damage early, so the material it's too weak. i'm really disappointed."
3.0,It is ok but does not actually do what I was told it would.
3.0,I have a big head and this would fit a normal human.  It feels just a tad small I tied it right but my head is fighting this hat.  Rag... thing.  I’ll update if it stays on.
3.0,"I normally wear mediums, and the shirt was too small, but I was able to give it to my best friend. Even though the shorts are a little big, I can roll them up and they are still comfy. I do wear the shorts often. I’m 5 foot and 126 pounds.<br /><br />Note: I do not like tight clothing."
3.0,The &#34;cami&#34; area that covers the torso and bust is very low.  You could potentially expose parts of your bust you don't want showing through the sheer area of the top.
3.0,It looks sturdy but doesn't fit with my 38mm buckle. Too wide so doesn't click and also too narrow so my male bucket can't go in.<br />Both are for 38mm strap but doesn't fit to each other. Maybe not universal size.<br /><br />And it even came a day late so I couldn't actually use it too.
3.0,Just too big and baggy on me. Cant wear with jeans
3.0,It’s a very nice mask however I thought I was ordering a mask that said Montana and when it got here oh it was Virginia??
3.0,"A bit low quality in the leather, and the magnetic clasp is not strong (I've worn mine maybe 7 or 8 times and just noticed that it fell off my wrist sometime today and I've lost it.)"
3.0,Kinda cheap looking and is smaller than the pic appears but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"The quality of the &#34;leather&#34; is low but, as always, you get what you pay for ... especially out of China."
3.0,"This outfit was really cute and not a bad deal. I ordered the cream one in my normal size Medium. I’m 5’6 and 140lbs and kind of built like a door.<br /><br />The bottoms were very flattering for me, however they were very sheer. So white or tan underwear will be needed. The top was a little tighter than expected with not much stretch due to the material. I debated on sending this back but decided to just be mindful of my underwear choices and have a more of a tighter crop top look."
3.0,Loved the top but the description fails to inform the purchaser that it is flared at the bottom.
3.0,"It is too large for this year!  Hopefully, she can wear it next year!"
3.0,The pants are too big the shirt is to short not a great item
3.0,Loose if you are a child. Nice shirt though.
3.0,Great dress. Runs large. Size down. Never wore for this reason.
3.0,looks better in the picture than in real life... I like it but for a more casual event than what it appears in the picture.  Good beach dress because it does not wrinkle.
3.0,a little small and the material could’ve been a lil better :/ the zipper is also very hard to unzip
3.0,"The T Shirt is high quality. But, I ordered a L and they sent me a small (with a L label). Order two sizes larger than what you need"
3.0,"Size chart was off. I recommend sizing down.<br />The green color was beautiful and the fabric was soft. However, the button accent did absolutely nothing to give the shirt any shape. It looked like someone had just sewen random buttons on the seam of the shirt."
3.0,Too tight though hips.<br />I usually wear a small or medium… If a product comes in extra small -usually small works for me. In this case I should’ve ordered a medium.
3.0,"I got a large and I'm 5'6"" and 145lbs. It was way too big! I just didn't like the fit bc it wasn't my style. I would say it's true to size though. I should have gotten medium or small."
3.0,It did not fit me well. I have a short waist.
3.0,Very cute.. but the glitter was gone on the front within a week!!
3.0,"Really nice, but when I sit down it`s just ripped :("
3.0,"I bought this in black and fell in LOVE with it. It fit perfectly, it looks flattering, feels soft, and can be dressed up or down. Then I ordered the grey... and my love for this fizzled out. First time I wore it, the dye in the fabric interacted with my deodorant and turned my under arms a gross black and blue color. This was not exactly what I envisioned. I'm pretty disappointed."
3.0,These are very nice glasses for a toddler.<br />They were too tight behind the ears. My first pair was a rubberized black pair that were much better.<br />I will purchase from them again.
3.0,"I used it for a small hiking trip. Couldn’t drink the water because it tasted like plastic. Used the water to rise out my mouth. After a year it still smells like plastic. Tried soap, lemon juice .nothing has worked."
3.0,"Comfortable. The bling does fall off... mine came with a pice missing and 2 have come off since. It's not obvious, still . I like a platform sandal that is soft. These are"
3.0,I have not had them on for a full day so we will see! They fit good so far but a full cold day will tell.
3.0,fit nicely but the bra padding is very small doesnt really offer support
3.0,"Well.  I REALLY wanted to love this.  I was super excited for it.  My issue is the purple gem is pretty big.  To big imo.  But other than that, it's cute"
3.0,"Love the colors and material, but it runs small and I don't like the zipper all the way down the back of the dress. Unfortunately I'll be returning this one."
3.0,"Of all the dozens of running short brands I’ve come across over the years the Baleaf 7” running shorts are simply the best in price, quality and fit compared to any other.  Yes they truly just that incredible!  So why only 3 stars? Because the length is not as described as 7” like the other styles or supposed to be which of all my half dozen pairs those have all really measured 6.5” not 7”.  THESE SHORTS MEASURE AT 8” Not 7” as described.<br /><br />So just a word of caution when length is important to people with shorter legs."
3.0,The material wrinkles very easy. Would probably not buy again.  Dress was cute.
3.0,Adult size but otherwise perfect
3.0,"Got these through a deal on VIPON and was excited at first.  Packaging was nice, and case is solid.  Glasses themselves are lightweight and frame is durable.  Ear grip is nice black rubber. Nose-piece bumpers are rubberized - but metal piece should have also been black metal to match the frame. It cheapens the look.<br /><br />The frame isn’t the problem though - it’s the lenses in them.  They’re so flimsy that they came out while I was simply cleaning them with a cloth!  Luckily it popped right back in, but clearly not best quality.  Could be thicker and more durable."
3.0,"I got a small and it fit more like a medium, the straps in the back were uneven and oddly proportioned. The bottoms were decent but they fit so weird. I can manage with the top but the bottoms aren't even wearable."
3.0,"I love the design and it fit well. However, the leather is kind of thin. It's also rather fragile and easy to pull one of the rivets holding the chains in, out. Once you pull one of those out, it's impossible to get it back in. So this is more for show. I would not recommend this for people who would usually be rough while wearing a collar."
3.0,Love these but these ripped super fast. Here’s fit great! Material felt generated but was obviously cheap
3.0,"It looked good online. But when I ordered it, it was too big and looked like a pillowcase. There was no way to salvage it so sent it back."
3.0,Bought these to complete a little red riding hood costume.. they did the trick. Cheap little toddler shoes.
3.0,"The top is a little too small, but other than that i love it!"
3.0,Picture is better than the actual product but all in all good piece
3.0,Did not look very good on my husband.
3.0,"This is a simple, light weight frock with spaghetti straps.  It is a good choice for vacation travel as it can be rolled and only take a tiny space in your luggage.  Also it hand washes well and can be towel dried or hanger dried in your cabin or hotel bathroom although it is also machine washable.  The problem with this dress is that it's not very well constructed.  There is a lace hem on the top flounce and the hem which has already started to separate."
3.0,Bends very easily but it's cute!
3.0,I believe the improper fit is due to my body type and proportions rather than the actual suit.  Had to send it back.
3.0,"Not too crazy about them, They're nothing special just o,k. But it's a good buy.<br />Frames are smaller then expected."
3.0,Fabric  seemed a bit  cheap but reasonable for the price
3.0,"I liked the shorts, great fit. But the button popped off the first time I tried them on. Had to take it to the cleaners for them to put a new button on."
3.0,I finally got this today. It looks really cute on the site but in person it's still kind of cute but not really what was expected. The material is REALLY thick and kind of wears a little bit weirdly. I love the length of this though it goes down to about mid thigh on me and I'm 5'3. I also love how wide the sides are. I'm a thick person and it wraps around me perfectly. The only complaint I have about the way it fits is that my boobs are not covered on the sides. It's wearable but it really wasn't what i had expected. If the material were different I think i would love this 100% and not just 60%
3.0,"Handle not real leather. Stitching came apart within a couple of months, if that long."
3.0,"I wish I new the seam for the skirt ran right down the front. I felt it looked really awkward, and it doesn’t show up in the picture. Definitely out of place."
3.0,"These are quite tiny, Celtic knot pattern is difficult to recognize"
3.0,"The outfit indeed is super cute. We loved it. It runs smaller than expected, especially the pants were too short. Yet the larger size I assume would be too big for my son either. The sizes are not accurate.<br />Also the bow tie was poorly made. I would suggest buy your own. At the end it is an outfit, not practical enough for everyday wear for sure.<br />just adding the suspenders are not included. I bought them separately"
3.0,"buy one size bigger, it runs small."
3.0,"I love the guitar strap overall, it's a very beautiful looking, retro strap. ""HOWEVER"", it is advertised as having an extra guitar strap, aside from the string, as ""REAL LEATHER"" & is far from leather! ""IT IS ""PLEATHER!!!!!!!"" I bought this bcuz it says the extra one was leather. ""THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING"" & I'm putting up on notice that this should not be the way you do business! You can lose a lot of customers for this!"
3.0,"Pro for this suit is that it is pretty fabric and I really like the way the fabric looks. Cons are that it comes with these pads in the top that are so thick and rigid almost like shoulder pads. If you don't fit into the pad exactly then it looks very weird. I took them out and put some different ones in. Another con is that the top is a little loose, not much support even with the shoulder pad things in there. I'm a 38DD and it is kind of loose under my arms. Also not very long in the torso for us tall girls. I'm going to keep it because it was cheap and I think I can make it work with some alterations."
3.0,Happy with the product. Only thing I wish it had was sizes on the package. I have to get a micrometer out to see what size I’m using. Clearly marked sizes on the case would be great.
3.0,This necklace is beautiful!  It was given 3 stars because the crystals tend to flip themselves over because of how it is designed and you really cant add more than 3 (4 tops) crystals on the necklace and it stay somewhat flat.
3.0,"needed black, not torquoise"
3.0,"Outfit was very cute but was huge for a 4t. The shirt was very thin, sleeves were too large by like 5 inches, and the onesie style neck opened and fell off her. I had to use double stick tape to keep the shirt closed and the sleeve rolled kept unrolling. The tutu also went past her knees."
3.0,nice suit but runs small
3.0,These slippers are ok if you spend most of your time sitting.  However when you are up and moving around a lot they are harder to keep on your feet and have no support.  They would be fine for someone who is mostly confined to sitting however.
3.0,"Very pretty, but is not as full or as long as pictured."
3.0,I wear a medium but it wasn’t available so I ordered a large. The large fits more like a normal medium.
3.0,It is a nice skirt but does ride up when you walk which I don't like.  It is pretty and professional though.
3.0,"Great material, but I returned them for a smaller size. I'm almost 160 pregnant and the medium size is too big for me."
3.0,"Was super excited to give this as a gift for someone - however when we opened the packaging, we realized the gold one came with a broken string. If it had come in better condition, I would give this item a 5 star!"
3.0,They were good quality but they are not &#34;really&#34; 2g.  They are a little small but will work.
3.0,Looks good as part of a costume but kind of cheap for anything else.
3.0,No muy lindas
3.0,When I bought these i thought that would actually heat up. My husband has neuropathy from his Cancer treatments and always complaing his feet are cold. These are just like a regular pair of socks nothing like what I thought they would be. I would not buy them again
3.0,"This dress may be cute if you're petite.  The print is printed on top of the fabric and not through, this is important in a minute.  The skirt part of the dress was a bit more flow-y than I had anticipated and not just A-line.  So if you ever worry about a Marilyn moment it would definitely happen in this dress.  If your a little busty, the print stretches out and fades because the print is not through.  Not what I was expecting given all the reviews and photos.  I am returning mine."
3.0,"After I read the reviews, I ordered medium size, and it fits just fine. I normally get small size for those. However, one of them had front strap sewed twisted (see pic).  I have a sewing machine, so it's not a big deal to fix the error, but I wish the strap was a little wider.  Other than that, I like the length and the fabric thickness. It's good enough if you want basic camis."
3.0,"The shirt is long, and with bottom band kinda looks like a very short dress.  It kinda looks fitted in the pics but it’s not.  I like everything else about it, though and so will probably snip off the band.  It’s seamed we’ll enough that it should be fine to do"
3.0,"It's large for me, but to return I have to pay for shipping, no Kohls or lockets retur, be aware of it!"
3.0,The material is very wrinkled. Even after in the dryer it comes out wrinkled and Has to be ironed every time.
3.0,Super duper small
3.0,These were way smaller than I expected them to be ... had to return them.
3.0,It’s starting to show signs of getting disrepair already.. but it’s a lifesaver for my pants n shorts to stay on me all day long.
3.0,"Seems to be a fairly well made belt. It takes a little getting used to how to unbuckle it, but that's the only drawback I've noticed.<br /><br />Update: So I bought two of these belts and the pins holding the buckle together on one, fell out about 6 months after I got it. The other one seems fine so far."
3.0,"Cute hat, but NOT average adult size! It fits my 9 year old daughter perfectly but can only sit on the crown of my head and of course it doesn't stay on!"
3.0,"This product is nice and a great alternative to the oem combi. However as others have mentioned the spring bars were VERY hard to get seated. This will likely be a no go for most skill levels unless you are fairly determined and have multiple spring bar tools, and lots of patience. That being said I like the feel, and it certainly seems to be well attached now (no movement of the end links whatsoever) and functions as it should. I am not sure if I would buy it again due to the difficult footing and installation."
3.0,"It was a bit small, I was hoping for it to be a bit flexible/ comfortable.  It kind of feels like cheap plastic in my opinion.  There was only one mask size which isn't the best.  Its fine for its price ."
3.0,"The Material is a bit on the cheap side dosen’t flow real nice, but color is good, little on the big siz"
3.0,"Found it frustrating that there was nothing about sizing  at all on the site had to order blind, let's see what I get!!"
3.0,"I love the unicorns! So cute! Unfortunately, these caps did not come with buttons. According to the description and photo, there should have been buttons sewn on the caps."
3.0,"The hat is nice, however, it is for someone who has a head the size of a child.  A man could definitely not wear this hat. And the circumference is so small it might give women a headache if they try to wear it."
3.0,"It's pretty big for a one year old,  but it'll do for the day. So very cute for pictures."
3.0,I don’t care for these sweat pants at all the fabric is way to heavy!!
3.0,The picture is very inaccurate. I ordered this for my 9 year old and it didn’t fit at all nor did the brim look like what was advertised. I’m returning unfortunately because it’s way too small and it was misshaped. I gave 3 stars because it is a super cute hat.
3.0,Don’t lay right in my ears but like them anyway
3.0,"It's beautiful one, but I think the size 5 only suit with 3 or 4 year old girls. It is too tight for my daughter. We are the Asian people"
3.0,Dress is very long. Almost to the ground. Color is not as pictured and is a lot lighter than pictured. My sister said that I looked like I was wearing a potato sack. I should’ve gotten a different color.
3.0,not as sturdy as I would have wanted it to be - one wire bent under the forceful wind
3.0,Slips as easy as others.
3.0,My daughter was so excited when i ordered these pants but was very disappointed when they arrived. They are very baggy in the leg and ankle areas. The waist fits true to size. Also i liked that where they are distressed there is material inside the pants so her legs wont show. If they were a bit smaller they would have been perfect
3.0,Love the stones but not the fishing wire that is used.
3.0,"Love how big they are, unfortunately came with some scratches on the lens."
3.0,Just order a size larger than you wear.
3.0,i ordered this bag a month ago and for my vacation trip to Maui last week. Packing to come back home it ripped :( very disappointed when I seen this because I was really excited about the bag.
3.0,"Very cute but thinner than expected, I don't feel comfortable wearing them yet"
3.0,"A bit flimsier than I expected and most things look like rainbows, but I wear them most everyday and they get the job done."
3.0,"This is a well made beautiful color shirt. However, be aware that it is very SLIM FIT! My 6'1&#34; 14 year old son is 135 pounds all wet, he is very slim. This shirt was too tight on him when purchased in the size that normally fits him well. The sleeves were also about an 1&#34; too short (as in an 1&#34; above his wrist bone). Fortunately it was easy to return but a bummer because he really liked it before he tried it on. I would say order your next size up, maybe even two sizes up."
3.0,size of a large
3.0,Very hard shoe and narrow
3.0,"fingers crossed that he will actually wear this costume for more than 10 mins. the face mask piece has a really oversized headband for a toddler but I'll just clip it and adjust it. Also, it's fuzzy on the nose which isn't so comfortable."
3.0,"The earrings are a BRIGHT RUBY color, not garnet. I was disappointed with the packaging and the color. The packaging was a small jewelry ziplock stuffed into a shipping envelope. Great price though! Lol"
3.0,"I like the strap, it's soft looks great. My only complaint is it is difficult to clean. I won't be getting this color again."
3.0,They were OK but did not last<br />Was not strong enough
3.0,I really like the charm buts its a tad smaller then it appears in the picture but it fits my Pandora charm bangle just fine and it was a great price.
3.0,Neon Orange otherwise nice enough.
3.0,All I can say is my 44 DD ain't fitting but made good so i give 3 stars and you get extra straps clear and the beige plus snap add on to make wider
3.0,Difficult to keep on.  It fell off and I lost it after 2 days :(
3.0,The quality is great. The zipper is sturdy. One of very few rompers/jumpsuits that have fit my torso/butt correctly (I’m 5’6 and would say I have an average length torso but large backside) the stomach area is a little baggy though and the tie is way smaller than the picture appear in length and width. Also the tie starts right and the sides and doesn’t allow you to tighten much to help elevate the extra material in the stomach area.
3.0,"The hat is ok. When it came, the brim was very bent which I had to work on to get it sit on my head properly. My main issue is that I order gray, but got black."
3.0,Fits way too loosely
3.0,I got this dress for my little sister. I am over all excited about it for her. The packing was great- they even turned the dress inside out so it wouldn't snag the gems.. However I am pretty concerned about the part that goes around the neck.. it is the sheer mesh fabric and they put one small hook. If you are a large necked person I would be concerned it might not fit proper. When I purchased I imagined it would be a tie around the neck. SO just something to take into consideration when purchasing. other than that it is a super classy dress!
3.0,"I bought a set of mediums before and they were perfect. I loved them a lot, so recently I bought another set of 3s in the size medium. Unfortunately ONE of the 3 bras that came this time is a smaller size. I can’t fit in it. Very disappointing."
3.0,"I thought it was cotton and some t-shirts are cotton other arre not cotton.  I can only use cotton. I gave 4 comfort in the review, but it because it not cotton and I have to give it away."
3.0,I purchased large size.<br />It sustained couple of washes.<br />But slowly started shrinking and now it became square shaped.
3.0,Larger than what expected got a medium and fit as an xl<br />comes big!
3.0,"I got this for myself, loved the earrings but I didn’t realize that they come in one of every color,not in pairs of the same ones. Now I have to buy another."
3.0,"I didnt read the other reviews and I bought a size smaller so the shirt can be a ""little"" tight but since these shirts are already tight, that didnt work out lol. So I learned to read the reviews and that this shirt is already a size down so I should have just ordered my normal size for a slightly tight fit."
3.0,It is not that formal
3.0,An affordable option of a very stylish and sexy legging. Perfect with a blazer or a sexy blouse
3.0,material is great but size too small
3.0,"Had a long search, finally found what I wanted, or so I thought.  1.There is no inside zipper pocket, for my change. 2. No place for pen.(elastic for holding pen in place).  The only things that matched the last Incredible Bulk Wallet I purchased a while back , were the photo slots and the check book.<br />  Thus  three stars instead of four or five.<br />  I loved the last MIBW I purchased IRL which is why it wore out.  I kept it too long. Too bad, I guess I'll just have to keep searching.<br /> Disappointed Buyer"
3.0,"Love the look, but a bit smaller than the size chart indicated."
3.0,For the price it was sub par. The clasp was a cheap hook that keep falling off. I will redo the clasp and restring it myself.
3.0,"shirt seems ok, design is as is in the picture. When buying I looked at reviews and went instead with actual body measurements and it was way too big...hopefully I will find someone it fits and it will be a nice gift."
3.0,Xxl demasiado grande<br />Tela un poco dura
3.0,product was just OK --  Shipping was good
3.0,"I purchased this bra in a 36D. It was a bit too narrow across the front bust, as you can see from the stock photo. Even on the model there is side spillage and I have the same problem - it's not enough to prevent me from wearing the bra. What is a bit disconcerting about the bra is that the narrowness across the front bust causes a cone shaped profile, which doesn't look very good (unless you're into the Madonna cones look)! The bra gives good lift and support despite its shortcomings on the fit and silhouette. I would not purchase this bra again or recommend it. It's just okay and I will wear it since I've already washed it cannot return. I can really only see this fitting someone who is very narrow across the back decent."
3.0,It came with 2 chains for a necklace and not a keychain 🙁… I just put it on a ring and added it to my keys anyways
3.0,"It is exactly as advertised, I just realized I don't like it as much in person."
3.0,I like that it was somewhat like the description. What I like least is that it was a little too big for my daughter.
3.0,SOME WERE CUTE SOME WERE NOT
3.0,They are not as long as they look on the picture and material not as thick.
3.0,Very waxy and stiff. Very cute. It will be fun to wear once I can get the wax off.
3.0,Runs small and arrived with a stain on it. The color and fabric is really nice.
3.0,"Too long. I'm 5'3"" and it fell below my knees and it felt matronly. Waa cute w a belt but still too long. Also, the armpit openings were HUGE."
3.0,"I like this belt - it does stay flat and undetectable, but, because it's only an inch thick, it rides high. I feel like it would be better if it were 2&#34; thick. I still find myself hiking my jeans up."
3.0,It was a gift But the person said that theywould not have payed as much as I did for it..they said it was nice but not super good quality...I'm bummed I'm spent so much
3.0,"Got these earrings - pretty. Gave them back, though: two stones missing... right out of the box! Hope you have better luck"
3.0,CUTE BUT NOT GREAT FOR SOMEONE BROAD AND BUSTY
3.0,after a few washes already losing its compression
3.0,Good for what i paid... when I did a squat one of those got tear apart the first day.. of course I get it it's for sleeping..
3.0,"The cut is a bit sloppy, but I like how it fits and the fabric."
3.0,Quality is mediocre but they're not bad earrings.
3.0,"Pros: Dress was well made for the price, seemed sturdy and nice material.  Cons:  Didn't fit long torso.  Waist too high, sleeves not cut in a flattering way.  Bottom line: you probably won't know if it fits you unless you try it on.  It runs slightly large."
3.0,"Smaller than I spected, I am a 6’7 245 Lb. Sleeves are shorter than I thought. I wish they had a 2XL"
3.0,I gave 3 stars for the unknown the 90 day return guarantee is why I purchased. Very shiny and cute. Hopefully my ankle does not turn green ugh.
3.0,Its beautiful. But it's much longer than it looks in the picture.
3.0,"The material is great, but the size of the sleeve openings is large enough for a double pair of gloves and an extra set of arms."
3.0,"Nice shoes, but the sole does not feel as I think it should (feels a bit too spongy).  It is a personal preference and may not be experienced by anyone else."
3.0,"This is not sized to American standards. Only order if you're a size 8 and under. There's very little stretch and I couldn't even get my arms in. I'm a size 12.  Ordered a L. Not saying anything against the quality, just the sizing. Very pretty tho."
3.0,"Well, the chain arrived broken - although I was going to replace it anyway, as I couldn’t adjust the length on it & it looked cheap next to the pretty dandelion pendant.<br />So, I will take the pendant off, which is perfect & just what I wanted & put it on a better chain, that can adjust lengths & look better.otherwise, very satisfied with the purchase & would consider buying again"
3.0,"I really like the way these earnings look. Very stylish, but after a while, they are extremely heavy and have to be taken out."
3.0,Stretches out while wearing it.
3.0,"My daughter is obsessed with Cocomelon and was super excited to get these pajamas.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that for the price, they were not the best material. They are some sort of synthetic fabric that is pretty scratchy. They feel very cheap, which is unfortunate as $20/pair is the same price as true 100% organic cotton pajamas.<br /><br />They fit true to size, although I should note that the pants are a bit long. They are also more loose fitting, not snug fitting like pajamas are supposed to be for fire protection purposes."
3.0,Printing was kind of “light” not very dark<br />Other than that it’s cute
3.0,"If you're like me an want a swim skirt to cover your bum and thighs, you might be a bit plump in the rump.  The skirt on this was perfect, I'm 5'2&#34; and the skirt hit me at mid thigh.  I did find the brief underneath to be too snug in the leg openings. Almost perfect, but not quite.  The search continues."
3.0,Very nice product but needs a larger loop in order to put on any chain other than the cord included.
3.0,I haven't tried it on because the holes in the sleeves looked super large and awkward.
3.0,Looks like it should and light up is cool. Just super small. Going to my youngest child when she's big enough to fit in them
3.0,loved the quality of this but it’s super tiny. my septum is pierced pretty high up so I couldn’t clasp it :(<br /><br />placed it next to a 16g 10mm (I think) septum ring
3.0,"No real compression.  Cute tank, though."
3.0,"I really wish I'd just gotten more Baggu bags.  These are a good size and seem well made, but they DO NOT fold up easily into their little pouches."
3.0,Back rides up on your behind.
3.0,"My fault, I didn't read the dimensions.  They are so so so tiny.  I wish the seller had posted a picture on someone's ear."
3.0,"This dress was too bi and I got an xs. I am 5’0” and 122 lbs. and this hung with no shape whatsoever. The quality overall actually feels good, but the style itself is not flattering for my body type. I will be returning."
3.0,Very comfortable a bit big but beautiful material and design
3.0,I got a better pair at Wal-Mart for 16$ and they light up!
3.0,"Quality could have been better, but not bad."
3.0,Wrong sizing. Quality.
3.0,It's a bit too casual for my job. I bought it for work. It is too fitted and it is like a t-shirt type fabric.
3.0,AFTER ONE WASH THE COLOR DYE WAS HORRIBLE AND SO DID THE SOFTNESS COZY FEEL
3.0,"Necklace is very nice, but the bottom crystals turn to the back as you move which do not have crystals...Needs crystals in BOTH sides!!!"
3.0,"What arrived was of decent quality, but what arrived was not what I had ordered.  Since it does what I need it to, I'm keeping it.<br />The description stated &#34;6 double-sided windows for cards or photos&#34;.<br />The package stated &#34;10-place&#34;,<br />The actual product only contained 4 double sided windows.<br />When I went to Buxton's website (http://buxton.co/collections/window-books/products/window-book-three-fold-and-two-fold) to confirm which was right, and the product was listed as having 10 place windows (presumably 5 double sided windows) with 3 cards per window.  I don't know where the SNAFU is, but somebody has got to get their QA and marketing under control."
3.0,Just a little too big
3.0,"I will  supposed to wear at my friends birthday,but I can't  it's too large for me"
3.0,Recieved so many compliments on this band but the material is not durable. Lasted me 4 months.
3.0,My daughter got annoyed with the unicorns and stuff on her back. And they kept slipping off the glasses as well. I returned them
3.0,"might be too small, sizes run small,Christmas gift"
3.0,They are not long and don't go much past the ear lobe.
3.0,"these look great, but after just one hour of wear, my fingers are all greenish black."
3.0,I'm a size 8 and to me felt tight and still tight after wearing socks for a few hours. I don't think the socks are anywhere true to your actual foot sizel
3.0,Threads are already unraveling from stitching - have had for a few months.
3.0,"We have had these flip flops for almost a year and they are pretty much done. They’re really pretty and comfortable which is why they got so much use, but if you’re looking for longer wear flip flops, look elsewhere."
3.0,"There is nothing special that I can see about these socks.  Just a pair of socks.<br />I machine washed them and they laundered well.  Socks have a tendency to cut off the circulation at my ankles, these did not do that.  They stay in place and don't slip down into your shoe.  That's a good thing.<br />They don't cause my feet to sweat at all.  That's another good thing.<br />However, they are still just a pair of beige socks."
3.0,After wearing these earrings all day at work I can’t wait to take them off at the end of the day because they do feel a little bit more weighty than I thought they would be based on the description
3.0,This dress is for someone who really doesn’t have a lot of hips or that the pockets address hit your hips in the right spot.
3.0,"This dress fits extremely snugly. After reading the reviews, I got it one size up from my usual, and I probably should've gotten two sizes up. The top just barely fits (I'm a D cup), the zipper is a little stubborn, and the dress is difficult to take off. I feel like, after a wash or two, it will be unwearable. It's a cute dress, but I think it is cut for someone with a slim build (just my opinion). I'd give it two and a half stars if it were possible."
3.0,"Colors not quite what I expected. Color is off in the photo,it is definitely lighter and the print is all one color.  Also takes a lot longer to arrive than predicted, expect it to take about a month since itis coming from China.  Shirt definitely feels decent quality construction, on a positive note"
3.0,"Has not changed yet and I have showered in it, had it over a month now and still good to go."
3.0,"Super cute and the backing feels secure, but the color used for the ""Rose gold"" part is extremely cheap. I had it on my light-colored jean jacket for 15 minutes and it left a rose-gold colored stain. I'm nervous to put it back on, but might try painting the back to keep the color from rubbing off on my clothes."
3.0,"Very pretty, but didn't hold up for my first one week trip to Europe."
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful, but the cut of the bustline is off and the fabric is super stiff. They also didn't pre-wash the fabric so even on a cold wash the white lace was stained to a light turquoise."
3.0,Rubber can hurt the back of my heel. What i was looking for tho. Super thin for my slip on converse.
3.0,The hat is good quality but the embroidery interferes with the  inner hat band and rubs against you head. I'll keep it and just wear it loose in lower wind conditions.
3.0,Love the cork and style but very uncomfortable on top of foot. Corks are my very favorite as they go with everything. For the price they could have been made much better in my opinion.
3.0,"I really was excited to get this dress, and it came and it fit very well, other than it was WAY too short. If I lifted my arms all the way up, the length was more comparable to a shirt. I sent it back. (I am 5'6)"
3.0,I ended up giving it to my niece. The chest fit small on me and I am not large in that area! It was pretty and she love sit!
3.0,Cool looking watch. Glass cover cracked out of nowehere.
3.0,These are okay.  They are thin but still comfortable.  I like the print.
3.0,"The outfit is so cute, but I ordered the 12 month size and it runs so small. The onesie runs about 1 inch shorter then a 12 month Carter’s onesie. Seems more like a 9 month size. My daughter doesn’t wear anything that is size 18 months. This is the very first 12 month outfit that hasn’t fit."
3.0,"I really like that it is soft, and nice on the skin. It’s a little shorter than I expected but it still fits perfectly lengthwise. It is a little tighter than I would expect for my normal size (runs smaller), so I would suggest sizing up.<br /><br />It’s cute and has a great color otherwise. When it goes on sale, is the best time to buy it lol"
3.0,They're tight but I guess that's for a reason. It is not soundproof but it does mute the sounds to an acceptable level for a baby. I let my son wear his at the races and they are great for him. But sometimes I feel bad about how tight they are.
3.0,Wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,Mom shorts..
3.0,"Sleeves were stretched out and gaping. Dress is VERY thin and rides up a bit. Had no tags, I returned it."
3.0,So tiny and tight. Sizing doesn’t seem correct.
3.0,Uncomfortable<br />And not conducting for me to walk long distances. Feels too flat footed. Miss<br />My nikes!
3.0,I bought these on impulse one day for some reason.  They looked okay for a few wears but then one day the earring and the pin part just snapped randomly.  Haven't used since.
3.0,The lid of the battery case would keep coming off. My boy would love to keep the mask on but he had to take it off because it keeps turning off because of that.
3.0,"Super pretty, I washed in the washer and the elastic twisted up"
3.0,"Seem to be decent quality, I wish they'd get the fit right. I am 37 x 30 and they are much too wide."
3.0,"I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large but this fits like a much smaller size or fitted base layer. I’m keeping it, but recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,The bras fit me well however I wasn’t expecting the packaging to be taped up and torn as if someone else wore them already?
3.0,This is a very tight 3x and the waistband keeps rolling down every time I move. I do love that it has HUGE pockets on both sides that go nearly the full length of the leg with a small grommet on the corner to let out water. The material is super stretchy and when I first took it out of the package it looked to small to even fit at all. The material is soft. I personally wish it was a tag bit longer in the legs for thigh rub but its not terrible. Theses shorts have a built in bikini bottom. Overall not terrible but would not be my go to choice for swim bottoms.
3.0,"The choker was super loose on me and looked like a dog collar. I have a small neck but it wasn't wearable for me. Velvet was nice though, seams are pretty noticeable."
3.0,"I love these belts because they look great with many of my outfits.  However, I was a little disappointed when my silver belt had a feather fall off on one end after only wearing it five times.  I have had to re-glue the silver belt a couple of times now."
3.0,"The shirt seems to be good quality, but the sizing is even worse than anticipated.  I ordered an XXXL for my husband who usually wears an XXL.  The shirt is now my  17 year old daughters.  She likes it, but the sizing is WAY off.  Not just small in width but very short as well."
3.0,"Cheap, like the price. They lasted a few weeks. You get what you pay for I suppose. I just spent a little more on better quality a few days ago."
3.0,"Cute shoes and my daughter said they were comfortable, however, they only lasted 4 months of daily wear at school. The sole started detaching from one of the shoes. For the price, it wasnt too painful to order another pair. The comparable school shoes sell for $40."
3.0,Not really flattering. Doesn't look sexy like the pic. Poor material also
3.0,Looks longer than it is.
3.0,Size 13-14 means size 13. No way my size 14 feet will fit.
3.0,This is a very pretty necklace.  It is a bit too long.  I had to remove some links.  But I do like it and am happy with it.
3.0,Love the design but it does slip. I wish Sweaty Bands would get on the the adjustable slider wagon like some of these other brands have done its crucial to be able to adjust it to your head size. Check out some of these styles on Amazon that have the option to adjust the elastic..
3.0,this robe is good value for money but it is made for short people! I am 5'7 and the belt loops sitting way above my waist.
3.0,Runs small so they fit tight if you have a round shaped face
3.0,"First impression was that the zippers are rough to get open, then I realized the main holder is narrower than expected but worst issue is that once I put it on to see how it looked I realized the hardware makes a lot of dangling noise with movement."
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful, my only problem is that the leather is not black! I bought some black and gold earrings to go with it, and now I won't be able to use it. Other than that, it is great!"
3.0,Loved the bracelet but fell apart rather quickly. I intend to contact the maker so I won't condemn the product. I received plenty of compliments though. I'll reserve judgement until see how they resolve this issue
3.0,"It looks exactly as it's shown. Very pretty & fit perfectly. The first issue it is printed in white, it's difficult to see against the rose. It would be much better printed in black. The bracelets are meant to be worn for health precautions. It also broke after only a year. I was upset."
3.0,"Got as a gift for our friend. I’m hoping the cotton is softer after washing, because it is so stiff now. Almost feels like canvas."
3.0,Has hard under wires I am small chested did not look good<br />Quality of suit was great
3.0,Good for only a few wears
3.0,it was made well and cute  but I did return it  due to it being to small for me.
3.0,"The color was great. However, the metal band drained my battery faster. I believe it eventually caused my fitbit to stop working well."
3.0,very cute but I'm shorter than most and the belt line is in an awkward spot on my hips and not my waist.  But I'll still wear it :)
3.0,"Was bigger then planned. Also the trench coat I received had a dirt spot looking discolorization. Material felt like that of a rain coat and I was looking for something with a higher grade of material. Lastly, to me the coat I got didn't resemble that of the picture."
3.0,"These are really cool sunglasses. I am happy with my purchase. I would give more stars but my lenses, though in a protective paper, had fingerprints and little scratches all over them when I pull them out of the package. I will be contacting the seller about the scratches because I really really like the look of these."
3.0,These are great for my sensitive eyes but I was sent the wrong color. I ordered the ones light inner color and got the solid ones 🤦🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️
3.0,"These are going to be great for around the house. However, the waist is way to slippery and rolls down with any real movement. I won’t buy anymore even though they are cute."
3.0,The glasses are tiny. Like baby sizes. Don't fit adult heads<br />Purple & red came broken. Very cheap quality. Half (All mirrored) are so dark you can't see through them.<br />Looks like a great deal?<br />Nope. You get what you pay for here. Messaged them & they wanted further info....It wasn't worth my time to jump through hoops so I just threw most away &gave the rest away at shows to small kid fans. NOT FOR ADULT SIZED HEADS. WILL BREAK EASILY AND CANNOT SEE THROUGH MOST OF THEM.
3.0,"Runs small, sleeves are really tight, but omg is this gorgeous"
3.0,Lightweight but way too big for my face. I wish they made these in men's and women's sizes instead of unisex
3.0,"Hat is a cute design but the bill portion of the hat is unusually wide and long, more than any hat I’ve ever bought. I am returning for that reason."
3.0,"These shorts are very soft and comfortable. However, they were too short for my liking. The material shows every dimple and imperfection in your skin. They were not flattering on me. Maybe to sit around the house or for pajamas but I wouldn’t wear them out of the house. I wanted to like them but I returned them."
3.0,"Slippers were comfy for the first few weeks and then the padding squished flat to be almost imperceptible. Which would not be so bad if the plastic sole wasn't so hard and unyielding. Fast forward 6 months and holes appeared under the ball of the foot portion of the sole, which felt perpetually like a nail was sticking into my foot. Would not buy again."
3.0,"Worked fine but sizes did not match up, would've done the job I got it for but the clear mismatch makes me hesitant to buy a second pair."
3.0,I bought this tie for my husband. It doesn’t look the same color as it showed on the picture. Colors are washed out and not bright. It looks like it’s been used for a while.
3.0,Wasn't comfortable for my feet.
3.0,Runs about 2 sizes too small and fabric is itchy. Otherwise it's great.
3.0,"This dress is actually better quality than I expected, It is well constructed and fitting, I ordered mine in navy blue and the color is very true to the picture, I have only a couple of problems with it.<br />One is that it actually runs a little bit large, I ordered the small and it is a little bit loose, and it is also very long, I am 5' 3&#34; and even with high high heels it goes all the way to the floor.<br />The other problem I encountered while wearing this dress is that the necklace that forma the neck of the dress is made of tiny &#34;chains&#34; held together, I have long hair and when I'm wearing it, my hair gets caught in between the chains and it pulls it off, so it is very uncomfortable. The solution is to wear it only with my hair up.<br />The fit other than being a little on the big side, is flattering and it looks elegant without being pretentious.<br />I received a discount on this dress in order to try it and share my opinion about it, this review reflects precisely that and I hope you find it useful"
3.0,"If you were buying more than a could of these as I did, the cost per item wouldn't seem so high.  Still it was a fun and unexpected gift for a newly graduated nurse who happens to be male.  Finding nurse gifts that aren't feminine or girly isn't easy.  Overall,  I'd recommend and would buy again."
3.0,This product looks good but it broke after 2 wears. My daughter really liked the look but it was made poorly & cheaply.
3.0,"Firstly, I don't know if its because I prefer my clothing more baggy but I  feel as though these are a smidge tighter then I would prefer. I went off the reviews and the size chart and ordered a Small. I'm a size 4, 5'5"", and 125 pounds.<br /><br />Secondly, as much as I really want to love these... every single pair seems to sit oddly at the butt/crotch for me. It keeps wanting to ride to the left, uncentered. Which I do not understand why this is occurring. I've never experienced this with other pairs of leggings I've owned, just these for some reason. They are good enough for exercising at home but I won't be wearing these outside of my house."
3.0,The clasp broke the first night after I gave it as a gift to a policeman
3.0,"This only works if you have a VERY large wrist.  Size can be adjusted but at the expense of the buckles/the hook coming around and almost touching the watch case, creating so much clutter on the wrist!"
3.0,I wore this as a maternity skirt and pulled it up over the bump and it hit mid calf. The pockets made me look very wide so I cut them out and sewed the holes shut. Feels kinda cheap but worked for a wedding outfit when nothing else looked good at 8 months pregnant!
3.0,"Nice lightweight material without being cheap feeling.  Generally the design is nice, except the waist.  The sewn in waist band is high.  If you are long waisted , it would be way above your waist.  I am a medium which is what I ordered.  The waistband is about at the last rib in the front.  When you tie the attached belt there is an improvement. OK as a house dress for me.  I'm 5'4&#34; and it's bit bit long.  I just knotted the corners of the bottom hem...that works."
3.0,Ok the style and function of the bra is great. But the foam cups do not hold anything and with larger breast the bra strap is placed to high(forward) within the cup giving that cone look spill over shape that defeats the purpose of the bra.
3.0,It is definitely not as long as the model is showing. It is a basic Tank. I ordered a medium which is my normal size and it was cut high and tight in the arm pits.
3.0,Little thin for me but will do.
3.0,"First of all, my daughter loves this costume.  She is a bit tall for her age (5years) and I wanted to make sure there was room to grow so I got the 7-8. The body suit fits as expected with room for her to grow but the mask is very tight. It fits for now but it is pretty tight. It seems like the sizes don't match up. I am disappointed since I am sure she'll want to wear this outfit again and again."
3.0,bought my regular size fits very loose the back is useless I have bought several of these type of mules and most with the small back of the foot is useless it is week and just gets flattened out . much better buying a slip on clog.
3.0,"I’m a size 6 and the skirt hugs in all the wrong places. If you are 100% toned, it will look like the pictures. The medium was not flattering and is being returned. Fabric is polyester-type."
3.0,Material is super thin. Wore only once.
3.0,"I needed a white floppy hat as an accessory for my Halloween costume. I was concerned about the color because the description says white, but it looked off white... it’s not white, definitely off white. I don’t know that I will have any use for it after halloween, but it is a cute hat. Just disappointing that it isn’t white as described. Also, the fit is on the small size."
3.0,Not the fabric I expected. Runs small too.
3.0,good for the most part
3.0,Loved the finish and style but pendant fell off within 24 hours of opening
3.0,"Very nice looking carry on bag. My husband uses it often. But, it arrived with a broken zipper pull on one side. It still functions, but I was sad to give him a damaged item for Christmas. I should have returned it for a replacement, but my husband is only home a few days a month and I wanted him to be able to use it. My loss"
3.0,The plastics really Flimsy. Don’t really feel like it would protect the eyes if something hit them hard.
3.0,"Not a huge fan, but I prefir more of the Aviator style.  They are decent quality though.  Buy price would be a deciding factor... i usually am happy with 10-15 dollar glasses... these are about the same in my opinion."
3.0,I bought this specifically because of the larger size and purple accents.  The charm is tiny and looks to be about half the size of others I have.  If there is purple on it I can't see it.  It's cute just not what I expected.
3.0,The style is cute but after couple of months the design got separated from the band! Like the glue wear off! What a bummer! But they sent me a replacement which was really nice!
3.0,"in picture looks great. but in reality, does not looks thats good. very slipshod metal and plastic made frame. not happy with this."
3.0,nice BUT POST IS TOO LONG! WITH THE BACK TIGHTENED IN PLACE THE EARINGS HANG OUT INSTEAD OF SITTING AT THE SURFACE OF MY EAR LOBE.  THESE ARE MADE FOR PEOPLE WITH FAT EARLOBES
3.0,"Overall I really liked this watch, big face- easy to read time no matter environment. Unfortunately the band snapped in under 2 months. I repaired it and then it snapped on the other side. Really bummed about it."
3.0,The product looked different in person.
3.0,"I ordered the orange and blue set and what I received was blue hat, blue scarf, and HOT PINK gloves. Makes me wonder if they have proper lighting in the warehouse or factory."
3.0,Lighter tint than my original and the lenses seemed foggy even after I cleaned them with Oakley Glass Cleaner.
3.0,"Initial impression here. Fit is smaller than I expected. Thin material, hopefully they breathe. Seems well made."
3.0,A little hard to work with because it's so sticky. It sucks to my hands and my tools that I'm trying to use so it makes doing my costume makeup and effects MUCH more difficult. It's still usable but I prefer the wax that doesn't stick to everything and is easily suck to my skin with latex or gum.
3.0,"Fit a little tight in the bust, but too big around the middle. Keeping it because I like the print so much."
3.0,"I've bought these in the past because they are a simple classy style. Unfortunately, the last batch had inconsistent sewing/material color and dot placement. I tended to buy the same brand so that if one stocking had a run I could use another one from a new package. However, due to the irregularity it doesn't match. I like the the elastic (not too tight, not too loose). Also, as all thin stockings they are not sturdy."
3.0,It's not as good as other caps I've ordered. Small cap.
3.0,If you wear glasses it will need to be pushed up to eyes or glass will fog. This is a negative because no pinch bar for the nose area to help stop that from being an issue like a throw away disposable mask would have.
3.0,"Not pleased , very boxy for me and unnatractive on my body"
3.0,"Covers fine, but not slouchy"
3.0,The earrings are nice..but one of them was bent a little bit on the back part
3.0,The inside lining is not as long as the outside layer and that is too sheer.
3.0,Not loose fitting - small for size. Cute but will send back
3.0,Pretty dress. I wasn’t a fan of the sparkle but the fit of the body was good! The sleeves unfortunately missed the mark. They are on the bigger side. I’m petite 5ft 1 and they were baggy
3.0,"The buttons unfortunately don’t stay closed. I bought these for myself and my bridesmaids, were all different shapes and sizes and they didn’t stay closed on any of us. They were comfy though! For the morning of."
3.0,I thought this shirt was going to be nice but I didn't realize it was so short. It is definitely a crop top. I would suggest wearing it with very high rise pants.
3.0,Difficult to put on due to band
3.0,"I wish the description had indicated how small these are. Cute sunglasses, but way too small for my 6-year-old.  I had to return them. These are toddler-size, perfect for a child 2-4 years old."
3.0,"Love this hat, nice color and warm. It's a perfect match with the Sorel Joan Gloves black/bisque. It fits perfectly my small head but sincerely It runs very small and is expensive to be a normal wool beanie."
3.0,it was a little cheap looking.  I was expecting simple elegance.
3.0,Non stick soles
3.0,It came...finally. and it came dirty. not like completely dirty but it wasnt fully clean either. i'm putting it in something so hopefully that will help. i'm thank God that I used an amazon gift card on it
3.0,My stepmom who was diagnosed with cancer said she would not wear it
3.0,"Cute,  but just like the others stated,  not as pictured. Only had 3 of the pairs pictured. :/"
3.0,"A beautifully designed cap, but the construction was disappointing.  The brim is sturdy and the cover section is good, but the button on the top came off within a few weeks - very disappointing.  For the price, I expected a lot more."
3.0,"Pretty sweater.  I'm 5'9 and 147lb. Normally a size 8/10. I ordered this in a 12 and while I can get it on, it's skin tight (and thus confining and uncomfortable). Sweater is WAY more fitted than it appears in photo.  Won't order from this seller again."
3.0,"The back of the stone was not on secure, so I added some crazy glue to it and Straightened it out"
3.0,Good quality materials but sizes run small
3.0,Very nice pajamas but due to the material didn't fit.  Another set of a different material in the same size did though.
3.0,Works well and fashionable color.  Don't know about UV protection.
3.0,"This sweater is not as thick as the description or photo would suggest. Also the color is much brighter than it appears here. This also runs small, I would order a size, or TWO up."
3.0,Nice value for your money! After first wash feel a little loose.
3.0,A bit heavy and easily scratched
3.0,Neck is really high. Feels like no space around the neck.
3.0,"The dress arrived within 2 days however there was a decent sized hole at the zipper and it is very difficult to zip up. I needed the it for a wedding that weekend so I had no time to order another and opted to repair it. I also ordered a Grace Karin petticoat to wear under the dress which made it look beautiful. The sleeves fit perfectly and weren't too tight at all. Other than the sticky zipper, I loved wearing this dress."
3.0,Looks pretty and I shower with it and it does not tarnish or rust.  Not sure of the medicinal qualities though.
3.0,"Pretty, but stone was smaller and chain was shorter than expected."
3.0,"Boots are nice ,only lasted about 5 months but I do have a tough job also some sole inserts made them a lot more comfortable."
3.0,Product was not up to par with your typical FRYE product. Color was lighter than expected.
3.0,Omg! this was hideous on me! I returned it right away. I loved the print but just did not work on my body. I felt like a cow with a tent on!
3.0,My favorite beads but after a month or so about 3 beads cracked off.
3.0,"""Fancy"" is an overstatement for this Handkerchiefs.they are just ok.The fabric is rather stiff and rough.Hopefully this will change after they have been washed several times.<br />Will not buy again.<br />They are value priced."
3.0,"I love the beads, but the elastic is so flimsy, the bracelet droops and is uncomfortable for me.  Beautiful packaging."
3.0,I feel like a business card must hold more than 10. Very pretty. I would have given 5 stars it was a regular cardholder but the description described as business cardholder little bit disappointed.
3.0,Just your average disposable mask. The print is very light. I bought the Halloween print to give out as part of our Halloween treats this year after I individually wrap each one.
3.0,"I bought the medium and it fits like an extra small ... I returned it ... Not re-ordering a larger size ... I think it's just too inaccurate of sizing .... (I'm 5'3 - 130 lbs - 34D) ...<br />I rated in the Middle because it feels nice and the 'concept look' is beautiful ... the fabric is soft enough (not stiff) ... the liner is separate (so, you could wear the sheer part over shorts and a tank to look cute) ... Just be cautious about the sizing ... I actually found a better alternative with better size reviews and costs less ..."
3.0,"The sleeves are a completely different fabric.  Not what I expected, however, I do love it!!"
3.0,"Holds 10 bills , no problem. holds 8 cards. Hard to get them out tho. would be great if it held more......"
3.0,Beautiful but fell apart using it as a key chain the first week!
3.0,"Love the festive print and is sewn without a problem, however I was disappointed that the pattern isn’t sewn as an angle like shown in the picture. The stripes are horizontal and vertical which simply isn’t particularly flattering."
3.0,I didn't get 3 pieces . The head tie wasn't in my order.
3.0,"I have a thin neck, so this more so just rested on my collarbone (there’s no way to make it shorter or longer). It’s nice besides that."
3.0,"Was not described or pictured as a crop top, but it is. Shirt itself looks like decent quality.  Order normal size."
3.0,Did not new they were short...but mainly sizes run very small<br />I will like to change it as well as the FOURSEEDS cargo short
3.0,Unflattering on me<br />Too big and too basic looking<br />Definitely could have sized down
3.0,Super small!! I really wish this was true to size. It even comes with a tag saying that shrinkage was accounted for. My son is 1 month old 10lb 14oz and 22.25inches and this would not have fit him when he was born. I ordered the 0-3 month safari animal one and it would probably fit a premie after I washed it. I’m sad that I can’t return it for a larger size as I’ve already washed it. That being said. The quality is great! And I love the print! Just not sized right.
3.0,"Something very, very average. It'll stay shiny long enough to last a few wears."
3.0,"I’ve had this watch band for almost a year now. I wear my Apple Watch daily to track my activities. This bad was easy to put together and the protective touch screen is top notch. The reason for my average review is because the plastic opening for the bottom of the watch started to separate within a few months of owning it. Also one of the two clips (for lack of a better term) to hold the excess band broke off pretty quick. Yesterday the other clip broke off. Overall it’s decent, but if you plan on having the same watch band for the life of your watch I’d look elsewhere. I’m looking for a replacement as soon as I finish typing this."
3.0,"I like the outfit. However, the polo shirt color is not what I saw displayed. That however had me a little disappointed. Was also hoping that the pant/shorts would be a little bit longer."
3.0,"This looks like a nice rash guard, I was so excited to get one with built in padding. I chose my size based on the size chart, but was dubious that it would fit since it had me going up several sizes. When it came it was way to big. I would recommend going up one size."
3.0,Fits very very small.  I typically wear a mens medium in bike jerseys so I got a large.  The large is waaaay too small.  Other than that the jersey quality appears to be OK however I wan't really able to wear it.
3.0,Didn't like the color.  Need to purchase 2 sizes bigger!
3.0,The stainless steel is a must but the chain is to short you are measuring the chain with the lobster clips which is wrong
3.0,Nice but slightly tight for the size.
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes bigger in Hope's of a more baggy look and this tank was still to tight. For reference I'm 5'3"" and 175 and normally wear size Large if the shirt is not a fit shirt. Hope this helps for reference"
3.0,"Nice Material, but runs large , and even tho it says machine wash, it suggests lay flat to dry. I am a tumble dry lady."
3.0,I bought this as a gift. Looks like it runs small.
3.0,A little tarnished but overall good for the price.
3.0,It's really pretty but it's too thin so I'd wear it with a thick slip under it and it works.
3.0,This is cute.  Very small so I don't use it that much. I only use this if I know I'll be in a bigger crowd so I can crossbody it and hold it.
3.0,Running much smaller than described.
3.0,Returned because of sizing.  The top was to boxy and the shorts were to short.  Disappointed because the<br /> fabric and color looked nice.
3.0,"A cute shirt; however, the sleeves are incredibly long and flare out so much that it felt like I was flapping them around.  They would have bothered me too much, so I had to return this one."
3.0,"I am giving this blouse 3 starts just because it fits me perfect on my shoulders but it is very very loose on my waist and hips (I'm 5'6, 127lb). I am aware that a blouse should not be tight, but this is too much! My shoulders will never fit in a XS. So sad, the color rocks!!!"
3.0,"It fits perfectly and the tools with it are a life saver, but the quality of the strap is not so good and may harm your wrist a little, haven't tried it in water yet but ill update when i do"
3.0,"The locking mechanism barely works on one, haven't been able to close the other. Not sure if I can use these earrings as planned."
3.0,I would to call this a poncho.  Thin material.
3.0,"Really cute looking shoes. My son loved them. However, the fabric is already starting to wear after only a month of having them. They don't have great support either."
3.0,"These are definitely the best auxiliary lenses I have used, with probably close to a dozen bought over the years. Why they go to the trouble of making superior optics and then couple it with with a stupid clamp-on defies logic. Wouldn't you think that the optics design ( I'm a physicist and studied lens design ) which is quite complex would would compel decent mechanical design? I did. It's a nightmare, compounded by the fact that the slip-on tips which helped but didn't solve the attachment problem slip off even easier making it almost impossible. I will design or possibly re-design the attachment to prevent damage to both the clip-ons and my glasses which the casual buyer can't do."
3.0,"The material is more cheap-looking and thinner than I expected, but since it's flowy enough, decided to keep. HOWEVER, the item arrived absolutely reeking of cigarettes. I took it out of its sealed package and it stunk up my entire house. I tried it on to make sure it fit, then immediately tossed it in the wash and took a shower. That's how bad the cigarette stink was -- it literally stuck to me after just trying the top on for less than a minute."
3.0,"Let me start this off by saying that I'm on the shorter side: 5'3""ish. These are supposed to be capri length, and they hit me at the ankle (maybe even a little below). They are not cut to be 7/8 leggings, so they look very weird. Overall, I would not recommend for shorter girls."
3.0,I thought there where cute but they where to tight. I had a hard time putting them on my son's feet. And he's a Mickey mouse fan.
3.0,Kinda disappointed. I bought this dress for St Patty's day I got the green dress of course. And it is not as brightly green as the picture. Lame.
3.0,"So the product was bigger than I expected and thinner as well but the feel of the fabric is immaculate, almost silky to the touch. I will have to return for a smaller size but it's beautiful all the same."
3.0,priced paid for product was reasonable
3.0,Pajamas received very quickly.  Where presented as pictured with pattern and color.  Size was  at least 2 sizes too small  I have used this size for other companies with no problems in the past
3.0,"We thought they were navy, but they are actually royal blue.  I waited too late to try to return them."
3.0,The dress was of good quality but as some of the other reviews mentioned the top was way too big. Definitely needs alteration if i need to use this. It spoils the drape of the dress and is now banished to the back of my closet.
3.0,product was smaller than I was thinking it would be but it is okay.  For the price it is adequate and I will<br />be using it soon...
3.0,Comfortable shorts and liner. A little on the heavy side. Phone pocket is too stretchy to keep phone from bouncing heavily.
3.0,These ride up too high - the legs should be longer. They stretch out after a few hours of wear and become baggy. Not a high quality product.
3.0,"This watch is not teal. It is a turquoise blue (less green than pictured and more vibrant). The face is gray unless lighted (again the picture is deceiving). My fault for not realizing the top outer circles are both seconds... which is weird. I keep expecting one to be the date. No directions. I can NOT turn off the hourly chime... I'm sure it's possible, I just haven't figured it out after giving it 10 minutes on two different occasions (I have been able to program all my kids watches and my other basic watches without directions previously, so the hour chime is kinda taunting me at this point). It's larger than I expected."
3.0,Not slim
3.0,"It is fine except I must not have looked at the size in ad carefully because it is very large, as in men's watch size, too big for my small wrist but I will use it as a gift."
3.0,"I am 5’5” n 138 lbs. 34 A.  Will return for medium. Length covers butt. Soft material, not see through, color burgundy as expected. Knew what back would look like, with lace strip, but not my style, but will return and buy medium."
3.0,"very small, and the colors r not what they look like in the picture. the red ones look more orange"
3.0,We have several family wearing different style under armour.  They have run true to size but this one was much smaller. We had to exchange for a size up.
3.0,"I've bought two of these in less than two years. I wear them on most work days, so they get a fair amount of wear, but the build on these could stand to be improved. The pegs that hold the headband onto the earphones are just crappy plastic."
3.0,"The earrings are much smaller than I expected, but that may be my fault. I didn’t pay attention if they listed the measurements. But either way you can’t really see the skull design so that kinda sucks."
3.0,Fits sinwobe small and material doesn’t really stretch.  cones in the smaller side in my opinion.
3.0,This is not a cardigan. This is a long sheer scarf/ shaw. It's beautiful but not what I wanted.
3.0,"Love it, it just needs better stitching and for the speakers moved back about a inch. Its VERY comfortable and warm so great for winter and the music is loud enough to hear over most things. Great for for the price."
3.0,"The mask is cute, breatheable and fits perfectly however the nose piece is not durable. It ended up twisting making the mask uncomfortable."
3.0,I normally wear an XL or L and purchased the L.  HUGE.  The camel color is beautiful and the jacket is well done.
3.0,"The top is super cute and fits great, true to size. The bottoms are too small for size so at least I got a cute too out of it"
3.0,causing my ears to get itchy. I can typically wear any type of earring and I've had to take these out constantly
3.0,I have an extremely long torso and am over weight.  I purchased the 2xl (my regular size) I am disappointed they still show stomach when I lift my arms.  Quality seems poor (thin fabric and weak straps).  Overall it is just another tank top that I will still wear.
3.0,Darker blue and dull color
3.0,"A little smaller than I hoped for, but the quality is good."
3.0,"Fabric is thin and soft. I don’t know how opaque they are. Only one single pair, not 2 pack, we’re sent twice so I haven’t been able to wear them. I could pay double or get only one pair."
3.0,Fit was a little snug
3.0,"Size up if you can (maybe even twice). If you normally wear XXL, then you won't be able to fit this. Has the potential to be extremely cute, just too small."
3.0,Nice hat but it's a little thin and small.
3.0,Too small. Was not able to put on as it has no stretch. It was also not a free return. So I’m now returning and losing money. But customer service /company was super nice
3.0,"I just got my dress in the mail  and I am amazed at the quality considering the price. The fabric is a bit stretchy  but solid cotton material and fits in all the right places. My dress ordered was a bit too big so I'm exchanging it for a smaller size and I think I'll love it even more!!<br /><br />I a wear a size 8-9 jeans, 34 dd  I'm 5'3 160lbs, I have a small waist  but a booty and big boobs. wasn't  sure what size to order so went off sizing chart and other people and got a 12 thinking i would need room to fit the girls...wayyy too big in the stomach area, lots of loose fabric.  exchanged for a size 10. Thinking it will fit great. .. will update once new dress is received."
3.0,"Good for a later fall or a early spring, but during a winter it wasn't enough. Usually I buy clothes with a Large size, but this time it was small for me."
3.0,The glasses were scratched when removed from packaging. The lens were fine though. Not very comfortable to wear. Tint is stronger near the top of the lens than the bottom. Does a okay job at reduce light glare and whatnot.
3.0,NOTHING SPECIAL BESIDES THE COLOR
3.0,Comfortable but keeps sliding down.  Maybe a size smaller may have been better.
3.0,"I thought it would fit mid thigh as shown on the model. However, it was close to the knee. My wife is 5'6&#34; and purchased small."
3.0,"I wear an 18/20 and a 2X always fits...if not being a little big.  These were still tighter than I'd prefer (sounds funny to say that about leggings - but hopefully you understand what I mean), granted I do have bigger legs...but they were warm so if anything they'll fit perfect under other pants during our frigid cold midwest winters!"
3.0,"It was too small for me and I wear Medium tops. Gave it to my sister. Over all the fabric is nice, and quality not too bad."
3.0,Color was not pink
3.0,Cute hat-well made however…I believe this is a hat for youth. Way too small for my 18-year-old son’s head.
3.0,The percentage of spandex was not has fitting as I thought it would be. Check product very closely. I found very small pinholes randomly on the product. And not along the line of where stitching would be.
3.0,Magnet is not strong enough to keep it wrapped around my clients neck. It’s kinda disappointing and it just falls off my clients neck.
3.0,"The arms are too tight. The fabric is great, the overall fit is small but I could have worn an XL IF the arms were not so ridiculously tight.  For reference, I am 6' tall and 150lbs, typically size 6 pant and 10-12 top....with seemingly &#34;normal&#34; size arms???"
3.0,I was a bit disappointed in the amount of glare blocked. They are very comfortable and I like the large lenses to protect my eyes from UV rays..
3.0,Got this for my mom to use on a temporary basis b/c she lost her more expensive one. And temporary it was b/c it constantly sticks out from the her nose. Not attractive.
3.0,Very cute.  Runs small.  The smell---overpowering.  Have to store them in a plastic bag because it was stinking up my daughters room.  Would buy many more pairs if it wasn't for the smell.
3.0,Not great quality. Looks pretty cheap.
3.0,Very small but its ok .. I can use it for day trips shopping or give it as a gift
3.0,"I'd say this hat is on par with what you'd find in Wal-Mart or Target.  Not super high quality but decent.  The sweat band inside is a thin ribbon,  the string is like thin paracord, the hot glued &#34;leather&#34; band is anything but.  The pros is it is crush proof.  Evidenced by the fact that I was able to get it resembling a hat again after opening the envelope it was shipped in, wadded in my mailbox.  I have a real straw cowboy hat from Wal-Mart 10+ years ago that I adore but is totally shot,  this isn't quite the replacement I was hoping for.  I don't feel like this really has a cowboy hat shape, more like a Panama hat with a rounder brim. I wish it were a bit bigger, I'm a female usually wear a large in helmets/ hats and it fits snugly. Bottom line is it'll keep the sun off my face while I mow the lawn, so we'll call it a win."
3.0,Cheaply made pendant that was scratched up and made with cheap plastic. Decent chain.
3.0,"These are very comfortable, super stretchy, great pockets but very much to the knee or longer for someone who is 5’6” or shorter.  When they are folded up, they look the same length at a short pair of capris."
3.0,Did received all the colors as in the picture. Did not receive the military blue and light gray but the hats fit great.
3.0,"It's okay, but I was looking for a light beach dress. Instead this has an under lining all the way up. It feels like I'm wearing 2 dresses.  Hmm, it's just okay. Not my favorite to wear."
3.0,Like these pants but after 2 washings the length got shorter even washing in cold and dry on delicate.  So frustrating.  Wish they would sell in a tall length if they are going to shrink.  At least 33 inch.  So sick of short pants.
3.0,"SO went through 2 pairs within a month as they tore and frayed at the toebox area. He is not rough with things (on the contrary, he is usually more careful handling things than I am), so it's not him being overly careless. They are probably fine as disposable guest slippers, but not for reusable/long term use, which was what I was looking for. I cannot imagine them holding up in the wash at all."
3.0,"I just got it, it looks  nice and elegant. After a month ou normal use the wristwatch is fading really badly,I dont now at this point if the watch is real mk I doubt.Very dissapointed at the moment."
3.0,I kept these leggings but they are thin. When I bend my knee I can see my skin thru them. I only wear them whim my longer dresses. They will not work with a tunic unless you want your underwear to show threw.  Also the elastic waist band is thin and not comfortable.
3.0,Not really what I expected.  Stone is dull and looks cheap.
3.0,Great pants so cozy live them but…definitely not the color advertised in the picture.  It looks dark brown almost charcoal in picture. But that roux color is actually like a true brown. Disappointing if you choose your purchases based on color you want!  But fits cozy so I will keep them.
3.0,"I wanted to love this swimsuit so much but it looks nothing at all on me as it does the model. Honestly, my figure isn’t that far off from the models so I’m not sure... It makes me look as though I’m built like sponge bob square pants - which is really hard to do! I have an easy-to-dress body shape but this looks ridiculous on me. I love the colors and pattern of the top and it seems to fit right, it just doesn’t look right :("
3.0,Lasted only a month and the strap broke
3.0,Wore it to a party. It did the job. It fit comfortably and it’s a decent quality given the price.
3.0,Didn't like the quality
3.0,Very low fabric quality. Also they were too tight.I've returned these jeans.
3.0,This purse is a little smaller than I had hoped and looks bigger in the pictures with the models than the purse I received. One of the cross-body strap clips broke the very first time I carried the purse. I am still using it without some of the items I carried in my previous purse and with a leftover strap that I had on hand.
3.0,Inexpensive dangles
3.0,"I really liked this shirt. However, I bleached this shirt and the black stripes faded (a lot). Black and white colors together can be tricky, the white can get dingy but if you bleach to keep it bright, you run the chance of the black fading-which is what happened with this shirt. I’m only sharing this info for those if you who may want to do this (I’ve done this with many other stripe shirts and never had a problem)"
3.0,Super Cute... But way too small.. However I’m having the crown put on another tshirt ..
3.0,Just didn’t realize they were leggings. The photo looks more lick pants or slacks.  I like them though just wouldn’t have paid that price for a pair of leggings. Nice fabric leggings though.
3.0,The decorations fell off the skirt before the first wash...very cute when it first arrived though. (You could probably hot glue decorations back on if you wanted.)
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 225 lbs. Ordered an XXL and it fit well in terms of sizing alone. I typically wear an 18 in misses or 16W in plus sizes. Hit just below the knee. I ultimately returned it due to various style/fit issues that I personally didn't care for. As another reviewer mentioned, where the peplum attaches to the dress in the back/side looks a little funky, needed help to get in and out of the dress (zipper isn't great) and sleeves were too long for my T-Rex arms. Just wasn't for me."
3.0,I don't like the material. I thought it was cotton and it's more like a silk and spandex.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:4b91c216efa048df2ae057cc9fed117e]] To be honest my review is based on my not reading the product description and making assumptions.<br /><br />I didn't realize this was going to be a purely blinking hat, and then I tested it and found out this is a fast blinking blue mode, a slower but still fast blinking blue mode, and a fast blinking colored mode.<br />I do not like fast blinking items, had the slow blink of blue been blue switching between 1-2 colors I think that would've been an improvement over it blinking from a light to no light or if the circulation of the colored blinks been 1/2 the speed or slower I might've still liked it but yeah too fast, I'll have to see if a friend with less sensitvity to lights can find use for it sometime.<br /><br />Also if the colored version only has 3 modes, the title of the multicolored listing should not be titled. ""4 Light Effects"" The description makes it clear, but the title makes it misleading.<br /><br />Otherwise the hat is nicely consturcted for the most part, if you aren't blinking light sensitive you'll probably love this hat."
3.0,"Kinda cheap. Looked ok, but wouldn’t purchase again or recommend."
3.0,"This necklace is cute, but noisy! The metal pieces clink together when you walk announcing your arrival, a lot like a cowbell!  It is a shorter, choker style necklace, but it does have an extender built in which makes it a little better. I think this would look better if it was a really long necklace. Then I would be able to hold it against my body easier when I walk to silence my arrivals! I could hold now, but it looks a bit ridiculous to hold it up that high. It's sturdy and seems well made."
3.0,"I was really excited about this GRACE KARIN dress. It is exactly as the size chart says. I ordered a medium as my measurements are: 36, 28, 40. If I was any bigger, I’d definitely want a larger size. The material is thicker than I was expecting and has a synthetic look to it(in a not great way) so there is no give! Sleeves are a bit long, but I’m only 5 3 so that’s typical. It does feel very well made and that it will last a long time if cared for properly.<br />My big disappointment is that the fabric on my chest doesn’t look good because all the folds don’t allow it to lay flat."
3.0,"I expected to easily find yellow wedges since it's summer but it's been a total bust.  Like most things, the reviews were mixed on these so I took a chance and ordered my usual size.  When I stood up my heel was just slightly longer than the back of the shoe and my toes were all the way to the end.  The ankle straps were loose even on the tightest setting.  Each shoe had a mark of some kind on the toes straps, one was brown and one was black.  One reviewer stated that there was glue on one of her shoes, but these were actual marks on the shoes and very visible.  The sole was beginning to come loose or maybe never glued down completely on the front of the right shoe.  It also had a protruding area on the bottom of the heel.  I don't know what exactly it was but something on the inside was out of place.  I suspect it wouldn't take too much walking and the sole would wear through and whatever the protrusion was would be sticking out.  The shoe looked decent aside from all the problems.  The color was a dark mustard.  The material seemed low quality."
3.0,"The print in AIR FORCE is not very clear, the O and R's all look blurred and you don't get a clear outline of what the letter is.  It's ok, but I probably wouldn't purchase anything else that had lettering on it from this manufacturer.  It looks defective."
3.0,Not the best quality of product
3.0,"The dark strap is more taupe than grey on mine. Also didn’t orginally realize it had a blue stripe, not 3 black stripes. Overall decent quality but I hate my dark strap."
3.0,"tarnish fast  ,made bracelets"
3.0,"I do love these, but have had to order about 8 pair because the nose pads keep falling off. I do wish they would sell the nose pieces separately! It's not about &#34;if they will fall off&#34;, but when."
3.0,was smaller than the size. must purchase a size larger to fit correctly
3.0,"I like the straw hole, but it doesn’t fit around my face as snug as other masks."
3.0,"It's an interesting lightweight material, stretchy and sort of swimsuit-like. But it's pretty tight in the hips, it has a very straight silhouette, so if you're curvy in the hips it's not going to work for you. Additionally, it's several inches longer than the picture suggests."
3.0,These are not stretch enough
3.0,I Had to send back..they had glaring imperfections. Meaning they didnt match and were cloudy. But return was smooth process.
3.0,I love the jumpsuit but it fits entirely too small and although it's white - it's too see through.  The item is being returned.
3.0,wasnt a fan of the face plate when it came in person
3.0,They smudge really easy and don't clean super well but they are really cute
3.0,"UPDATE:  The company was kind enough to send me another shirt to re-review. The stitching underneath the ties is definitely better than the last shirt I received but still not flawless. Also, the shirt still runs small. (Normally wear a large, ordered extra large).<br /><br />I returned this top because it was extremely small. Even if it had fit me, when I received this shirt there were 2 holes in it just under the ties, so it would've been returned anyways. I really liked the style of this shirt and the color, but unfortunately it didn't work out for me."
3.0,"They are small on me, should say size. I gave them away just kept the one with the bow that size fit well!"
3.0,The shorts are pretty long and kind of big but the shirt fits great not a super comfy material but definitely works for bedtime.
3.0,Choice to decide how snug you want your slippers to wrap around your feet is noteworthy.  Swelling of the feet happens and it was nice to be able to relieve some of the uncomfortableness width wise.  Softness is there across and below your feet. Mediocre rating is given because the foot bed portion does not remain buoyant but flattens<br />and what little arch support was there disappears after @ six weeks.  I only weigh 110 lbs. at this time.  Hope manufacturer considers revamping with minimum price point increase.  I was very happy with slippers initially.  No thought to reorder d.ue to short length of arch support and underfoot cushioning
3.0,I wish they ran true to size. They were a birthday gift.
3.0,Not like a picture
3.0,"Esta bonito y de buena calidad, pero es incomodo para mi."
3.0,The case is ok....but when I put my phone in it the volume button gets stuck and turns off all my sounds
3.0,"Color and design are beautiful, but this top is definitely cut too small."
3.0,Item was very large did not expect to that
3.0,"This dress is mainly for taller woman especially if you order any size past large.  If you're a curvy girl but 5'2, don't waste your time, you will be tripping over this dress all day unless you feel like cutting & sewing them to suit your height.  Had they not been so long they will fit any size woman as they're quite baggy and comfortable to wear as well. The design is unique obviously an acquired taste. Material is soft cotton-like & cool to wear. It's a perfect summer dress,  it's just not a universal fit."
3.0,Nice sweater -thinner sweaters I like but this was short in length -shorter than waistline
3.0,"Kinda see through material. Will be using for swim suit cover up and wearing around the house. I bought the jackets to match for work, the colors are not the same. The reds are different shades. I assumed they would be same."
3.0,It had / still has a bad chemical smell. My cards stick in the sleeves. My ATM card has a permanent bend from trying to get it out. So I put another card I seldom use in the slot and slip the often used overtop of it. I like the wallet other than the smell and stickiness. Maybe it will get worn in better later.
3.0,"For a large tall, it is mostly large, not so tall.<br />Otherwise, good fabric that keeps one warm"
3.0,"Returned. Did not  look nearly as nice in person as in the photo. Looked cheap in person.<br /> Honestly, for the price I should have expected that. But, I am always hopeful. LOL"
3.0,Too big for my 5 month old.
3.0,"Cute, but not an orange fox. Will be returning."
3.0,"The medium fits my size 9 women's foot reasonably well. These are cheap water socks, which likely will not hold up over time, and probably aren't going to be good for diving. I used them to protect my feet while swimming. The grips on the bottom aren't going to do well against slippery rocks, but they will protect your feet on the beach or in rivers.<br /><br />If you are going to use these heavily, or often, you should invest in a better pair."
3.0,heavier than expected. divider inside purse does not hold up to do its job very well.
3.0,"After seeing the reviews about the fit on the smaller size, I ordered a medium despite having smaller hands. I received a small instead, but luckily, they were able to fit on my hands just tightly. I wished I can throw these in the washer though instead of being able to only spot clean because of covid etc. I used a gentle fabric cleaner for the outside, but couldn't really do much about the inside since it was small and hard to flip inside out."
3.0,"The color is as expected, but the material is supwe thin. I bought this to go underneath a tennis dress but I would never wear it on its own."
3.0,The paints is too large compared to the jacket
3.0,I ended up returning it because the over all quality looked cheap.
3.0,I was expecting a WIDE belt and these came in slim. I would love to send back but too much $$ to send back.
3.0,the charm is bigger than I expected
3.0,"I love the style but they are really big for someone with a smaller face. they are a bit bigger than your typical ray bans so if you like the chunky glasses that cover your face go for it, if not, look elsewhere."
3.0,"Runs large. Got medium based on hand size,  but the gloves are loose.<br />And they don't go as far up the wrist a photo indicates."
3.0,This necklace is cute and a good length.  I get many compliments on it when I wear it but it's very cheaply made.  The paint job on it is terrible and there are red smears all over the core area of the apple.  I guess I got what I paid for but I wouldn't want to give this as a gift as it looks cheap when examined closely.
3.0,The colors in this multi color weren't quite as shown here. Had a lot of pastel pink and not the bright Coral color as shown. Everywhere u see coral was like pink. Looked more like pajamas because the colors were more of the pastel ones dominating it and not the vibrant colors. Kind of a reverse pattern of this in colors.
3.0,Gotta be real careful they tear easily
3.0,I really like this watch bracelet. The size was not for my watch it was to long.😏😏 Looking to find the right size. Its super cute. Would've looked great with my galaxy active. 🤷🏾‍♀️
3.0,"Cute dress but waaay too small! I ordered an XXL and it barely even covered my chest and pulled super tight. My bust is40”, waist is 44”, and hips are 45”. The bottom fit fine through the hips but the top was super super small. It might work if you have no chest or a tiny waist. But I’m very straight through my waist. It was also tight in the waist."
3.0,Lovely patterned dress.  Description not accurate. Not velvet. Stretchy polyester jersey.
3.0,"I’ve bought both the cheetah printed ones in a L and they fit perfectly. I’ve tried three other prints and they either fit too tight (roll down when bending over) and/or they fit SUPER long. I’ve had to return all three. Smh, such a shame too because I love my cheetah printed ones"
3.0,"The Kimono is beautiful! My problem was that it was way too small, I bought XL, in the shoulder area. When I put it on, I could not put my arm down at all but it would have fit every where else. I'm hoping now it will fit my daughter who is a XS-S. If not, it will be a return :("
3.0,"I returned this dress. The color was very muted and muddy, but greens are tricky. The fit was odd on my body type. I'm 5'3&#34; a medium build, but have square shoulders, and the neckline was not wide enough for me to wear this dress off the shoulder. The flow is beautiful, but the amount of fabric makes it heavy to wear IMHO. I might have kept it if the color was more appealing to me, but all it all I didn't think I could pull it off."
3.0,"These are really cute, but I bought the size 3-6 months and they are definitely only going to fit a 0-3 month old. Very disappointed considering 3-6 months is what I needed, but I already washed them so it’s too late for me to return them. If you buy these, definitely order a size up!!"
3.0,The Jacket is nice -very light and I could have sized up due to arm lenght being a bit short.  My pocket developed a whole in it although I've only worn it 4 times.<br /><br />Outside of the sleezes the jacket fit well.
3.0,The bracelet is nice but  the holy card that came with it had instructions on how to say the rosary. Should have had a holy card with instructions about the bracelet
3.0,"This shirt is hilarious and my husband lives it. It has been washed numerous times and the graphic is still intact and has not faded, neither has the black tee. Only issue is it does shrink and shortens up. I would recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,"Ordered this thinking it would be nice to have an easily adjustable belt to use with an inside the waist belt holster. The belt is nice, adjustment is easy, buckle works great, but the belt lacks the rigidty necessary to be comfortable for carrying.<br />Basically it is a normal floppy nylon belt, I had been hoping for something more rigid like the 5.11 operator belts that I own.<br />It is good as a “pants holding up belt” but that’s about as far as I would go."
3.0,I loved it because it motivated me. The first time I put it on I was on a date and the NP charm broke below the loop. It cant be fixed. I'm sad.
3.0,"The XL pants fit great. However, the XL shorts were too small."
3.0,"I was expecting something else, this product when it arrived looks man made & not real rock; but what do I know, I will never wear it. Oh well-live & learn!"
3.0,It looks great and is comfortable but after only an hour or two of wearing it (no strenuous activity) it broke apart and the two layers separated.
3.0,loved the print - but definitely made for a short build person not someone 5'10
3.0,My son is an average size 18 and we ordered the size 18. It runs tight for an average size. But it does have stretch to it.  This would fit a slim size 18 boy. Hope this helps. The sweater is nice. I took 2 stars for the sizing.
3.0,"This would be a very nice looking dress if only it fit without exposing one's breasts. The problem is that it is not sized like other dresses in this maker's line. If I might get a more modest dress in the larger size I will never know, because I don't intend to bother with another round of purchase and return to find out."
3.0,"I ordered this based on the sellers measurements. Based on their sizing chart I was in between sizes from medium to small. I ordered the small, however it was just too large. Also, the color is off from the pictures. Even the pictures show two different shades of color."
3.0,"I adore this bag, its so cute and the size is great! Unfortunately the first reason i bought it was for travel and while at the airport, one of handles broke and made it super inconvenient to use."
3.0,The watch faces were beautiful! Only problem is that I can't use 2 of the 5! The hole where I am to pass my wire through is completely closed!
3.0,"The band appears to be of good quality, time will tell.  However the band is small, almost to small for my wrist and I am only an average size.  I would like to see multiple sizes available.  Also the leather is very stiff, I suggest others to soak it in some kind of leather softener for a couple days before wearing it."
3.0,"I like the quality.  The picture only shows part of the bracelet, which led me to believe that the whole bracelet had those links, but it is more like a chain and the part you see is the only decoration on the bracelet.  I was disappointed in the size.  It is a little smaller than I expected, but if I ordered a size up it would have been too large.  Also, the heart that says &#34;wife&#34; is smaller than I expected."
3.0,It was lovely...I gave it as a gift
3.0,"I really, really wanted this coat to fit. I am 5' 2&#34;, the arms were a little too long but the kicker for this coat was the fact that it was too small in the torso area. My chest didn't fit so zipping it up wasn't an option but leaving it open will work until it snows. I would love for this coat to get an overhaul with a little more give in the torso. It looks great. Fantastic even, it simply doesn't fit where I need it to."
3.0,"The color is very nice and the fabric is not too thin. Unfortunately, the hemline is very strange. It seems to be even across the back and slanted across the front."
3.0,"Little usage, swoosh fell off, a shame"
3.0,"Not bad,but looks different than photo, quality well."
3.0,Decent wrap.  The fabric is nice.  Not as curved as I had hoped and have not worn yet.
3.0,"bit heavy, but it's cute."
3.0,"There were several things I didn't like about the sunglasses. They weren't the same shape as my glasses and they were difficult to attach to my eyeglasses. Finally, they had a weird angle sitting on my glasses."
3.0,"I ordered on the smaller size figuring I could get away with it based on the measurements and losing a lot of weight. I was wrong, it didnt come close to buttoning. However, I gave it three stars because I will definitely come back and buy this dress again in time and will more carefully select the size. Worth giving it a shot, but make sure to err on the side of caution when choosing your size."
3.0,The arms are really tight and I already have small arms. Everything else is perfect
3.0,It's the biggest black hole of a purse I ever had.  Not easily assessible even when massively organized.
3.0,I love Flaming and birds.  Received this Tote bag looks nice but have not use yet.
3.0,"I loved everything about these, they just won’t stay on my head."
3.0,These are really cute Mary Jane's but my daughter has hardly worn them and the faux leather is coming off a bit in places.
3.0,Less than 6 months after putting under my kayaks to move them around the top 4 to 6 inches of the ribbed rubber on each post cracked and tore off the cart. I looked up the manufacturers website and attempted to contact them with the issue. To this day I have not been contacted or offered a fix or replacement. I will continue  to use it as long as the bare posts don't mess up my boats.
3.0,"Decent value for the price. I was most disappointed with the back light, which is barely useful."
3.0,"The build quality could be better. The cross strap used to hold excess fabric in place ripped off and frayed the band on the red and black one, which was disappointing since that was the one I liked the most. At least they ship four per package, so I had a backup. Haven't had any further problems with the other straps for the last few months. I'd recommend this pack only if you like two of the straps, since you might have to ditch your first pick."
3.0,"I have to use the blistered support adhesive bandages, because these rub the back of my ankles raw where the zipper is."
3.0,Arms are very skinny
3.0,I love the shirt but Yugyeom name the U is not full color. A bit disappointed can’t return it because I bought for a concert going this week.
3.0,Great for keeping your hands dry and warm but finger sleeves go inverse if you don't pull your hand out slowly and carefully. Takes an effort to fix but can be fixed for reuse
3.0,"My husband ordered this for me. I love the color and the look. However, it isn't very roomy and doesn't have any 'give'. I won't be using it as a primary every day purse. It simply won't hold everything I need without it being completely cram-packed. By the time I put my full size wallet, medium size make up bag, check book and my son's emergency medical glucagon, and a small bottle of lotion, it was full. I usually carry more than that in my purse.<br />I'll be using it as a fun this matches my outfit purse or 'pop of color' purse during the evenings and weekends."
3.0,The bag I received seemed to be well made however it was not the correct bag. It was also heavier than expected. It was returned in the same box that it came in with another messenger bag.
3.0,Packaging of gloves was sloppy.  Box was smashed.  Poor quality.
3.0,"Fabric pattern does not lined up at all, if he had I would have given this 5 stars, but instead I’m returning it"
3.0,"It is a very soft fabric, the color is nice the straps are a bit wide and the top is just machine edged."
3.0,"Looks fake on close inspection, but I have seen a lot worst.  Stones atleast have good color in the light"
3.0,This dress was more of a satin fabric than I had expected. With that being said........ the fabric itself is decent but not great 😐 the inner fabric which is exposed at times is not a full bleed of design and color so it’s whitish but it still look pretty. The back strings you have to do yourself which take a a couple minutes. Pretty dress but not something I will ever have as a go-to.
3.0,Standard hats
3.0,Always tell my size to try to help other ordering. This was going to go back but then I tried it on with a pair of super baggy pants and this crop top is really the only thing for them. I didn't like the static right out of the bag but this is a well made blouse -sheer -wear a cami. The pockets look very cool. Will work w/ jeans too. Nice blouse. wish it had more cotton in it but at this price? It's just fine.
3.0,The zipper was getting sticky. Returned.
3.0,"6'1"" with 38 waist. Too small to wear comfortably over jacket or sweatshirt."
3.0,"very light weight... a bit see-through, but still nice for the price"
3.0,Dress was unusually big everyone said it was small so I ordered a size bigger than my usual size and it was huge. Had to return and pay for 2 day shipping because I needed it for a wedding other than that the dress is cute and comfy.
3.0,Fit seems ok but it’s ORANGE not red. Disappointed because I wanted to be patriotic.
3.0,"From the description, I knew it was going to be small with a thin chain. But the stone was even smaller & the chain flimsier than I expected & the clasp was hard to use. The stone was a very pretty color. Might be nice for a young girl."
3.0,I liked it but I have a 38 c bust and theres just to much side boob! I need a little more coverage to wear it out but if you wear it inside for a significant other then they will love it!!
3.0,Nice jacket but too small
3.0,"I ordered size 18 per the charts, and it was a bit loose on me. I am 5' 7"", 185 lbs, 44-40-44.<br /> It made me look boxy,  no curves at all. Also I decided I felt frumpy in it. Sent it back and got a different dress for my son's wedding."
3.0,they were okay. nothing spectacular.
3.0,I find it helpful but the metal that was used is really flimsy. It bends easy I have to be careful not to break it.
3.0,"I was disappointed.  I needed some compression socks for my Neuropathy, but I had to give up trying to wear these.  They are very tight and restrictive.  My feet and legs started hurting after two days wearing these."
3.0,I ordered size L and got size XXL - but it still fit.  Lots of pockets - too many pockets - blocks easy access.  Stiff fabric and not very neat sewing.
3.0,"I really wish this bra would have worked out. I tried it in a 36B first and while the cup fit, the band was a little too tight. I went up to a 36C (no 38C option) and it was still tight on the band and a little large in the cup. I was hoping for a bra that I could put on easily and would hold it all in for working out while pregnant (I'm 26 weeks, size small-medium in regular and maternity), but this one just didn't work out for me."
3.0,"The 3 stars are because it isn't right for me, a 68 year old woman. I'm sure it would be charming on a  younger, taller lady. The material was a bit thin, the sleeves are short even for a short person, and it fit too tight for a mature figure. Thanks to Amazon prime for free returns."
3.0,"It looks okay from afar, but the silver color and pearls look really cheap when you are close up."
3.0,See through. And I bought this as a &#34;slip&#34; for my wedding. It was a last minute wedding but when looking at the pictures taken at my wedding I can through this dress.
3.0,"I bought this mask to protect myself and others from COVID and also to share the sentiment about my native country. Unfortunately, the mask looks better than feels on my face - too tight and really difficult to breathe through. But I will continue to wear it as proud Latvian!"
3.0,They leave black spots on my ears after wearing them.
3.0,"Really great quality, but had to return because they run very narrow. My feet are not wide enough to wear wide shoes? So I don't know why they'd fit so narrow."
3.0,Like The pants but runs small
3.0,Its cute but it runs very very small. I ordered my daughter a small and she couldn't get it over her head. Had to reorder an xl.
3.0,La calidad mala
3.0,"This is kind of a missed review.  The large one was flat huge, hitnifbyiubload it up with 50 lbs of cloths the coasters are not suited for the weight, and the caster mounts to the case are weak.  The middle one is great for a checked bag, however should not have the laptop pouch and no one will check a laptop.  The small one is a perfect carry I’m with a laptop slot.  It would make a great weekend bag"
3.0,"This was a gift.  Hat was a bit small and had to be adjusted to the very end to fit and average sized head.  It is embroidered, not stamped but the embroidered design looks just a hair off center when placed on head.  Seems well made and sturdy."
3.0,I a nice shirt. Fits a little snug.  I have put it away till summer so I do not know how it will wash  Do like the ruching.
3.0,"Nice fabric, orderd xxl, got xlarge.....get your act together"
3.0,"I ordered a small, white color. The color was not &#34;as white&#34; as I had hoped. It has a very slight purple tint to it & the size was slightly bigger than what I had expected as well, I should have ordered an XS."
3.0,"They are cool but when one of them fell, the little face plate came out …"
3.0,Not good enough planning to return.
3.0,"The black stones don't look real onyx, and the silver is poorly worked."
3.0,"would give it 5 star if it wasn't too small.. this is an asian size swimwear, normally I would fit in them but not on this one. I'm a very petite 5'2 100lbs ordered a MEDIUM and this is too small for a petite individual. I think people should order 2 size up if you're an ASIAN SIZE to fit you perfectly. I believe this would fit a child tho about 10-12 years old if they are petite as well. NOTE: American size - dont expect to fit on this swim suit, if its too small for an asian size it'll be even worse to fit a regular size. It looks good though, the only problem is the sizing is way off"
3.0,Nice gloves but get puffy after one day
3.0,Cute for the money! This dress is so thin it’s just about see through so make sure your daughter has shorts to go under it!
3.0,Great buy but runs small
3.0,"Both sides should be checkered, i cant wear a half black half checkered belt. And its too long. I like the style, its cheap, but overall its just okay."
3.0,A little bigger than I expected. Good construction. Would definitely recommend.
3.0,product runs REALLY SMALL.
3.0,FOGS WITHIN SECONDS. False advertising.
3.0,Sheer top with bad seems. Falls apart
3.0,Nice quality shirt love the look ordered a small and still really big.
3.0,"The cuff was sized smaller than expected. The size is more suited for a child. In addition, the font/wording if the statement is sub par."
3.0,I like the shirt but it turned my armpits purple. So hence the three stars.
3.0,"I HAVE A VERY TINY WRIST AND NEED AT LEAST  THREE MORE HOLES, SO THE WATCH CAN BE NEXT TO MY SKIN."
3.0,"Arrived and seems to small but with a single wash, fit is bigger. After one wash, I don’t think it keeps its “slim fit” but does not become excessively misshaped so it will be usable and neat."
3.0,The vinyl wore off pretty fast but it was good while it lasted! I got some really got pictures in it
3.0,"The bracelet was a gift for a friend but when given to her it did not fit. Too small. I had to, at my expense, have an expansion put on to fit properly"
3.0,Fits the glasses<br />Pads are to small for the size of my frames<br />Locks into the frame no cushion
3.0,Disappointed because normally letters are engraved not printed. Not sure how long this will last.
3.0,"The mask is very cute. lightweight material. HOWEVER, it is made too small. I have a small face and it still pulls my ears down.. uncomfortable and pops off.. too bad:("
3.0,Fit  well and looked great until the 1st time I wore it in the pool.  I went to put it on the second day and the edges on the top were curling over.
3.0,Great deal for the dollar. Kind of stretched out after a few washes. But great for toddlers.
3.0,"It's pretty interesting to order a tie and not know what you're going to get, but I'm not sure that's entirely ideal. I got 2 of the same tie, both of which are a mild, inoffensive, checkered purple pattern. I was excited to get the bright pink tie pictured on the site. These ties are just okay, so I'm giving them three stars. Definitely wearable, but nothing I'm overly excited about. Oh well!"
3.0,"you truly need to go up many sizes in this, I wear a 16 in U.S. sizing, I ordered a 5x and it just fit's, may even be a little snug for my taste, and I like my tops fitted. It is def. not the same color in the pic., it is much darker, not navy though, more like a dark cobalt. the quality is not superb either. It's o.k., but if I had known how it was going to feel, or even not be the color of the pic, I would have not of bought this unless it was much cheaper."
3.0,These are not workout leggings which is what I purchased them for. They are just cotton leggings for everyday wear.
3.0,The slits are to the hip.  A lot more leg showing than I wanted.  The slits do not fold over.
3.0,Beautiful watch...easy to read however it runs small. It says it fits a 6.25 to 7.25 wrist.  My wrist is 6.5 and it's very snug. It leaves an indent after a couple hours of wear.
3.0,"The bag looks nice but it is not the size indicated (13.4&#34; L x 11&#34; H x 4.5&#34;W)<br /><br />Instead, the bag measures 11.25&#34; X 9.5&#34; across the front panel.  The bottom panel measures 4&#34; across, but the bag isn't square so at the top of the side panel you get 3.25&#34;.<br /><br />The effective size is thus 11.25 X 9.5 X 3.25 .<br /><br />My measurements were generous, going from seam to seam, or in the case of the front panel seam to edge, so you should expect to have a little less space in real life where the corners will be rounded off a little.<br /><br />I bought this bag to carry a text book and notepad.  Thanks to this item's falsely advertised size they won't fit."
3.0,Too big for me. I'm coming from a slim credit card holder/money clip so maybe my expectations weren't appropriate. But it barely fits in my jeans front pockets and still just holds the same amount of cards and money.
3.0,"Tends to run a little small in some places & a little large in other.  Coat is fairly warm.  I did not pay full price, so for the discount, it was a good buy.  Paying full price would not have been a bargin."
3.0,Fits perfect but it’s a little pricey.
3.0,"Cute, but my short legs make this dress look long, so I had to return it."
3.0,Pretty but soooo not worth what I paid.  Much cheaper on Wish.com
3.0,"Really pretty but it is kinda big on me, and it cannot be adjusted, although it looks like it would be.  :("
3.0,Could fit a medium sized adult
3.0,"Absolutely love this sweat shirt. It's very light in fabric, perfect for those slightly chilly summer nights. I love the color, it's a burgundy. I only gave this 3 starts because the stitching on one of the pockets started to unravel the first time I wore it. I restitched it by hand so that I could continue to enjoy this sweat shirt but am not pleased that it fell apart so quickly."
3.0,I ordered this dress and it is not what u see it in picture.  The color is very pail and poorly made.....material is a good quality but the dress looks very cheap compare to how elegant it looks on the photo. I usually wear large and I order an xlarge base on customer review.....but I should have ordered my normal size which is large.....its a purchase I regret....very dissappointed
3.0,The cap fit ok with the ear flaps tucked under but is too loose with them down.  The ear flaps are not really thick enough to keep the ears warm in cold weather.
3.0,"Bad zipper.......,"
3.0,"This is a nice looking belt but it seems to be made of bonded leather, not top grain. It's very light for its size and the interior side is too smooth. For just a few bucks, you can't beat it but don't expect it to last more than a couple of years."
3.0,"Usually I’m an XL, followed instructions to get an XXXL and was still very tight. Did not come with red bow."
3.0,"Errr...it's not canary yellow like in the photo. We needed a yellow accessory for a yellow-themed wedding and this wasn't exactly what I expected. This is more like yellow orange than canary yellow. In fact, the scarf is the exact same color as the Amazon stars and the submit button on this review. Luckily, we're just the guests so we can pretend to be a little color blind if the bride thinks we're way off her color theme."
3.0,"Not sure if I received someone else's return, but the post of the earrings were faded to a dull silver color. And because of the size of the opals, from far away, they just look white and doesn't show the fiery brilliance you'd normally expect of opals. Will be returning."
3.0,Actually a really cute and decently fitting dress! I was impressed with the quality. Was too tight in the tummy though... darn c-section! 😂
3.0,"Pockets are too far back, awkward to even get my phone in there. Tighter and shorter than expected. Also have several loose threads already seems to be coming apart at the waist, do not recommend."
3.0,"I'm not sure what other people got but I ordered an XL out of caution and reading reviews but it would not fit a 10 year old. I don't know what they consider XL but this ain't it. Shame cause it's a cute shirt. No where did it specify ladies, teens or unisex sizing just says ""ladies girls"" so it was a gamble but it's certainly not a normal ladies XL!"
3.0,"I think someone else might enjoy this, but I'm not a fan of the chunkiness of the embroidery or the very itchy sheer sleeves. I am a size 6 in dresses, 34DD-28-36, 5'4"", 127 pounds. I got the size 6 and the fit was perfect. The quality of the dress is nice, better than expected, which would lead me to recommend this brand. However, I returned this primarily because the sleeves were itchy and the pattern was a little chunky and busy for me. FWIW, I generally wear solid colors or classic patterns, and go bold with accessories. I think I would've liked it better with plain sheer sleeves that didn't itch. You might like it. I could've worn a long sleeved bodysuit under it, but it's just not for me. Back it goes."
3.0,"It’s cute and I guess worth what ya pay for! Super lightweight but the magnetic part is not very strong, it often comes undone or loosens on its own. I’d recommend this for once in a while use but not every day"
3.0,Great material but no stretch I'm 5'3 220 and it's too small for my hips. Also may be a little long
3.0,It was a lot smaller than I expected...and didn't fit my wrist...and I have a small wrist...I gave  it to my 5 yr old daughter
3.0,"Ordered a  xl. Im a 38dD and the Top was too small, so i bought another. The bottoms fit ok. Could have been a lil looser in the leg holes."
3.0,"These flip flops fit my husband well, but wore out after just a few weeks of wearing (deep indentions in the footbed.) Cheap materials - would not purchase again."
3.0,Amazingly beautiful glasses. However mine came with a pretty deep scratch right in the middle of the frame on the nose piece. Plus there are some small dents on my frame...just my luck.
3.0,"Way to large going to return it, but color was perfect ant it was very soft"
3.0,"My daughter loved this crown, but it is very heavy."
3.0,"I’m 5’8”, 165lbs, 38in chest, and 31in waist. I ordered the 36US size and the whole thing is a little snug. Jacket a little tight up top, pants a little tight in the waist, and the length of the pants are about an inch too long.<br /><br />Seems to be good quality, I can still wear it, it’s just a little tight and uncomfortable depending on my posture or how I sit. Only reason for three stars is because the sizing chart is so far off from the actual fit. I didn’t have time to return for the next size up."
3.0,Given as a gift.  Pendent larger than I expected.
3.0,The product is okay. I wouldn’t say it was worth what I paid but it’ll do since I already have it.
3.0,My daughter is a big fan of Among Us.  It was difficult to find a hoodie that had great reviews. I went with this one bc of price.  The print looks great.  Colorful and clear. The hoodie is ok.  Its polyester but doesn't feel smooth on the outside.  Inside is softer but my daughter needs to wear a top under.  Not comfortable wearing alone.  I ended up buying the among pj's from another vendor.  That one was worth it.
3.0,"It's hot as heck outside right now and I needed a pair of lounge shorts, but this wasn't quite what I was expecting. The fabric isn't terrible, it's fairly soft and silky, but the fabric loves to ride up. I felt like every time I shifted I'd have to tug the undershorts down so that they weren't bunched up by my crotch. Now maybe I just have thick thighs, but it also just might be the cut of the shorts themselves."
3.0,Very very cute shoe but runs very small my daughter usually wears a 12 and I ordered a 13.5 and it was too tight to keep so we returned but I do love the color
3.0,Nice but came with a vinegar smell washed it twice !
3.0,I guess this is meant for shorter women. Does not cover as well as seen in the pictures. I'm almost 5'8&#34;.
3.0,"Cute pattern, but a bit wide and slide off my son's feet"
3.0,Los numeros no son tan reales.
3.0,"It’s a decent sweater, had some snags when I received it. It’s somewhat itchy material too."
3.0,These sock are good for running and working out but their pressure is not enough for me as I have varicose veins. They are very nice but not what I expected for my medical conditions.
3.0,"too short, in my opinion. im 5'8 and it didnt go to my ankles. it stopped at a awkward length."
3.0,"Adorable, but very thin and appears cheaply made."
3.0,"I'm used to Hanes' Premium Line, which uses very soft fabric. Unfortunately, I couldn't find Premium and opted to try the regular line. They're okay, but not nearly as soft as I'm used to. Would recommend people opt for the Premium line if they can find it. Still, the fit is good, with no riding up."
3.0,"Fits HUGE! Usually buy Med, got a small and I’m swimming in it. Had a seamstress take it in over an inch on each side and some in sleeves and it’s still big. Size WAY down! Got cheap with a lightening deal or would have returned"
3.0,"This looks and feels like a nice mask but even with the adjustable strap out at the max I cannot get the ear straps over my ears. Yes I have a bigger head than normal and a beard but this does not come close to fitting my head even if I didn't have a beard. When the description says ""fits most men"",  I would beg to differ."
3.0,"Fits very loose and isn’t that true to size so I’d suggest sizing down if you can. Otherwise it’s exactly like I expected. The material is nice and thick, love the pockets on the sides, and it’s great for an expanding belly!!"
3.0,The zipper broke my son was unable to zip it up . It was aXL but fits like a L
3.0,"I had to return mine, as it was way too small for my average sized wrist."
3.0,Runs a little small - It's cute but I need a bigger size which I'm not sure would be too flattering on me personally. Ok quality.
3.0,"The band is made of good quality material but doesn't match my rose gold watch, it does however come with a face cover that matches the band, I just wish I didn't need to use the cover"
3.0,"Cute but arm holes too big, chest too small"
3.0,It was an ok purse. I didn't like the color so I returned it.
3.0,I haven't used it yet but it is very slim. It does look cute on. Not worth the price.
3.0,"I like them enough but they are a bit wide, and I have a wide face so that's saying something.  It's still a great look, kind of oversized celebrity sunglasses feel.  Do it. it's a fun look!"
3.0,The small was huge. I’m 5” and 117 lbs. wish they had it in extra small at least.
3.0,"A bit large and arrived very wrinkled.  I think it will be fine, but will require some alteration."
3.0,For a boys size 2/3 the shoes are small. He will outgrow the shoes very quickly.
3.0,"Toes wore through pretty quickly. Sad, because the colors are fun and they have traction."
3.0,My husband loved them but they broke shortly after purchase and no one could fix them.
3.0,"So, I'm not sure how most people are saying these are true to size. I saw on Puma's website that people were saying they were way too small and saw on here that most said true to size so I went middle of the road and bought a half size up. I bought two different Puma shoes at the same time; these - the Cali Sport - as well as a pair of just regular Calis. In the pics you'll see the size difference. The one of the shoes laying on their side is one of each of the Puma's that I just bought. Both I bought in size 9. Yes, that's right, they're the same size. But the regular Cali looks like it's at least a half size bigger. I then compared it to a pair of 8.5 Nike Courts that I own - I know, they look rough - and even the 8.5 Nike Courts look bigger than the size 9 Puma Cali Sport. The Nike Court 8.5 fit me perfect with just a little extra space at the toe so it's not touching. With these Cali Sports, my big toe was pressing against the very top and rubbing the inside.<br /><br />The shoes look great; I love the style and their made well, but man, they're super miss-sized. If you're determined to get these I'd go for a full size up. I'm returning for a 9.5."
3.0,Order 2 sizes up!
3.0,"Worked as expected. My daughter used the flower cuff to camouflage a nasty looking bump on the top outer part of her ear for the proms she attended. She initially needed me to tighten the cuff on her ear for her. She did say that during the party she had to tighten it about 2 more times throughout the night. It did what we needed it to do for that night so... Would I recommend these? Yes, all of the cuffs are beautiful especially the flower cuff and the 2 different studded cuffs."
3.0,"These socks are pretty nice.  I ordered a size larger than I wanted to because they didn't have my size in stock at the time.  I also don't like how long they are.  I like them to be ankle height but they are longer than that.  Possibly that's because of larger size, so I just scrunch them down."
3.0,"This was good quality, but had to be sent back because the top was way too small. The pants fit great though."
3.0,not a miracle worker but helps.
3.0,"So the material is super comfy, it is large and baggy, HOWEVER, I just feel the shoulder cutouts are WAY TO LARGE for the arms. When I put the shirt on, I'm not a larger guy, but I just feel if I lay down, or even twist the wrong way, my nipple hangs out. If you're into that, this is the perfect shirt for you. I 'm not a fan of spaghetti strap tanks. So the image of the skull looks great, material is soft, but the arm holes are beyond larger than anything you'd need unless you were Russian Popeye."
3.0,"I was really hoping the fan would provide more air circulation in the mask, but it did not."
3.0,"Material is thin. It's like an average Kirkland (Costco) shirt. It is correct in terms of being made for tall men, but certainly not worth the $60 price tag. I can get 2 Duluth shirts for the price of one of these."
3.0,Material was shiny black like when you iron something black and burn it.  Maybe mine was a return that someone ironed too much?
3.0,"Very disappointed about the color of the top! That was one of the main things I loved about this bathing suit is that burnt orange looking color shown in the picture, and when it came, I thought they gave me the wrong one because it's like a coral, reddish color. It's definitely NOTHING like the beautiful color that the picture shows! 🤨 I was so excited for it to come too because it was set to arrive just in time for me to go to a beach trip that was planned for the weekend. Very very disappointing! I don't know why, but that color made a big difference in how I felt about the bathing suit!! ☹️ I got the one in blue too, because the style is so cute, and that one came looking exactly like it was shown. The blue one is ADORABLE! 💙 Glad I chose to get both of them!"
3.0,"The hippo heads were a hit for a game night themed event I attended.  However, they definitely need some tweaking to be able to wear them.  The noses do not puff up well on their own...I took a seam ripper to the lining and stuffed the noses of the hippos with cotton batting to make them look right.  It was easy to do, but a bit frustrating that it had to be done.<br />The beads are the cheap flimsy plastic and they crush easily...in fact, many came partially crushed in the package, just from sitting in a tight package up against the other beads.<br />Was fun to wear, and our outifts were a hit, but definitely be warned that you'll need to do a little bit of work to make them look good"
3.0,This dress is super cute and my daughter loves it but after first wash it had two holes in the neckline. Ordered a replacement. Will repost after washing it.
3.0,I like the material but the size is not accurate.
3.0,"The heated peotion of the socks worked well. However, if you are active the battery pack is very large and the switches will get bumped to a lower setting or the cord comes unplugged from the battery. If you are just sitting for hunting or fishing they work well. If not I would purchase a heated sock with a smaller battery pack."
3.0,"This is cute style wise, but it has no stretch or give so will need to order size up if bigger busted or curvier. I have the L, thinking it would be fine since loose, but the arms were extremely tight and the bust area smooshed my bust in."
3.0,"I like the look of these leg warmers but they do not hold their shape very well.  I don't think there's enough elastic to them.  You wear them once and they're stretched out.  For the price though, they're fine."
3.0,might have to alter it. its too large<br />medium size seemed like xxl size
3.0,"The skirt is adorable. I love the color, and it fits well. I’m 5’2” and 105 lbs, and I ordered the small. The waist only had to be cinched a tiny bit. It falls 1/3 of the way down the thigh on me, but remember, I’m short. No issues so far.<br /><br />I wear skorts because, quite frankly, as small-framed as I am, I still have big thighs that tend to chafe in the ridiculous South Florida heat and humidity (which is most of the year).  The “shorts” part of this skort are a very thin attempt at a “biker short”—literally thin. There is not enough substance like biker shorts to hug the thighs and stay in place; these have an extremely narrow hem that rolls up and takes the rest of the leg with it (not to be too graphic, but all the way to the crotch) providing no protection; I might as well have just been wearing a second pair of underwear. Very disappointing. I sent it back.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a skirt with an undergarment attached, without regard for leg coverage, this is your skort. If, however, you are like me, and need coverage at least over the top of the thigh, opt for something other than this."
3.0,"The way they shipped it, very nice & classy, but the wallet itself seems very poorly made. I'm not too impressed with it, but for the price i paid for it, it will just sit in my drawer."
3.0,4.5 stars
3.0,"The fabric is not at all what I expected, other than that it is super cute and fit exactly as expected!"
3.0,Gifted this to my stepsister for Christmas and it was beautiful and she loved it but it broke in a month. Not long lasting at all.
3.0,The bust area was a bit too big for me.....I will take it to the tailor and see what he can do with it. I am 5&#34;2 and weighs abt 120lbs.
3.0,I wear a size large shirt and am large in my chest. This shirt hangs/cut so low that a sports bra is all you have to cover the boobs. Straps of shirt are long as well.
3.0,I’m only 5’2 and 148 pds. I ordered medium and the romper kept creeping up into my butt lol. Not comfortable. It needs a little more space in the torso otherwise it would be 5 stars.
3.0,Nice jacket. Runs big. Get a size smaller than what you usually would.
3.0,Beautiful dress but the sizing was a bit off. The small I ordered was small in most areas but was incredibly short and not proportionate. Good if you plan of wearing leggings under but not my style. Slit was also very revealing.
3.0,"The shoes look great, but once you are on the for a while the area in the back where the zipper is rubs against your foot. I could only wear these shoes with bandaids on my ankles."
3.0,"Bought for my mother in law , she had to do some sewing to make it work. Size was way off ( too large ) and it didn’t fit as expected around waist"
3.0,Ordered a large (normally wear size 10-12 dress) and it's too small.
3.0,"Cute bracelet and different, fun design. Shipping was a bit longer than expected. Made in China a bit disappointing to find that out when received."
3.0,"If I had a proper fit I think I could have given it a higher rating. did not itch, and was pretty worm. but would only cover the very tips of my ears."
3.0,theyre cool. cheaply made. material thin. already ripped out the butt
3.0,Little bit bigger than my size
3.0,If you love showing off your imperfections these would be great. They run small & tight. They are super long. I am 5'10 and they cover my butt but snug. Not snug like it will hold you in- but snug as in it will show all rolls & rolls you didn't realize you had before. If you are going to buy these- I would go a size or two bigger.
3.0,"At this price point I thought this was made of Top Grain leather but it is not. It is Genuine Leather, Which is fine but other brands make Top grain leather straps at this price point that look and wear better in my opinion. I ordered 2 straps from Bartons at the same price and the quality difference in the leather is quite noticeably better with Bartons. Other than a bit overpriced for what you get the strap is fine, and shipping was fast as well. Doubt if I would purchase again unless this strap was priced around $10.00"
3.0,Very thick material but for someone who normally wears large pants these fit like mediums.
3.0,It has great look - texture & compliments my watch. However the strap is very long.<br /><br />Strap measures normally from buckle to watch ... but the length of 'tail' is over 1.5' longer then other watch bands - making the appearance ill fitted.
3.0,I bought a pair of size 32 blue and accidentally bought 2 pair of the black in size 32. One pair of the black fit pretty well while the other black and the blue were too big. So the sizing is off. I kept the black pair that fit well. They are very comfortable and nice for the winter weather but they smell so bad like chemical factory. I've washed them twice and they still smell very strong like chemicals.
3.0,"Loves the look of this fabric; however, it started to fray after only a couple of months."
3.0,It fits perfectly and nice color but u need something under is Bc it’s see through
3.0,The bracelet is nice but the charms broke off within a week of wearing it
3.0,Mi wife is 33 weist and 34 hips what size she can wear
3.0,"One pair was broken upon arrival. They are cheap and cheaply made, but can't expect alot for the cost here. Product is just OK."
3.0,It’s was too small in the waist area. Doesn’t work for people over 6 feet. The bottom fit like capris and the sleeves were too short
3.0,It came too small and was disappointed to return had to pay shipping cost
3.0,Good as a mask but not good as a ear cover
3.0,Don't buy the white one unless you like see-through material .  The material is very thin and it runs a bit small.
3.0,"I have wanted small drop pearl earrings for years and I thought these looked exquisite online. My husband bought them for me as a V-day gift. I do really like them. They are well crafted beautiful pearls. The size is perfect. I wanted a classic small drop earing, large enough to be noticed but still understated that I could wear day or night. My one issue with these earing is that they are not secure. Every time I put them on I am afraid I will lose one. The lever backings are loose and not secure at all. It is such a shame, I have barely worn them. I plan to take them to a jeweler to be reinforced but if I had known that was necessary I would never have purchased them."
3.0,Purchased medium fits like xs
3.0,"The image on the site is of a solid band. However, what I received has a 1 inch teardrop opening on both sides of the straps. I would prefer it to be solid as pictured but keeping it since the leopard design makes it less noticeable. Other patterns or solids would make this more visible and in my opinion, not in a good way."
3.0,bought for my fur babies. thought it would be pretty durable but my fur baby found a way to tear off pieces.
3.0,Wore this for the first time and it seemed to fit well.  My arm though felt weird.  It was pinching my underarm. Until I looked in the mirror at the sleeve I noticed the stitching was sewn incorrectly.  Everything else about the top is wonderful except for the right sleeve.  I am hoping to return this and exchange it for another but not sure after I wore it for 2 hours.
3.0,The underwear is a very small fit and flimsy fabric.
3.0,"It fits really weird. That was the only issue. The material is fine, though."
3.0,"If you are looking for virus protection I cannot recommend this hat/visor combo! It is good as a rain hat or sun hat only. The visor does not cover your nose and mouth when you hold your head in a normal position - it would act like a funnel opening if you cough or sneeze and all the germs would blow straight out onto other people. If I tilt my head down then the mask can act like a virus shield, but we cannot keep our heads down all the time."
3.0,"Listen... this jewelry is SO cute, and hasn’t stained my ear, but it hurts like HELL to sleep!!!!! I have been sleeping with my arm under my ear to notnlet it presss against my pillow but sometimes I guess I. My sleep I shift and I wake up with a horrible pain. Definitely not the earnings fault but I don’t feel comfortable taking it out every night bc in scafed the hole will close up or I’ll forget to put the jewpback in. SO cute but think wisely because rhis is ridiculous pain to be in for a stupid piercing 😭"
3.0,Very nice just a little big.
3.0,Great fit but it shrinks after washing
3.0,"nice belt, the box is super fancy... the black markings on the leather look pretty fake up close, and the belt stretches about 1&#34; when held at the ends and pulled lightly.  so expect it to stretch out a bit!"
3.0,"Liked the color, the length and fit but have ti break them in a little."
3.0,"The designs look good, but these don't fit my Neff glasses.  After a lot of useless tugging and almost breaking the frames, I actually cut the threads in one side.  What? Why? They looked to be sewn just like the way pants pockets come sewn, so I thought perhaps there was a formed pocket of neoprene that the frame fit into.  Nope.  You need to have small/Tyndall temple tips and temples to fit these.  I'm sewing up,the ones I got and ordering another to use on skinnier glasses.  Definitely not user friendly.  I'll see how they work if i ever get them onto glasses.  I emailed Ukes a few days ag with a question but never got an answer.  I guess at these low prices there's not a lot of operating margin for service - or even for a basic description online about the maximum dimension that the Ukes strap will accommodate."
3.0,It looks nice but is so thin that I'm afraid to break it.
3.0,These came two in a pack. One pair fit great but the other is too short and too big in waist. I am planning on giving the black pair to Goodwill since they do not fit me.
3.0,This is a nice shirt but the size was off!!!
3.0,This item did not come with the helmet harness at all. Other than that it seems fine.
3.0,Make sure you order a much larger size. My daughter is a size 7/8 and I had to order her a 14 to fit.
3.0,Sometimes you can buy smaller but these are not for shoe size over 10 as advertised. I wish thy would make queen size!
3.0,the posts had black on ends? The ends of snowflakes had some black on them too?
3.0,I like its my deceased mother's birthstone. It's pretty.
3.0,This item is so tiny that I thought it was pure sterling silver. Not worth the price or the effort to return it !!!!
3.0,It’s okay it leaks a little bit by the squeeze handle but nothing that bothers me too much. The thing that’s annoying is a couple of them only let out tiny spurts like there’s no pressure behind it. So 4/6 work good not too bad
3.0,"This top is beautiful, but I is long enough to be a dress.....too much material at the bottom. Once it is tucked to look like the photo..... there is a lot of bulky material to gather underneath. I’m a size 7/8 5’5”, and I can almost pull it a couple of inches from my knees."
3.0,"The necklace was really cool and very true to the picture, but had a dent in it and the dent looks weird because it's off center"
3.0,My grandson wears a size 10 so I ordered him a 9/10 and they definitely won’t fit him until next year . Too big .
3.0,It's cute enough but very cheaply made ~ can't really expect much for the price however! Good enough value for what it is!
3.0,"These cover up the nipples, but if you are large breasted they won't be holding the girls or pushing them up. There were no instructions and I wasn't quite sure which way was the top and bottom. They held on fine, but didn't stop any movement. I am not sure these are the same as the original picture I saw online since I thought there were going to be tabs at the top to help pull and keep my girls higher."
3.0,"It's big and boxy! You must have curves to pull this look off! Otherwise you look like your in the circus! Bozo the clown comes to mind! But if you fill out the dress it's super cute! But order down a size or 2! I'm 5'5 170lb and I ordered a medium, still to big!"
3.0,"Comfortable, super lightweight, durable, color = +5 stars<br />Material wear n tear,  non-waterproof = -2 stars<br />Overall - ⭐ ⭐⭐"
3.0,Just opened one pair of gloves and found that one of the gloves has a cut in it on the side.
3.0,"I bought this to wear my Fitbit One at night. I had to use a knife and slice the opening a little bit in order to get the Fitbit One in it. It serves the purpose.  I probably would not ever wear this during the day, as it is rather bulky."
3.0,Perfect size and looks authentic. Only thing I didn't like was that it turned pink after about a week.
3.0,"Look good , but don’t like the way it fits good around the house shirt."
3.0,the colour was not as I expected or wanted.  It was black and white while I thought it looked more grey than black in the picture and I wanted grey.
3.0,I don't like the fabric and the fit is weird. The neckline just doesn't lay right.
3.0,Got this for my nephew. He loved it. The material is slippery and weird texture. I can't speak to how it holds up in wash.
3.0,Cuter in the picture than in person for sure. Necklace is super cheap plastic and I tossed it. Shirt is very thin but soft material. Not suggested for bigger women as it does accentuate the parts you really want to be seen and if you have wide hips the frilly bottom of the shirt sits right on your hips and makes them not only look bigger but also draws attention to the widest part of your body.<br /><br />I'm keeping both of the shirts and plan to wear them with a light cardigan.
3.0,I ended up returning this item. It didn't fit well and the arm patch was odd.
3.0,A little short but very cute
3.0,"You get what you pay for. They were great when I first received them, but over time they kinda lost their value and look. But for the price you really can't beat it."
3.0,ordered an XL because we have bigger boobs and the top fits like a small. covers literally just the nipple.And then the bottoms are way too big. Glad these were running late and i was refunded my money. Very disappointed.
3.0,"Ok for a cheap wig, but sheds like crazy. The bangs are a pain too."
3.0,Fit was too tight
3.0,Cheaply made (cheap fabric material and cheap screen printing) but my 2 y/o is obsessed so I'm not mad. Definitely runs a little big
3.0,Not as full as should be
3.0,It’s a nice jacket but not what I expected. I thought it was a a  denim jacket. This jacket is a light weight very thin  material that looks like denim. It has a very strange smell to it as wel. It’s nice but not what I wanted.
3.0,It's very small for a men's small and its 100% cotton
3.0,No es lo que se menciona el producto
3.0,"Very cute, just doesn't fit well with my facial profile."
3.0,"Not very warm, picks up every little piece of lint or fiber you brush against...not at all waterproof or windproof...I would have sent mine back but I NEEDED a coat immediately so I kept it..it does fit well, but I can tell the zippers are cheaply made.  I would suggest you look elsewhere, I wish I had."
3.0,"Waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy too big/long. I bought a black one DTLA& fell in love, so I ordered this one ..one size ..same as the black one i previously bought, but this tan one fits like its for a 6 foot tall plus sized woman. I'm 5'6 135 lbs& I use this as a snuggie-type blanket inside the home. At least I found another purpose for it. Works well"
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend because I liked the design very much, when I get it I was i little disappointed: the photo in the Tee is too dark so you can't see clearly the whole theme."
3.0,Cute and tiny!!
3.0,They are beautiful. But after a while the coding comes off. The copper shows through.
3.0,These earring are OK..I have to admit they look as advertised but lack a little quality...I'm satisfied but not SUPER happy if you what I mean.
3.0,"This ring is okay but nothing great. It doesn’t look a lot like the photo. The photo makes the edges look somewhat rounded, but they aren’t, at all. What you get is a very thin, very squared-edge piece of metal with a very much stamped out flower. All edges are sharp. I ordered two in size 7 but received size 8 for both; my order also now reflects size 8– not sure why they changed that. This ring would maybe be okay for a toe ring but for fingers it’s just too thin and sharp to be worn on a daily basis."
3.0,Loved this when I got it. But after 3 months it no longer will stay attached to the Fitbit. Falling off anytime you moved your wrist or bumped it. No longer able to use it.
3.0,"I just received my bracelet, I have been so excited to get it but I am a little let down about it, It looks a little cheap not worth 20 dollars in my case 30 because I got 2 day shipping. And one of the beads where off so now I have a broke bracelet, its still cute though jst not worth 20 maybe 15 I jst wish the thing wasn't broke thats all."
3.0,"They don't fit over my rectangular glasses, and are not very stylish. They kind of look like the bus driver glasses😉. I will prob only wear them for safety glasses while weed eating. Dissapointed😔"
3.0,"The product itself is ok, but my son normally wears a size Small so I ordered a Medium.  Shirt came in the mail and it was way to small that we ended up ordering a Xl and fit him perfectly...."
3.0,"This is a good, light to medium support bra snd would recommend for smaller-busted women for support. Note: This bra RUNS VERY SMALL IN SIZING. I’m 5’4”, 135 lbs., 34B and had to buy a size Large for it to fit without being too tight (and it’s still a bit too snug). I always wear a Size Medium in sports bras, so recommend to buy at least one size up from your regular size."
3.0,The charm tends to creep to the back too often. needs a heavier charm to keep it in the front.
3.0,"The skirt is cute, but I wish the material was a bit softer."
3.0,Runs bigger than expected; will have to wait until she grows into them.
3.0,Need to advise buyers to go up one half size.
3.0,"I bought an xxl for myself. It is very short, I gave it to my daughter. My daughter is a pretty solid small and it fit her well. Super soft, wish it fit me!!"
3.0,The sizing was not correct and it was way smaller than expected
3.0,I ordered an XXL and the shirt fit tight.  Not as soft a other flannels I have ordered in the past.
3.0,I bought this for my 7 year old son who has sensory issues. He was able to chew off one corner of it in about 10 days. Although for the price it is tough to beat. Probably great for younger kids.
3.0,They wouldn't zip up but love the boots. Just returned  I'd order a half size bigger.
3.0,My mother is legally blind and the watch works well for her but she does not have the option of purchasing a smaller band to fit her wrist nor does she have access  transportation to jewelry for shortening the band.
3.0,"I love these tank tops. However, it's supposed to be a 3 pack of tank tops and I only received 2 out of the 3."
3.0,Not top quality- ended up with snags after 1st wear. Ended up purchasing some tights from an online dance store for around the same price plus had free shipping!! Don’t waste your money on this product!!
3.0,Did not really like the fit. but overall a nice shirt
3.0,Cute top! As expected. This top is well made. Thick material. Color is accurate. Sizing accurately.
3.0,"The wallet is good however the zipper wasn't opening easily . So everytime we open it or close it, it gets stuck and hardly we can close/open it ."
3.0,It's kinda cheap and chinsy. I wouldn't buy another. Especially for that price.
3.0,"Bottom piece okay, the top was tooo huge"
3.0,Much smaller than originally thought. The photo that is used makes it seem like its larger piece.
3.0,"These are really comfy but the fuzz GETS EVERYWHERE!! They immediately started shedding, and in chunks!! They have saved my feet from walking my hardwood floors chasing me round 3 kids and housework but probably won't buy again because of how ridiculous the shedding is"
3.0,"These are SO cute, but unfortunately are too small. I missed my window to return them (my own fault), so I will have to donate or give to a friend. I wish they fit because I absolutely love the style and the quality is really nice!"
3.0,Las costuras hacen que el vestido este fruncido.<br />Además el encajé es muy áspero.
3.0,"Item is a slim fit jean, but the overall look of the jean looks more like a women’s jean rather than a mans.  They were just not my sons style, For this reason I contacted the company who had a very quick response time."
3.0,Bad battery have to buy battery?
3.0,"Like the pattern on the underside of this hat. Also like the wire in the brim. Maybe it's just me, but I can't get it to an attractive shape.  It looks best when not rolled up on the  brim - but then you can't see the cute fabric as well"
3.0,Beautiful. Lightweight. Do make a little bit of noise.
3.0,"The screw that hold the legs to the frame get loose very fast and no matter how many times you tighten them, in a few days they start to get loose in a few days and if you dont pay attention, then you will end with a lost screwand one of the legs falling apart."
3.0,"I bought these shoes a few days ago. I was exicted. They're cute, a bootie but have a nice heel. I thought they'd be great. They weren't.<br />The heel was loose. I could move it slightly when I pressed on it with my hand and when I walked the entire heel moved. I don't think all of their shoes have a loose heel, but I didn't want to mess with it. I accepted the Amazon credit and went on my merry way.<br />The shoe itself is a good shoe. It's made out of quality fabric and is as easy to get on as a regular heel. (AKA: If it takes you half an hour to get on a regular heel this pair of booties won't be much easier.) You can unhook the clasp to release the slouche-ness of the boot part, but it isn't adjustable so it doesn't do much. I wish the heel would have worked right because I would have worn the heels a lot."
3.0,"The seller sent these bags to me the next day which was wonderful. But, these are thin, nylon bags. They are easy to fold and very light weight. But, they probably will not hold much weight. I'm hoping the corner of a half gallon container of milk won't rip the bag. Time will tell."
3.0,Love the card but wish the charm on the key chain was better quality.
3.0,"The dress is very cute, but unfortunately the white is see through."
3.0,"I bought these in a 14 (labelled 35) and they were too small. Hmm... I didn't have time to deal with a return so I ordered a 16. It arrived, labelled 36, but it's smaller. I thought it was my imagination, but I held them up next to each other, and the 16/36 is cut smaller. I'm going to hang onto them for the weight loss journey I'm on, but I'm really conflicted about ordering again because I have no idea if I have mislabelled 16s, or if another pair will also be too small. 😓 I'm kind of stuck."
3.0,Cute but I read all the reviews first so I knew not to dry it or it will shrink way to much to ever wear again. Also oddly the bottom sides are longer then the front and back. I also sewed all the way down the front to make sure it didn’t come open like the reviews stated. You don’t need to button it on just pull over your head. Also too loose at the waist I sewed the back in two places and I was good to go. I’ve worn it to a college graduation and work and both times I had several compliments.
3.0,It fits snug and is breathable.
3.0,Way to tiny. But nice.
3.0,"These are not very comfortable, nor are they warm for some reason.  Oh well, they were on sale."
3.0,The material is not great my niece likes it she only sixteen
3.0,"Like the style, but bought several sizing off on this one."
3.0,The leather feels great but the color is VERY different than what's shown on the picture.
3.0,"Disappointing fabric, as well"
3.0,These headbands are nice and gently in my baby's head.  The only complain I have is that the pearls brake off easily.
3.0,"Cute hat, but runs small and keeps popping off my head."
3.0,It's 100% polyester due to the tags and fabric feeling
3.0,The color is beautiful but the beads are very tiny.
3.0,"Lovely.  Great price.  ....Was my initial review however, the handle started cracking at the top, then totally disconnected, then the cross body handle hook threading...for some reason blue on one side of the handle and then black on the other side of the handle...started poking through.<br /><br />Looks nice, don't put too much in it, keep it for a special event.  The straps don't hold up for daily use."
3.0,I must've missed something because these are way bigger then I though and I can't even get them in my nose. Probably my fault but still...if they fit I would have loved them
3.0,He is a serious 14 yr old skateboarder and had holes in the soles after day 7.  They are stylish but not the most durable skateboard shoe you can buy. But you can't beat the looks.
3.0,Muy grande y la tela
3.0,Had to add blouse clip so my tits wouldn’t pop out
3.0,"I thought these were pretty warm, and then we had a string of below-freezing days and they weren't really adequate, partially because the lining is thin, and partially because the thumb hole is designed to basically always have a crack that lets the cold air in, unless you use your whole hand to hold it closed. You could do worse for the price, and it's nice to be able to get your fingers free, but I don't think a 4.5-star average is representative, as you'll probably need a more heavy-duty pair than these to deal with the colder winter days."
3.0,It's a little big but I put my hair up and it fits then
3.0,This fits boxy and is not figure flattering. The top also bubbles up when I rest my hand on my waist.
3.0,"well, on the first trip one of the seams broke on one bag, and on the other a zipper."
3.0,gave it to my son since it was a smaller fitting hat
3.0,The top is lovely but the dress is too blousy and shapeless. I tried a belt but the dress just doesn’t quite work with it.
3.0,"4'11"", 87lbs.  Trim physique.  Ordered ex-small.  1-2"" too loose at the waist.  Also a few inches too long."
3.0,I know it says blanket in the description but seeing it shown as a clothing item I focused on the shawl aspect of the description. Item is definitely more of a cozy blanket than piece of clothing.
3.0,"Size fit my foot well, but I think the comments that others made about their reliability are probably true. I've only worn them 2x at an indoor only pool and the seams are looking a little loose."
3.0,"Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this bracelet but I thought it was just ""okay"". The quality did not seem to match the price in my opinion. $25 seemed a little high for what I received. The bracelet did arrive quickly but also came with a few scratches on the front piece. Not a huge deal but I didn't expect that for the price I paid. The bracelet overall looks nice but is just not as nice as the price and other reviews made me think it would be."
3.0,Found this same shirt at the outlet for a lot better price but overall great product
3.0,It wasnt as big as i thought it would be
3.0,"It is a cute hat, but not to keep the baby's head warm. Crocheted with large holes, not tight like pictured."
3.0,The sleeve openings are rather big. I had to return it. The material was nice and soft and I wish it would have fit better.
3.0,"Good dress, but the waist line is very high. Returning."
3.0,"It's a pretty ring but it definitely looks fake. In the pictures it looked much smaller.  Also, the size is off. If you are going to purchase this ring, go the next size down from your ring size. I got a 5 and it's very loose on my finger."
3.0,Very comfortable and soft. Recommend ordering one size up because of the disparity between top and bottom.
3.0,"They look nice, but through the lenses it is a very heavy green tint which you would not expect from these color of shades."
3.0,"The shirt is a thin, lightweight t-shirt material. It's soft and comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, it did not come with pockets as advertised."
3.0,These run pretty small. Go at least a size up. Thank God these are just used as shower flops in the gym or else I'd have to throw them away if I tried wearing them out.
3.0,Pretty bracelet but doesn't help my arthritis.
3.0,I did not like this pant. It was so thin and sheer and had an awkward fit as well
3.0,"breast area was huge, had to send it back"
3.0,Posts bent unnaturally easily. Not any sturdiness at all.
3.0,Too heavy... Opening not wide enough... Straps are too short
3.0,"The design of this dress is very pretty and so were the colors but the material was weird on the bottom and seemed as if it would unweave. The polka dot material was nice, it should have been used for the whole dress. Very cute but I had to return, I just didn't like the material."
3.0,I was a little dissatisfied with this necklace and it's packaging. It came in a plastic Ziploc bag and the necklace looks cheap
3.0,"They mostly stayed on. My daughter was determined. She also broke out with a small rash Where are the grippies gripped her skin, on the inside of the socks. I bought a set for my niece, as well and they have had good results."
3.0,I did not like the fact that you could not wear it  Back-to-front because there is a unsightly seam so I returned it.
3.0,"Kind of gross. These earrings were delivered to me on time but they were all glued together, as one chunk. I had to break each earring apart. Even though these earrings are cheap i still expected more. I won't be buying these again."
3.0,Very pretty. I like dainty jewelry but I was surprised at how small the lotus actually was.
3.0,"If you have any boobs at all, it won't close very well."
3.0,"Though this is cute - wearing it a time or two, it really is not something I feel comfortable wearing. I ended up passing it over for a more softer, more comfortable, and more age-appropriate one. I think this would work better for someone younger. I likely will give this to someone else. But, the review below still applies in its general sense. It's a nice hoodie, just not as practical for my needs as I first wanted it to be.<br />--<br /><br />This Truity Women(‘s) Hoodie Sweatshirt crop top is cuter on than I thought, and better made than I thought it would be, as well.<br /><br />At just under $17 (at time of this review), it’s bargain priced.<br /><br />The material is fairly thick—it doesn’t feel like a cotton sweatshirt, but smoother feeling. There’s no cotton in it—it’s mostly polyester with some elastayn and rayon added.<br /><br />The laundering instructions read to wash it cold cycle and line dry it—maybe because of the rayon it may shrink. I don’t mind hanging it to dry as I hang other clothes, since I don’t want any shrinkage as it fits just right now.<br /><br />I wear a small or sometimes x-small in tops but this medium fits me perfectly—you may want to size up if you want a looser/roomier fit or are unsure of what size to buy. If you normally wear a small, a medium may fit you better; if you wear a large, an extra large, etc.<br /><br />I worried the crop would look too young on me, but with a shirt underneath (t-shirt long- or short-sleeved), it looked really cute on!<br /><br />This won’t keep you really warm in cold weather but it does add some layering that isn’t too heavy or bulky.<br /><br />The hoodie is designed a little differently around the neck area, and gives it a kind of stylish look.<br /><br />There is a kangaroo pocket in the front. Drawstrings at the hoodie. The sleeves are 3/4 length so it would be good for warmer weather too.<br /><br />The design is fairly simple but overall this is a really cute hoodie. I’d throw it over my t-shirt to wear to the gym, but it would look cute with jeans as well.<br /><br />I almost didn’t order it but now I’m glad I did. Soft, comfortable, cute, and something different in a hoodie sweatshirt!<br /><br />(It looks just as it does in the Amazon photo.)"
3.0,A little too big for my hand had to buy and extra extension for it
3.0,"really very pretty, not expensive..I baught a bunch of cheap jewelry to help fill up the jewelry box I baught the wife..some of the items came from china so they took a long time to deliver..would be nice if they stated it was coking from china"
3.0,I did take a pair out I deemed inappropriate.
3.0,"what happened to spax quality.  they fit well and feel comfortable, but they came with a hole in the rear end."
3.0,Arrive way too small. I hate returning items so it'll be getting regifted to a friend.
3.0,"Thinner than the ones in the store, but much cheaper."
3.0,Cheap but did the job.
3.0,"I bought this vest for trout fishing. It is a light weight vest. It does dry quickly. It does not have as many pockets as I first thought. If you like a vest with a lot of room for your tackle, this is not the vest you want. If I plan on walking the river far away from my truck, I use my old vest and leave this one at home."
3.0,"I'm not able to wear them for a whole night because they get too uncomfortable, but they look great/more expensive than what they are."
3.0,It got to the negatives where I live and when I had this jacket on I was sweating
3.0,Disappointed in the fabric.  It is very silky and not what I expected.
3.0,Purchased mine on another site for much more.  Should have waited a few weeks.  It is ok but not as beautiful as the pic. And for the price $36.00  was not worth it but this price of $24.00 is worth it.  Will wear it again and see how I feel about it.The material looks kind of cheap but I got a few compliments.
3.0,"Bought this for my 11 year old daughter. Very cute, but it was a lot smaller than expected."
3.0,Make sure items fit if not its hard to refund or return. Material is ok don't expect the best its ok for the price you are paying.
3.0,I like the shoe but they were small for my toddler feet.
3.0,"The watch is very shinny, but it's totally a women's watch. It's so light and the wrist band is very skinny plus they even send it with a pink cleaning cloth. Everything is good with watch but not for man."
3.0,It runs small. I am very particular and make sure to size.myself when ordering.
3.0,Not my favorite.  They don’t fit well so if I look down they slip down my ears and nose.  The shape of the lenses is not what I was expecting based off the image.  They look awkward.<br /><br />Even though I don’t love the look of these they do work well.
3.0,Dress was very pretty and fit well everywhere but the bust. I needed 4-6 inches more in the bust. Would be great for any one C cup and smaller
3.0,"Runs small, material is like spandex"
3.0,The turtle neck was great at first but there was a material used that gave me hives and a rash all over my chest and neck.
3.0,small hooks are ONLY good for a key ring.
3.0,Seems to be a different material now than it first came out
3.0,"It was good in regards to the charms, they are solidly built. Wore the necklace 3 times before it broke. Had to replace necklace."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this, but the fabric is horrible, it is not at all soft, and it's got a ""cling on"" feeling, a lot of things stick to it! Not a fan, unfortunately I washed it to see if it would get softer and lose the ""cling on"" feeling, so I can't return it."
3.0,The size and style is good but the wrist attachment broke within 3 months.  And it's not fixable.  I'm going for a more sturdy material next time.
3.0,Bottom of shirt has a tight uncomfortable elastic otherwise it would be great
3.0,"I wish it was a tighter snug, especially in the chest area."
3.0,It says two piece but it’s really a romper.  Very misleading. In The first picture it appears to be a top and bottom in the second picture you can tell it’s a romper but I thought it was different for each color
3.0,"Very pretty, but not sturdy. Once open, it's kind of wobbly. Disappointed"
3.0,"This product is stretchy, sheer-ish, and comfortable. But it provides almost no constriction at all. If you're looking for shapewear, this isn't it. If you're looking for comfy sheer shorts, maybe to reduce upper thigh chafing or something (they're pretty short) these might do the trick."
3.0,"I love this dress and was so incredibly bummed to have to return it, but it was like a compression vest over my rib cage and the seam lines dug into me. It hugged every problem area and also seemed see-through to a point. I wish there was a more forgiving fabric for this pattern with less constrictive seams and I would buy it right away :)"
3.0,"They were so cute in but mine got stuck and in the process of taking it out, it broke ):"
3.0,Slit is to big makes it look cheap would  be nice without  the huge hunt of fabric  missing.
3.0,"A bit flimsy, but one gets what one pays for..."
3.0,"I bought this purse to keep my phone in since I just got the Galaxy S5 and it won't fit in my girl pockets. The purse is way too small to fit it with the case on, and the phone is only about 6 inches long. It fits just fine without the case but that doesn't quite fit my needs.<br />The feel of the purse is extremely cheap and it doesn't feel like it will last very long. The black is also not as deep and shiny as it is in the pictures.<br />I will give it 3 stars, though, because it was incredibly cheap and I'll be able to use it for other things when I don't want to carry a big purse, which will be nice."
3.0,"Well made, except that the breast cups were far to high to accommodate my chest. Service was fast and the dress arrived before it was scheduled to. I'll either have to get this dress altered (if it will even work), or I'll plan to buy something else for the wedding I'm in in June."
3.0,"Ordered a men’s medium for 13 yo grandson. Item received was marked XL and was still a little tight. Really cute jacket and looks great, but would have preferred a little less tight. Good material."
3.0,"I really did try to like this shirt. I got it because I needed a shirt with long sleeves and a high SPF rating for a boating trip. When I got it the material was scratchy. I thought washing it would soften it up. It's been a year and repeated wearing and washings have not softened the shirt up at all. When your skin is tight and itchy from too much sun, this is not the shirt you want to grab to throw on those shoulders to protect your skin, it's too rough. I do love the roll up sleeves and the sunglass holder on the shirt. But the fabric is a no for me."
3.0,It bends very easy. Not for long time wear
3.0,Very cute but the cups are small in comparison with the size of the suit. I am a DDD and the cups didn't even cover half.
3.0,The pocket looks to stretch out it looks stupid<br />Not like in the picture
3.0,"Spikerking Womens Hat Faux Fur Thick Warm Knitted Cap is very cute in its style but the fur on the outside lining is coming out by the handfuls. The hat itself is a cute knitted hat that is rich in color, which is black and trimmed with fur on the outside. The fur lining on the outside seems to be sewed on in a hurry. You are able to see the seam on the outside where it was sewn to the knitted cap. I not impressed with this product but it is not horrid either. It will keep you head and ears warm while you are outside in the cold. It seems to be able to stretch to fit your head and it will stay put once you have it on.<br />This product was provided to me at no cost (or at a Discount) in Exchange for an honest and unbiased Review.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AP9WGEI Spikerking Womens Hat Faux Fur Thick Warm Knitted Cap,Black]]"
3.0,To long and lose.
3.0,Nice jacket pretty color but is has absolutely no stretch in it at all.
3.0,a little too narrow in the pointed toe area
3.0,"The bottom of the mask does not obscure the neck very well. Also, it's still very tough to see through these masks even though every supplier claims otherwise. It also has a strange indian herbal smell upon opening."
3.0,"Had to send it back, very cheaply made"
3.0,"The sizing is clearly overstated IMO. Whilst the jacket was actually very nice (hence 3 stars) the sizing was very disappointing. Partly my fault (hence the 3 stars) for not checking the sizing chart carefully, but stil,l, you would figure a 7XL would be a lot bigger"
3.0,Did not fit my face. Very small. Not true to size.
3.0,"First, I love the color and size of the wallet. Plenty of room for credit cards and cash.  However, I give the wallet only three stars for a couple of reasons.  A sachet is included with the wallet and I care for the odor and, more importantly, the wallet doesn't open flat.  I hope that it will flatten out.  If not, I'll return it and look for something else."
3.0,Unfortunately I did not receive the 4 different colors as shown. I received two of the same color. Not happy about this.
3.0,To large will sent back as soon as possible
3.0,"Colors not as good as picture, don't particularly like the style."
3.0,"Very pretty and it fit well, but the material is odd and wrinkles easily. Almost like tee shirt material."
3.0,"They fit ok, but the waistband is kind of weird."
3.0,"Use this watch for those activities where a more expensive watch might suffer damage.  Accurate time, easy to set time, day, date and alarm.  Watch band is a little smaller than I prefer, but that's an individual preference."
3.0,"Lindos, pero son muy estrechos. Son para caras delgadas"
3.0,"its cute butt poorly made, the straps keep sliding out and my purse ends up on the floor and the ears dont stand up either"
3.0,"I purchased a size up (XXL) because I knew my breasts weren’t going to fit in my normal size. I wear a 40 DD and the top was still too small in the cup area. I’m really in love with the bottoms and the cute cover up, however!"
3.0,It is not cotton. It's a stretchy slightly heavy poly blend. Not for summer weather at all or warm summer nights.<br />It also had long sleeves.  I thought it was 3/4 sleeves. Not bad but not great. I'm still debating whether or not to return it because of the price. $11 doesn't seem worth the time to do a return.
3.0,The dress pattern is beautiful but the circles landed at the wrong spot on the top half of the dress. The circles ended up right on my breasts which looked awkward.
3.0,Logo needs to be adjusted to fit the size of the shirt. Bought a 2XL and the logo was tiny compared to what must have been a small size shirt used for the stock photo.
3.0,Threads are to short!!! The backs don't stay on for long. They back off to easily!!!
3.0,Comfortable but a bit too loose
3.0,Dress is cute but the cardigan looked cheap and not like the picture.
3.0,"The good: The color I ordered (khaki) is very pretty in person.  It looks like a dupe for a well known boho brand of clothing.  It looks good with leggings and will compliment many of my shoes and sweaters.<br />The bad: The material is on the rough side. It is much longer in person and doesn't look like the same top that the model is wearing. It is very flowy, almost too much.<br />I decided to keep it because I can wear it to work with a lot of different things.  I just wish it was shorter (as pictured) and had less material overall."
3.0,"Returned. They were kind of a rough, cheap material."
3.0,This is a little to bulky but it works well.
3.0,they tiny but otherwise nice.  did I mention they are tiny?
3.0,These are super cute but they are extremely thin and do not fit comfortably.
3.0,The shorts are great even after washed
3.0,Runs VERY small. I got two sizes bigger that was recommended for my dress size and was still pretty tight.<br />Within Five minutes one of the metal loops for the ribbon came loose and popped off
3.0,It's see through. Yikes!
3.0,"While these tie clips are a good unobtrusive size, they are crimped overly tight and are mirror polished, unlike the matte finish shown in the picture. Rather than bending the clips back acutely,  I found that placing them on a mug and leaving them helped to relieve the spring tension somewhat. I think hitting them with a scotch brite pad or ceramic bead blaster will give a more subtle finish. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a shiny, high polished clip, these are a good value."
3.0,Quality is amazing<br />Super cute<br />Just Oder a size up
3.0,The belt itself was fine but the clasp broke.
3.0,Looks like someone may have own it and returned it. Would have love to get more colors but no. If I want 2nd hand clothes I'll go to a yard sale.
3.0,"Decent fit, runs small.  It semi supportive"
3.0,Really adorable but I had to give it to the kids next door because it wasn't sized correctly
3.0,"I am short waisted. Do the skirt did not work for me.  If it was elasticized, it would have been much more comfortable."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this but the ribbed knit material did not &#34;gather&#34; like it did in the picture, and I'm not particularly large-framed.  It also was not as long as shown.  It was still nice but I haven't yet found a place to wear it."
3.0,"I have had better quality watches for cheaper. nonetheless, it came quick and worked well for the amount of time it did. The battery dies quickly though, had to replace several times before I decided it wasn't worth it."
3.0,"Pretty to look at but did not like the material - feels like synthetic blanket, not like a towel"
3.0,I bought this bracelet for myself. It is really more beautifully designed than I could tell by looking at the picture.  The clasp is easy enough to maneuver that I can put it on by myself.  The downside is silver tone is beginning to turn a reddish color after only a couple days of wear at the clasp. Not sure how long I will be able to wear it  before the entire bracelet turns.
3.0,I gave this dress for stars because it does not fit the way as advertised. I ordered a size up from what I would normally wear and it fits funny. The cut is strange. One side has a very wide u-shaped hem cut out while the other side has excess fabric that bunches in a strange way and sometimes does not lay in a way that looks flattering or decent. If I wear this I will continue to Belt it and wear it with a pair of leggings if I'm leaving the house. Around the house it's fine the way it is. I ordered the blue with white stripes the colors are great it is a very vibrant royal blue I have yet to wash it to see if it bleeds into the White but I will probably do a soak in vinegar to help this not happen. I did get quite a few compliments on it even though it wasn't quite what I had expected. I would recommend ordering two to three sizes larger if you wanted to hang like it does on the model. Still can't make any guarantees that it's going to hang the way it should though.<br /> I receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"I ordered a size XL and these are pretty small. I do have wide hips but usually an XL fits me fine. I wear a size 16 or 18 (depending on maker). I am currently losing weight though, so I guess they will fit me eventually. I do love the quality and the print is so cool. I am super bummed that they run smaller. Oh well. I would buy them again though."
3.0,"Seems to be a decent belt, but the finish doesn’t hold up to even a few days’ use. Black dye is flaking off making the belt look months old after first use."
3.0,"Very nice infinity scarf, however it's more a two-tone dark/medium dark wine burgandy color w/ very little contrast...not  as shown in the photo.  Really no red tones.  Subtle, not bright."
3.0,"Pretty, but the stones are not centered on the silver behind it, so they look cheaply made."
3.0,Hopefully it will last more than a couple of washes
3.0,I love the color and price.  Fits well and adjustable.  My only concern is that the watch band connection has popped off of the watch 4 or 5 times.  But it does seems to be holding now.
3.0,"I think it’s an ok band. I just got it and not sure how secure the locking is going to be, but I hope it works. It looks nice and so far it is secure."
3.0,"These are somewhat light weight. They are cute and fit my 2.5 year old son well. I also ordered a pair of LOCS for Him and they are much better. I may have rated these higher had I not got the LOCS which are much more durable and the lenses are soooo much darker. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase but when they break or get lost I will only reorder the LOCS."
3.0,Love the watch! it wasn't what i have expected.Band to small i was hope to find a extra extension to make the band a little bigger.
3.0,Small compared to other by sane company thread loose
3.0,Super dark during the night time.
3.0,Extremadamente pequeño
3.0,"I ordered an xl and it runs small and when I put it on, the sizing doesn’t feel correct.  I would not purchase this again."
3.0,It was OK.  Took a while to get here.
3.0,"The fabric is VERY thin. The belt is one size fits all, but the bodice is very tight. It's pretty, but it will probably sit in my closet until I find someone with a tiny chest and large hips."
3.0,The front of this is very pretty. I was expecting the back to have something but it just looks like a one piece. It's a bit strange looking definitely from the side with the nice flowy front then a hard seam and nothing in the back.
3.0,It looks a little cheaper in person and the strap is thin.
3.0,Do you have a small lady head? This night be a good fit for you. If you have a normal sized man head? Too tight. The pocket for filter sticks open and filter creeps out. Ear loops are to small and too close to front so pulls on your ears. Would be good for child who wants to look like a ninja n
3.0,Glasses are too tight and push into my face
3.0,"The color I received is a different shade than the one shown, not as vibrant as the picture. I love the design of this but it is styled a bit strange having the shoulder seems at mid-bicep, which makes it fit weird because of its A shape."
3.0,They were good but they shrank. I'm not going to hang dry socks. All socks should be dryer and warm water friendly.
3.0,Pants were baggy and a little short. Not the best quality . Not horrible.
3.0,She's going to keep the dress although needed alterations are necessary. Descent quality with price considered
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e0ad10639e20fc31cc887d235c5fd27d]] I like the top a little loose but cute
3.0,"Pros: Very good looking, Very good padding.<br />Cons: Material is vey thin and easy to tear.<br />Buy 2 sizes up if you don't like very tight fit"
3.0,"This is a cute dress when you are standing but as soon as you sit down the top gets really blousy, so wear some sort of bralette to avoid flashing everyone.<br /><br />Also this is a shiny poly which I was not expecting."
3.0,Zipper goes all the way around the hood and the fabric is low quality....
3.0,Acceptable for a party gift bag and similar uses.
3.0,I thought the earrings would be what was described and shown in the photo however they are smaller than they appear in the photo.
3.0,"The dress is attractive enough, but it does not fit. I find clothes coming from China many times are too small. But after reading the reviews, I decided to get my regular L size since I am not large busted. However, it is still too tight across my chest and the material has no give to it. So unfortunately, I had to send it back."
3.0,I order 2t-3t for my 2 year old she is average toddler and its fits great its soft but inner fabric is made of very light material not great quality its good for play time but can't use for any occasion.
3.0,Same ring review weak in color but nice quality build for earning.
3.0,"The fit was true to size and the colors were nice. However, I wish the inner padding was better quality. They do not offer as much support as I had hoped."
3.0,"Nice dress, however the bust was way to small for me, even though I ordered the size listed on the chart.<br />will be returning"
3.0,Really see through
3.0,"I would love it, if it were what I ordered.  I still can make it work, however.  I ordered &#34;Black&#34; which is pictured with pink stones.  I got the black mask with clear stones, which is listed separately."
3.0,Band isn't adjustable
3.0,This is a pretty average shirt. I only bought it because of the elbow length sleaves. Other than that it is too clingy. I won't be buying any more nike products though.
3.0,So there is plenty of color selection but the gems are lose and seem like they will fall out. Also 1/3 of them I am unable to remove ball without pliers.
3.0,"On the very 1st day of use, the zipper of the back compartment started to unravel!  I couldn't use the pocket because the threads were getting caught in the zipper!  I love the purse, it's roomy and very organized and kept things I needed for traveling right next to me on the plane.  I will get the zipper repaired, but I thought Travelon was made better."
3.0,The gray and red pair fit as expected.  The black pair wouldn’t even come above my knees.  I would have given a five star but I can only wear two of the three pairs.  That is a disappointment.  But the other two pair fit great.  Therefore I will only give 3 stars.
3.0,"This dress had a nice fit and style, but I didn't like the feel of the material and it was a bit clingy."
3.0,STUNNING BUT CAN LOOK SOMEWHAT FAKE UP CLOSE
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress but it was just too big to not look like a weird church/nightgown combo. I'm 5'7, 140lbs and I usually get dresses in a medium but I recommend sizing down for this one.<br />Even in the picture I attached, I'm holding the dress in the back because it just had too much fabric. It's a cute idea but just poor execution. I would size down.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions or click the ‘Helpful’ button if you found this review to be helpful 😊"
3.0,Very large case.  I'll use it for something other than glasses.
3.0,After 1 day of use the Velcro on the shoe starting lifting.  My son loves these shoes but due to the Velcro issue he will not be able to out grow the shoes.
3.0,It was too small. Didn’t fit true to size.
3.0,"I was surprised how this top fit. It was shorter in the front and the sleeves weren't very long. The elastic at the sleeve cuffs was snug and hit right at my wrists. The sheer leopard material sleeves also have the seam on the outside so it looks as it is inside out, but its not. It was nice looking for work but the material snags super easily. You have to be very careful to not brush up against anything. I also was wearing a white tank top underneath and you could see it through the top, but with just a beige bra it wasn't as noticable."
3.0,"Love the too, super comfy . The bottom fits a little weird but it’s still comfy. I think I would prob need a medium bottom and small top."
3.0,My fault - I reordered a larger size
3.0,"The roses on the suit are not embroidered like advertised. There are roses but they are printed on, not the same ones as the picture and extremely pixelated. The back strap only has one adjustment, a metal clasp that doesn't stay together well, meaning I'll have to find another way for it to stay on. I ordered a medium, the bottoms fit well, but the top seemed like it was a larger size. All in all this is a cute swimsuit that I'll keep (some sewing will be required definitely) but I wouldn't recommend anyone else to buy this."
3.0,Feels good but no height.
3.0,I think this would have been cute if it was true to size. I ordered a large which is what I normally wear  but it was too tight. If I could have gotten an XL it probably would have been much better.
3.0,Awkward proportions for a taller child. Straps were extremely long and torso too short.
3.0,"I don’t think you could make this “sweater” out of a cheaper material. It feels like the softer side of velcro. The stitching is like a Halloween costume… and I’m terrified to wash it, and I won’t dare dry it… I feel like it would literally melt if it touched heat. It is not warm AT ALL, it’s basically see through. I know it’s like $10… but why even waste resources of any kind to make this sh-t?"
3.0,"I would suggest get 1 size larger then you normally would, other than that no issues"
3.0,I like these socks but they do feel somewhat small and a little short. Probably won't buy again.
3.0,"A LITTLE BIG BUT I LIKE IT OK... Nice fabric.....color is a nice blue, probably wouldn't buy again but cant say its a bad buy....fits lager than expected, I could have sized down...."
3.0,"Picture was deceiving, but it's a decent necklace."
3.0,I really like the style but The material is thin. The XL is good for my hips but the top is a little lose but overall I like it.
3.0,I wear at 10 or 12 so I ordered a 11 way too small.
3.0,Would be perfect but chest area too small
3.0,"I'm a 36/38 waist. I got these in a 2XL. Seems to fit right.<br /><br />Advertised as 95% cotton. Now, I'm no fabric expect by any means, but there is no way in hell that is correct.<br />I would bet a significant amount of money that the claim is wrong. Look at my picture. Have you ever seen a cotton fabric that is grey on the outside and white on the back?<br /><br />Anyway, they work fine for gym shorts. A little sweaty in the usual areas because of that polyester greenhouse effect, but overall fine.<br /><br />The looks are subjective. I would have personally chosen to go without the separate panel on the lower leg and left out the color block. Just me though."
3.0,"they are not as oversized as in the photo. a little misleading. they do fit well  on this face. they do not have the silver lining look to them as in the photo. personally, i would not buy these again."
3.0,Beautiful ring and timely delivery but the stone is loose. It's too bad it is because the ring is gorgeous
3.0,All other coats a large is fine. This coat an XL was too small. Returned it for an XXL. Had to go up 2 sizes. It was tight in the shoulder<br />Upper back region. The coat looks and feels great. It just runs super small!!!
3.0,Likes:<br />Print design<br />Multi-layer fabric<br />Filter pocket<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />A bit small for adult male<br />Could never get a good fit
3.0,"Love the way this looks but I haven’t been able to wear it because I can’t get it open, even with bow opening pliers. Which makes me hesitant to put it in for fear of pinching/bruising or difficulty getting it out."
3.0,"Maybe they had run out of the smaller buttons that are in the picture? I ordered a black top, and the buttons are sand colored (almost white), and twice the size of the picture. They were the same on the arms. It looked so jarring and out of place, that I just returned the shirt. Shame, though, because the fit was good."
3.0,Very cute but the clasps break easily.
3.0,I’ve been struggling to remove the links to adjust the band.  Only one has come out after several days periodically trying to use the tool that cane with the band.
3.0,"I think the pj's are very cute but the fabric is rayon which is known to wrinkle, even after you pull straight from dryer. The ad sounded so good I thought I'd try it anyway. Sure enough I had to iron. If you iron be sure to iron it inside out to avoid marks. Pj's are soft n comfy but I've bought man other pajamas in the past that are much softer. Next time I'll stick with all cotton."
3.0,zipper is on the left and on men jackets the zipper is on the right. Other than that the jacket is good
3.0,Great look but smaller than expected
3.0,Wife loves and the dress fits perfectly. Noticed fraying as soon as it came out of the packaging
3.0,"This is a fine product. It has a cheap feel and appearance, but I bought it to replace wearing t-shirts. Be careful when you wash it, do not put it in the dryer or put it on low or it will shrink. I would make this purchase again, keeping in mind that I am not looking for a high quality fabric. It's sheerness gives it a cheap feel."
3.0,"Like it,but not as fitted as in the picture."
3.0,Arrived on time. Low quality but but it was what I expected when paying $10 for a watch.
3.0,"The Note 4 has a slight bend as it meets the side frame of the phone.  We have all seen other Note 4 glass screen protectors not cover edge to edge properly.  The &#34;Crown&#34; edition from BodyGuardz for the Note 4 gave me some hope, but did not deliver.  It's not all together their fault, but I can't imagine they didn't see this in testing or assumed some customers wouldn't mind or care.<br /><br />You can see in the attached photos there is a part on both sides that does not fully attach, leaving a wavy line of clearance between screen and glass.  You can't see this when the screen is on so it may not be an issue for some people.<br /><br />I like the company and the product for other phones have been pretty solid.  I gave 3 stars because I think some may not mind the gap but also customer service was very helpful and sent out a 2nd unit for me to try (no charge or shipping).  Unfortunately I had the same result shown in the pics.<br />My feedback with percentages to ‘weigh’ the values of each:<br />Pros:<br />-Love the packaging that also helps guide the install.  Pretty much takes the guess work out of getting it lined up. (40%)<br />-Customer service top notch. (40%)<br />-Glass cover while screen is on looks fine. (10%)<br />-Crown is arched and fits perfectly.  Matches well with my black Note 4. (10%)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-My OCD won’t let me live with a section of glass not fully touching and its quite apparent and shoddy looking when screen is off. (80%)<br />-Price is up there. (10%)<br />-Install/quick guide has &#34;IPhone&#34; in directions.  Who knows maybe they printed up 40k pamphlets and need to use them up. (10%)<br /><br />Tips:<br />1) Turn off all fans/air movers in the room, these types of things are dust magnets.<br />2) Use canned are to clear your work area.<br />3) (Most important) Use canned air to blow out packaging dust from the guiding frame and product prior to removing the first adhesive protector.<br /><br />I will leave it on for a couple of days just to see if it somehow magically resolves and attaches fully, will update my post if it does."
3.0,"Got an XL, non pocket, biker short. The fit and length. Not too compressed. Material is cool and breathable. Not gym squat approved but good for home workouts.  For the price, I am keeping to wear around the house as I WFH."
3.0,"Bought this as a part of a birthday gift for someone older who will just have to trust me when I tell him what it says!!! It's cute but the charm itself is so tiny (1/2 an inch in diameter in total). It's not really possible to read the words without using a magnifying glass, so it's not going to have the impact I'd hoped for."
3.0,"From my girlfriend:<br /><br />The only thing that was not as expected is the color. It is definitely rust, not orange like it looks in the picture. I was expecting the fabric to be light and airy since its a summer jumpsuit, but it is a thicker poly. Normally thick, quality fabric is what I look for, but for a tank jumpsuit I don't want thick, non-breathable fabric. The fit is awesome though. I'm 5'2"" and 120 lbs and it hits just above my ankle, which works.  Love the overall design, just not the muggy fabric :( Even though it looks super cute, I still may return because of the material."
3.0,"Had to return them, the lights from one shoe stopped working after the first charge...But the idea is great, my 3 year old loved them."
3.0,"It's a cute shoe and I loved the simplicity of the style. It was also fairly comfortable except for the strap between the toes. The more I walked around in them, the more the straps dug into the flesh between my toes. I wondered if the discomfort would go away if I broke the shoes in, but I didn't want to take the chance. The shoes were also heavier than I expected (I guess I'm more used to cork or lighter material)."
3.0,"Here is the thing. Depends on your baby how he or she want to wear it or not. when my son started crawling, the pads move from knees to down of his legs. If I tighten up it leaves the red marks. Overall material is good"
3.0,"I was so anxiety to get this ring, I love all things paws. However, I was disappointed by the size of it. It's so narrow the paws are hard to see ~ it looks like a wedding band."
3.0,"Just like a lot of others have indicated, this really needs a camera angle adjustment.  If you put it on naturally, like a headband, you are going to catch all the skyward action, but very little in front of you.  You can compensate for this (high on the back of your head, low on your forehead), but even still, it tends high.<br /><br />Probably works better on a helmet (haven't tried that yet)."
3.0,"Nice looking ankle bracelet. Some of the rings on the chain broke off the second day I had it, but it was long enough that I can still clasp it shut even without the bit of chain that I lost."
3.0,"They are okay.  I was hoping for them to be a bit longer.  I was not able to wrap them around my neck a few times like the picture.  I thought that took away from the look.  Otherwise, good product and they seem like they will hold up well."
3.0,These fit very well but a long blouse is necessary for the white pants since they are not lined.
3.0,"The pocket on the scarf was a nice size, but even my Samsung Galaxy S7edge was too heave to keep the scarf from becoming noticeably long. Like something was weighing it down. the scarf itself inst as bulky as anticipated, the fabric is rather limp. Wouldn't advise purchasing. Just keep your coins and buy a dress with pockets like KORSIS instead."
3.0,I got these for my husband and even the 3x were small. Not very roomy for lounge pants
3.0,The shorts/overalls seem okay but the onsie material is very strange. Kind of shiny like silk but more stiff. Doesn’t seem like a material you would normally put on a child.
3.0,It adds smoothness to my silhouette but doesn't do much in the way of slimming. I'm a slender person who is just in need of toning but it still didn't help.
3.0,Sweater is very thin and easily seen through.
3.0,"Some of these had &#34;Victoria's secret&#34; on the inside label, and some did not. Wtf??? These are absolutely NOT Victoria's Secret. The listing doesn't claim that they are, but I found it bizarre and off putting that some of these claimed they were.<br /><br />They are soft and come in fun colors, but definitely order up a size. These come from China and don't quite match American sizes.<br /><br />(I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion.)"
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress. However the bottom is too small. The flowy skirt does not cover black skirt, it shows half of it at all times and the top is too small. There is lots of spillage. I bought a large because of the reviews and its still too small. For reference I am 5’8 152lb 36DD Medium/Large top size 8 jeans<br />Update: bought the xl and made minor modifications to close the breast area (too revealing for my taste) and it’s a perfect vacation dress. Still three stars for the pain of trying all the sizes and having to sew it shut."
3.0,"If you like polka dots, this is your dress. If you work at a Mexican Restaurant, you need this. It fit small, and I found the sudden need to eat tortilla chips."
3.0,"Boots were the easiest to put on my dog that I have ever purchased.  Did not hold up well.  The toe seam came out of one of the boots the second time they were worn.  The other three are coming loose at the seams, I will have to patch them all. They were worn in -40 wind chill weather and they seemed to help my dog's feet adequately.  For ease and warmth I'd give them a thumbs up, for quality a thumbs down."
3.0,"Nice color and fabric, although it is a little thing. Definitely fits small, I would order a size up. Going to return mine due to sizing."
3.0,LOVE THE DRESS BUT EXTREMLY SEE THROUGH.
3.0,Just a little.watm material for Florida
3.0,My glasses didn't fit so I had to return.
3.0,Makes me look larger
3.0,"Very pretty, definitely meant for small size person."
3.0,"This dress is super cute and I love the style, however the bust runs suuuper small. I’m a small 34d and the top four buttons would not close in the size large. If you’re bigger busted this is not the dress for you."
3.0,It's ok. Nothing spectacular.
3.0,There is a large string that looks like it should lace up and the top fit is strange and waste higher than in the picture.
3.0,Not black. Definitely navy blue.
3.0,The bells are beautiful but the do not ring.
3.0,Decreased quality on the closure...
3.0,my brother said itlooked like a x-mas shirt
3.0,"Purchased for my niece. I don’t think these will last too long, but fine for playing dress up."
3.0,the skirt looked like it should have... but was so short my bottom hung out the back side. there is saving money and then there is this.
3.0,Didn't Cover the whole head
3.0,"Fabric thin, poorly made.<br />I returned this dress."
3.0,Very pretty but the lens color eventually scratched off.
3.0,"So based on the seller's description, I was not aware that this is a bluetooth enabled hat as well as a night hat.  The hat is cute and fit my children well (and actually fit me as well!) It is warm.  However, we found the bluetooth control box over the ear to be very uncomfortable and as we have no need for it, we used a seam ripper to remove it from the hat entirely.  With this modification the hat is very comfortable.  So the hat itself is a win.  That being said, it you want to use the Bluetooth function, it does detract from the comfort.  We were interested in the light function and the light has both pros and cons.  On the up side, it is rechargeable and comes with an appropriate cord that bust be plugged into a usb port (outlet adapter not included). Has 3 different light modes - 2 brightnesses and a flashing red light. On the down side, the light functions are much less bright than a standard headlamp operated via AAA batteries.  So we find this product useful, but not optimal.  Incorporating the hat into a beanie style hat makes it more comfortable and user friendly, but the quality of the light is less than we hoped for."
3.0,Shirt was cute but fit two sizes too small.
3.0,Small for a large
3.0,The cigar mask is large enough for an adult male.  I noticed an off smell to the fabric though.  Other than that I’m satisfied.
3.0,"Well, you get what you pay for.  These are very cheap boots and DO look cute.  However, they don't last long.  About 3 weeks after my girls wore them and they started to sag and droop.  I didn't really expect much for the price though."
3.0,"Dress came quickly. Looked just like picture.<br />Material was stretchy and textured.<br /><br />Returned it because it was much too large on top. Fit around my hips and bottom just fine, but was too large and floppy up top."
3.0,"This watch is for a girl who is already confident in telling time because the numbers are hard to see. It looks great in the picture, but when you get the actual watch, you really have to study it, if you’re still learning how to tell time. So, we decided to return it because our daughter is just learning. Everything else about the quality, etc. was quite good."
3.0,It ripped fast
3.0,"It is nice and soft watch band , I bought it to replace the rubber band of my Pulsar Swimming watch , I feel the rubber band is too big for my small wrist"
3.0,"I bought six of this shirts as a gift for my wife, but it fit to large, the size chart it's a kind of wrong."
3.0,"Nice dress... but made for a VERY buxom woman!  WOW!  Even a 36C didn't fill the gaps in the top of this dress. A size 8 is what was ordered, and it fit in every other area perfectly... and a 6 would have been too tight, but maybe fit the chest.  Maybe this one was cut wrong, but whatever the case... we returned it."
3.0,Oh my gosh! I don't even think this would fit a 4 year old
3.0,"Unfortunately the strap ripped the second time I used it.  I needed it for my niece's sports games-and literally only had my phone and wallet in it.  I was able to mend it, but it was definitely originally put together poorly."
3.0,"The size are not for regular, small sized people."
3.0,Side pocket not big enough for cell phone. More color options and another pocket needed
3.0,Too tight for my foot
3.0,"I ordered the 3.0 tw earrings.  They are pretty and big, but still appropriate size to look real.  They look well constructed and had lots of sparkle.  I wore them twice and noticed one of the stones felt loose.  Sadly had to return them."
3.0,Like the belt. But
3.0,"Nice tops, but run really small.  Fabric is thin."
3.0,I ordered a medium and the overall fit is good buy it is Very short/tight into the armpit. If I had ordered the large I think it would have been too big overall.
3.0,"The design is cute, not what I ordered, but I can give them to a freind. I just dont like the smaller frame for me. They look bigger in the pictures. I would have given more stars if they had sent me the correct pair. I just didnt return because I felt my friend would really like them."
3.0,"Not Ropalia.  Cute sports bra, I wear it a lot... but not the same as a Ropalia"
3.0,"Son muy cómodas y prácticas para mi trabajo, solo que se descocen muy rápido, no son durables, lo siento!"
3.0,These tops fit well but they are see through so I will be returning.
3.0,"Definitely get what you pay for -- sewing quality is very low with serged seams on bow, droopy bow showing back of silver pin, and neckline interfacing pulls up and out. It will have to be hand-stitched to compensate for these problems. Bought size 8 for little girl who loves it though."
3.0,Este tipo de joyería debe ser de rosca interna
3.0,"The bows fell off within a few days, I super glued them back on and they are fine now."
3.0,Price was great for basic deck shoes. Size ran large.
3.0,Nothing to classy here they are nice cuff links the only problem I had is that it is smaller than expected.(The link is fine and it fits the shirt no problem). But besides for that there are no complaints.
3.0,This review is for the wrap dress. It does not fit in a sexy manner and the hole for the wrap belt is way too large (visible still after securing the dress in place). The sleeves fall at a weird length- it is not quite balanced when off the shoulder and doesn’t look better on the shoulders either. Overall the material is good for this price point. While it does have stretch it is not thick enough to hide anything either. I have some scar tissue on my stomach and the lumps are clear even if the dress is not see through. It doesn’t look quite like what I wanted or expected but it also fine enough to serve the purpose of the event I purchased it for.
3.0,I have a couple chips missing
3.0,Color wasn’t exactly what I thought. But purse is very functional.
3.0,Didn’t fit right and looked kinda funny on head. But a decent hat
3.0,Everything says that this runs very small - and to order three sizes up. I'm a 30GG cup size and I usually squeeze into an extra small because otherwise I'm extremely petite. I ordered a medium - I can squeeze into the cups of the top but it's a lot more provocative than I hoped. The bottoms on the medium are so small they didn't fit my little sister.
3.0,it's cute but looks kind of cheap
3.0,"A very sturdy and well made garment , but order a few sizes up. I’m not that tall (5’9”) but still too short in torso measurements"
3.0,They are all too small.
3.0,Quality of clothing is not good
3.0,"It fits on the body nicely but the chest/bra part was too big. I needed a strap or something, it kept falling off. I will get it altered but I did not wear this gown. It is lovely though"
3.0,ok not like photo
3.0,These aren't that great. The balls on them aren't that shiny and it's cheaply made. i am disappointed as my daughter wanted these and they don't look like the picture. I wish they were nicer looking.
3.0,You get what you pay for have it for 3 days and 6 of them the balls have broken off
3.0,"The fit was very good, just not as flattering as some of Velvet's pieces with a more structured waist.  The fabric was a bit then and the seam went right up the middle of my body, accentuating my belly too much.  I'm 5'6""-  39.5 hips, 33.5 waist and 37 bust.  Shoulders fit well and the tie hit right at my natural waist which made me think a while before I returned."
3.0,These are nice gloves but there is no way they would be good in temps down to -30°F.  My hands were cold with temps down to +20°F.
3.0,Cute boots. My 3 year old loves them. I don't expect them to last long already had to stitch part of the zipper as it was falling off.
3.0,Pretty  style and color. Did not fit as I expected.
3.0,I didn't really like the fit of the top and the bottoms looked weird because the stripes did not line up .
3.0,Fit well and very comfortable. Had a giant hole under one of the arms. Ordered XXL and recieved an XL. Had to return and reorder which was a pain.
3.0,"Advertising as a 24mm, it's slightly larger. I had to remove the straps pin tube, and cut it down with my dremel for it to fit in my 24mm watch. The leather sits very tight as it was the same with as the pin tubes. I'm hoping over time it wears in.<br /><br />Appears to be good quality. Feels rugged and thick. It looks sharp, just as pictured."
3.0,"Eh. Smallish, and as a result they have a tendency to ride up too. Won't buy again. Men's boxer briefs are much better constructed."
3.0,"Pendant was loose from the setting when I opened the box. Also the box was cheap-looking. I would not recommend it for a big significant occasion, but is nice for tokens of affection."
3.0,Good quality. Thought they would be larger. More of a medium size. The picture gives impression of a larger earring.
3.0,I had very high hopes for this product.  It looks so beautiful and when you open the package you feel the material is a good quality material. Not to sheer and does not seem like it will tear or break.  The down fall is that it is tiny! The panties would fit someone of a small statue but my 8 year old daughter would not even fit into the top if I tried it on her.  I would not recommned this product unless you are an exsmall.  I wish I could give this product more stars but I cannot as the description of the size is inaccurate and I feel that it should warn people of that.
3.0,The red on the shirt looked faded. The engaged couple loved them so I kept them. Would not advise you buy it.
3.0,"This mask appears to be a good quality item, but it is not in the same shape as shown in the product pictures. This mask is straight across the top and bottom and does not have any curves as indicated in the pictures. It does have pleats, so it will expand to fit over your nose and chin. just not like the picture when laying flat. The bendable metal piece at the top for conforming to your nose is barely noticeable and not always located in the center of the mask."
3.0,A bit flimsy but cute
3.0,"I adored these earrings but the post/wire was a little hard to get through my ear and when I went to take them out, very difficult because how much my ear had swollen. They really are beautiful and I really loved them but ended up having to give them to a friend who wears heavier earrings so these will work for her. :-("
3.0,color was lighter then shown
3.0,"Good quality, but short battery life"
3.0,Cute but doesnt withstand a 4 year old very well. After only a couple wears there are several rips. And headband broke right away
3.0,"I really like the look of these leggings, but I have to pull them up all the time and they make a lot of noise when I walk. I’m a girl where my thighs touch and rub and I have to say I think these are going to be strictly House leggings because of the noise."
3.0,"Super sturdy, virtually impossible to get money out without key."
3.0,"had to purchase another watch and the band is too big, can't win."
3.0,Shirt is not for the well endowed. Shirt cups too small. Shirt is thin.
3.0,Loved at first but the support boning inserts dug into sides of breasts.
3.0,"They are nice looking, and my boyfriend loved them, but one of them was broken when we got it, and one chain broke shortly after getting it."
3.0,"Used for a costume, was a little smaller in width than i wanted it to be"
3.0,"This would be totally awesome except the armholes are too small for my child and are chafing under the arm.  It is very thick, so probably not a hot summer item.  But my child says it's like walking around with a blanket.  If the arms were cut a little bigger it would be a 5 star."
3.0,"The blue was a pretty blue, but I found the Velcro was tight even when I loosened it, and I’m a size 8"
3.0,Not squat proof if you have a round rear. I would have sized up and see if that did anything at all but ‘eh
3.0,Wore the dress two times and the second it ripped completely down the side next to the zipper. I loved this dress and couldn't believe the quality that it ripped like this. It's too late for them to even accept returns.
3.0,"I honestly bought this dress with minimal expectations to begin with since I’m not by any means a small girl (5’10” around 245) and it’s online shopping. It very well could be my fault, I didn’t see a size chart. I opened the package and two pieces fell out, one being the part that covers you up, and the other was the lace part. The ...undergarment? is very see through (you can maybe tell in my picture, I’m wearing a black tank top underneath) and while I could technically wear it as a dress, it would be extremely short.<br /><br />I am however giving it 3 stars because it makes a super cute shirt when you bunch it up a little."
3.0,Alittle too small for me but it works well as a stopwatch.
3.0,"The lens is great, so I'd buy other sunglasses from these folks.  The arms are metal, and I have scratched my ears a couple of times putting them on."
3.0,"I am a size 14, but could not fit into the size that was supposed to fit me. I'm also 5'6&#34; (the average height for American women), but the suit was a little short on me. It made getting out of difficult. Granted, the small size it partly due to the fact that I have large breasts, but it really was too small. I have a pretty small waist compared to my top/bottom, but the zipper wouldn't close. So, if you are petite, this will be very cute on you. I was not impressed with the fabric--that itchy, stretchy knit stuff. If stuff like that doesn't bother you, it really did come out cute. The belt looks nice. Only other note is that the buttoms are a cheap looking gold. Either replace them with your own or (better yet) Manufacturer, find better looking buttons. It sounds like I'm ragging on it, but I'm really not. If you are a small woman, it will look really cute. If you are average or bigger...find something else. I would post a picture of what it looked like on, but I'm not going to post with that much skin showing...<br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review and feedback to the manufacturer."
3.0,"The print is not that great, a little blurry.  It has the connectors to be able to adjust the size. The front is silky fabric."
3.0,Cute sweatshirt but runs small!
3.0,"The good: the bag is wonderful. I was able to pack enough clothes for three days (jeans and thinner shirts etc), toiletries, and still have some room. The wheels work fine unless you try to use just the two back wheels. The bottom would scrub trying to operate that way but not as easy to operate on an incline with all four wheels down.<br /><br />The bad: I love the design of the bag BUT it would NOT fit under the seat. I had to pay $65 to check the bag with Spirit.I would not suggest the bag for under seat because airlines have gotten smaller under seat areas. It definitely will not fit on Delta or United window seats.  If you want a smaller bag as carry on, it is fine. Under seat, too large."
3.0,"Top is a little too long, and the material has a lot of strings coming apart."
3.0,"Al parecer el error fue mio, al creer que lo que muestra la foto es igual, pero ni, el vestido a pesar que lo compre una talla más grande, para que me quedara suelto, queda corto y al pegarse al cuerpo por el tipo de tela, los bolsillos se salen, osea quedan fuera, por se una tela que estira no da lo que dice la foto de quedar suelta al cuerpo. Soy alta y delgada, y sin embargo no quedo como esperaba, la tela no me gustó."
3.0,"Got these for date night with my husband and the adhesive wore off in the middle of dinner. I really loved them up until that happened. As a reault, I  don't use them if I plan to be out very long."
3.0,"The bracelet arrived on time.  However, the bracelet runs too big for my 6.5"" measured wrist.  I will probably give it as a gift now.  I liked the design though."
3.0,Excelente Material ; pero corren grande
3.0,arrived with lots of unsown openings throughout ...had to sew all the gaps before even wearing the costume.
3.0,Nice dress but the size small was too big on my waist.
3.0,"I ordered one as a gift, and one for my daughter. They are cute BUT the 2-3T one didn’t seem to print right and you can hardly see “wishes” at the bottom. Unfortunately, this one is a gift and I don’t have time to return it for a replacement before the party. The 1-2T one that I ordered is fine. Both have a horrible paint smell that I’m hoping will go away once washed."
3.0,This was too flimsy. Seems it might break easy
3.0,It ran pretty tight.. but my husband and has a big head lol.
3.0,Material is thin but works perfect for what I need it for
3.0,"Not as pictured. The grey version, at least, have the unsightly black fingertips on thumb and index. Might be warm and ok for touch, but they're going back."
3.0,"Cheap material,  doesn't look like same material as in picture"
3.0,This dress was shorter than I expected (I'm 5'4 and it stopped mid-thigh on me).
3.0,They ride up. Don't stay in place
3.0,"Very nice, looked nice on bracelet."
3.0,"These pants are the most comfortable, best fitting,  wear anywhere pants I’ve ever had.<br />But - the fabric pills, like a sweater…"
3.0,VERY SMALL GLASSES
3.0,Upon receival of the product I have noticed two major issues with the picture. The &#34;C.C&#34; is actually folded up and not on the bottom rim. Also in the picture it looks like the cap is composed of two colors and in person it is definitely one color. I'm still going to wear it but I probably would not have bought it upon knowing what I know now.
3.0,I have purchased several shirts with this similar cut and style that I have LOVED but this particular pattern... not so much. I guess with the pattern on bottom and the solid top it made me look pregnant when I'm not. I guess the two fabrics put together in that way looks like a maternity shirt. It is super comfy though!!! I will keep them as night shirts because they are soft and kinda stretchy and roomy.
3.0,This is a really cute purse. It is much smaller than it looks in the picture. That is my only disappoint
3.0,"Absolutely love this necklace. Although like the other reviews have stated it did come broken. But it wad easy to fix, one of the small connectors wasn't tight enough but with a little squeeze it can be pushed tightly together. It also has a rustic look to it and isn't completely shiny which I'm so happy about. Came way before I expected it to also."
3.0,Got a large and the sleeves are too tight
3.0,The reviews hyped them up a lot they are good material but after a few washes I feel like they look dingy I’m wearing them to work in the health care field for reference.
3.0,seems ok for a quick Halloween costume
3.0,Bulkier than I expected.
3.0,"They are cute, but notherwise really what i was expecting. They seem more like mechanics hardware really.  For the price, you can't really beat it.  However, the wait on the product was long.  I probably could have gone to the garage and found some rings that would do the j I b in half the time. :)"
3.0,"Don't know why it mentions Fatshark in the description, the snap buttons won't fit through fatshark strap slit. I took the original snaps off and used screw type instead."
3.0,"I only love a few of the options in the order. They're good quality but some are just too big and chunky for my taste. The picture makes them all look pretty small but some are so long they rest on my upper lip! They had a long delivery wait and were set to arrive after 4 weeks. My order was somehow misplaced or lost so after 6 weeks I contacted the seller. They were excellent at getting back to me and shipped me a new set for free the same day. It still took 3 weeks for those to arrive. So in all it took over 9 weeks to receive my order, but now that I have them I'm very happy with them. Complimented all the time!"
3.0,"There is an elastic band in the waist not listed in the description that is about a size too small making the waist fit like mediums, I stead of larges. The material is to die for though so soft to the touch, and the print is super cute too... it's all one print, not different prints stitched together, as well, incase anyone is looking for a stiches legging look."
3.0,"Fabric is quite sheer and very synthetic. Definitely requires ironing. Not for very large chests. Otherwise, looks like the picture."
3.0,"The ring is ok, I am going to jeep it, but colors are not as they look in the photo,the red stones are too pale."
3.0,They were too tight had to return them
3.0,very small and delicate. It came shipped very tangled.
3.0,Unfortunately half of the clips had came unglued from the flowers.
3.0,"The leg compression is great, but the space for the foot is too small. I ordered the XL & I wear a 11 mens."
3.0,A littler smaller than I expected.  You may get wet with this.
3.0,Color was not as it appeared in picture. More of a reddish purple than purple.
3.0,"I love the fit of the dress, and it’s incredibly comfy, but I bought it to use as a nursing dress because the description said it “buttons up”. The buttons are just for decor and *not* actually functioning buttons. I’m disappointed that that was not made clear in the product description and I won’t be able to use the dress as intended, but I’ll go ahead and keep it because I won’t be nursing forever and it is cute."
3.0,Too tight grip too well
3.0,The fabric  was really nice and costume was very comfortable but I had to return it cuz it ran a little tight for my 8 year old
3.0,Tried a medium and large...the chest part it just too big. You need boob tap but then you can't get the top down. Cute if you can make it work but i was not able to.
3.0,i was little disapionted
3.0,"I ordered the short Robe , as seed in photo. But What I Recieved Was A Long Robe, that is not what I Ordered"
3.0,The color is not as bright as the picture shows. It more dark and moving them shows the bluish color. They are very pretty and fits snug on my face. i love the lens they are very good value for the price of the sunglasses. would recommend for decent summer wear.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount to leave my honest review.
3.0,"I ordered the khaki belt, and it is in fact gold. Well made but I don't really have much use for a gold belt. Will return this for maybe a browner color. Should really dial in on these shades."
3.0,Cool watch. Got 3 stars because it fades very fast. Light use and is already turning Grey
3.0,The clasp breaks easily but I changed it out with one from an old bracket and it's my new fav bracelet
3.0,Very cute but magnet fell out of the red one within the first wear.
3.0,The chain broke as soon and I put it on...not made strong enough even though it looks strong. But the cross is nice quality.
3.0,This is nice loose very veryh thin though thought it would be darker but a good shirt
3.0,Tight sleeves does not fit as picture
3.0,Makes them stay put !
3.0,Cute..very thin material though..i read all the reviews and bought a size bigger and fits well.
3.0,My daughter is super tiny and still it is small on her. Not great quality.
3.0,Could use more spandex or lycra. During the day the toes seem to slip up
3.0,"It seems to be a good bra, but it is smaller than expected."
3.0,Sizes are difficult to determine based on photos and item I had didn't fit in  charm I desired.
3.0,made no difference in my pain level or my husbands. was hoping it would help with my arthritis in my knees
3.0,I really love the design but it's too small. After reading other reviews I went a size up but the top still ended up being pretty tight. The bottoms fit fine but the red stripes are a bit more orangey than in the picture. I'll still wear it but I wish the fit was better
3.0,"The colors and style is interesting looking and accurately depicted in photo. However it is a very awkward fit. It is described as a small, but I am within the waist specs that the product description included, even so I find it uncomfortable to wear. Particularly in the crotch, I feel like any leg movement will tear the seams open. I guess the length is a bit short too, they are more cropped on me than in the picture, my inside leg is a 30&#34; Oh well I guess I can give them to a more petite person."
3.0,"These are lightweight, which is good. After 1st use the hook came off the earring. The writing is only on one side and it turns towards your cheek so u can't really see the words unless u position them then stand still lol (like I did for my pic...lol)"
3.0,Literally arrived like this. One of the lenses looks scuffed and there was a lot of lint as if they've been out of the original packaging. Also only one of the arms had the protective film. Other than that they have been horribly mishandled during shipping they are very cute and high-quality.
3.0,"Cute, but much shorter than expected even with ordering a larger size. Not really a dress."
3.0,"Important Considerations:<br />I'm one of those people that looks at the pictures and the basic information of the item then skips down to the customer reviews.  Because of the pictures, I was expecting this bag to be much much smaller, just large enough to fit my 15.6&#34; laptop.  My laptop fits in the pocket, but the elastic strap can't fit over it.  Honestly, when I carry this backpack, I feel like I'm trekking with a tent on my back.  Keep in mind that I stand broad-shouldered at 5'6.  Some reviews say it is somewhat big, but I blew them off thinking it wouldn't be huge.  It is HUGE.  Carrying it by itself is heavy.  Also, the backpack looks funny without books in since the leather is only in front, not on the bottom.  The leather is a chocolate black-brown and likely not the color you see on your screen.  Still, I have kept it since I ordered it right before school started and didn't feel like returning it.  No fault of the seller's.  They have disclaimers about the size and color.  If you are reading this and haven't read the seller's full description, I strongly encourage you to read it all.<br /><br />Positives:<br />The black hides dirt and is extremely versatile and sophisticated.  Just the right placement of and number of pockets!  The bag came well-packaged with a cute little tag.  This bag will definitely hold all my books which is a good thing.  I just wish it didn't look as big and bulky as it feels on my back :)"
3.0,"Pretty, but the pin part forse not hold. It fell off me 3 times. Not reliable, unfortunately."
3.0,These are more party favors for decorating than they are functional visors for working outside or hiking.
3.0,It hugs you and very soft.
3.0,"they are comfy, but NOT at true 3x/4x.  I have not decided if I'm keeping them or not.  So disappointing."
3.0,It's  a lightweight T-shirt. Material quality looks good enough. But the size is problematic according to the sizing information. It's big and loose than expected. I wish I ordered one size smaller. I am out of the USA at the moment and cannot return it. The T-shirt will wait on the closet perforce.
3.0,"Since my gym class started this semester, I have needed a workout jacket, and I found this one. This jacket is good, but alas, it is not to my fullest expectations. I have organized my thoughts by category for your convenience.<br /><br />THE FIT<br />The jacket fits me like a glove in the best way! I am 5'4, 125 pounds, have a 34-35"" bust and a 27-28"" waist; the medium was perfect. I ordered according to the size chart, and I recommend you do the same. It is accurate. However, I will note that the thumb holes are very uncomfortable. I feel like they are digging into my skin and pulling my thumbs; it is pretty unpleasant for long periods.<br /><br />THE FEEL<br />I do not care for the feel as much as I do the fit. The jacket has a cheap swimsuit-like material, and I had higher expectations for $35. It is not uncomfortable, nor is it super comfortable. It is just meh. You can probably do better than this for less.<br /><br />WORKOUT<br />I have yet to use this jacket in my class, but it is a sturdy jacket from the feel of it. I do not have any concerns in that regard. I will use it tomorrow and update the review if things change.<br /><br />CONSENSUS<br />I probably would not recommend this jacket. It is on the pricier side for something that is, all in all, just average. It fits amazingly and is very flattering, but its overly apparent flaws overshadow that. I recommend you look elsewhere for a better jacket unless you desire a specific color."
3.0,"Shoes are incredibly durable, but they are so high, they feel platform-ish..... I wouldn't want to use them for walking around the neighborhood.  Just to take the trash to the bin."
3.0,They fit smaller than the size they are supposed to be
3.0,"I really wanted to be pleasantly surprised by the quality, but definitely was left disappointed with these glasses because they feel so cheap. The style was great, but overall I wouldn't recommend the eyewear from this brand to anybody unless you are looking for a disposable pair of sunnies..."
3.0,"I have several pairs of the Amands shorts. which I love,  but the ""light blue"" ones run tighter at the waist band, changing the fit."
3.0,Top is tight fitting and bottom is big. Gives you a few extra pounds in the mirror. No one wants extra pounds!
3.0,Returning item because fabric is heavier than I expected. I also did not like the built in mittens.
3.0,Love them! Using them for my destination wedding. But they came a little tarnish on certain areas. That is the only issue I had.
3.0,Very comfortable but the material pills up quickly.
3.0,Look super cute but doesn’t stay closed well.
3.0,"The sound quality is good. However, within a week later the charging port just started to fall off and break simultaneously. You're better off with something a bit more expensive."
3.0,It fit but I didn't like the material. Giving it Way.
3.0,"las botas estan lindas, pero la parte del himpé están algo ajustadas"
3.0,"really cute!! I'm usually a small. ordered a medium, wish I ordered a large, but ganna keep it."
3.0,"I am honestly surprised with the quality of the frames. The nose pieces are metal, which are great for people with sensitive skin but not very comfortable. The glasses do provide a little bit of blue light protection. I have another pair of blue light glasses form the doctor and they are MUCH STRONGER than these. The lenses has a weird wave effect when light hits them. (see the picture)  Overall.... 3 stars, OK, but I wouldn't buy these for heavy computer work."
3.0,Dress was a little long on me. Fit just right for the size but the neck area wasn't right.
3.0,the snaps keep unlocking
3.0,It is cute. But not for curves it did not fit over my butt
3.0,"Ordered a Large, but really need a medium (unfortunately available sizes are quite limited)  As noted, the  phone pocket will NOT fit an iPhone 12 Pro that any type of case on it.  If you have an iPhone 12 Max there isn't any chance of it fitting."
3.0,Love the fit and size of the xl but feel cheap!
3.0,The writing is incorrect. It says half hot on both the sleeves where as it should say half hot half cold. Material quality is as expected.
3.0,I'm normally a size 8 and ordered the S/M. It was HUGE. Also - did not look much like the picture at all. The cowl neck was very awkward. I was super disappointed.
3.0,Just did not like how it looked on me. The black color blocking was larger than it appears on picture.
3.0,"Fit Not True To Size, SIZES RUN SMALL!!!!"
3.0,I like them but not liking that the brown looks too much like the black. May have been better if different shade of brown.
3.0,"I wish there would be size written anywhere before I bought these. They too small for me. I couldn't try them, but they look nice. Colors are bright. I'm sorry I cannot provide more info on how long gem stays inside or how skin reacts to them.."
3.0,This item was purchased for grand daughters. When I received them was disappointed in how much smaller they are than how shown!
3.0,"Definitely not titanium.<br />I ended up with a reaction to the post in a few hours. Ears were red and itchy.<br /><br />The gems were very shiny though, so if your not super sensitive go for it!"
3.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to order an extra large. I wear a size 8 and it fit good. The top however is very padded so being a 34C, it definitely gave me some cleavage. I'm 5'9 155-160. Was a little snug on the leg openings, had to stretch it out a bit."
3.0,Buttons don't even make it a full day at work other wise cute
3.0,Cute swimsuit and good price. I ordered a size large. It runs a bit small.  Didn't realize until after I washed and wore it that the bottoms are a size medium so check the tags.
3.0,Was too small. Better for fitting women but still small.
3.0,"A perfect nightgown.  I would not wear it without a slip outside.  Soft and thin, like an old tee shirt.  great if you like wearing pajamas all day.  i do, so i like them, but it is not cute like on the model.  It is a baggy, thin tee shirt, longer in the back and comfy.  not for wearing outside, unless you like to show everyone what you have, or don't have...<br /><br />if you look like the model, you could wear a burlap bag and it would look cute and stylish, so its always hard to tell...<br /><br />I personally wear this dress, top, whatever, when i am really tired and pair it with my husbands baggy old sweats that feel like the softest thing on earth.  Aaahhhh...."
3.0,"They are just a little to tight in the claves but I have big calves so I really can’t complain and they are longer than expected but I have short legs so that’s to be expected lol as far as the patch work I believe they really make these different each time, they are from China and look pretty much Identical to the picture except some of the patches are in different places than in the pic but that’s fine, over all I’m very happy with them but not overly impressed"
3.0,"Cute photo bomb shirt.  Quality is OK though it's quite expensive for what you get.  Despite the high price, the shirt leaves little extra room we wanted to ensure good fit after washing.  Didn't seem good value for money."
3.0,Design will probably wash of fast!
3.0,I have hats from this company that I like a lot. This jacket was a bit of a let down to me because I assumed it would be a lot warmer. It has the thinnest layer of wool on the inside of the garment making it just a base layer on cold days or suitable as a jacket when it’s a bit cool out. It’s well made though and I still like the company a lot.
3.0,"Grrat material, awrsome look. Fits small, go an additional size up"
3.0,"It's comfortable and cute but it came crumpled.  I kept it since my daughter liked the unicorn and other charms that came with.  It's been a couple of months, but it stayed crumpled."
3.0,It's a nice tutu but didn't look like the picture. Different style.
3.0,2 sizes bigger and still to small and i ordered xlarge my size normally
3.0,Not thick material. Very short in the length
3.0,Wore once during indoor basketball practice. Fell once on the gym floor and a hole ripped in the knee.
3.0,"These are functional and cute cut.  They run very short and tight in thighs.  The waist band fits true to size so is not tight on waist.  I am 5'6"" 120 pounds and not built thick at all and found these tight in my legs.  They are still wearable if I don't mind how short they are but it is border line for me.  If you are unsure or don't like shorter or tighter things definitely size up.  Especially if you are planning on using the tennis pocket to hold balls functeionally"
3.0,"Misleading description!!!  It says 5-pack, but only comes with 3 pair.  I now see where the images says 3 in tiny print, but I went based off the description.<br /><br />The socks themselves are great, so I am giving one star for every pair I received."
3.0,For the price I was expecting a better quality shirt. It looks as is displayed but the shirt quality is very cheap...so I feel this was a little overpriced.<br />I did get it on time etc so no issues beyond shirt quality. I got a large  6'5 205lbs and besides for the shirt being boxy it fit ok
3.0,"This dress is very pretty and the fabric is soft and flowy.  BUT, this dress runs extremely small.  Sadly, I could not wear it, but if you're interested order a size larger.  Good deal for the price!!!"
3.0,"Good size and very nice for the price.  Happy with the purchase overall.  The clasps are a little difficult, that's the reason for the three stars."
3.0,Dress is nice but very big. I should’ve ordered a size smaller than I normally do.
3.0,This broke after a few wears of gentile use.
3.0,Good concept but breaks too easily
3.0,These are very heavy weighing..when hiking walking you need as little weight to deal with as possible.
3.0,"It was pretty long but I scrunched it up a little at my hips to make it look shorter, Material feels ok.  Nothing too special about this top but I'd say it's worth the cost being under $10."
3.0,Very thin stretchy material. Soft material. Oversized for me.
3.0,It fit kind of loose and the material was a bit odd. I think I was just expecting a more cotton type of fabric
3.0,Didn't last as long as expected them to.
3.0,I recently bought 6 dress for my aunts bridesmaids and the dresses are beautiful and as I expected them to be. The only unfortunate thing is that two of the dresses we got were too big for two of the bridesmaids and I’ve tried to exchange the two large dresses for a medium size but I have not been successful because they are out of “M” sizes. The other sad thing is that I can’t contact the seller directly.
3.0,Material it’s great I ordered an xxl based on the comments and it was too big I wear size 14/misses
3.0,Too big in one area and too small in others. The fabric feels weird.
3.0,Clasp busted a month into it. Sad considering it's so damn cute. :(
3.0,"One of the tubes was great, the other had a leak in it when we tried to pump it up it lasted 15 mins."
3.0,"This sweater is ""okay."" It is nicely made for an inexpensive product and would likely look okay on a Zoom business call. The sleeves, however, are entirely too long and the knit is too bulky to cuff."
3.0,"Great lenses, but clip can't be put on glasses while driving.  Have to take them off first."
3.0,"It's a cute dress and I really like the style. But it's VERY thin. I don't know if I'll be able to wear it to work because of the material. It's definitely not worth $20 so I might return it.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'5, 36-29-42 and I ordered a large."
3.0,"The quality is good, but dang are these bars big! I'll admit, I have petite ears (I'm a small woman), and these look comically large on me. The upside for the zigzag bar is that I can use it without the balls and the bar will stay in place. Without the balls, it doesn't look half bad."
3.0,This shirt fell a bit short for me. The material feels a bit cheap and the lacy part is really cheap and thin. The material is synthetic and just doesn't feel great on your skin. It is true to size and I do like the pattern of the print. I wish they would have used a better material for it. It is very thin so perfect for hotter days at least.
3.0,"Cut off my circulation for months and they didnt stretch out even a little bit. Other then that, the durability and material is 2nd to none. Wish they didnt cut off the circulation."
3.0,Black is not black. It is charcoal gray.
3.0,You get what you pay for. It &#34;looks&#34; ok but you can tell the metal is pretty cheap.
3.0,Nice belt. Too bad it broke after a month.
3.0,The chain was not as good as the rest of the set.
3.0,"This costume is cheaply made, but what else can be expected for the price? The very front plaid panel isn't really red- it's more like pink. The front panel is a really really thin fabric. The bow on the front fell off before I even got it out of the packaging. The packaging was pretty bad-- it was in a bag triple wrapped in tape. The color is a really bright red- almost like a santa outfit. It's actually not that short. It's cute for the price."
3.0,Cheaper matetial. Product arrived with missing button on a pocket. Yet the shorts are very comfortable and are easy to pair with a graphic tee for a good look.
3.0,This is a nice jacket didn't have a lining which l thought it would've  had fits nice soft and colors are nice and muted but would be a good coat for really cold weather
3.0,The colors were off and the pictures are misleading. They are actually navy blue and have pink not red hearts. The pictures show that there are words on the hearts but there is not.  The quality is great but they do run small. Size up.
3.0,Little bit too long for me .<br />but fast shipping thank you.
3.0,"The look, design, and finish are great, but the cut is bad around the eyes and too small. I have to close my eyes a little so the edges don' t hurt my eyes."
3.0,"I love the design, I love the colors and soft material. But keep in mind it's that clingy thin material that showes every jelly roll. It is definitely a womens cut. I got an XL and its certainly long enough but I wish it was wider. Also, I can see my bra through it."
3.0,"Style and color is exact what I wanted, one came broken in each package I ordered which was disappointing."
3.0,"Manufacturing is alright, screw post on flower is attached crooked, makes it awkward to screw on. Otherwise exactly as described and super cute."
3.0,not the best quality but decent for price purchased
3.0,Se siente muy suave i sobre todo abrigado
3.0,Other organizers could be more useful
3.0,"Saw this dress online and read the reviews and thought yes I’m gonna love it, when I tried it on it was way too big I weigh 120lbs and 5’7 thé small is more like a Med/large."
3.0,After a couple of washes they seem to of stretched out.
3.0,I returned this robe because it was too big and ordered a smaller size. Unfortunately it wasn’t available in blue
3.0,"lenses came out on first wear popped right back in but, get a the job done"
3.0,"Runs smaller than medium, but it's very pretty. Order a size up."
3.0,Its a cute little costume however it runs a little small
3.0,should have gotten extra large
3.0,"They were thinner than I thought they would be, otherwise they were fine."
3.0,"Cheap material that was too small. Luckily my wife was able to add some fabric and make it bigger. On the other hand, the mask is great."
3.0,Hinges to ear pieces are too flimsy...I do not expect them to last too long.
3.0,Great for a gag
3.0,"This is not a dress, it's a long shirt. The size I got fit as expected. It was very loose, great since I wanted a boho look. The arms were pretty tight but I do have larger arms, so that was ok. It was just way too short. Even though the body was very loose and draped, you could see the crotch area. I don't think the next size up would have been long enough. BTW I'm only 5'4&#34;. Typical woven poly material, soft but wrinkles easily. If you want a boho tunic, try this out.. if you want a boho dress, skip this unless you are very petite."
3.0,The dress is very long & I am 5’6”.... to the floor!  Also runs large!
3.0,"A couple of pair of the glasses showed up with scratches in them and I'm unable to wear them.  For the few that don't have scratches, they are doing the job."
3.0,"The material is quite thin with questionable quality and sized too large. The blue I got has faded noticeably after 1 wash. I should have taken a medium being 5'5"" and around 160lbs. Note, it will shrink in the dryer."
3.0,Its soft and pretty color but doesnt fit as expected and I ordered a bigger size than I usually wear
3.0,"This dress has a lot of potential if it was made a bit different. Ok, it's just a bit see through, but the problem is that the sleeves are too balky which makes the body unaltered. I wish this dress had different kind of sleeves. The bottom part is nice and sexy, although you can't really see the leg as much as shown on the photo. At the end, I ended up retuning it."
3.0,The dress is nice and pretty but the stitches at the waist came out easily on the first wear  suggest that the manufacturer does a double stitch so the smocking is strong or use a garter underneath the breast line. for he price it was fine  would have to send mine to a tailor to rectify.
3.0,Cute but small.  Very costly.  Not sure it I s worth the price.
3.0,Liked long sleeve tshirt
3.0,Color and fabric dont match the picture! It's nice but disappointed in the color. Much lighter than the picture.
3.0,"These insoles were bought for a new pair of Doc Martens boots for my husband, but were a complete DISAPPOINTMENT.  Just a cheap insole imitation; no orthotic support, no cushion, no comfort from these Dr Martens Comfort Insoles.  Will continue to stick with AETREX ORTHOTICS for quality, support & COMFORT."
3.0,Metal is definitely cheap and seems fragile
3.0,The ring is the best art of the necklace if u do wear it a lot the string will give out mine broke after wearing it a few times.
3.0,"Quality is decent. Remember it is cheap, so don't expect a higher end bracelet here."
3.0,"I might be the first to leave a lower rating. I know they say thin in description, but these are ultra thin. I can see my feet, they are basically transparent. They are also cut a bit small."
3.0,Good fit. But I do not like the color of the lens to brown.
3.0,Looks cheap but I guess if you don't look closely they would be ok
3.0,"It’s a nice fabric and a nice tank top, but it looks very different than the picture. I’m going to keep it but it’s not worth the $$ that I paid for it."
3.0,I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter and the pendant was just too large on her lityle neck.
3.0,Runs short and little small.<br />Buy one size up.<br />The polka dots are bigger than appears in the picture.
3.0,they don't feel like 78% merino wool more like 78% spandex and polyester
3.0,This is okay... however I found that for my head there was way too much bagginess in the back. If it was a couple inches less the fit would be perfect for a slouchy winter hat.
3.0,"It looks incredibly tacky in person.  I was hoping for something nice, but, I doubt I can ever use it.  It just looks very cheap.  Thankfully, it's not a necessary item, I bought it because of an idea I had."
3.0,These are very nice. I ended having multiples of the small ones but I had purchased for the dangles. They have worked out nicely for the price.
3.0,Doesn't really give the room to wear a layer underneath and a lot of work to get them off when they need to go potty.
3.0,"A little too small.  Also, the stitching started coming off on the outside after just 2 washes.  Nice big pockets though.  Not very high waisted.  Cheap fabric."
3.0,Pajamas are ok. Just ok.
3.0,"The item came as described and was cute, but it was in a plastic envelope, and inside it was really wet.  I have no idea why it was so wet and it freaked me out, so I threw it away!  Hopefully it was a fluke!"
3.0,"They're cute, but they're turning 😒"
3.0,Too thin and not wide enough
3.0,"This dress is comfy but some of the seams at the top seem like they are in weird places so it doesn’t fit in a way that makes it feel flattering or like something I could wear out. I kept it and will wear it around the house on hot days, but I don’t love it."
3.0,"Because of reviews I ended ordering a very big size, it doesn`t fit me at all. The quality is fine because for a non expensive swimsuit. It looks like the photo"
3.0,"My mom loved it! She was very pleased with her gift. The only thing is the material is kind of cheap. You get what you pay for type of deal. If your willing to spend $80-100 for a Prayer Shawl then I would go that route. Overall I am happy with what I purchased, and so is my momma."
3.0,It was a comfy shirt but way too big looked sloppy on me so I had to give it away to someone else.
3.0,These are lovely and made my granddaughter very happy with me.  With multiple holes in each ear these really stand out.
3.0,Thin and dainty- get the right size or you’ll lose it.
3.0,"Fits as expected. However, the front hang right & the back to the left."
3.0,"Item came on time and seems to be of good quality, good design and looks good unfortunately the soles on this slippers are NOT slip resistant as stated on the the description. I have hard wood floors throughout the house and my son was slipping and falling all over the place. I'm returning this item"
3.0,A little tight and looks brassy. My hair got caught in it. Not as brilliant as the picture shows.
3.0,"Once again, the size chart on Amazon does not need the size chart for the company."
3.0,If you don't wear glasses then it is a good product. If you do then your glasses will fog up. It's not designed for those who do.
3.0,Hat is okay
3.0,The material is VERY thin and hugs every curve and imperfection.
3.0,Very thin fabric but it has pockets!! Yay for pockets!
3.0,Not to my wife's liking but it was my mistake in ordering them.
3.0,"Very very tiny, but the sentiment is there..."
3.0,"I wouldn't consider this a &#34;light weight&#34; jacket...also the drawstrings are super short. I think it will start pilling soon and I've only washed it once since purchasing. Not the best buy, but it works."
3.0,"These aren't as stretchy as they could be, even though they are listed as the same materials and proportions as the SWAK tank tops. I wont buy again."
3.0,"I need a sparky bracelet for my wedding and thought this would work but it won't. It's not tight the way I wanted it to fit, the rhinestones don't go all the way around the bracelet and it's not that heavy. It's better as costume accessory or for a night out. Shipping was fast and it was packaged really good."
3.0,The fit is good. I thought it would be a little thinner but I like the material!
3.0,Very cute and well made but extremely thin. Not sure how warm it will be for my little girl.
3.0,Comfortable and durable but wrinkles easily. Fortunately I wear it for physical therapy and my therapist doesn't judge me by my wrinkles.
3.0,"It's a lot bigger than depicted in pictures. Wasn't to happy with the size, but it's kinda pretty."
3.0,"Not as good as used on YouTube, does ok but does not remove everything like in videos. Less than 24 hrs of dirt, still very visable"
3.0,"These are not well made. They came missing a screw. They are cute and great for throwing around, but not high quality."
3.0,It's okay. Not crazy about it.
3.0,Color in the picture is way off. I thought it would be more of the bright color like the picture but instead its a light aqua color that i'm now afraid to wear because it will get way too dirty.
3.0,My daughter said they were too tight on her legs.
3.0,"I had bought these after I had my second baby for working out with the bonus of them being tummy control and I loved the side pockets. Over all they are comfortable and the colors are great. What I don’t like about it, is the tummy control. There is none. They are high waisted but that’s it. The band that is at the top of the capris is tight causing it to push in on your belly and causing a puffy lower belly bulge. Not a fan! Just because they are high waist does not mean they are tummy control."
3.0,pockets not deep enough - otherwise there good
3.0,"Cute, My daughter is waitress and loves to wear seasonal jewelry."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress and would have been perfect if the bodice was a tank style. One shoulder was a tank/strap with the chiffon attached which made the flowy chiffon sleeve hang just perfectly. The other sleeve was just chiffon, and it wouldn't stay up. Kind of a funky design. This dress either needs to be a complete tank underneath on the shoulders (like the one side of the dress is), or a true off-the-shoulder dress.  The sage green was a beautiful color and the dress wasn't super long on my 5'3"" frame. It just wasn't comfortable in the bodice."
3.0,"Runs a bit small imo but over all soft, stretchy and comfy. Its a bit see through on me so no pics. I dont see the point of the little pockets. That could be bacause its small on me. Its not tight but it clings like a second skin if that makes sense. The hubs loves it."
3.0,I am a 44-38-46 and the XXL fits and nice and snug but breathable. Not work appropriate but perfect for summer.
3.0,"VERY VERY SMALL. WELL MADE LEATHER, BUT DOES NOT HOLD EVEN MUCH FOLDED PAPER BILLS."
3.0,I found these to be not very compressing & I've got thick legs. They are tight but not blood clot preventing tight. I think over time they get even less compressive. I'd go with a higher quality or a name brand sock over these.
3.0,The colors on this are vibrant and true to the online pic.  It fit odd on my shoulders.
3.0,I was on the small end of all of the Castelli sizing chart numbers except the inseam.  At 6'4&#34; the XL is nowhere near long enough in the body.  I can't stand upright once it's on the shoulders.  Feels like good qualify and would love to figure out if there is one that will fit me.
3.0,"Looked nice, but super heavy and some scuffs/dents on the gold rim"
3.0,They are cute but run too big
3.0,Too small for a man's wrist.
3.0,"I received  in a timely manner. The bag is good for the price. It does have a strong smell which will most likely fade. It’s was pictured with a pad on the shoulder strap which was the feature that my decision to purchase was based on. However, it didn’t come with the pad. I’m very disappointed."
3.0,It’s comfort but it does roll down. Not thick enough
3.0,"These fall down a lot, even though they're tight. Maybe it's my muffin tops fault???"
3.0,"sent them back, werent comfortable for my shape"
3.0,Not comfortable. Is sticky.
3.0,Cute but about a size and a half too small - had to return which is always just an inconvenience
3.0,"I’ve already washed this shirt maybe 4 times and the writing is peeling, and it was slightly on the small side for the size I ordered."
3.0,very high waist to make fit.
3.0,The text on the sweatshirt is a little hard to read because of the way the design was screen printed. I also realized after I got this and put it on my toddler that the mermaid scales are upside down.
3.0,haven't had a chance to wear it but its ok
3.0,"Must have ordered the wrong size, but they looked incredibly small... I returned immediately and did not attempt to try on."
3.0,"Am returning, size ok but fit is not what I expected, also does not feel like cotton."
3.0,You get what you pay for with this hat. It's cheap and feels cheap.
3.0,I bought this suit to be more modest. I guess I assumed the bottoms would have better coverage. The top is cute and fits well but the bottoms are a high cut. Your cheeks will hang out. I literally have to cup my cheeks and jump into the pool so I don't show the world my stuff. Which totally undermines the reason I bought the suit.
3.0,"Fits exactly like it shows  i bought it for travel to Alaska. Ended up being something else I had to carry through the airports since you have to take it off everytime I had to put the handle down on my suitcase. On off, on off. I bought 2, only 1 was opened. Good idea, not practical."
3.0,Very pretty necklace. Absolutely love it. But chain was very weak. Broke within 24 hours. Fixed it- broke again. Looking for a new chain now. Otherwise the beads are absolutely beautiful and I’m not giving up on it
3.0,This is going to be a Christmas present. The shirts look fine. I don't know how they will look after a washing but right now they are great.
3.0,Started to unravel at seam
3.0,"The material is odd polyester-like.  It doesn't drape like in the picture.  The image is reversed on half of it so the writing is backwards but the pattern is so busy its barely noticeable.  I ordered a medium as i usually do but it's a little big on me.  Otherwise, the colors are pretty.  I still like it. Would have loved it to be cotton."
3.0,I love the tank tops but I definitly recommend going up a size when ordering.
3.0,am returning it as it was mis-labled
3.0,"This dress was just ok. The colors are nice, though not quite as vibrant as the photo, and the pockets were great. However, it fits closer to your body than expected, and if you’re tall like me (5’ 10”), it’s just a little too short. The fabric is thin and cheap looking and there was a pretty big flaw at the bottom hem with the stitching. I returned mine and will be looking for another maxi dress elsewhere."
3.0,"Returned- way too long for me for a midi-skirt. I'm only 5'2 though, so it happens"
3.0,It is very pretty but the chain is cheap and hard to get on
3.0,I love my shirt but. It could use another button towards the bottom . I have to use a safety pin . Shirt is open above my waist. Fabric is wonderful comfy soft. Speedy delivery .
3.0,It is on a smaller side. Fabric is cheap quality! Fun to wear ones or twice. Not for every day use.
3.0,"Color was wrong. Hat label says &#34;cafe&#34; instead of the gray it was supposed to be. More like a taupe. If you want gray, you may not get it. Otherwise, it's a nice hat."
3.0,"It's a little big, but overall okay."
3.0,I ordered a medium. I am 5'5 and 130 lbs. The sweater is much shorter than I expected. I wanted a longer cardigan. It also looks very wide ?
3.0,"I’m 36C, 28 waist. I normally wear a size medium in fitted shirts. I got this in a large, it fits, but the shoulders are poofy. Not a fan of how that looks."
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" 220lbs and ordered the XXL based on other suits I bought on Amazon that fit great. This ones too short and it had a weird gap in the chest area by my armpits. Cute suit but returning it due to weird fit."
3.0,bought these for my 8 year old daughter but they are too heavy--the illustrated part is very thick.
3.0,"Brought it because I am pregnant, it fits as expected but the fabric is to thin for my liking."
3.0,Tomfet tbis big enough to fit my 36 DD and have coverage there is no support. So it’s a cute sport bra to wear for show not support.
3.0,"Small was too tight and medium was too loose. Hard to get a good fit because the fit is not adjustable. Returned and got the Switchback cap instead, which I like much better."
3.0,Purchased for my husband to use for deadlifting. They are very long a little on the thin side though.  They work for what I purchased them for
3.0,"the clasp is a little bit low quality as expected from this price point. Sizing the mesh links, I mean literally cutting them is a pain. When you cut the upper line the lower line begins to deform.  Does the job its ok"
3.0,It runs small so I suggest sizing up.
3.0,"This shirt is a cute pattern and comfortable, but runs long. It fits, although I will probably need to hem it. The issue is that the mystery fabric it's made from has a grippy weave, smooth on the outside but textured on the inside, which makes it cling to my bra. This causes it to pull across the chest and not in an even way, as it would if it was really too tight, just up on one side, down on the other. And yes, I used the term mystery fabric. The only tag is a tiny size label, no fabric information or care information. It appears to be a cotton blend, but I'm really not sure. It is comfortable, a good thickness and a cute pattern, and if you are someone with really sensitive skin who has to remove clothing labels the lack of tags is a plus, I'm just not sure it will work for me."
3.0,"These are very casual summer weight pajamas. That is good going into the summer. The material is very thin and designed to be very loose fitting. It is very comfortable, but it has a very unflattering, frumpy look. My partner will probably wear it, but only when lacking other options or very hot weather."
3.0,Pills after a few wears but cute for price
3.0,"These are cute but boy are they small!  They bend easily, almost too easily, but they are too small for me to really handle and not fumble.  They might work ok for someone who has nimble fingers.  Cute for someone really young.  They should package these better, they are in a tiny plastic bag and that bag was in another bag, I nearly threw them out, they are not giftable being packaged like this."
3.0,"Te band is extremely large, it didn't fit my wife, if you have a thin wrist dont huy this band."
3.0,Lightweight pendant & flimsy ring. Figured for almost 15 dollars it would've been a little heftier & of better quality.
3.0,"Cute, but the color fades so quickly."
3.0,"The fit is ok, but the hat itself is large. The inner band keeps it on your head, but the hat kind of floats and just doesn't quite feel (or look) right."
3.0,It's okay. I got what I paid for. The clasp is fragile and I don't expect it to last a long time. However I am still pleased with this purchase.
3.0,It’s a nice wig but it tangles very easily. When I took it out of the packaging I had to brush it for hours and if you leave it unattended for too long it will tangle even worse. Just be mindful of the tangles.
3.0,"This is a massive watch, easy to get snagged in close quarters. It's easy to read and has two light buttons to allow the digital screens to be seen in 3 second bursts when light is dim. The illuminated hands don't stay visible for long unless they are exposed to bright light during the day. I still haven't gotten the watch to allow me to change back to 12 hour time in the digital display. The directions require several readings before they make sense. They say it's good for 50 meters but they also say don't press any buttons while under water so I doubt it would last long as all the major buttons can be pressed easily by accident given the design. Safe to say this may be a good work watch but time will tell. For the price it's worth a shot."
3.0,They were not exactly what I expected.  They are a bit harder to read at the same 3.0 as the others I have that are not anti glare.  Also not happy that they did not come in a case.
3.0,Would have kept it IF it had been new. It had makeup on the collar. The charging unit had a big chunk of broken plastic PLUS the battery was exposed and badly dented.<br /><br />It fit beautifully and had nice quality metal zippers. Loved the bright white!
3.0,I love this watch. I had trouble with the latch as have other reviewers. It wouldn't even stay closed for a second. I looked at the watch for a week because I really wanted to keep it. I took a chance and bent the tang on the clasp so that it positioned correctly against the pin on the other piece. It closes perfectly now. Makers should resolve this problem.
3.0,"I gave this watch to my employer, he was impressed with the detail and over all look of the watch. Its a great gift for anyone who likes to look a little more elegant. The only thing I have to warn about the watch is if you expect to wear this often the latch that keeps the watch face covered weakens over time. My boss wears it with him every day and three months in the latch loosened. Other than that the watch is a great gift idea or a treat for yourself."
3.0,"I got this ring to possibly be my wedding ring. In person it does not look nearly as cool as the photo. The carbon fiber inlay was ""cheap"" looking and the ring is just not good enough for a wedding ring. I got it on a great sale, so it was cheap but now that I have found a nicer ring that was still less than $10, I will not be using it anymore."
3.0,"Works great for reading. When ordered they were pictured as full lenses, but came as small granny lenses."
3.0,TOO LARGE GAVE IT AWAY AS A GIFT
3.0,wife really didnt like these that much
3.0,"After using these slippers for a week, I noticed that the plushness of sole was going quickly. first few uses were comfortable, but materials not as long lasting as expected. I have a narrow foot and also noticed that the sippers were somewhat wide for me. However, they do stay in place and provide great warmth, even when standing in snow."
3.0,"It looks great and it is a great watch, but it is way lighter in real life than photos."
3.0,A little tight in the arms.
3.0,It was to big for my watch
3.0,"I would love to give a better review because the stone is nice and heavy and the color is absolutely beautiful, but there are some issues that don't live up to the description. The ""stylish"" chain is a normal chain and while I like the length, the links were tarnished and stretched as soon as I opened it. All of the metal on this jewelry is TERRIBLE and my stone has several long chips through it like it's cracked. I could live with that if I felt like the metal was better because the stone size and color really is stunning."
3.0,"I bought this in size small, and it was slightly too large for me (normally XS). While it was cute, it just seemed frumpy on. I'm not sure if this is because the size was too large or if the quality just wasn't the best. It seemed to puff out more than drape nicely as the style is intended."
3.0,ZIPPER DID NOT HOLD UP. SO RETURNED ITEM
3.0,"Okay, this is not for ladies with large chests, or anyone who's not going to cochella.  I'm a 30 year old, 5'6 and 125, but this was wayyyy too short!"
3.0,These socks are too bulky in the heel. They stick out of your shoe which is the opposite reason I bought these. They are comfortable but definitely not no show!
3.0,The purse is a little lighter in color and more pastel than expected. Came in a bag so flowers are a bit crushed. Hot glue gun used for some of the flowers can be seen. Returning. :(
3.0,Didn’t come on time! Was disappointed about that! Other then that the earring is fine
3.0,"a little big, but would still work over a swimsuit"
3.0,"I received my prayer shawl in the mail just a couple days ago, and have enjoyed using it as I take time for prayer and meditation. My one &#34;complaint&#34; is that the shawl I received was not linen or cotton, as the reviews and the feedback had indicated. Mine was polyester. While it doesn't effect it's usefulness in any way, it does have a &#34;cheaper&#34; feel, and also has a fairly strong chemical smell to it.<br /><br />I'm glad I received it, and I will continue to use it, but had I known pre-order that it was polyester, I would have held out for another option of higher quality."
3.0,I got a small and it is too big and the sleeves are too long.  I'll have it altered and wear it.  The colors are great.
3.0,Itchy and not soft or cozy. I like the pattern in the fabric and the color.. but won’t keep something that doesn’t feel good. Sent it back.
3.0,"I ordered a size larger than typical, and the waistband was much too tight.  This fit does not lend well to the already tight shorts that I wear them under.  Also, the padding-super thin, doesn’t provide nearly enough cushion.  I made a bad choice with these☹️"
3.0,It's a nice beautiful ring but it's too course the work man ship need to be more smoothly it sore up my corner fingers
3.0,White was a bad decision on my part.
3.0,Not one drop of multicam black in it.
3.0,Much smaller than I expected.  I couldn't even get it into my cartilage piercing.  It was a nice quality but I'll never wear it.
3.0,"I bought this nightgown based on reviews that were very positive. Some reviewers said the weight of this gown was heavier than other flannel nightgowns, which is one of the main reasons I purchased it.  Unfortunately, I would disagree on this point.  It is a beautiful product and attractively packaged, but the weight is more on the light side, a lot like the thinner nightgowns I've seen in most stores. When I re-read the manufacturer's product description, I see that they leave their description about the weight somewhat in the middle. Unfortunately, I needed a heavier weight and hoped this would be exactly what I wanted - something pretty, feminine and WARM. I would have returned it, but went into the hospital with a serious illness and missed the return deadline. I sent a message to the supplier about this, but did not receive a response. (Not that I thought they would allow a return, but on the off chance they would, I contacted them.  It's unfortunate not to have received a reply.)"
3.0,"I love SOA and I really wanted to wear this for St. Pats, but it was just a bit too tight. I’m A medium and that’s what I ordered, I would have been more comfortable wearing it if it was a size bigger."
3.0,"The fit is pretty good. Could have gone a size down for a tighter fit. Only exception is the pick shows the bottom hug your ankle and mine was wide a few inches from looking like wide leg at the bottom which takes away from the look. Will have to roll them up to keep the tight sexy look. But the material is great, and doesn't look cheap. Also the stretch of material is comfortable. It looks tight but you have the comfort of a relaxed feel.  Gave 3 stars because I wanted the exact look in the pic but pants at the bottom did not fit or hug my ankle it was loose"
3.0,"This shirt didn’t fit me well at all. As someone who normally fits an XL well this was not it. Can’t lift my arms, is very short on me for someone who has a short torso, and the material is stiff. Really sad but it’s should fit someone who goes for a large or smaller very well."
3.0,"If you’re big busted, this isn’t a top for you. It fits awkward between your chest and shoulders."
3.0,"Had high hopes for this tankini, but I was a little disappointed.  The material is thin and the elastic is not good.  It is cute and true to size.  I ordered 4 tankinis on Amazon and this was the only one that disappointed.  It won't last long, but would be good for a week at a beach - then toss it."
3.0,The mask is good as a display piece for a game room but the eye holes are so small that you can not see through the eyes and there is no place for air to enter or escape when breathing.
3.0,"I really LOVED this bag. It looks nice, it has great storage space. It's comfortable to wear. I love the two outer pockets (front and back) great for cell phone and keys. I received several compliments on it as well. I was so sad to see a rip on the outer side seam after about three months of daily use.  I am hoping to repair it, because I still love this bag."
3.0,This is a super cute design and I love the fit BUT it is also super cheap fabric. Not the best material for daytime. It’s very stretchy and see through in a few spots.
3.0,"Fellow shoppers:  there is nothing wrong with these pants.  the color is true.  they could be a tad bit longer I'm returning them for that reason.  for me, they were just a little too short."
3.0,"Very pretty, and the hankie part is soft, but the lace trim is stiff and seems more like polyester or nylon. I was hoping the whole hankie would be soft."
3.0,Wtf?
3.0,"This skirt was easily see-through, I got the cream-colored. I also ordered a size up after reading many reviews of how small the waistband was, it was way too big and very long. Im 5'4 and 160lbs."
3.0,"If you love phosphosiderite, you'll appreciate the high quality and perfect deep lavender shade of this stone. However, the frame it sits in is quite strange. From the front, it has an intricate, well-crafted silver scroll pattern, and the back has a similar style, but it is constructed in an odd format that wraps around almost like a cage, which prevents the enhancer from laying completely flat. As a result, the enhancer tends to flip over, and it also feels a bit unusual against the skin. (You can now see the general shape in the side-view image; that was not available when I made my purchase.) Overall, the enhancer is beautiful, but I did not keep it due to the issues noted here."
3.0,Very large and a heavy material and very very long
3.0,Socks were okay but took FOREVER to arrive.
3.0,"Tighter than I'd have thought, and a lot of trust goes into being sure it's not cheap plastic. I can't tell.  It's ok for the price."
3.0,"This was a very cheaply made hat. While it does look like the hat from the viral snake-y snake video, it started falling apart and had to be glued back together within the first day we had it. Fun for a gag gift. Not so great quality, especially considering the price. It is a thin, felt material with an elastic string to hold it on. It is definitely sized more for a little kid (as you'd expect)."
3.0,Fits so well everywhere except the front...slightly too restrictive on the pouch. Excellent quality and material but sadly I can't enjoy it.
3.0,They were really cute but 2 out of four broke within the first week.
3.0,It is what I expected.  I have only used it twice but seems sturdy.  It could have been just a bit wider.  My main complaint was that the black strap left a stain on the clear plastic.
3.0,Cute for my costume but had a hole the seam
3.0,"I bought this hoodie for my 16-year-old daughter and it was OK. The material is a bit thin and the color is off. I got her the dark red with the floral sleeves but in person, the red is more of a rust color and does not match the color of the flowers. We ended up sending it back."
3.0,It is what’s pictured. But it’s definitely NOT as big as I thought it would be. And you can’t really read the letters because they are not deeply engraved. Not worth 8$ I paid but I still like it
3.0,Seller was very accomodating. My hook was stuck and would not open.
3.0,I was hoping it would be more airy. It was but it ripped apart first week.
3.0,"The fabric is very thin and see through,I am not able to wear the white out of the house!!!"
3.0,"This is my second order of these bracelets.  First order very nice pearls but bracelets were not strong enough for my purpose.  I used the pearls to make a rosary for my niece.  When I began a second one for her sister I ran out so I made second order.  These pearls are not as nice, about half lack the luster of the first set.  I wouldn't order again too much waste"
3.0,"These bras would have been great, except the binding is not very stretchy. The binding is well....binding. It digs into my skin and is just not comfortable. Really too bad."
3.0,"I got this for my girlfriend. Unfortunately she didn't like it. Their main complaint was that it sits weird on her chest, material was okay but not as soft as she would have liked. For reference they're 5'10"", ~200lb, and wears a size XL."
3.0,Not as nice as picture
3.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I did not buy this because of its association withTaylor Swift. Maybe it would appeal more to one of her fans. I got it because I just liked the term “anti-hero”. I knew this would likely just be a cheap piece of novelty jewelry, so i wasn’t too shocked when I opened the box. In my opinion, the gold color is too gold, if that makes sense. It’s also bigger than I expected, which to me is not as flattering. From the pictures in the description I thought it would be more subtle and dainty. I think it might be more appealing to a teenager or someone much younger than I am…but I guess that’s who Taylor Swift appeals to? I don’t think I’ll ever wear this like I thought I would. I have no clue how the metal plating will hold up because I haven’t worn it except to take the picture. The clasp seems ok though and the chain is pretty sturdy for cheap metal. If it was smaller and a more subtle gold color it would be better and I might actually wear it more. It is shiny though."
3.0,I love Bob Marley and the sweatshirt was nice but it is for a little child or a very small teenager. I wear a medium in women's size 9/10 and I ordered a larger size and it didn't work. I returned it.
3.0,"This is an outstanding piece of jewelry for an excellent price. Perfect Mother's day gift for mother with three children. Unfortunately, the included chain has a clasp but nothing to attach it to, making the chain worthless. Still recommended, but buyers beware."
3.0,Really unique bathing suit and material.  Better suited for a more full figured woman. I am 5'9&#34; and weigh 119 lbs.  I wear a 34B bra and both the M and S bathing suit tops were too loose around my torso and there is no adjusting fastner in the back like a bra so both suits were too large.  The bottoms were both a little large in the leg opening.  This would not be an issue if I had more padding on my bottom.
3.0,You need a small hand to get this bracelet on
3.0,"These shades look cool and are very functional. However, they scratch easily (even if kept in their associated case).<br /><br />They look good enough and are cheap enough that I've purchased three pairs so far. The arm snapped off on the first pair (travel) and the lenses became badly scratched on the second pair (more travel) even though the glasses were kept in their case, in a backpack.<br /><br />However, noting that I'm hard on my things, I'd rather buy another pair of these than splurge on a pair of Raybans. So, the price point matches the quality."
3.0,Cute...but the straps are way too thin for the thickness of the rest of this dress. Material is heavier than I expected but pretty in the black and red. I had ordered the cream one as well but I never received it.
3.0,"The Material is that stretch material. The good thing, it wasn’t to thin. It can be worn on or off the shoulders. I didn’t like the belt so I added my own. Overall it was okay."
3.0,"I ordered this on December 13 and was guaranteed delivery by December 22.  It did not arrive until after Christmas.  This was supposed to be a gift for my 14 year old daughter, because her Grandpa passed in June.  When it finally arrived, after Christmas, she was very happy with it.  She’s had it for less than a week though and the chain already broke."
3.0,"very tiny charm, looks as the photo. I would not buy another one, I don't think"
3.0,Flimsy inexpensive hat.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Nice bracelet, but like others have said the clasp opens.  The Nina charms are too big for the Pandora bracelet.  After crawling on the floor looking for charms after the clasp opened we've decided to try stoppers.  Hopefully it works."
3.0,"It is a nice dress. I had ordered it before but exchanged it for a larger size(from l to xl). It fits as it says but I wanted more room. I received many compliments. I did not like that it came with a hole in it. I was in crunch time, so I pinned it instead of sending it back."
3.0,Bought for our son in Chicago. He says they’re a good 2nd layer of sock but very thin so not alone on their freezing days. They apparently have metal wires on the bottom. Kind of underwhelmed. Maybe they work better than their density suggests.
3.0,I can really only rate this as three stars.  The color is beautiful.  But after three months the front zipper broke.  Would have been very happy if zippers weren’t so cheap.
3.0,"Ok let's talk Pj's. This set is nice satin and soft. However, the shorts runs a little small on my thighs. My thighs feel trapped. I may  cut slits on each side of the shorts!"
3.0,"My daughter will be 2 next month.  Size 2T to 4T just barely fit her head and it was near impossible to get the chin strap to attach (too short).  Last time she went to the Dr, her head was in the 70th percentile, but I'm not sure how this hat would fit a 4T or even 3T sized child"
3.0,"They shrink once you wash them, and have a sticky rubber patch on the heel which wasn't in the description so I was trying to take it off until I realized that it was intentionally there to keep the socks in place.  Would have been nice to have had that in the description. The socks really shrank once washed and dried."
3.0,"While the band looked very nice initially, after wearing it the black color on the band is breaking off.  It looks like the clasp is tearing the black off."
3.0,"I bought XL little I wear and they fit over maybe a quarter of my butt. Luckily, they fit my daughter (a small teenager) and she loves them. So I lose but she wins."
3.0,"They are nice shirts for the target inexpensive price. They fit as expected and I would say true to size. They are more of a compression/spandex material then anything. They're plenty long, and will be perfect to wear under other tank tops. I ordered a 3x, true to size. The only complaint I really have is, I ordered a pack of three, white, gray, and black. The white one has obviously been dropped on a dirty floor and still shipped quite dirty. I'm hoping it will come out in the wash but it doesn't just wipe off so I might be stuck with a dirty top."
3.0,to tight to put on.
3.0,"Decent gloves for the price. The small wasn't small enough, but I made due. The fact that I can touch my iPhone without remivejmg my gloves, is a great boon during winter. I felt some knobs at the end of the glove tips, within the cashmere lining. This is the point where they were tied off after sewing. Those nubs were driving me crazy. It seems that I was able to remove some of that extra threat that was left behind. It's much better now."
3.0,"Believe the reviews that say it's tight! Cute but ouch. Couldn't wear, had to return. :-(. 3 stars because it is nice and they are good material. Just tight!"
3.0,"Nice durable material. Smaller than I thought and sits awkward. Good for my 10 year old to carry Her stuff when we are out and about, but not a good everyday bag like I hoped."
3.0,My newborn would have outgrown these in a week had I bought them right when she was born. Unfortunately I bought them a few weeks later and they absolutely did not fit her hands or feet.
3.0,Used for client - it was ok - structure was odd - had to fight with it once on door
3.0,"The sizing on this jacket is definitely &#34;off.&#34;  I have several other 5X men's shirts and a jacket, all of which have a similar familiar fit. This jacket has sleeves significantly longer than expected for this size, and the cut of the body itself is much slimmer than any other Men's 5X that I've tried in the past. It's almost as if this jacket was cut for &#34;Tall&#34; rather than &#34;Big&#34;. It's a big disappointment because I can't use it.  Otherwise, it seems to be constructed well, and in terms of the lining, snaps, etc. was what I was looking for. Thus the 3-star rating."
3.0,Corto
3.0,"This bag works for my purposes, nice quality construction, good design.  I have one complaint, the end section that holds a ball is a bit small.  It takes a good bit of work to get a ball into it.  It is the Jr model, so maybe it is designed for a ball smaller than regulation.<br /><br />Otherwise it is OK."
3.0,Fits good. Comfortable. Too shear after I put them on. Too easy to see through.
3.0,size was to small
3.0,"I ordered this shirt originally in a Medium, and I was SWIMMING in it. Super large! I'm typically a size medium, but can be a small when it comes to women's shirts. I ended up getting an X-Small instead, and it fits just about right. Do not buy this shirt if you're not typically a size small, you'll be drowning in it."
3.0,"I was upset that i was not able to keep them.  The material feels great,  i probably could have down sized because of the leg space,  but the elastic on the waist was not very stretchy and thin.  I could not putt them up to my hips.  I don't much to my back side ot hip are either way.  😔  That was the only down side.  I really wish i could have kept them."
3.0,A little Wide for my feet. Have to wear to pairs of socks.
3.0,"No stretch, runs slightly smaller than usual."
3.0,Sizing is off and runs big
3.0,"I like the idea of this 2 piece set but it is of very thin material and definitely not for the winter months. When I 1st opened the package & look at it,  I  thought ""oh my,  this is really thin for AmeriMark products that I have purchased in the past"".  It is a very comfortable outfit."
3.0,Its cute on. Quality isn't the greatest but not bad for little ones and not bad for the price
3.0,"I love the logo and I am a HUGE fan of the Avett Brothers. The t-shirt however is for a very small female. I ended up returning it for a larger men's size, only I had to choose a different logo. Wish this logo was on larger t shirts."
3.0,"Normally my daughter wears a size 10 (which is big) and I got these in a 12/13, and they are still tight. I think it must be how they are made. I might stay away from the children's animal slippers and go with something a little more conventional for fit."
3.0,Pretty but doesn't last long
3.0,"not enough cities in World Time Mode. Aluminum bezel too soft, scratches easily."
3.0,"The fabric isn’t great, kind of cheap. It doesn’t drape like in the picture."
3.0,"I bought this apron to use as a costume for a 1930s nurse.  I loved the design and quality was good.  However, it was too small to wear.  I ordered a medium but it really seemed to made for a child.  I am 5'4', 128 pounds and the Medium did not come close to fitting.  I was still able to use it as a waist apron (I simply folded the top of the apron down under the skirt and tied the waist straps."
3.0,"These slippers were disappointing.  They are very cute and will be a hit with those who love Beanie Boos.  However, the quality is suspect.  After receiving my order, I discovered that the nose on the left slipper was attached sideways.  So, I placed another order for the same product.  The second order arrived with the same problem - the nose on the left slipper was sideways.  These also seem to run small.  My daughter does not yet wear a size 5 in regular shoes, but found these too short in length."
3.0,nice material...seems well made.  Slim fit is definitely slim.  didn;t see that part when  I ordered
3.0,"Cute, but can't be worn alone. It seems like it would be or should be sold in a pack of bangles."
3.0,"The fabric is very flimsy.  If it had more body to it, I would rate it higher.  I like the size, as so many bags are very small."
3.0,It's flimsier than expected. Bought a chain wallet from Walmart that last me years. Was expecting equal quality but I don't think this will last long. Chain is also flimsy so I suggest getting a different one.
3.0,Husband wanted for gym bag. He didn’t care for it too big and bulky.  Kept it since he needed right away! Doesn’t think it will hold up as described on web page.
3.0,I give it a 3 because I ordered a 3/4 sleeve but the sleeves are short sleeves. The label on the package is for 3/4 sleeve but it wasn’t. I am disappointed but will keep it. It does fit as expected. Company should check for accuracy.
3.0,felt cheap. :P but good
3.0,Material was really thin.
3.0,"I am 5'5 and 115 lbs, and the smallest size fit okay, but the shape was very strange. It was boxy and did not accent my waist at all."
3.0,"The picture looks great, quality..hmm could be better. Extremely small. I normally wear L sweatshirts, I ordered XXL because I read a review that it runs small, and still not comfortable. Not a really stretchy sweatshirt material. I am disappointed, I was looking forward this cutie!"
3.0,"I really love the look of the jumpsuit and I'm so bummed it didn't work for me.  I'm 5'4"", wear a size 10/30, 34E and ordered a size Large.  Unfortunately it was too small and too short for me.  I could barely get the jumpsuit zipped up and the neckline was too low for me to wear a bra.  Also, the length was too short and not in a cute way.  I really wanted this jumpsuit to fit and wish it came in a X-Large but it doesn't, so back it goes!"
3.0,"I purchased this for resort wear, but decided to return it. I wear a 10 or large bottoms and ordered the large here. It was a little loose, but I think the style of this is more situated for a tighter fit. The pockets were placed right at the sides and on the hips, which just adds bulk.<br />I debated keeping it and using it just for a beach cover up, but I have enough of those and wanted something I would also wear in the summer."
3.0,"Material is weird. I expected it to be smooth, soft and flowy. The fabric is a sort of a weave, as in old polyester fabric. Packed in very smelly plastic.<br />Not a good choice for summer wear.<br />Runs very small, and I did order a size up."
3.0,"These are super cute, but for the price I kind of expected them to all be fully intact upon arrival and not damaged  Of course the color combo I needed, which was why I ordered them, was the damaged pair."
3.0,"Swim suit sizing is a form of size shaming. Sadly, this brand participates in such sad behavior. Other than that, once you finally figure out what size to buy, which is not easy, the suit is fine."
3.0,Thin but warm.  Easily rips and the stuffing comes out everywhere!!!
3.0,"Pretty much what I expected, came in a little too big, and okay packaging."
3.0,Not a very practical wallet.  It doesn't allow easy access to the cards.
3.0,"It's ok, but the velcro on this is very scratchy... they should have put the scratchy side and the softer side opposite.  It also shrunk a little after the first watch, so is a little short and hard to sit down in.  If I'd known this I would have ordered a much larger one."
3.0,"This midi cocktail dress is cute, however it is too open in the breast area (especially if the wearer is full breasted, it becomes more defined), and the slit on the bottom of the dress is also too high. Basically this dress is a bit too revealing for me to wear."
3.0,"Though a bit roomy, they stay onto your hands while wearing and with usage they do not tear or rip.  Price could be less."
3.0,Material is scratchy and uncomfortable. Not great for longer torsos.
3.0,"Not the most expensive pair of gloves, but they will do the trick when running in the cold."
3.0,"It was beautiful. I love it. but the clasp is so small, difficult to open and lock on to wrist."
3.0,"This product is ok.  only 2 of the 4 are quick drying.  The ones with graphics are regular graphic tshirts.  the quality is a little rough and cheap, not like top brands."
3.0,Bracelet is pretty but it runs very small and has a cheap clasp.
3.0,"Pros: color variety, stretchy comfortable material.<br />Cons: way too big! Almost has too much stretch and not nearly enough support"
3.0,Good fox quality but the color is odd. Stone would be a broader grey but these look green. Like a sage green almost. Just doesn't match any jersey I have
3.0,The body of the shirt has a nice loose feel but the sleeves are too tight. I am going to order a size larger and see if that works.
3.0,I bought these for my daughter for a play she’s in. She has the same shoes same brand just the tap version. She’s had them for 3 years and are great quality . So I figured to buy the character shoe in same size. When we got them they were too small. When I went to order the next half size up- the price jumped up 6$!!! So I went with a different brand . I don’t know why a different size would be a different price and not prime .
3.0,"I bought these for my 12 yr old. The socks look fantastic, however they were so small and tight we couldn’t get it on his foot"
3.0,These were too long and too big. Return shipping was over 5 dollars.<br /><br />*Update- the seller refunded me the shipping cost as well and they were super nice. I didn't even ask them to. They reached out. So that was nice.
3.0,The quick release - continuously quick releases. it will not stay latched. any stress on the band at all causes the band to disconnect from the watch
3.0,It was return did not like the color
3.0,I thought it was going to be metal but it's actually plastic and looks the part.
3.0,Son loves them but are very very long
3.0,Color is different than pictured. Its actually pink instead of mauve.
3.0,These compression stockings are a bit too tight.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my friend. The garment comes in a ziplock bag. This tank’s hand feel is good: soft and silky. But I couldn’t find the care label; I can’t tell if it’s 100% cotton (the fabric is very thin; it’s made of see-through fabric). The cut and color are simple; its design makes it go along with your accessories. The print quality on the front panel is vivid and good. (It feels like a real giant panda is staring at you.) If you are a prime member, this item can be your last minute gift option since the price is pretty reasonable.<br />I purchased this item with a discount coupon so I can contribute my unbiased and honest review."
3.0,"when first ordered, I thought were better?"
3.0,Its too large. I am 5'5 and 120lbs. I have a little back.. Its way to baggy. I bought a large because they said buy one size up. Material is thin and nylonsish. Nylonish is not a word but you need to get the idea. I am going to return it for a small and see how that fits. Oh yeah it comes with the belt which is the same material.
3.0,I liked the idea of them but the white is see through and they weren’t baggy the fit to snug for the description so order and size up !
3.0,Cute and fun but way too small for a 2xl my son needs the size for length not width but couldn't even button it.
3.0,"I needed a E, O, and N. It did not have a N ."
3.0,"I loved these earrings, but they fell out the second time wearing them. Should come with a back or maybe change the design of the hook?"
3.0,Nice colors but flimsy closure. Not very thick band makes it easy to fall off the wrist.
3.0,They fit perfectly and are true to picture.
3.0,"These are decoratively pretty on the one side, but flat from the mold on the other.  The way the earrings hang on my lobes, that inner side is quite visible.  To be honest, I'll probably never wear these because they're so awkward-looking on me."
3.0,"The pants are flattering, soft and fit as expected but the quality is not the best. The stitching from the back pockets came undone the first time I wore them!"
3.0,It's a cheap pendant. But it's cool because it has the Tardis in it. My daughter loves it.
3.0,I ordered a small and it fits like a XL
3.0,La gorra es de muy baja calidad . Y el logo pegado pensé que era bordado
3.0,The map image is blurry and it doesn’t look like the picture you see. Took a long time to ship but the price was cheap. I’m sure my students will still think they’re neat when I wear them.
3.0,A couple really cool looking bracelets and others that are very plain. would liked it better if all black or all brown. some of the edges are a bit sharp on the bands which are irritating while wearing.
3.0,It actually looks cuter in the picture than in person but I still like it and I like the material cause it’s comfy and flattering
3.0,Really pretty.  But lace started falling apart after 3 washes.
3.0,No hem line.
3.0,I haven’t worn this item for even a month and it already broke ! I will be returning it !
3.0,The bracelet is well made and very beautiful but is very heavy on the wrist . I usually wear several bracelets but you really can only wear this one by itself
3.0,"Cute style, it just wasn’t for me. It was too loose at the bust and is more A-line than fit-n-flare.<br />It arrived quickly but I ultimately returned it."
3.0,I have only had the bag for a couple months and it is already ripping.
3.0,This too fit weird. Too small in the chest. I only wear a b cup but too big on the mid area. Makes you look pregnant. I returned the top. I wanted to like it but wasn't right for me
3.0,bulkier than expected
3.0,Standard issue
3.0,"I love the look of earrings, but they bend and feels like they may break if I try to shape them into circle.  Have worn a couple of time and like I said they are very cute but don't know how long they will last.  Wish they wasn't so bendable"
3.0,Just ok-sizing is off. Size up one to two sizes if you want a flowy look. The grey is. It as pictured -much lighter and washed out
3.0,"I was a little bit disappointed in this item.  It was more flimsy that I expected it to be, however, for the  price, I did not expect a quality item.  I am sure my granddaughter will find uses for it."
3.0,Product messed up really easily.
3.0,"overall 3 stars only because it fits great right out of the box. it’s not too stiff or rough. BUT, it doesn’t fit the apple watch “holes” all that great on the bottom “clasp” or “holes”. it’s very loose, and i am afraid it will eventually break or pop off and cause damage to my watch."
3.0,Appeared to be a good quality dress but sized too small even using the sizing chart. Also very short
3.0,Really like the design but they keep getting caught and stretched out of shape on my scarves
3.0,one sock tore after I wore it a few times. They work though!
3.0,"it came in to small, the side only goes to the tip of my ears so its like its just balancing on my ear, so sad because its a really nice durable glasses."
3.0,Very see through but fit was great
3.0,I love these eye necklaces which are part of an outfit for a themed party cruise.  A little too big but I can get away with the size (I hope).  The theme party on the ship is the 5 senses.
3.0,Even though it said this is a knit dress this dress is very thin and it's not warm the top because of the design is very weird to put on in the shoulder always slips out of place the design is not workable
3.0,Way to small. Adult design. Thicker. But only a small child could wear
3.0,"I had to return.  If you have belly fat like me, it does not hold anything in.  If you have flat belly this will look great on you.  It is really cute, just not on me."
3.0,"This dress/tunic is thin and runs on the small side, but looks great with leggings! I plan to order more. Great for weekends and casual days."
3.0,it smaller that the size it say an got lent ball an frizzy quick
3.0,"Adorable, but smaller than expected. It did not fit my 8yo at all, and barely fit my 5yo."
3.0,"This could be a very cute dress! It is just below knee length (I'm 5'5&#34;).  I usually wear a small or medium, I ordered a large and could barely put it on."
3.0,Nice socks but tiny definitely not for men with a shoe size any larger than 9 maybe 8.5
3.0,Cute n comfy but material trays and you have to de-fuzz it after a couple of washes.
3.0,"Beautiful fabric and good quality of fabric, however the neckline is to high and tight in the front and looks odd when you put it on."
3.0,Not as long as it looks in the picture and the piece arrived with knots in the chain that is nearly impossible to get out but for the price it's a really cool piece of costume jewelry.
3.0,poor  quality
3.0,These are kind-a big to fit around an ankle. We made them work though.
3.0,Runs extra small. You definitely need 2x bigger than what size you need.
3.0,"The only reason this belt did not receive five starts is because of the smell.  It has a terrible odor as if it has been in a wet and dank warehouse for the last 20 years.  I am happy with the way it fits and the way it buckles, but the smell is overbearing.  I am  going to try a few different things to try to get rid of the smell because I like the belt that much.  Hopefully with brown one I ordered won't have the same smell."
3.0,"Te choice of length was unclear, and they were way too long when I thought they would be short."
3.0,"The shirt was fit once it was on, but getting off was hell. Shorts were to big. Super cute outfit though."
3.0,"I Did not expected like that,It's too small.but it's all right"
3.0,Pretty dress and print. A little too high waisted though. Makes u look like a 10 yr. Old. I guess u have to be really petite for it to fit just right. Sadly returned it.
3.0,"On the plus side, the fabric is super soft and and the price is great.  On the negative, there is no support or compression whatsoever on these shorts, and the fabric is much thinner than I would have expected (they might be see-through if they fit tightly, but mine were perhaps a size too big and therefore were not).  Comfy for lounging around the house and maybe a restorative yoga class, not sure if they would stand up to a rigorous workout."
3.0,It is super thin. You can see through it very easily.
3.0,The lace is cheap and easily fraud but the price is right
3.0,I'm not sure how to rate this product 🤔<br />Truthfully our kids just won't wear them. And they are too small for me to test.<br />They do fit their little faces but if it helps my kids breathe easier or if its comfortable is unknown
3.0,"This backpack is perfect for what I have been looking for. I'm an avid reader and carry up to 2 books on me at all times. I'm also diabetic so I need something big enough for my supplies, including low treatments and had been shopping around for months until I found this!<br /><br />It's cute, it's not that weird fake leather feeling, the straps are comfortable, plus it has an additional strap if you want to use it as an over-the-shoulder bag and not a backpack!<br /><br />That being said, the first one I got, I noticed that there was some peeling near the edges of the main zippers. Since I know that can make the bag not last as long or give an idea if it'll do the same in other areas, I contacted customer support for a replacement.<br />Let me tell you, their customer service team rocks! I got a replacement sent to me within a day and had the new one a week later! No questions asked (other than the obvious, ""hey, can we see pictures please?"") They were very nice and understanding during our emails and never once made me feel like a bad person for requesting a replacement, which I have had an issue with in the past.<br /><br />That's where I would love to give them a full 5 star rating. Everything has been so good so far with just minor inconvenience. However, when I got the replacement bag, I opened it to find the same issue, just not as bad in my opinion. Im ok with this because it's not as noticeable this time and I think it's just the way it's folded then packaged. It wasn't stuck to the packaging, it wasn't vacuum sealed inside the bag, but if they made bags in bulk and folded and set them aside until they were ready to ship, it is possible that it just wore down being folded that particular way. I dont know, I dont work there and I dont do that as a profession so it's hard to say why this is happening for sure but I am a consumer and I know some things just don't do well with certain folds or in certain packaging.<br /><br />That being said, the pictures I've attached are hard to tell apart but lucky me, I had my nail polish changed between photos! The ones where the polish is green is the first bag and the other is the new, so you can see the difference. Im going to keep the new one because I do still love it. I'll still be on the hunt for the smaller but cute backpack of my diabetic-reader dreams though."
3.0,It was a little too small
3.0,Keeps falling down. Should be tight and comfortable
3.0,"I love the style and the fabric of this top, but it is way too big. I was disappointed that I can't wear it out, but I'm keeping it because it's so comfortable. For this top, definitely size down."
3.0,"Quality design, under sized, should of stepped up two sizes!"
3.0,It was not the color in the picture. It was more of a brown/grey color. Best for young kids. My child is 7 and it just barely fits.
3.0,Too fitting and too short
3.0,"In the description, it claims 15% Spandex. However, on the cloth, it labels as 10% Spandex."
3.0,"Some fit comfortable, two were a bit snug."
3.0,"Quality was good on initial inspection but I never installed them. Bronze brown does not mean bronze reflective lens with brown tint like Oakley defines it. The lenses were just brown with no reflective properties. Returned for refund, but will be buying another set for my Square Wiskers."
3.0,"These sunglasses remind me of Zion T. The fit is good, however I feel like the sides could have curved more to better frame my eyes. I felt like there was a large gap in the area between the outer corner of my eyes and the temple arms. It's not noticeable from the front, but as the wearer I can feel bits of light coming through. I've never worn mirrored lenses before, so I'm not sure if this is how all mirrored lenses are, but at times there would be a rainbow effect on objects. Also, it's really dark to see through. When I checked out my phone during stops (in my car), the phone screen was barely viewable even when it's at the brightest setting. Visually, they're appealing, but not for me when I'm driving."
3.0,The colors are not a bright in person as they appear in this picture.
3.0,This is absolutely a normal woman’s size. I listen to the reviews and it was way too big. I am not sure if the reviewer‘s are used to buying juniors clothes and that’s why they thought it was too small but I ordered it a size up as they said it was huge.
3.0,The shirt is definitely a girls and the pants are a boys.
3.0,They were super cute sunglasses!<br />But the lens fell out barely 3 wks after I got them.. I will admit that I can be a little rough on my sunglasses but these broke fast than expected
3.0,Quality of the leather is not very good
3.0,"Very small, but cute bag."
3.0,"This item is nicely made, however the size chart says Large is XL and it's not more like a Medium<br />so if you are XL I wouldn't trust the chart they use."
3.0,They don't cover my ankles and I'm 5'9. Kinda thought they would and they're a little baggy but i ordered my exact size.
3.0,they loved this used in a parade
3.0,This dress was definitely not proportioned for me. It was tight and had no give.
3.0,"Love the bracelet since I have small wrists. I wore it for a week, no issues, then, with a touch of sunscreen on my arms and the inside tarnished and turned my skin green. Now, with clean skin, on contact for a while, it turns me green. Exterior is still beautiful, would love to reseal the inside. Is that even possible?"
3.0,Its cute but its a crop too it does not fit in your pants as pictured.
3.0,"I wear a size small in everything, and sometimes I wear an extra small. So I did not think twice about ordering these pants in a small.  They do not even zip! Much too small.  Otherwise they are cute so if you want to buy them I highly recommend you size up."
3.0,"Hermoso vestido, y muy buena calidad de tela"
3.0,Small and not as shiny
3.0,"Fits just fine, went a little larger than my size and it's good. The only issue is that it began pilling very quickly and only escalated. It's a nice casual hoodie for at home, but not one I'd wear out often."
3.0,"Got this for my 8yr old son after he asked for a watch.  He's had if for a week or so and doesn't want to take it off.  It's waterproof enough for his  summer camp where he swims and is on boats, etc.  Easy enough for him to use after I showed him how it works.  Instructions could be a little more geared towards kids, but were fine for me to understand.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase.<br />UPDATE: this did not survive going in the ocean. Salt water killed it almost instantly so I deducted a star. See pics.  Still ok as long as you don’t take it to the beach."
3.0,"Had to return, it was too small in the bust area."
3.0,"These earrings were nice but much too small for my twelve year old granddaughter.  I returned them with no problem and ordered something different.  They would be good for a very young girl, though."
3.0,"I have wider shoulders, the bust area was too narrow and my bra hung out the sides"
3.0,"The shirt itself is okay, sizing was correct...but the design isn’t centered on it, so unless you’re wearing something over it, it looks off."
3.0,"Compared to my other fit.-over glasses, these are smaller and barely fit over my wire rims"
3.0,"If I had seen this before I purchased as a gift, I would have never purchased. But.. He likes it, so that is good.."
3.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and usually a size 4/6. I originally ordered a size medium that was so small it wouldn't fit over my shoulders of all places 😂 I returned it and got an XL instead and it fits much better. I would definitely size up whatever you are normally x2. Other than that it's pretty cute.
3.0,Very thin material and see thru. It runs small.the shirt is nice for an outdoor photoshoot in the beach. Fashionable not for work unless work is at the beach.
3.0,"Even though you get a lot of jewelry more than 15% of my jewelry was already broken, What a bummer!"
3.0,The material is soft but it does run a little small
3.0,"I like the silicone undersurface that is supposed to prevent sliding, but it slides nevertheless. At least it doesnt give me a headache. I have to adjust it couple times during the day. It leaves a big impression (dent) on the hair, you cannot take it off without looking funny, gotta wait till you get home!"
3.0,Definitely not compression. I bought a medium. Its a really nice tank and will keep them. If you want compression look elsewhere.
3.0,Nice and cheap!
3.0,"I bought this bag for the bright color and the overall style and shape. However, the bag is huge! I guess I didn't pay enough attention to that detail (my bad).  It can fit my Kindle and a ton of other stuff.The &#34;faux leather&#34; is very stiff. I would give it five stars if the material were looser."
3.0,The material was much thinner than what I expected and it was much shorter than what was expected.
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress and I like it quite a bit. That being said, I'm 5'6&#34; and about a size 6-8, so I ordered a medium. My boobs are not huge by any stretch of the imagination, but this dress is certain to result in a wardrobe malfunction if I have a glass or two of wine and bend over wrong. It seems like they used too much fabric in the back, and forgot that us ladies have boobs. It's still pretty, I'll definitely wear it...but with a camisole underneath."
3.0,"This seems to be well made but be careful with sizing. I am usually a Medium or Petite Large.  Being familiar with the fabric, I ordered an Extra Large and it is a little tight in the tummy area."
3.0,Inside felt material already coming unglued
3.0,I have a very oval face and these glasses were narrow so they were not very flattering for my face. But very cute style!
3.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 125lbs and it fit well but the material was too thin and the dress was too low cut for my taste, plus the blue was a little brighter than expected and so I ended up returning the dress."
3.0,"These Pjs are pretty, comfortable, but lighter than I expected.  I will save them for spring-summer and happily wear them.  I need something heavier in the winter months.  Perfect if you live in Florida or Texas."
3.0,"Returned this.  I didn't like the material (which when stretched goes white and you lose the print entirely.  The cut was a little off, but that might be more my frame.  Bummer because I wanted to love it."
3.0,"Nice bracelets, sturdy but they do turn my skin green which is a rare reaction for me. Painting it with nail polish doesn't seem like an option as it needs to move freely<br /><br />Update - Anklets began to tarnish very quickly and are now a very dingy brass. I do take great care of all my jewelry, costume and real, and can generally get much more wear out of lower quality jewelry. It is a shame as these are very pretty."
3.0,"Cute, yet small size and rather flimsy materials."
3.0,"smaller than expected, more for short hair.  Med to long hair not covered well"
3.0,Very pretty skirt but I was in search of a maxi style so I could pull up my skirt and take it off easily. This skirts design is to be tied on which looked a bit silly on me.
3.0,"I wear a size 6 shoe. I found these to be a bit short, and they also shrunk after they were laundered!<br />When I pull them on all they way, they go past my big toe &#34;knuckle&#34;, the (metatarsophalangeal joint) at first....then they start to shift.<br />When you are wearing them, they feel like they're coming off, 1 mm with every step. After a few hours, if they're still on your feet, the heat from your foot inside the shoe will help them stay on better.<br /><br />I love the neutral gray color. You won't get black sock lint all over your feet with these, but they don't stay on too well either!"
3.0,this was nice but i have average sized ears so i felt like it didnt fit correctly
3.0,I loved the look of the dress and the material was so prefect for summer. I did return it as it was too short. For reference I’m 5’4” 160lbs and I ordered a large. If you have a booty this may not work. I hope this helps.
3.0,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I normally take a large in fitted Ts, but, holy cow!!! I think this one would fit my two year old. The design is great, though. After reading reviews, I'm going to have him send it back for a 2XL"
3.0,Pretty band. Velcro closures fell off
3.0,Cute but rather small fit
3.0,"Product and seller are fine, I just went 1 1/2 size bigger than my boot size just to play it safe and I couldn't even fit my foot in it. I know I have extra wide feet so I just caution you"
3.0,"I mean, you get what you pay for. I purchased size 3/4 and they seem to be about 1mm or 2mm too big? They collapsed and wrinkled in my lobes and I put them next to some other silicone gauges from kaos brand that i own and there's a noticeable difference in size. They seem to be not cut properly some pairs had uneven edges as well. If you're size 00 or lower I for sure recommend considering the product reviews with the images look awesome!"
3.0,"Crooked, finger print on lenses, but overall good quality because of polarized lenses"
3.0,"Only needed for a Halloween costum, so it fit the bill for the price. Material is thin and I dont see washing well if you wanted to wear it over time."
3.0,"Its a cute dress. Casual, loose and comfy. Not for women who are busty. It gets tight at the top."
3.0,"The size is much smaller than expected. I ordered an x-large for it to be baggy, and it is a tight fit. Practically somewhere between a standard med-large. The design is accurate to the picture. The quality is about what you would expect from a walmart sweater. It would be appropriate for fall temperatures in the 60°-70° F, but anything under that i would be cold in just this sweater. Its not a bad sweater, however it does not live up to the expectations i had when ordering it. Just know it is smaller than normal and not a thick, warm type sweater."
3.0,"Runs small, very see-through"
3.0,Dress is beautiful but tight in the chest/rib cage area... had to order a size up..which fit perfectly in that area...
3.0,"These are really cute, but the ball in the back is really small and difficult to hold on to. the front of the earring screws on and off instead of the ball which can be a bit difficult at times. I also had one of my earrings fall out many times."
3.0,"If you want a good Frye boot that looks like a Frye - these Mexican versions are not it. I purchased this boot, and the leather is nice and thick, not shabby at all. The sole and heal appear sturdy after a few wears. Those two reasons are responsible for the three stars.<br />But the foot bed is smaller on one foot, and the shaft is too large, disproportionate to the boot. The shaft is actually stretching more and looking like galoshes and bagging at the ankles.<br /><br />It's good leather, and I paid just over $100, but next time I'll remember if it's not the original made in America boot, it's not Frye."
3.0,"So, I really loved the color navy it came in. The material is very soft but thin, just like a cotton t-shirt. I’m tall 5’8 and in me it was a bit too short for my liking. However because of the rouching, it made a great top and I kept to wear as a shirt. Really like it. But not as a dress. Also runs small. If you want it to look like the picture, I would order a side up. Otherwise it will pull the material too tight."
3.0,"Ok, so first things first,  this is not a true wrap top, so that's important to keep in mind.  The color is a little more faded/heathered in person than the image shows,  but it's still a great color. One side is folded over,  the other is not.  The folded side required some adjustment throughout the day.  Wasn't as fitted at the waist as you would imagine from the picture but still flattering.  I'll wear it often enough,  but I'm not in love."
3.0,I returned them because their weight was too light and the holes in my ears are kinda large... So the did not hang well. I really wanted them to work.
3.0,"It is a nice mask for design and color. However, it is so big and gaps on the sides."
3.0,I should've sized up. They fit ok but I know I only have a few hours in these. For $10 I will keep them! 😂
3.0,The royal blue satin blouse is NOT like the picture. The shoulder pads make the blouse not fit right and hang right. Th size Large was too big and I wouldn't have been able to go a size down to a medium. Had to send back for a refund.
3.0,"Thought they would stay on my heels ad indicated by other reviews. Ok, but not great. I'm keeping them though."
3.0,The picture showed a rose gold . The watch i received was like a fake yellow gold. Its ok but I would not buy again.
3.0,The design is nice but it's a bit smaller than I expected. The gold colour seems to be slighly washout after 1 month of wear.
3.0,"I wanted this dress for a black tie event with a masquerade theme. I was so excited!  Unfortunately it is Halloween costume quality.  It isn't fabric, it's material.  It reminds me of the sport swishy pants, loud and the ""swishhhh"" sound when you move.  It won't work for my event so I will be returning it.  It would be good for a Halloween party though."
3.0,"Gloves do not have any markings showing the cut resistant rating, however When I took a knife across the back of the glove it did not cut the gloves. The fit poor, sloppy,  but for the cost they are well worth it. I will be using these till worn out."
3.0,Looked rally cute but my son at the time wore 18 months. I ordered a 2T the shirt and bottoms were really snug. I had let him wear it the shirt open with another shirt underneath. Also the shirt was thin.
3.0,"a little to big, but looks just like the pic..."
3.0,"This fit perfectly, but mostly because of the elastic waistband that I read unaware of before purchasing. I don't know if I overlooked that detail in the description or not, but I definitely wasn't expecting it.  The front of the skirt is all nice and smooth/flat for the ties to sit nicely, but the back is all scrunched up elastic and it just makes the whole outfit look really childish."
3.0,"It looks more like a pajama than something you can wear outside.  My daughter loves it, so she using it as pajamas."
3.0,"My 8yo is excited to get a “smart watch”. It’s a nice little device, but adding an SD card was more precarious than I would expect from a Disney product. I am handy and love tech, and I wouldn’t expect most people to go this deep to perform a simple task. Especially with the minimal instructions given. “In a clean and dry location, remove the back of the watch with a small screwdriver” - no mention of delicate wires and location under the battery which is held in place with double-stick tape."
3.0,"I think I would have liked it if the chain were better quality. It looks a little costume jewelry-like. However, I’ve received tons of compliments. Even from my jewelry snob friends."
3.0,Kind of see through not a lot of stretch
3.0,Dress is more of a baby blue. Sent back
3.0,Pretty but I got the wrong size . I think the fabric was delicate and soft which is what I wanted but the dress was a bit short too. It didn't drape over my knees like I wanted it too
3.0,Shorts are too short
3.0,Not the quality I was hoping for
3.0,Great delivery time and product satisfaction. Only issue is the thinness of the material during these Covid times. Otherwise completely happy with product.
3.0,a lot of the balls break very easily  but I wear them everyday and it does the job
3.0,The cap fit my 20 month old granddaughter. But the gloves were way too big.
3.0,"Definitely no where the length that is advertised.  It is a lot shorter, but still makes for nice costume jewelry for the kids to play with."
3.0,"The case and cleaning cloth are top notch. They’re almost worth the price without the glasses. The glasses weren’t what I was expecting though, the “glass” piece actually is the entire front of the glasses. As in, it doesn’t fit into the eye holes, it’s in front of that. They’re not poorly made, just not what I was expecting, and in the marketing photos it’s not made clear that’s the case."
3.0,i love the bracelet but had to send back it broke the second time i wore it.  the clasp was always loose.
3.0,The dress is darling and as expected.  However the bow is gold rather rose gold so it does not match what so ever. :(
3.0,"The light is worthless for seeing the time in the dark, otherwise the watch is ok."
3.0,The strings to tie are super short. I like a bit longer strings in the back for me. Otherwise this was fine. It’s a bit on the costly side but this is what my fiancé wanted to cook his crawfish in for our annual crawfish boil.
3.0,The quality of this key chain is superior and I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.  I highly recommend this item.
3.0,"Got this to make a necklace for my self. I was impressed at style, yet I had to do some filing and polishing as all the edges, and especially the fluke ends, were very sharp. Don't know if this just wasn't polished enough, but when I got poked, I knew I had to get out the files. Might need to look at that part of the process."
3.0,Weird. Just weird. Very difficult to store due to the stickiness of the cup. I can see this being fine for smaller sizes but for larger sizes you will need to wear another bra along with it.
3.0,"True to size. But the top is very see through.... was not able to wear it. It’s very cute, but I haven’t found the right bra to wear with it."
3.0,"This necklace was given as a gift. It is very pretty but the writing on it was so small you almost couldn't read it.<br />It is very glittery and pretty, very well made."
3.0,Color was exact match very cute set runs on the small side. Falls apart easily. I wouldn't buy this again.
3.0,A good product for a fair price and it does work as expected. Normally that would get 5 stars from me. However I'm deducting 2 because of one GLARING flaw. The tape is VERY DIFFICULT to separate from the back part. They should have made the back part a tiny (maybe 1/16th of a inch) bit wider. Then it would be perfect.
3.0,Unfortunately the color is not a neon yellow softball color. Still a cute well fitting headband for a young girl!
3.0,"Light at your literal fingertips, but at what cost?<br />I was very disappointed with the product when it came in. I'm no stranger to ""plastic bag packaging,"" but the title referencing Father's Day is a bit misleading. This isn't packaged like a nice gift and the gloves themselves don't exactly sell that idea either.<br />To start, there were small stitching errors and fraying in various spots. The wrist strap was incredibly small. I had the strap wrapped as loose as possible and my wrist was still being squeezed into shape. It terms of design, I don't understand why they didn't use an image or logo for the power button. The left hand glove has the on/off button upside down. I had to actually check the listing to see if I was wearing them correctly, especially since no manual or instructions were included.<br />Worst of all, the lights don't point where they're supposed to. As a matter of fact, they are even pointed in different directions than pointed in the product images. Does it work? Mostly. Is it pretty? That would be a no. I couldn't see any reasonable handyman using these for very long. Especially with how tight the wrist strap is, you might be cutting off circulation to your hand just to wear them.<br />With that all being said, the listing is cheaper than most other fingertip glove lights. Kids would love this, but it doesn't seem to be marketed towards them. For the price, the value seems reasonable as long as you know what you are getting."
3.0,Material appears cheap and thin.... Poor quality
3.0,"This dress is super cute and I’ve gotten a ton of compliments on the pattern. I’m a 36C and the snap button at the front couldn’t hold my bust so I had to use a safety pin, but it works and the dress is adorable!"
3.0,Not a fan of these - the nose piece pushes the frame too far off my face and it looks a bit ridiculous.
3.0,Ordered a size bigger than my daughter wears and it’s still a little snug. And  doesn’t look so nice in person. Strings hanging from all of the lace. Not quite what we were hoping for.
3.0,Nice but the material was a lot thinner than I thought it would be
3.0,Quality of the fabric is very cheap. Wouldn’t recommend it! Wouldn’t purchase again. It can rip very easily and it’s very very super super thin. “See through”......
3.0,These fit great from hips down. After one was the elastic in the waist shrank and they barely fit over my hips.
3.0,Thinner fabric but okay purchase and shipping was so fast
3.0,"Not as comfortable as I was hoping. I ordered a xxl which I never have worn. It feels snug and no give in the material. Even the robe is snug. I would highly recommend ordering at least a size or two larger, unless you are very slim"
3.0,"face is very small, and time is tough to read."
3.0,"This was a gift for my grandson, and I wasn't happy at all with the quality.  It was very thin and cheap looking. Very disappointed, but had to mail it along with my grandson's other gifts so that he would receive it by Christmas.  They sent pictures and it looks smaller than the size is. Not a good purchase, find something else."
3.0,I didnt get the belt which is what really pull this look together. The material is not the best bit overall its not too bad. Really could try make it work if i had gotten the belt.
3.0,the sunglasses run big and long in size for a women.
3.0,"I bought a 5X so it would be a very roomy hoodie. What I got what a strangely made jacket where the maker sewed pieces of a hoodie together, tagged it and put 5x on it. I would say it is about a woman's large size, a size 16. Oh but the arms are nice and long and the hood is the correct 5x size."
3.0,"Love the way it looks in the picture, but it's on the small side, and the fabric is very thin!"
3.0,"I bought this to replace a old, discolored alloy wallet chain.  While  the chain itself is very nice, and is indeed good quality stainless steel, it is much smaller and shorter than expected.  It appears the seller included the clasps in the measurements posted.  Also, the included clasps are not stainless steel and look cheap compared to the chain itself which, although small, is actually very nice.  Unfortunately, this item didn't meet my needs as a wallet chain as it is too small and too short.  So I gave it to my wife and she's using it with her purse to hold her keys, so she's happy at least.  If you're looking for a standard size wallet chain, look elsewhere."
3.0,"Not what I expected, thinner , a little see thru , and has no give , it is tight on my hips and big thru the sleeves, has no stretch or give whatsoever. I do get compliments on the look on rare  occasions I do wear it"
3.0,"Came quicker than expected, clean, safely packaged. It was plastic, I think, surprisingly. And it's SUPER small, it's like at most as big as a 1 cent euro coin. It's nice, but it's way over priced, I think it should be $5 at most (w/ shipping), but w/ shipping it's ~$10"
3.0,"I took as many picture as I could to really show you what your getting with this purchase. I took measurements and did a comparison of a size XS t-shirt from target to the top they send. It’s not a crop top but wanted to show its true size in comparison to something relatable.<br />For reference, I’m 5’3, between 132-135 pounds, and a size 32 C cup.<br /><br />Pro’s- color matched as pictured and could be a really cute outfit for someone.<br />-it does have a great stretch and pretty comfortable<br />-for as tight as it is, it’s very comfortable, just not flattering on me…at all<br /><br />Con’s- what does one size fits all actually mean haha. Too tight and too crop top for my liking."
3.0,"I really like this watch for my job as a vet tech. I’m kind of sad that the whole face of the watch popped off the watch band some how. There are two small little pieces on the side of the watch that keep it in place and attached to the band, but maybe it was just loose? I still use it because I need to. It arrived very fast though and it’s cute. It came with an extra battery as well."
3.0,"A little big in the shoulders, and the loose collar is kind of unflattering. It looks more like the tunic for a community theater Robin Hood than a stylish work blouse."
3.0,These look strange like the photo oddly enough. Im not a fan of them at all but I cant say theyre cheap or dont block the sun because they absolutely do. Not what I expected but Ill live with them for now.
3.0,Great for the cost but not as warm as they look.
3.0,"I ain’t really like how it fits. At the image, it looks fits well on the waist, but it is squared. The tissue is too thin. And the collar doesn’t have a soft finish. And the delivery takes twice long than it should. The good side is, do not stains with bleach."
3.0,"Bottoms fit great, high waisted. The crop it a little too croppy. But really cute if you have a youthful figure."
3.0,Expected the cubic zirconia to sparkle more
3.0,The dress is longer than I thought. Good material
3.0,"Fits as expected, came with a small rip in the side seam despite being thick material. Warm and comfortable."
3.0,"The bag is smaller than expected.  I thought the bag would hold at least a notebook that is 8.5x11, but it won't.  It holds the current book I'm reading very snuggly.  There is not much more room for anything else.  The color is also darker than pictured.  The canvas is sturdy and the bag overall is lightweight.  The strap is also adjustable too on where you want it adjusted on your back.  It also comes with a built-in USB cord."
3.0,Very cute dress and my granddaughter loves it. I would have given it 5 stars BUT after wearing it only twice the seams have come apart on both sides of the dress.
3.0,"Great belt, the sizing is a little small, so I'd got 2-4 inches over your actual waste size."
3.0,Love the socks but they are super small! Bummed they don’t have more sizes
3.0,Gave to my teenagers.
3.0,very good for the price works good
3.0,Very thin fabric but looks nice
3.0,They fit waaaay big
3.0,My girlfriend loved it but said that it held everything she needed but the sparkles feel off
3.0,It is dainty and small. The price seems excessive for the item.
3.0,cute but zipper broke easily.
3.0,Pay attention to the size.  This is much smaller than we hoped.  It would fit a little girl but not an adult
3.0,"The dress is fine but it is not made for tall people. I'm almost 5 ft 9 in and it should be about 3 inches longer to meet the floor. The material is this so it is see through when stretched. I received no less than 5 compliments the first time I wore it, but u will only be wearing it with flats"
3.0,It was tighter than the stockings I got in the doctor's office. I actually can not wear them at this time. They were exactly what I ordered and good quality.
3.0,"These are pretty flimsy. The springs aren't very strong, they don't all close on their own.  And one arrived already broken. They'll do the job but not feeling confident that they will last long."
3.0,"The cup sizes are fine but the problem is that the strap length is far too short and unadjustable. This becomes a bigger issue as your breasts grow. I ordered one of these at about 32 weeks pregnant and a larger one again at 35 weeks pregnant.  I am currently 38 weeks pregnant, so obviously not breast feeding yet but concerned that I'll need to order up in size AGAIN...the only challenge is that I've already maxed out their sizes! I am currently a 36DD and wearing their extra large. The original large that I ordered still fits me in the cup but is simply too short over the shoulder causing it to ride up in the back. Admittedly, this is new territory for me since my pre-pregnancy bra size was 34B+.<br /><br />While this bra is extremely comfortable be prepared to purchase a size yourself up."
3.0,Kinda cheap quality after a wash
3.0,Product need kick pleat; which would eliminate rustling sound as you walk or take steps
3.0,"The dress that I received fits great, and quality is good, but i’m pretty disappointed that it’s not the dress I ordered. What I received is a similar style, but with a boatneck & longer sleeves, and the color is cranberry, not a true red. I hate the hassle of returns & the size that I need is sold out anyway. :( I would give 5 stars if only it were what I ordered. For size reference, i’m About 5’3” and 145 and medium fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Haven’t decided yet if I’ll keep it."
3.0,Hard to see out of and hard to breathe. Plus it is very plastic-y. Not quite what I hoped it would be.
3.0,"Buyer Beware:<br />I bought two of these shirts. One in orange and one in mustard yellow. The orange was fine a little big, but that is my fault 2XL. So with the musturd yellow I ordered XL which fit great, but the whole shirt is crooked!!!!!  It hangs crooked on your body and off. To say the least I will not wear it ever again and already washed. I wash everything new. So disappointed I love the style of this shirt, but will never order again."
3.0,The dress was what I expected for the price- thin which is why I bought it for summer.<br />There aren’t any pockets though like in the picture so I’m very annoyed.
3.0,This looked good from the pictures but not as great in person. Quality of material not as great and colour not as bright as this
3.0,This was returned - did not like fabric
3.0,I did not get the variety of shapes that was depicted in the pictures.  I don't think I will be ordering again.
3.0,"This item is a ""one size"" fit. That works OK for me because I am petite. However, it won't serve for a large woman. The length of the sleeves and the body of the sweater are very short. The buttonholes are too small, and it is hard to close. It is very soft and is a pleasing color, but this is barely a functional size for a real woman."
3.0,The dress appeared well made but was supposed to be a 3x and fit more like a 2x
3.0,Although the label says on size fits all it does not. The belt is now being worn by my 5 year old as part of costumes so i did get my moneys worth
3.0,Product is beautiful but runs extremely too small
3.0,Not as absorbent as I need
3.0,It’s adorable but runs very slim.
3.0,Cute but too big for toddler
3.0,This is a pretty robe. The colors aren't as deep and vibrant as in the picture. The fabric is a little stiff but I'm hoping  that will change over time with a few washes. I'm 5'7 160 and the robe has room to spare. The waist tie is not attached and there are not belt loops so it keeps falling away. I am going to have to add loops. It goes almost all the way to the floor on me.
3.0,It seems a little small there was some glue On the bow and there was some strings coming of had to cut it off with sissors
3.0,Awesome product but the coating on the lenses did not hold up on a windy day at the beach...the sand scratched them up pretty badly. Was only able to wear them that one beach trip :( If I hadn’t of gone to the beach then I feel these would’ve lasted me longer.
3.0,Found I needed to wear an underlayer as the material is quite thin. Not as flattering as other wrap dresses I've purchased.
3.0,Touch screen has slow response time. Not a lot of features. Time setting is not very intuitive. Not water proof; water can easily get into the holes on the side for the speaker. Don't think this will last long.
3.0,"The pajamas are beautiful and super soft however, they are SO small. I was so disappointed at the sizing. Ordered a size L , which is what I usually order, and the pants size is like a Super Small. I would say order 2 sizes up."
3.0,This shirt has an awkward flare at the bottom. Just doesn't look right.
3.0,This top runs quite small.  Order at least one size larger than you normally wear.
3.0,"I ordered one size up, it's still small."
3.0,"I got this for a friend and was very happy with the price I paid. It finally got here and I opened it to discover that every part of the buckle that was metal had rusted and was terribly corroded. I took my seam ripper out and detached the belt and buckle and was able to still gift the dress. Two less stars because they should have taken better care of their product. I give it 3 stars because the price was great, the dress was put together nicely and it looks adorable. Cute dress, rusty buckle."
3.0,Flimsy material and seems to run small
3.0,"Shorter than it is supposed to be. No matter how I measure it, it is shorter than the specs say. Otherwise seems good so far, haven't had the wedding yet. But I am very I'm happy about the length."
3.0,The fabric feels soft. The problem is that one pair looks like it's unraveling already. Maybe these are returns but not what was expected. I was going to give one pair to a friend but instead I'll need to return. There's no way to only send back the one with obvious fraying out the package.
3.0,"I like it for the most part. Just being honest though it is rolling up on me and I was hoping for better. Also I don't love that the front is so low cut, I'm mounding a little bit over the top of the bra.  I think considering the price it's not bad, I do love all the ways it can adjust, if the sizing were better I'd be happy. ."
3.0,It is alright seems was a little better quality.
3.0,Colors are vibrant.  Folds away very easily.  Material is very thin.  Which is bad.  Probably won't last very long as I can already start to see thru the brim in some areas.  But it does keep its shape after repeated uses.
3.0,Material was way too thin for what I wanted. Returned it.
3.0,get what you pay for. A bit smaller than expected
3.0,"I really liked this scarf when I first got it, it felt nice, looked nice, the color was true to the picture. When I washed it though it lost all sense of shape and softness. I am still working on how to remedy this as it is not a problem I've had with any other scarf I've had before."
3.0,"The hat is cute, but my toddler absolutely will not wear it. She’s obsessed with accessories (hats, sunglasses, etc.), but she screams if I try to put this hat on her. I think the floppy brim freaks her out. She will happily wear any other hat she can find."
3.0,"It's a nice bag, but more rugged than the picture indicated. Not quite what I'm looking for."
3.0,"These are decent tank tops, a little on the thinner side. Overall happy with the tanks but I think they should be priced much lower. Not worth $30 in my opinion, should be more around $20 if that."
3.0,"Cute outfit...but description says cotton and the pants are polyester. The bow is not tied, just a strip of material. Bought as a shower gift. Shirt says hand wash...ugh."
3.0,"Beware: This is not a dress for larger chested women! I was at the hotel before the wedding I was attending, and both the small straps in the back of the dress snapped, ten minutes prior to leaving. The dress was snug in the waist but overall fit well everywhere except the chest. I am only a C cup, maybe D depending brand. The straps were so tight and thin that they were digging into my neck leaving painful indents within the hour, so I was not so surprised when they finally snapped as I was walking out of the door."
3.0,She loved it. Heart came unglued but just used super glue to fix it. Otherwise it's a good item.
3.0,"Got these for my daughter.  They arrived with half the stripe not sewn on, but she wore them anyway.  A couple of washes and they are now also very pilled, overall, not great quality."
3.0,"The sunglasses are nice, but the frame is small, they are much smaller than anticipated, but still wearable."
3.0,"I bought this to use as a sleep shirt.  I have purchased many Jockey shirts in the past, but have been able to see and try them on beforehand. So… I thought this would be just as good.  I thought the material was a little thin.  I would have preferred a V neck, but there was not one to choose from.  I definitely use it and the sizing is fine.  Just a personal preference on the neckline."
3.0,"I love the style of this dress a lot and the fit is great,  I ordered a medium. The only thing I did NOT like was that the skirt goes to the middle of my knees, and I was really looking forward to a shorter dress.  The dress definitely needs to be washed before wearing, as it has a funky smell probably from packaging."
3.0,Use it couple of times
3.0,Received the shirt in the mail yesterday only to open it and find it’s dirty.  The shirt is cute and the size and material are as expected...  just hope it washes clean : /
3.0,These are very light weight but they do not stay up on your face if using as a mask.
3.0,"Difficult to put on, and a little tight, but all in all, they worked ok on a long flight."
3.0,not sure of the fit because I bought the wrong size. thought I would be bigger but turned out to have lost some mommy weight... (yay). I can say is that it is a bit see through. definitely need a slip.
3.0,"Nice hat, but delivery took a month"
3.0,I didn't return it because I had already tossed the bill and the shipping material. The top is ill-fitting. Not the best quality. It doesn't lay correctly against the body.
3.0,"I ordered this for a friend for Christmas who prefers a small purse, and who lost her last Coach bag. It was difficult for me to tell if this is a legitimate Coach bag because it does not have a serial number. In all fairness, Coach customer service told me that bags this size do not always have the serial number tag as I'm used to since all of my bags are large. Also, Coach customer service could not verify the seller as an approved vendor because it actually shipped from an Amazon warehouse. The purse is very cute, even with the silver tag on the front, and the little handle makes it especially adorable. My advice is if authenticity is important to you, do not order it.  I returned it, and purchased a different style at a Coach outlet."
3.0,"It was a little tight on top, next time I will size up."
3.0,Doesn’t feel super sturdy but the print is great and hasn’t broken yet (only used a handful of times for a big bag).
3.0,"I love Olukai sandals. My son needs them for the arch support, and there are no flip flops better for comfort and support in my opinion.<br /><br />We ordered the java/scuba. It does not look like the corresponding picture. The pic looks tan but the shoe is much darker. It is called “dark java”, but I was going by the pic. This boy likes his colors to all match, and it was darker than his hiking pants and shirt."
3.0,Kept slipping down<br />Really needs garters
3.0,"What's disappointing is that the dress arrived with visible signs of previous wear and it was torn in the butt area in the seam, which means it was too tight for someone's butt? Crazy. Would I keep it if it was in a new condition? Hard to say, I probably would, the overall quality of it was good."
3.0,"The paint on the tights chipped imediantly I took my first step in the cosplay and the vision broke not to mention the small hat with superglue on it another thing that had superglue on it was the vision that was made of foam and a clear rock aswell as a paper picture under the rock,it came with stains and the sizing was off , otherwise it was really cheap for how much comes with it so it’s kind of expected , the sizing was still good enough and over all it isnt the worst cosplay I have ever received and it is a great material,I might recommend this to some body but only if they were really needing one/desperate the only strings that had been loose was on the bottom of the shirt but you can’t see it with the really weird corset which isn’t like it shows in the pictures for anywon who is wondering what the black ribbon is for it’s for the corset in the back to tighten it.that’s all I have to say for this product!"
3.0,Tan small. Perfect for a gothic style dress.
3.0,Pretty shirt just not flattering on me. Also well made.
3.0,Looks cute. Measure feet before ordering
3.0,"The sleeves are seamed- like a 3/4 sleeve had pieces added on to make long sleeves, it is awkward. After washing and hanging to dry, the bottom has twisted somehow so it doesn't hang straight.  Maybe the thread sewing it together shrank or something?"
3.0,I ordered white and got grey.
3.0,I do not know why people say these are one size too big. I ordered XL because of the reviews. Should have got XXL like my normal t shirts. Will return.
3.0,Poor quality. Not worth money.
3.0,Fringe not as full as appears in photo
3.0,"It fit large. The leg cut was very high for a kids swim suit and not stop wedgies were the talk of the suit. Too bad, because this could have been a really great suit. The leg cut lead us to retire the suit before it's time."
3.0,"This is a very comfy dress ,not see through, but it shows my rolls in the back and the skirt is wide so it makes my hips look bigger. I got a large,I could of went with a medium as I believe it runs big.but it is a very cute dress. But I think it will look better on slim gals."
3.0,Though I had taken correct measurements as per directive of the site<br />Product is too tight for<br />Sliding on hand<br />Particularly from wrist to elbow<br />Elasticity / Stretchability is adequate on over all prodoct
3.0,"It's okay. It's a open weave so be aware of that. It's also a little stratchy but that's nothing a little fabric softener won't fix. The sleeves are a little short but it look okay rolled up. It also came with a overwhelming plastic smell that made my eyes burn and made me gag. So this requires a wash before wear. Not worth $10 though. Maybe more like $5 and I wouldn't be AS disappointed. It's a cute cardigan, just not very comfortable. If you're a comfort over style kinda person, I wouldn't buy this. But it's not too bad if you want something cute but don't want to pay a lot of money."
3.0,These are not designed for men with big arms way to tight and slide down. Ended up giving them to my wife
3.0,This was a gift. It’s a lot smaller than I anticipated.
3.0,These fit great and don't seem like they are seethru! They aren't as soft as some others and I really hate how off the color seems to be. Thought I was buying a muted pink but it's  definitely purple.
3.0,Very pretty but I didnt realize the inside spins around. That feature kinda makes it look cheap.
3.0,One broke for no good reason less than two days of use.
3.0,"I love the color and the style/design of the dress, it fits but it is a bit snug. I would suggest ordering a size larger than what you normally wear to get a better fit. Very light and airy which was exactly what I was wanting for these hot summer nights."
3.0,"Too large, probably safe them for later"
3.0,It didn’t look as good as I thought it would
3.0,"It’s a nice shirt but the size was wrong, they run about one size too small."
3.0,The necklace is fragile. I ordered 3 set and 1 came damaged.
3.0,"Too big, all over."
3.0,Order one size up runs small
3.0,"These are adorable - when new - to look at.  Sparkly and great color pink.  But they are a bit hard to get on (the foot opening isn’t large enough, in my opinion).  Also, after my toddler running outside for a week in these, they are already looking terrible.  Partly because the outside mesh traps and shows dirt easily, and partly because the mesh isnt very strong.  There’s already wear and tear (small holes) near the toe.  Just not a very durable fabric.  They’re not expensive but I thought they’d last a little longer for an “active” shoe."
3.0,The watch was too yellow shiny looking. I wanted more of a brushed gold.
3.0,Very large about 2 inches or more long! Just bigger than expected .
3.0,Slipped off my belt twice. It needs to be closed so you can thread your belt through it
3.0,"I typically  where an XL but purchased an XXL based on reviews.  While they fit, they were a little too form fitting.  Love the material, but these ran a little small."
3.0,"This dress is cute, really sad to return it. Don't order it if you're a D cup + unless you want to want to expose half of your tatas. The top runs small and the bottom dress part runs big.  I ordered a large to accommodate my bust area but I was still busting out of it. Everything below was extra puffy and made me looked pregnant. I medium would have been more flattering around my waist but I imagine my nipples would be showing in a medium top."
3.0,Very light frames. Bifocal is in the right place and has good clarity. Lens knock out the glare. I'm not sure if these glasses have a strong enough frame for active days. I've relegated them to driving shades only.
3.0,When you order go a size or two up. It runs very small.
3.0,"First off, this thing is really tiny. I don't mean just small, I mean tiny, like a little kid would take this on vacation. It seems a bit flimsy, but seeing how small it is, I'll just use it as a weekend trip case. I'm not sure more than 2 days worth of clothes will fit in it. I'm guessing there are better options out there."
3.0,"The cut it much lower than I anticipated, the picture is deceiving. If you're ok with rockin' your cleavage, than you will like it much more than I did! But as a new mom who is getting used to my new body I wasn't comfortable in it, and didn't take off my cover.."
3.0,Not bad just don't like the material used.
3.0,"I usually love stride rite shoes.  This was my first ""made 2 play"" shoe purchase.  My daughter loved the look, and they were very comfortable for her.  Unfortunately, after less than a month of wearing them, they look aweful.  No amount of washes will help these shoes.  There are already very deep scuffs all over the upper, and loose strands hanging off the entire velcro closure area.  I will stick with leather or suede uppers from now on, which hold up much better to play."
3.0,It's comfortable but not as supportive as I was hoping. I had a little difficulty hooking on the sides
3.0,"Ahhh... I had had really high hopes for this dress. It's just too sheer and the material too thin, unlike most of Miusol's dresses.<br /><br />First off -- the fit is lovely. I really appreciate how much Miusol is aware of sizing for women, especially considering how low their prices are.<br /><br />The ruffles on the sleeves are not as clean or simple as they might look in the picture: the ruffles on my dress just looked gawdy and out of place. I ended up tucking them under the seam when I wore it to the wedding and am probably going to have them removed for if I ever wear them again.<br /><br />But more than anything, this is not a forgiving dress. Miusol does a good job of usually using thicker fabrics, so you can get away with wearing some serious shape wear underneath. Because of the quality of the fabric and how sheer the material is, it is impossible to not show through every roll, line, or bump underneath. I ended up feeling really self aware while wearing this dress because of this. This can be easily fixed with a slip, which is an absolute must for this dress."
3.0,I only order this set because one was suppose to be yellow but to my suprise it's lime green. Not at all happy about that. Overall it's a good band but I'm not satisfied with the color!
3.0,"I love this jacket, but it's a little rough on the inside, but will work with a long sleeve shirt under it!"
3.0,"Came a bit small, had to return"
3.0,"A little Too short.  Iin this you get what you pay for cheap workmanship, zipper is flimsy back material is see through.  Just cheap all around cute cut and design though."
3.0,I can usually get away with ordering a medium even though I have D cups but I definitely needed to order a size up in this case. It's more fitted and shorter than I thought it would be but still cute and keeping it!
3.0,"It's a very nice dress..I am usually a medium in dresses but I know I have a butt so I opted for the size 10..it was so short in the back (not the lace part, the part under the lace)that I had to buy a half slip so you can't see the bottom of my butt at this funeral"
3.0,It's pretty cute. Shorter than I thought but I tie it to my handbag sometimes and then use it in my hair if I don't have a hair tie.
3.0,"I gave it away, beautiful bracelet but still a little big."
3.0,"The shirt is super pretty, but I bought the size based on the chart, but it was way off. I recommend going up a size or even two."
3.0,"Doesn't match my skin tone, I guess I'm just too pale. I also thought that they were far too bulky."
3.0,"They are super cute and my daughter loves them. I am giving it 3 stars, because one of the tails fell off on the first day of use. I just used a needle with a thread to put it back together and since then, so far so good."
3.0,If you're looking for comfy and soft sweats try the Bebe brand.  These are just not nearly as comfortable.
3.0,looks great but it's not real silver so it turns your finger green if you wear it too much.  Should of splurged an extra $10 and gotten a real silver ring.
3.0,Returned. It was an ok dress though.
3.0,They are uncomfy to sleep in. and they stick to my phone when talking. Other than that they are okay.
3.0,Is the fur supposed to be green? I've looked at pics from movie and it looks darker. Hat looks darker too - one on movie doesn't seem to be brown pleather.
3.0,Wish I had read the reviews before buying. Biggest issue is No Hem. So from now on when buying I’ll look for the DIY option. That’s the only thing in the description that might mean no hem.
3.0,Socks were not thick and warm as expected.
3.0,"The sweater felt nice, it wasn’t an itchy material. The color was as pictured. However, I ordered a small, and I’m normally medium. And it still was ridiculously too big on me. I understand this was supposed to be a loose longer sweater, but the sweater was way too big width wise. I possibly may have received the wrong size, but I’ll never know because there was no size tag on the inside anywhere that I noticed.<br /><br />Does NOT fit like the picture at all. Considering I got the smallest size, I don’t know how it could. The current price is $30. I believe this is too high and unreasonable."
3.0,So the reviews were right it is not as long as the photo implies but I still think it's super cute. I like to wear somewhat quirky clothing from time to time and this fit the bill. 3 stars because it's not as long as advertised
3.0,"Item is cute, cozy and warm."
3.0,Looks ok the red little beat but great for riding
3.0,Ad clearly indicates 2 hats ... only received one.  Amazon did issue an immediate refund so no objections there.  Otherwise its pretty much as advertised.
3.0,"XL fit like a medium and material has no stretch. Cute off, not cute on."
3.0,I think if this really fit me great I would like it more. It's bold and could border on &#34;costumy&#34;. Keep accessories to a minimum. Classic pumps. Can be pulled off with class if you have the right attitude but I wish the flowers were a little better quality.
3.0,"I really like this company but there's a difference in this compared to my other straps.  It was a few dollars cheaper and it feels like it too.  The leather doesn't look like it's going to wear well.  It's more like a very thin bonded leather.  The company does make some nice straps, just look at the slightly more expensive ones."
3.0,Quality was poor and the button broke.
3.0,These fit a little small and the cut made them tight in the crouch and buttocks.
3.0,They hurt. Expect blisters.
3.0,Cute shirt. I ordered xl and it's way too tight.
3.0,"Although light weight, it seems TOO light making it feel it's not as effective. Very comfortable though."
3.0,The color of the pants is nice. The pants run a little small but they stretch a bit. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"I loved them, they were just too small so I gave them to a friend for Christmas."
3.0,"It was a bit smaller than I expected (and my head is small-to-normal size), and scratchy. I don't see myself wearing it often except maybe gardening, because it's so unwieldy to take anywhere else. I wish I'd returned it, but I didn't get around to it in time."
3.0,These pants are cute but thin and cheaply made. I ordered a large because I am 165 lbs but should have gotten a medium
3.0,Hats ok - nothing special.  Sizing runs small
3.0,These are great and look just like the picture.. but I don't personally like them for myself. sucks..
3.0,It’s very see through!
3.0,"I expected a light gray Camo pattern...they’re actually a light blue, which is fine. I usually order a small with other leggings, ordered a medium as wasn’t sure on this companies fit, they fit fine"
3.0,"Everything seems fine with this product. Compact size, not very heavy and it is very useful. Not different from what I was expecting."
3.0,Like it but the material is thin and feels cheap. Not sure how much it will hold up after multiple wash.
3.0,"The quality of the padded underwear was definitely good. However I try both a size small and a size medium and neither fit me well. Made me bulge in all the wrong places! Returns were handled well though and I just ordered some that are higher waisted. Just for reference I am small but curvy. 5’4.5”, 117 lbs, pear shaped, small waist but big bottom."
3.0,HMM NOT AS NICE AS IN THE PIC BUT FLEXING WITH IT. LOL
3.0,"Nice watch, it fits well. The watch face is bigger than i thought, its like having a tangerine on my wrist..... but i like it for the price....... People haven't said to me yet "" wow that is a nice watch"" but i figured it s because my face is just to dam handsome and draws all the attention.....lol lol!"
3.0,"So baggy on the stomach, so it doesn’t really do anything for your figure."
3.0,Cute necklace but nothing fancy. Exactly what you'd expect for the price. The necklace came quickly and there were no issues with the seller.
3.0,"The only thing about these headbands is that they are a little small for someone who had a head size around 7-7/8 to 8 head it’s just a little tight, considering they are elastic they will feel tight around your head and uncomfortable if wearing a short  period of time. The quality is there but it does fall short."
3.0,Nice piece but cant read inscription without a microscope.
3.0,"This band fits just like the factory one, nice material and easy to install. My only complaint is the loop that holds the extra tail does not work as well as the original one. I find myself constantly tucking the tail back in, which I now realize really wasn’t an issue with the factory band. Other than that, it’s a nice change from the original black band."
3.0,"This is a really cute shirt, and the fabric is soft, but it is cut really narrow. My two-year old is a string bean, but this was fairly snug on her. Disappointed, so three stars."
3.0,These were stiff and insoles had no padding.
3.0,"hinges are a little loose but the glasses look cool and work as sunglasses, although they can get uncomfortable at times"
3.0,"The belt stretches a lot, so it does not hold.  The Ralph Lauren metal label is sewn on crooked.  I wonder if this is a factory second."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, these are decent but not glare-proof as advertised. Light off of water reflects badly into glasses and there is also a glare on the inside of the lens if any light reflects off your skin."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:286e34a2b626f251db97a2a53d503932]] Good size but not for me.
3.0,Had to have it altered to fit the snaps correctly
3.0,I got the pendant but not the certificate like it said in the description
3.0,I love this dress but the arms are cute too small. The rest of the dress fits fine but they made the shoulders and arms a bit to small.
3.0,"Great shirt, but I am 6'6&#34; tall and usually wear a large size shirt, but I need an extra large in this one it seems because the chest is small and of course the sleeves aren't long enough.  Maybe they will be in XL tall size."
3.0,Item is advertised as loose fit.  Better order bigger size.  Had to return and when I went to reorder it was $5 higher
3.0,"Cute top, embroidery is nice. The strings across the top pull a little at the edges of the neck opening, but for the price it’s a pretty solid shirt."
3.0,I'm thinner than model but it looked bad on me. Material is soft and thin. It does not have any form to it. ... Like I wrapped a drape around me. Maybe for fuller figure if you don't mind busting out the top
3.0,"While the design features are first rate, the manufacturing quality is lacking.  The materials are of quality but the hood draw string is sewn into the jacket seam so that it can't be used (without repair).  The zipper doesn't work well - I almost couldn't get in unzipped the first time I zipped it, but I believe it will work OK after I apply some bees wax.  I was promptly contacted by customer service to make things right"
3.0,Looks ok but the description of the products is not detailed enough to make purchase or to be sure of what one should expect when delivered.
3.0,I did not like it for my body shape
3.0,"Bought this dress as an easy cover up for a cruise I was going on. I loved the concept, it seemed easy and looked very versatile and like it would be comfortable.  Unfortunately,  the dress came with no instructions on how to use it in the various ways shown in the pictures and no matter how I used it, it was never quite comfortable. I think with a little tweaking, this could be an awesome product."
3.0,"I received my dress, I looked great but too small for my bust. I reordered a larger size. I got a notice that my dress was delivered and left on my front door. But I never received i was given a full refund. I'm a bit disappointed because I really liked the dress. Even though I like the dress I'm afraid to reorder another one again."
3.0,The shirt is very cheap. It's thin and the material is cheap. It fits true to size.
3.0,I will say this is an okay piece of jewelry for particular occasion.. like I wear mine on Halloween with gothic costume.. I don't think it will go very well with formal parties and other dressses..
3.0,1 size is too small the other is too large.
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress. It was snug in all the right places but the straps were too long making the bust too low. If I pulled it down in the back to cover my chest it was too low in the back since it’s already low cut.
3.0,bought  this shirt for my son i loved it  son not so much he would rather have a tshirt the only bad thing is the sizes  it was hard to pick one
3.0,Takes a long time to break in. Very uncomfortable at first. Looks bigs but the 2 big/main compartments are small. Not nearly as spacious as it looks or as I needed for work/gym/travel bag
3.0,"The ones they send you are not the ones pictured they don't look to bad but not like the pictures shows them. They are to long and thin to look real by looking at the picture they look like a 14g but as someone with piercings I can tell you that they aren't the same nor are they a 14, with that being said if you catch them on sale like I did and your buying these for a teen or pre teen then they should be ok."
3.0,A little small.  Hurts my head after wearing for a short period of time.  Will take to a tailor to see if they can make a little larger.
3.0,The skirt is long like the pictures and it looks fine. I just wish it came in bigger sizes. Was a little small at the waist.
3.0,"There is a patch on the shoulder (maybe for like a badge or course logo?). I didn't know it was on the shirt until after I purchased it. The shirt itself is fine, it just has this odd immovable patch that I wish wasn't there."
3.0,"Prompt shipping of dino PJs, however the quality of the fabric is disappointing. Very thin-nearly sheer. Both my 2yo and 3yo have worn Carter's snug fit PJs all their lives. Going into winter, I'm not really sure what to do with these. Did not expect to be able to see my hand thru the fabric."
3.0,"Clever, helpful idea...mine ripped at the seams in multiple cubes the first trip I used them on."
3.0,It is a really cute hoodie and I want to love it but it’s very boxy.  The neckline is huge and from shoulder to waist it is short.  The fit is definitely NOT as shown in the picture.
3.0,They like to run down if you have thick thighs
3.0,"Nice socks, I love the colors, but they are a little shorter than most crew socks I have owned."
3.0,"This bracelet is pretty, but won't suit my needs. Another review stated this bracelet is 1 1/2  inches wide. I ordered based on that review. My bracelet width is slightly over an 1 inch not quite 1 1/4. It fit my 7 1/2 inch wrist without problems. It is very malleable. Not sure it would hold it's shape over time."
3.0,"This is my firt time ever trying any kind of sheet mask and perhaps i was expecting too much from it.<br />I find these mask to be too small for my face, the wholes for the eyes and mouth are small and dont align.<br />The firt time i tried it, i left it on my sking for 30 minutes and it completely dried out on my face and it didn't feel good. The second time it was a little better i only left for 15 minutes but i still didnt feel refreshes or hydrated. The third time i used i applied moisturizer right after and my sking felt good but i am not sure if its the moisturizer doing the work or the sheetmask.<br /><br />Update,<br />I continued to use mask. Its nice after the shower to lock in hydration., but dont let skin dry, put on right away.<br />I used scissor to cut the holes bigger, must do it when you have it on but be careful not to cut yourself.<br />I do feel skin stays hydrated for longer but its a temporary feeling. It goes away after a while. Do use a cream or moisturizer after to lock in hydration.<br /><br />I like overall, i might repurchase if price is right."
3.0,The item was broken but is cute...
3.0,"No horn,nice horse earrings"
3.0,When I opened it I honestly thought I had ordered reeper hands. It was just unexpectedly large for her machine hands. It’s also very tight on certain fingers.
3.0,Does not offer the support you would expect. not happy at all
3.0,I ordered a medium and the bottom portion fit great. Waist line perfect! But the bust section was like 4 sizes too big. I’m not super busty and can expect it to be a little big there...but it literally gaped open and would’ve needed intense alterations to fit.
3.0,Very pretty but beads are very heavy and hard to wear.
3.0,Much darker than expected on the navy blue version.
3.0,Description says it has 7 pockets. Mine only has 4. Contacted seller to no avail. Runs on the small size. I wanted pockets but didn't get them.<br />Seeing more and more of this on Amazon.......getting to be an overpriced ebay. This is a shame....
3.0,I like the quality and the style of this vest totallly<br />Cute BUT it’s defiantly fit in china sizes and if u aren’t a petite person I wouldn’t recommend it . If u are a size xl I’d get the two ex for sure.  It runs small in the shoulders and in American sizes I never have a problem with my shoulders<br /><br />It is cotton  and it is pretty much like the picture but it is t as baggy as expected. For extra room go<br />Two sizes up. I’m on the heavier side but never above a 2xl the broadness of the arm holes is basically the width of a paper towel role.... and up high so it doesnt correspond with a women’s mid  / bra section<br /><br />Hope this helps
3.0,Booby part is tiny.
3.0,"Very flimsy,  not worth the price"
3.0,This product is very thin.  Size off a bit.  Too small.
3.0,Loooooooong. Like SUPER LONG. I could fit a second set of legs below mine!
3.0,It's quite difficult to navigate keys around in octagon when putting them on.
3.0,"I would have liked this dress more if it didn't fit like a tank, it has too much material. To say that it runs big is an understatement, which is really too bad since I do like some of the other features. I'll start with the color, it's a pretty mint green. I also like the material with its lace embroidery on it (it has lining underneath in the same color) and I also like its design with the embroidered trim. It has cute ruffles on the shoulders and there's a button in the back of the neck to loosen it. Now, I realize it's suppose to be a little bit loose with it's ""baby doll"" design, but not this big! I would recommend getting a smaller size."
3.0,"NOT as dark as I was expecting them to be, I am about to re-gift them to a friend of mine who will wear them more often then I do. Too big for my head also. Although good product, no scratches, no chips in the paint. Just not what I was expecting."
3.0,The blue was more aqua and the body kinda flimsy.  Otherwise we like the functionality.
3.0,"I don't understand why they name it size Medium but send the Large one... Of course it's too big, I'm a size 2, and since most of the clothes from China run smaller and I'm pretty tall and my arms are long I decided to go with the medium, didn't expect to get a large one though... It's not too bad, but I will need it to shrink somehow haha."
3.0,"I typically wear everything as a medium but definitely needed a large for this. I made it work because I didn’t have to time<br />To return and get new size but it does run a little small. The pants also are not full size, Capri length so I work black leggings under the pants that blended with my boots. The best under the jacket has a zipper and mine wouldn’t stay zipped but could have been due to it being a bit tight."
3.0,I love the print but it's a L/XL and it fits like a medium/small.... too short on crotch and pulls down and can't fold on top.
3.0,"It seems to run big? I got a medium which is my usual and it's super long and loose. Im 5'2"" and 135lbs"
3.0,"I don't know how I feel -- knowing what it is, I think it's pretty.<br />I never wear it anymore, because people kept thinking it was some fancy bluetooth device."
3.0,the material is thinner than I thought
3.0,"The description stated that these pants had pockets, which they DO NOT have. That was the only reason I bought these ones."
3.0,"Ordered large and it does not compress the loose skin of man boos from weight loss, probably should have ordered M."
3.0,"This is a cute bag but it's much smaller than the pics make it out to be. Since the material is very hard, you cant squeeze anything in so it really only holds a phone, a lipstick and one of those card holders, no wallet."
3.0,So the shorts kind of feel like a polyester material. They're slightly stretchy I am a 3X 320 so they fit my body just fine and they don't ride up
3.0,"It is cute, just not what I expected"
3.0,difficult to install.
3.0,I wanted to love this shoe but it gave my son terrible blisters. I will happily pass on to his cousin.
3.0,"I loved this suit! The pineapple print is adorable and the style is fashionable. I am 5’1’, 145#, I tried it in two sizes 10 and 12 and neither fit right. The 10 was close but the leg holes were too tight. The 12 was too long and the legs were cut high and the bottom was skimpy. Darn, it is such a cute suit I really wanted it to work but had to send both back."
3.0,"This hat is a basic, low quality product.<br />The front of the hat hasn’t any support & this makes reading hat difficult. The print is small and not legible unless close.<br />Color is perfect"
3.0,The wand is made of wood and is sturdy but the carvings are uneven. The dragons wings on either side of the wand don't match and one side extends down more than the other side. The shapes of the wings don't match either. Overall the carving work is sloppy.
3.0,I love the pattern but unfortunately its not adjustable and the mesh pulls on facial hair even my peach fuzz.
3.0,"The material and construction of the shorts are awesome, but the fit threw me off a bit. The crotch inseam is a but longer than other athletic shorts I own, making the fit feel tighter around the legs than expected and your thighs maynchafe a bit..dunno how else to say that. 6'2"" 190lbs, 33"" waist and mediums worked well. Will see how they feel with a pair of UA compression shorts underneath.<br /><br />Update: ultimately returned. I'm looking for something you can move in for Crossfit style workouts and these are more basketball type shorts to me as far as mobility goes. Update that and they'd be perfect!"
3.0,"Definitely not the color shown here, its lighter. Think more of a coral color scheme"
3.0,The ring was missing from my order
3.0,"I ordered a size bigger than what I wear and it was perfectly fine! The texture bothered my skin though. If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn't recommend. Or if you insist on getting it anyways, definitely get 1 size bigger than what you usually wear."
3.0,This hoodie is a christmas gift so I can't say how it wears or how it holds up but I will say this is not fleece-lined and it is really thin. It is made up of silky fabric.  That does not appear very warm. Just wanted to make others aware if you are looking for a traditional hoodie this is not it.
3.0,"I am a size 12 and the large was too big.  Also the red color was very bright. In addition, the back of the suit wasn't a flattering cut. I will rerun it."
3.0,Heavy and does not chime much - too hard to return
3.0,"Now I knew there would have to be some flaws, but you got 3 pairs for the price of 1. I ordered a Large and am a medium and they were still too snug. So I gave them to my elderly mom who is a small and it fit her perfectly well...not too tight but not overtly loose. She's also 5'1"" so the capris fit her in her height. Now it is summer in the dessert right now so the fact that its super light and some might reviewed as see through, if you wear a full cream skinned underwear, you can't notice too much. However, I will also admit that my mom has no butt. So in summary, if you are small, wear a full size underwear with no butt and are short, then order the Large where you can 3 pairs. lol"
3.0,Pretty but a little heavy
3.0,These were too tight. I've now tried many brands. This was just too tight.
3.0,Fabric is a little little on the thin side but it’s cute and fits. The stitching isn’t awful which is a huge plus !
3.0,Shirt was really cute and fit well. The only problem was that it's too short to wear with leggings so I returned. If it were tunic length I would have kept it because the pattern was great.  Ordered the leopard 3 (gray sleeves.)
3.0,I purchased this for my wife's pearls but now I can't transfer the protection to her name. I like Smart Guard and have used them for my more expensive equipment and have been pleased but I haven't received a resolution to why I can't give my wife the protection plan on the jewelry for which I bought them.
3.0,It's ok. Deff won't look as good as at the model hahaha<br />Downsize is that if you go into the water it will turn black straight away.
3.0,I got it when it was 54 dollars but it had a 50 percent off coupon.  For that price it was worth it.  One of the stones was sunk in so much that I could barely tell it was actually there.  All of the 8 names were spelled correctly and were machined nicely but I only gave 3 stars for the price point I would have expected a much more finished design.
3.0,It's okay. I would return it but the shipping would negate the cost. The case didn't feel like it would protect my phone. It has a thin plastic feel to it that doesn't seem super secure. It's just okay.
3.0,"Nothing like the picture, it's paper thin. Super adorable though and I wear it all the time."
3.0,Nice jacket but the arms are a little short.
3.0,it's a pretty dress but it's kind of small...
3.0,I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas so I can't really say yet.
3.0,"Cute and fun summer time bracelet. The product material is one step above cheap and annoying. Thus, cute for the summer time."
3.0,"Medium was just a bit too small for me at 5'6 and 160 lbs. I was excited about the zipper in the back, so that I wouldn't have to take off the entire PJ when using the bathroom. Unfortunately the zipper is useless and it has to come off. Other than that it is fun and soooo soft."
3.0,Gifted to Goodwill
3.0,the rist points are quit tight on me. harder to take off then I would like with cold wet hands
3.0,"Fabric is way thinner and more delicate than expected. If you are going to wear it, be very gentle with it."
3.0,Waist should be sized bigger for the size of pant.
3.0,Having to exchange it from XL to possibly a medium or large. Kinda hard to tell. The measurements provided are not accurate. I measured myself and technically should have been squeezing into an xL. I drowned in it and I'm on the curvy side. I loved the shirt. It's soft and it seems like good quality.
3.0,Sizing not accurate compared to other manufacturers.
3.0,I bought this shirt and it’s definitely more a fitted style. I agree with sizing up. I wore it to a friends and everyone noticed that the pocket was not placed in the correct place and sideways a little. I couldn’t return because I had already washed it and wore it.
3.0,They were cute and just like the picture but they were definitely worth the price. Really cheap feeling and uncomfortable to put in. I got 3/4”
3.0,Its really thin!
3.0,The “jewelry box is broken” unable to use
3.0,The item is too big but I will keep it because it matches my hat.
3.0,"Looks nice. Seems made well. But is at least an inch short in length, maybe 2.  True 36 (34 waist) belt should put me on 4th hole (7 holes total). This belt I had to squeeze some to make the second hole. I should be on 3rd or even 4th hole. Toooo short!"
3.0,"Not a fan, the fabric was rough and heavy for a summer top."
3.0,The colors weren’t like the picture colors so I am ordering different ones. The looks and feel are nice though.
3.0,"This dress seems to run large. I ordered the 14 plus based on measurements I'm trading this in for the 12 plus. It was maybe 3 in too big at the waist and bust. The dress is darling in person, the material is nice and stretchy and the length is at the knee and the dress has enough body that it naturally flares out that you can wear it without a petticoat. Seems decently made like it's not going to fall apart after 3 wears."
3.0,"This dress is sexy, but buyer be warned that you can see EVERYTHING. Every line, bulge or layer. Sometimes I wear with tights and you can see where the waist line is pretty clearly and if I’m wearing a bra with any back bulge, well you can see that too :/. Nonetheless, it’s sexy."
3.0,Shipped quickly. Looks good and fits well. Satisfied. Adjustable length is also nice when wearing with other jewlery and watches.
3.0,"I have very large breasts 36g so I was hoping I could just take the padding out, but it is a structured suit so it was a built in. But it was really cute. They refunded me the money fast."
3.0,"It looks like a nice band, but it was completely incompatible with being attached to a Charge 5."
3.0,"It fit great! However it was super see through, even with pink underwear! I would suggest Nude undergarments will go best."
3.0,"My wife is a size 8 & medium in everything, EXCEPT this dress.  Be certain to order a size up/"
3.0,Very nice blouse. I just wish I would have ordered one size larger.
3.0,I ordered these because I wear hearing aides. This product did not offer the effect I expected
3.0,Chain broke but my mom and daughter love them.
3.0,I know you get what you pay for but this watch won't handle any kind of physical work it feels like it would break so you have to be mindful
3.0,"Runs a size smaller and not stretchy enough, very soft fabric. Go up a size or two."
3.0,I was expected different fabric
3.0,This item arrived quickly and looks just as the picture does. My only issue is that I thought the materiel was more of a soft flowy material. This materiel is more a shiny nylon in feel and appearance. It resembled the feel of one of those Halloween costume tunics that you wear over something.  The stitching is also kind of cheaply done. I give it a three because I figure I can use it as something quick to throw on just to go to breakfast down in the hotel lobby before I come back up and get dressed for the day.  The sizing is spot on.
3.0,"Super comfortable and cute.  Black faded quickly in the wash,  though."
3.0,this outfit was cheap looking when I received it and pretty sure it is a one wear item because you can not wash it since the material is too thin The outfit was perfect in size and it was comfortable.
3.0,Good<br />Good
3.0,Bought this a while ago. After a few uses. The purse begin to rip. Not the best purchase.
3.0,"Too small, I had one a couple years ago that was same size, but fit so much better. I will give this one away. I love the feel of it, but it just doesn’t fit well."
3.0,This outfit is comfortable to a point! I was continually pulling down the legs of the shorts!
3.0,Bought it for a present
3.0,The attached necklace arrived broken.
3.0,SO DISAPPOINTED.
3.0,I specifically ordered these masks because the were 100% solid purple. That is not what I received. They look nothing like what is pictured. I received purple with huge white stripes and white ear loops. Not happy.
3.0,The fit was great. Didn't really like the tail on it. It was made from a different type of material. It was still cute on. The tail material was kid of cheap looking. Wish it was made out the same material as top
3.0,There are only 2 in the package and one of them arrived broken.
3.0,I really like this shirt a lot but I do NOT  believe it's worth the $85.00 it cost me no wayyy!!
3.0,Was not what I expected. Not as bright as shown online.
3.0,Sleeves and waist are too wide.
3.0,"I have ordered four pair.  Two were actually VIV and fit wonderful!  However, the other two pairs, although labeled as VIV, were another brand.  They were smaller and wouldn't stay put on my waist.  I'm frustrated because I do not know which ones are actually VIV and which ones are the cheap ones.  I am returning the non VIV leggings."
3.0,Paint started wearing off in a week
3.0,I love the product but fit small.
3.0,"It's ok, but would be better if the charm was two sided and used a lobster claw clasp. I lost mine after a few days."
3.0,Slit is much lower than in photo. Unfortunately I'll be returning this piece because it is too big and this is the smallest size available for purchase.  Love the flow of the arm pieces and ability to create entirely new designs of the dress depending on how you position them.
3.0,"The flower is not as big as the picture, but it still has a magical charm to it!"
3.0,"Fit great, but the white is very see through."
3.0,Kind of hard to see through. But will work just fine.
3.0,Smaller then size
3.0,Read all the reviews and purchased the Small for my son who is a size 7.  He is still swimming in it.  I think my size 12 son can wear it better.
3.0,Ran pretty small
3.0,"Tricky to install, and too big for small wrists. If you have patience and medium/large wrists, you might like it."
3.0,"The magnet was really good and strong, but unfortunately the band was too loose for my wrist. It was a little hard to attach the band to the watch. If it hadn’t been too loose, I would have loved it."
3.0,"Basic Summer Sun Protection. All 4 pairs are made of cotton with unfinished hems for upper arms, fingers and thumb holes. The 3 pastel colors were a big factor in buying this Gellwhu bundle. The grey look & feel like very light grey sweat outfits which I don't like. Without appropriate elastic bands, the sleeves slip down from upper arm and ride up from the fingers. Annoying. Hand wash/air dry.  Sleeves do provide the sun protection that is listed in their product description. Length more than covers my middle finger to mid upper arm 20&#34;.  My hands measure 8 1/2&#34; from tip of middle finger to wrist- 3 1/2&#34; palm. These sleeves work with cotton/poly sun gloves."
3.0,I'm usually a L so I ordered an XL and I'm glad i did because it fit perfectly. I still ended up returning because the color is not the same as the picture. In person it is a muted light orange. That's the best I could describe the color.
3.0,"I am not a large woman, except for ‘the DD girls.’ I bought a large, but the smooshed look was terrible. One wrong move and I may have busted out of it. If you’re bigger than a C cup,  this blouse probably won’t be a good fit for you. I was so disappointed... Its a simple, yet very elegant look, and the fabric was great quality for the price.  I wish they had an extra large, because it’s truly so pretty."
3.0,Much thinner than expected but quite long and good material.
3.0,"The shirt fit well at arm, neck but in waist was a littler smaller compared with others brands with the same size."
3.0,"I'm seeing a lot of petite sizes throughout Amazon that are 28"" in length.  Isn't that too long for a petite size?  And I rarely see short sizes.  It's very frustrating."
3.0,"Bonitos , realmente están construidos con un material que seguramente se dañará fácil , pero son muy cómodas . Espero que no se dañen tan fácilmente , las uso en sitios donde no tenga fricción . No es para. Aniñar en vías"
3.0,"not my favorite, runs small and not very soft"
3.0,I ordered a medium what I got was a xl sports bra a large jacket and small pants. I do like the material and construction though.
3.0,The bottoms are a little skimpy for a baby who will be wearing a diaper underneath...
3.0,Inside lining was damaged
3.0,I have compression socks of various brands. These were the most difficult to put on and take off.
3.0,Beautiful looking box. It's a little louder then I expected.
3.0,Three sizes smaller than normal
3.0,Very comparable to big name compression brands. My husband wears these both for working out and for work (he's very active there too). He likes the way they fit and feel. They wash and dry great as well.
3.0,"I ordered a size over my normal size and the suit was still a tad too small. It looks great, good quality, but the sizing was my main concern."
3.0,nice looking on but rips easily
3.0,I wear Size 12-14 ordered XL was swimming in it? Fabric is very nice stretch and soft! Color and style are what I expected but if unable to exchange will have to wear as a bathing suit coverup or short dress!!
3.0,"It keeps the sun off of my arms, but it has started to unthread and it is just the first week I've used it."
3.0,"It is somewhat large for me.  I ordered a small.  I am Asian, petite, 4'11'' and weighs less than 90 lbs.  I plan to wash and dry it to shrink and hopefully it will fit better."
3.0,The magnet works great but the color wears easily and too soon.
3.0,"I don't really like this color but they were limited on the other colors and the size I thought I needed. The size description on these glasses is completely confusing, I read the reviews but that was varied also. If I could I would return for a different color and possibly size."
3.0,"Pros: Super cute, mummies are tiny and detailed, seems like good material.<br />Cons: One of the mummies didn't feel like it screwed on right, but still felt like it would be okay. Lost it within 2 hours of wearing it. No way of contacting seller for a replacement, only option is to return, and honestly I really like it. I placed a ball and it looks okay."
3.0,"This is very comfortable and the ear loops are nice.  I bought this as a potential ""cloth face covering"" during the pandemic, and it seems that it probably isn't thick enough for this purpose, nor for the listed purpose of wind protection.  That being said, I'll keep it because I can think of instances where it would come in handy when a mask is required on a very hot day (dust/etc)."
3.0,Size runs very small .. I had to order 3x and it was very small and I’m a size 16
3.0,Its a bit to small probably should have ordered a size larger and I wish I would have because I loved the shirt. I gave it to my sister and she liked it.
3.0,Loved the fabric! Runs small but neckline is perfect!
3.0,"I wear a size 9 shoe and found these to fit right up to my ankles.  I have some straight leg work pants that I thought these short nylons would be perfect for.  The band around knee highs can show through as a bump in some of my pants legs or they tend to slide down as the day goes on and are difficult to get back up.  The idea of this shorter version was ideal to still have my feet covered in slides and mules but short enough to not show through fitted pants.  They didn’t work out quite as I had hoped.  I found myself pulling them up all day long.  They didn’t puddle around my feet but they didn’t completely stay put either.  After a single use they were full of runs anyway.  For the price paid I guess I should have figured they’d be disposable after a few wears but I had hoped they’d last longer.  I have a couple pair in my desk drawer as back up in case I wear a shoe bare and find it uncomfortable, but I won’t be using these on a daily basis."
3.0,"Does fit well, does needs to be fluffed before wearing to be a little more like a tutu, does not have any sparkle."
3.0,OK so I initially bought this for my moms cat this collar is well made never great quality but …. This is no way made for a cat kitten of any kind! Way too large it fits my one year old pitbull to bad he’s a boy so he cannot wear it 🤣 one thing for sure I had a good laugh putting it on him to show you guys. Again great quality just way too big.
3.0,"I though the dress would be a little flowy.  It fit nicely, just wasn't what I expected."
3.0,"I thought that a light on a watch was standard- and was surprised to see that it isn't. This makes it very difficult to see the time for me, especially since I am fairly sight impaired.  I would have bought a different one, had I realised there was no light.  This is not the seller's fault, but it was a disappointment to me."
3.0,Thick and can be worn as a shirt but there were runs in them.
3.0,These are  alright.  It is almost like wearing panty-hose material and the sizes are limited.  Because of the sheer material it is almost like wearing no socks at all.  They do have toes though.
3.0,Case did have a good variety of colors/prints. I bought the case of 24 for a back to school give a way sponsored by my church.
3.0,"Really like them. However, the Silver has already scratched off."
3.0,I was anxiously waiting for these to be delivered so I could try them on and I ended up being a bit disappointed bc there's nothing compression about them they are basically just the wicked dry fit material.
3.0,"Loose and swingy, fits fine on my 10 yo. She needed a few white shirts for youth group activity so this is a little variety. She likes the randomness of the pineapple. Cute."
3.0,"For the price, that is, $7.52 with super saver shipping, these were worth the purchase, assuming they are in fact sterling silver.  The thing that is bothersome is the card the earrings came on is designated as sterling silver, but the earrings themselves are not marked in any way, which is somewhat unusual for sterling silver jewelry.<br /><br />Regarding the size of the stones, I measured, and these are not 6 millimeters in diameter; they are 5 centimeters.  What that means is that they present to be about a carat each, which makes them on the verge of, if not in the realm of, unbelievability, if that matters to you. I had intended them for my granddaughter and was looking for something more delicate and more understated.  For CZs, they do have an excellent sparkle."
3.0,Cheap material but will be cute for once wear
3.0,Runs a little long. The material is thin and its almost see through. Overall decent purchase
3.0,Received all of them but one had a missing stone which wasn’t even in the box so I couldn’t super glue it back on even if I wanted to. Cages are hard to open. Had to use a butter knife to help me. Although ovals do fit they have to be the kind that are bigger because if not they’ll fall out through the back of the cage. Regardless they are beautiful.
3.0,"I'm grateful the dress arrived before I had to wear it. It came ripped in the chest area. The dress is pretty comfortable & fits loose at the bottom, but the 3rd to the last button will not stay button. This button is very close to a certain area. Cute, but not sure."
3.0,"Got this dress for a bridesmaid dress, color was supposed to be burgundy and gold and it is definitely more along the spectrum of red."
3.0,Fits small for Bella Dahl brand. Size up for sure. But cute top in general
3.0,"Coat is cute but runs small.  Should purchase a size larger than you usually wear and even then, it is small through the shoulders."
3.0,"I have not used it too much because it is too short, however, the quality is sturdy and pretty good."
3.0,This band is really cute and sparkly and was comfortable to wear for the price. However after a few months I threw it out as it smelled most likely from just normal sweat? I didn't wear it everyday but it definitely absorbed sweat!
3.0,Outfit was well made for the price but ran very small in the bust.
3.0,Well made but runs very small.
3.0,"I ordered a large, and ended up giving it to my teenage son who wears a men's medium.  It's a nice jacket tho."
3.0,2x NOT super large as I'd hoped.  Blue/black has black neckline edging unlike photo.  Will keep as fabric is nice - just won't wear as big vest type overshirt.
3.0,I loved the color of the dress but not the fit. The material feels like a heavy stretchy denim. I received it within the estimated time frame.
3.0,The pants are very comfortable easy fit nice to wear in or out side.
3.0,running
3.0,"Look like a well-made goggle, but they didn’t fit my face. Too muck leakage - had to return them."
3.0,"I am happy with this product. It was delivered as promised and has all the features that were described. It has 2 important elements to make it a worthwhile investment for any luxury watch: multi-directional rotation and speed selection. It also did not cost an arm and a leg. So far, a good buy!"
3.0,"Si tienes poco pecho no queda tan bien, pero el material es bueno y la forma es bonita. Las cuerdas son modificables y puedes transformar el bañador para que los laterales queden diferentes."
3.0,"I'm am only giving this product 3 stars because these are not high wasited. High waisted means it sits ABOVE THE BELLYBUTTON at your ACTUAL waist, not on your hips. The material is really thick and compressive though."
3.0,Fit well too short in the link of the legs
3.0,Looked cheap and the cubic zirconia was foggy and not sparkly. Returned.
3.0,"Product is very light and the sliders move well, but I can’t get them small enough to fit tightly on my head. Would definitely recommend for someone who has a larger head size."
3.0,Fit was good but VERY thin.  I expected something just a little heavier.
3.0,"Don't expect too much of it, this is cheap jewelry that it can be worn once maybe twice before it  changes color.<br />Do not put perfume or sweat too much while wearing it cause it will leave a green mark on your neck."
3.0,They were very affordable and looked very cheap when I opened the package.
3.0,It just wasn't long enough for my tragus. Shipping was fast and free!
3.0,"I'm 5'7 it's about 2"" from the knee.  Ordered a xl and l, I'm a size 12 and L fit best.  Bought the red and sunflower dress.  Colors are exactly like pics."
3.0,rolls up
3.0,I love these shoes! But I'm disappointed and annoyed that they've started to tear in less than a year. $39.99 for flip flops is a lot of money. I would have thought that they would last longer than 11 months of indoor-wear only.
3.0,"It's not bad for the price, but it's a bit think and the feel is of cheap vinyl. It will hold your pants up but it's not fine leather."
3.0,i like the way it looks but they didn't buckle well. was worried to lose them because of that. they are flimsy
3.0,The sleeves are pilling after just 3-4 wears. Not exactly what I expected from North Face.
3.0,"This is not a dress!!!! It does not cover a part of the body a dress should most certainly cover! The flap at the bottom after the last button is right at that spot and it opens. It is most definitely a shirt. It is long enough to wear with leggings. Its kind of thin so unless you want to look like the morning after version of a girl in a movie and walk around with a thin see thru button up shirt, you will want to wear a tank top or something under it."
3.0,"Too small, not long enough. But I already removed all the labels and washed it."
3.0,"I didn’t like how thin the material is, it was a bit too flimsy for my taste.  I prefer the heavier canvas type aprons.  Worked well for a single night use.  Used it for my Halloween costume at work."
3.0,STRETCHES! Go a size down because my true size looks too large on me.
3.0,Christmas gift pretty sure he's gonna to like it
3.0,"Good pants, all zippers broke."
3.0,I do not recommend this particular version of this jacket.<br /><br />I expected the Large size of this jacket to be longer.  Unfortunately is mostly just wider in size.  The leopard print is much more loud in person than it appears on the website.  I do not care for the fit or fabric print.  If you are in to fake leopard prints in non-leopard colors maybe you'll like it more than me.<br /><br />In a pinch this will keep you warm and the fabric feels good on.
3.0,"This product is really soft and light - almost like pajamas. It feels really good, but I am not really comfortable going out in public in it. I am using it mainly as lounging pants.  BTW, the drawstrings in front are just decoration. They are merely sewn on and do not allow you to make the waist tighter. I cut them off about 3 seconds after I realized they were worthless."
3.0,I like that they don’t slip but they are super thin not great for wearing with sneakers.
3.0,"im a very short and small individual when i ordered  i didnt fully check the sizes and just assumed it would fit, it was too oversized. Very cute dress and extras. Simply the sizing problem for me."
3.0,"Not crazy about the fabric...it feels a bit flimsy but, well, it's not my favorite, but it's okay."
3.0,Heavy weight fabric. Maybe I should have chosen a different color.  Just not a great fit sent it back
3.0,I ordered a women's medium shirt. The package clearly says women's medium and the shirt is a mens medium. Needless to say the shirt it is too large. However I have a ton of over sized t-shirts so I will still rock this shirt:)
3.0,the bag is cute<br />but I returned it<br />way to small for me.
3.0,"Comfy enough, but so wide I have to be careful fitting it through the belt loops on some of my garments. Not convinced it was overall worth the price."
3.0,Bought some goggles and when they arrived they were nicely packaged<br />Sorta cheesy it snaps and you have to snap them going opposite way so goggles aren't going same way so that kind of annoying
3.0,They ripped after the 1st wear for my 6 year old. She had only worn them for 1 ballet class.
3.0,Just was huge on my spouse - would make a good dress on him
3.0,Ordered 2 of these dresses. One fits perfect this one can’t even button across bust ..so disappointing!!
3.0,Lo usa mi hija debajo del skrob pero es muy fina la tela
3.0,It is cheap and it is just how it is. In general okay but the leaf pattern is a bit blur.
3.0,"very disappointed.  I like the fabric but because of the sheer quality of it, it should have been a larger cut.......probably will give it away....."
3.0,"This is an attractive sweatshirt, but it is so thick and heavy it isn’t very comfortable to wear. I was expecting a regular sweatshirt weight. This thing weighs 2.6 lbs!  It has a very heavy fleece lining similar to a Carhartt sweatshirt or jacket, making it rather stiff and uncomfortable. However, if you are looking for a very heavy, warm sweatshirt this it. I cannot imagine trying to hand wash this thing, it would be so very heavy and hard to manage wet. I am 5’6 and 130 lbs.  The sweatshirt fits loose and baggy and hit about 8” above the ankles. I really wanted to like it, it was just to heavy and thick for me."
3.0,"The deep blue is gorgeous, but this brand consistently runs so large. I returned because it's just too big."
3.0,"It is okay -- i wear plus size, and this material, although super comfy, is too thin and hugs all those places i would rather not show off :)<br />Too much of a hastle to return, so will wear at bedtime since it is comfy (or I until I lose a bit more weight!)."
3.0,as advertised but just too limp for  hanging and quickly accession little items.
3.0,Socks tend to roll around yr thighs
3.0,"These socks provide decent compression,  but are much thicker and heavier than the compression socks I'm used too.  Keeps my legs too warm.  The top band is also tighter than other brands that I find more comfortable."
3.0,"Classy looking, but band soils easily and the date function does not work properly."
3.0,"Vibrant colors, and pretty design. But the material is a cheap rayon type, not cotton and it slides to the back when you wear it. Also runs very big, size down."
3.0,"I ordered a large when I usually wear a medium and they were still too small. Also, each color runs a bit different in size. The pink one fit a bit larger than the green one."
3.0,"Originally gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks it became apparant that when I sweat a lot it looses it's connectivity and doesn't record my pulse rate, it keeps callin for a manual touch.  Very disappointed as I have owned several sportline watches and this is the first one not to work as well as I needed it to."
3.0,"I expected this to be an asymmetrical hem, but it is super wonky- like they were going for asymmetrical bit got the patters off by about 2 inches. The fabric is a very thin jersey, which is perfect for the summer heat. I'll probably redo the hem... it is just too weird."
3.0,It’s nice color and nice style but the material is not good. I exchanged my mind and I will keep the item. Thank you
3.0,The sweatshirt had a small smudge of something on the bottom. The color on the cuffs and bottom were not as white as the rest of the shirt. There was no tag in the collar of the shirt so I believe it is not the real manufacturer of the shirt. But I am going to keep it. Not going through having to send it back. Going to wash it and hope the color is better than when I received it.  Keep being late on my orders I will not renew my Amazon Prime. I got prime to be able to receive it quicker.
3.0,"I'm 5'4"". I literally am going to have to take 3"" off the bottom."
3.0,The Item is as described and appears to be of decent quality. they will work for my purpose. It is a lapel type pin with the pin being offset to the top of the back of the small button. The button is flat like a coin and is thinner than it looks in pictures. The quality is decent and for the price I think it was a good buy. The seller shipped My package many days after getting the order and tracking. The Shipment was late due to this. I tried contacting the seller but got incorrect responses that were not helpful. Would think twice before using this seller again for purchases.
3.0,I ordered an 2x and received a S will be returning. Pants would have been perfect in the right size. I won’t get to exchange in time for the party
3.0,"This dress is ok.  It came out of the package pretty wrinkled and it smelled ...chemically (I can't think of a better way to describe it.)  The dress is quite snug so if you are deciding between 2 sizes I would order a size up.<br /><br />Pros: The material is quite thick so it doesn't feel cheap.  I really like the sleeves and how the back fits - the cutout is nice but it's not so low it shows your bra.  There are boob pads built into the dress but if you have a larger chest they might not be enough.  The bottom is stretchy so it's very comfortable to walk in  I ordered both the green and the royal blue and the colors are gorgeous!<br /><br />Cons:  The ruching at the top doesn't lay as nicely as it does in the photos.  You might be able to iron it out; I didn't try.  The bottom seemed to have a bit of extra fabric so it looked a little sloppy.  The dress hit me at an awkward length - a few inches below the knee.  I'm short (5'2&quot;) so that happens a lot but I expected it to be a bit shorter.  If you are taller than I think it'll fit you fine.<br /><br />I'm going to be returning the dress because it didn't fit me right, but if you are looking for a cheap cocktail dress this dress looks pretty nice so it's worth a try."
3.0,Pretty but don't like the cubic zurcibua backing.
3.0,It's way bigger then I expected didn't fit me it fit my son he's 6'1 and has double the face I do.
3.0,"I love these earrings so much because they are the exact size and weight I was looking for. Unfortunately I only got to wear them once because the clasp on one of them totally broke. There wasn't a way to fix it. I sent them back and ordered another pair right away because I loved them that much. So far I've only worn the new pair once and one of the clasps seems looser than the other. I'm really hoping it doesn't break like the previous pair, and if it does, I won't be reordering."
3.0,Nice socks but slip off after wearing them for a while. Probably need smaller size.
3.0,"love the shoes, however, the elastic has worn out quickly."
3.0,They are great.  I want a karat and a half now.
3.0,"color and material of the scarf is nice ,,The stone id big and the metal frame looks cheap. I would have doubts in buying it if I had it in my hands in a store"
3.0,It’s not as loose as it looks on the pic... I was expecting a more flowing fit on the bottom
3.0,"It's pretty, like the colors.  I thought the dress would be longer, like in the photo, model must be petite.  I'm 5'7"" and it's much shorter on me."
3.0,"This more for an infant/toddler.  Not for ""Boys/Kids"",  it is very tiny.  But, had to use for event as very hard to find a silver bow-tie."
3.0,The suit is lovely but I ordered later than I normally do and it was just to tight
3.0,Thought it was going to be white with black writing-just like it shows online but it is silver color with black writing.<br />Still think she will like
3.0,"These are thick tights that are see through if stretched. I ordered a plus size. I weigh 162 and am 5' 7&#34;. These &#34;leggings&#34; are not what I was expecting and I'm honestly disappointed. If you are concerned about your under wear showing through, you might want to avoid this purchase. If not then you may love these. Price is great."
3.0,"The colors are pretty, but the elastic in the back prevents it from draping as nicely as it does in the picture. I'm 5' 10"" and wear a size 10 dress. The dress is actually a bit shorter in the back than the front. I'd guess that means the dress is a bit small on me. I have 36Ds and they fit fine in the dress with one of those stick on backless bras. It just took some adjustment to get the dress tied at the right height so it looked right.<br /><br />The material is on the cheaper side, but the dress is lined. If it wasn't the purple material would be completely see through. I just wish the slip was a normal length, it's kind of odd at mid-shin on me.<br /><br />I think if I cut the slip shorter and relax the intense elastic on the back the dress will be perfect."
3.0,"This is an adorable romper. It's on the small side so size up but be aware that when you do, the arm holes are huge so I had to have my daughter wear a camisole underneath. (see 2nd picture) Though it looks nice, there were a lot of flaws that made me think, did I receive a sample item from the vendor? First, there was no label inside the garment that indicated the maker or seller's name nor did it have a label saying what size the romper was. I literally received a blank garment. I can deal with that but I was impressed with the quality. You can see in the 3rd & 4th pictures all the sewing flaws. The threading around the button hole was coming undone and you can see all the extra pieces of thread/stitches peeking out of the garment. Had I not been given this item for a review, this would be something I would've returned to Amazon because I don't know how this will hold up after multiple washings."
3.0,It's a nice boot but seems to run on the small size. It fits but pinches at the toe. Maybe it will stretch with breaking in.
3.0,"The item does not have the brass and fabric enclosure. It's Velcro. It's not a bad hat, but I felt the need to leave feedback because the description is inaccurate. The seller told me the original item was discontinued, but they still need to edit the item description so people will know exactly what they are buying. It may also take a long time to receive the item. I purchased the item in early December, and received it on January 21."
3.0,"Fits well enough, though needs ironing. Kind of feels like a hospital gown."
3.0,Used it for less than a week and had to fix the strap. It started fraying and coming apart. Other than that it's a great size bag and I love the pockets and room
3.0,I am basically happy with my charm.  The only thing I'm worried about is the ring that holds the stone<br />and the loop that holds the jump ring.  I'm wearing it as a charm on a bracelet and they are both a little frail.<br />I would order again however that is my only complaint.
3.0,"Bought for my grand niece, she thought they were too big"
3.0,"This pin is a really neat concept. I bought it for my nephew and although he does really like it, I was a little bit embarrassed by how small the text is on it. It basically looks like a pin of just a plain pig because the text is too small to really be legible."
3.0,I like these but they run small. They fit my daughter
3.0,I'm not a fan of the material it is made of and it gathers in the crotch area so it looked kind of like a diaper. Fit snugly on thighs but didn't set well on hips or waist. Gathers in wrong areas. will be returning.
3.0,"This is an ok hoodie. It is soft but it’s a little long for me. The fit is just a little off.<br /><br />However my primary concern is with the color. The color is not at all what is in the picture, it’s more orange. Not what I wanted"
3.0,"The dress is a beautiful color, but it had some detailing that I didn't see in the picture (blown up). I ordered it in a size up so that the sleeve would fit my upper arm, that didn't work. 😔"
3.0,"Fits weird, gave it away. Arm sleeves are super wide and tight around the waste. Not like the old school Russell sweatshirts."
3.0,Though it is beautiful the arrow is WAY smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,For 10$ it is what it is and I guess you can't expect much. It's cute just super super thin material which I didn't expect.
3.0,Good color's good design but it's a little tranparent
3.0,stones smaller than they appear in picture.wasnt bad for the money  but glad i didnt pay full price
3.0,These were fun to open! Cleaned the peach ones with salt and they are shiny! The oysters smelt like the ocean. My kids and I had fun.
3.0,Love them but they run a little small.
3.0,This was a tad larger than expected and the color was a lot different than the picture.
3.0,Dislike?
3.0,"They came in a small zip bag, not organized at all."
3.0,The gloves are super cute but not thick as claimed and will not be warm in real cold I live in real winter weather and need warm not cute gloves
3.0,"A little big, but not big enough to return... As a novelty it's great."
3.0,"This product works but you are going to be very surprised when you see that’s its a very thin piece of formed plastic.  The box it comes in probably costs more than the plastic collar. And it costs $25.00?? For what?  It barely thicker than the plastic collar you get with a brand new dress shirt.  If this thing was cheaper I would buy enough to load all my shirts in advance.  But at $25.00 I only bought one.<br /><br />I know, I know! I didn’t have to buy it but there is nothing similar.  This would be a great opportunity for a Chinese knockoff.<br /><br />However it does work well.  It doesn’t move much but I did have to use dapper dots to keep it in place."
3.0,"I like the color of the dress and the style, but had to return both sizes I bought because the length doesn't change. I personally hate that the length doesn't change when the size changes, because as a shorter person I don't like dresses to be too long because they make me look even shorter. Great dress for tall people or people who like their dresses on the longer side. Those who fit neither description, don't buy this dress."
3.0,Really cute but thin material.
3.0,The material was not what I was expecting and it's very long
3.0,Liked the dress but had a tear in the seam below the zipper the first time I tried it on. Very stretchy material suggest getting a smaller size if you want a snug fit.
3.0,"I bought the bigger size for comfort, but if you want to look cute order a size down. This shirt definitely gives off “ ebenezer Scrooge “ vibes."
3.0,"I ordered this watch for my 5 year old son. It is really big! Much too big for a little boy, this is a man's watch. Nice colors, good price, fast shipping."
3.0,Great looking watch.  The size and weight of this watch is impressive and I like it very much.  The band is great.  I get alot of compliments on it.  My only complaint is that the watch runs fast.  I gains 1 to 2 minutes each week.  I've had to reset the time a number of times since I've received the watch.
3.0,"Picture and description both confirm these are screw-back posts, the ones I received were not.<br />Two other buyers state the same experience."
3.0,The shoes are great. The light up is pretty amazing. BUT they are very small. My son is a solid 13 & i ordered a 13.5 so there was plenty of room for thick socks. The 13.5 couldnt be pushed onto his bare feet. Nor would they fit my younger son with size 12 shoes. Order At least a full size possibly 2 sizes larger then needed. I need to return/exchange them. Hoping the next size up works because my son loves them
3.0,"This item was a little small and I have a smaller head. Was disappointed because overall, I do like the design and the fact that the ear part is lined for extra warmth. Can be itchy sometimes."
3.0,The product and the pictures look nice but once I purchased the product it didn't fit true to size so I had to get rid of it and just give it away as a gift.
3.0,"If you are a C cup, even a full C, these can actually work.  At a D or DD...there's coverage, but big boobs just weight too much to be held up by the adhesive.  You also get spillage on the sides.  That being said, these would be great for anyone wearing up to a full C or possibly a small D, but you might be pushing it."
3.0,The product was super cute and a soft material - not typically what you get from amazon. It just ran too small for me.
3.0,"For the price, it's alright. Not the best workmanship but not shoddy. Nowhere as pretty as the picture, but then most things aren't... worth the price, but not more.."
3.0,"I ordered by the size chart and was very surprised at how BIG it is! Nicely made, the pockets are clever. I'll return and buy 2 sizes smaller!"
3.0,Ok for a young girl
3.0,"This is true UA coldgear and works as intended... 2 notes, first: if you have a rather large head (I wear flexfit hats size L/XL) it will come up a bit short in the front exposing your throat a bit (so wear a scarf or if like me for tactical/hunting use, buy a UA coldgear shirt with a high neck -not crew). Second: if planning on shooting with this over your nose, expect any eye protection to fog up regardless of what type. Just take it off your nose to breath and shoot :)"
3.0,"good quality shirt and timely shipping, just make sure to order a larger size"
3.0,I ordered the XXL and had to give it to my sister who is a Medium. Definitely won't fit it in myself.
3.0,Beautiful print but was too small for a large.
3.0,"It's pretty, I love the design."
3.0,"The good thing about this product it comes with the Drawstring bags for each one if you want to keep them stored in the bag it comes with 2 a long one and a smaller one. the bad thing for me with this product  was that I found it hard to use for myself, my husband could use easily  because he has good arm strength! But if you’re like me and you have carpal tunnel Or arthritis and your hands are wrist’s it’s then I don’t recommended it! It will be very hard to use you would only be able to grab and pick up something like paper or something like that but if you need to reach a can or something heavy in the cabinet or something high if it’s heavy at all this is not a good product to use for that. But I’m sure it’s a good product for anybody else I just wasn’t easy for me."
3.0,I have been using it for a 2 months but the Velcro is not holding up now
3.0,These are not true to size. They are tight on my. I wear xl and these fit like a large.
3.0,deff runs small an i had to sew an few of the straps back on..
3.0,"Very cute for my mermaid Halloween costume. I'm 5'3 175 lbs and bought xlarge. It was a little long, I had it pulled up high. Should've bought the large because it has a little stretch but I didn't want to risk it being too small. I got so many compliments but by the end of the night (about 4 hours at a bar) it had 3 rips in the bottom where the 2 different fabrics come together. Wouldn't buy again but it was fun while it lasted."
3.0,What did I expect? Fine for the price I guess but flimsy and a little uncomfortable. We’re using them for a Katerina kitty cat costume and dyed the bow using water and acrylic paint.
3.0,"The clear holders the end don't grip particularly well. They loosen fairly easily, causing the stems of my glasses to fall out (especially the narrow ones.)"
3.0,Disappointed that the ribbon came as cream and not the pink/ beige contrast color as shown in the photo! Came on time. Came folded up with crease marks all over it too. Not thrilled but not completely unhappy.
3.0,"The velvet does slow the ‘slippage’, but this still sneaks off my head. I have very very fine hair.  It’s very pretty. I wanted it to work."
3.0,Runs a little small. Love the style.  Also the color is not white..it's more of an off white; winter white color
3.0,It was too small when other brands fit well
3.0,"Very cute, but cheaply made. For the price though I really can't complain."
3.0,"Only recieved one, I was under the impression that it was a set of 3"
3.0,"Really cute jacket, would love to keep but need to return for 1-2 sizes larger. Bought XL but it fits more like a Med for me."
3.0,Not expected
3.0,I like the quality for the price...but I thought they would be a little wider in width.
3.0,My daughter likes them but she's only 12 and can only wear the plain band because the other rings are much too large.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, it was very inexpensive, and the quality is cheap. Very lightweight fabric used for hat, very thin and cheap. Would not buy again."
3.0,"Fabric is awesome and it was true to size, except during the second wash both of the bottom buttons fell off!"
3.0,"Ordered a black one and loved it! soft cotton and I am using it as maternity wear. Then I ordered anther one in navy and its not the same material at all, really rough thick cotton, doesnt stretch as much (think of like a REALLY cheap stiff sweatshirt material) and is MUCH smaller than the previous one I ordered. i'll probably still keep it and just wear it postpartum, but disappointed that the black and the navy varied so much (also maybe explains why the navy was cheaper in price too....)"
3.0,"I recently purchased several different pairs of colorfulkoala leggings. I got the buttery soft ones with 2 pockets, the ones with the pocket in the waistband, the regular leggings, and then these (the seamless ones with pockets). I loved them all, except these. I’m really frustrated with these! Everything about them is perfect, except for the annoyingly ITCHY SEAMS. I thought maybe it was just me, but I read another review saying the same thing.. so I know it’s not just in my head. I know if I were to wear these to the gym and get all sweaty, the itchiness of the seams would drive me crazy and I won’t ever wear them again.. so I will be returning these. Unfortunately. Such a shame! Colorfulkoala, please fix this!<br /><br />Size info: 5 ft 1, 140 lbs, size 6 or 7 in jeans. I got the Small and they fit well. Probably could have gotten a Medium too."
3.0,So amazon wouldn't let me post the first review...which unfortunately lowers the rating on this further. It's a great axe and it is enormous!!! Used it for a viking shield maid costume and it was a huge hit! No pun intended! ;) first 2 that arrived were not in good shape but amazon fixed the issue and I couldn't have been happier. This is a great product. :))
3.0,"Los seguros de las bandas son de super mala calidad se quiebran al medio tocarse, las correas super lindas, fuertes y suaves."
3.0,"I had to return this dress. I ordered my usual size since many people said it fit true to size, but I knew my large bust could be an issue. The dress proportions seem more suited for a smaller bust size and larger waist. I ordered a size small, which the size chart lists as fitting a bust size of 33.5&#34; and waist of 27&#34;. I normally wear a size small, my bust is 34G/ 40&#34; and waist is 27&#34;. I was able to zip the dress completely with no problem. The waist was too big and the bust was tight. I wish I had measured the dress before I returned it, so I could give you its flat measurements.<br /><br />While it wasn't suited for my body shape of a busty hourglass, if your figure is more rectangle or pear shaped, this dress will probably flatter you."
3.0,"These socks are well made & comfy, but need to come in more size options in order to treat Plantar Fasciitis ."
3.0,Nice watch but the buttons fell off about 2 months after getting this delivered. You get what you pay for with this item.
3.0,"I normally fit a xl, but I prefer bigger, so I got an XXL but it fits like an XL, plus ,the fire is on the wrong side, it should be on the right and the ice should be on the left. But, the quality isn't complete crap do if you're looking for a cheap hoodie (with the fire on the wrong side 🙃) then I'd order it 2 sizes bigger. 😗"
3.0,Sizing chart is off. I followed it and my order was way too big.
3.0,"The posts were both bent....I somehow straightened it but I was afraid to break them...i guess, you get what you pay for."
3.0,It should have a 5 star but it's sizes run super small. I ordered XL. Actually American sized Medium. I kept kept for my daughter.
3.0,"This necklace was very beautiful I just didn’t like the fact that it came scratched up on the letter part like if someone already used it up, but it was pretty over all"
3.0,"I loved this coat but I had to send it back because it was way too big.  I ordered according to their size chart but it was at least two sizes too big.  I would have reordered in a smaller size but it was quite expensive compared to the larger size.  Also, the belt is elastic so you can't cinch it in.  And zipping it was hard, it has two pieces of fabric that get caught in the zipper very easily.  That was too many strikes against it to pay the higher price for the smaller size."
3.0,"Shrinks, have to hang dry to shrink less"
3.0,after using it several times it gets watered down
3.0,Straps ripped out after a couple of days and to sew together
3.0,Lights on one glove did not light up all the way. Didn't notice until it was too late to return as it was a Christmas gift.
3.0,"Too tight. Size up.<br />Cheaply made, there’s not even a tag in the shirt. Size Up"
3.0,This was bought for a costume party. You can clearly tell it is a wig especially on me. I am fair skinned so this is very dark compared to my normal hair. We had fun with it though afterwards playing around trying it on. Looked funny seeing people with totally different hair in an instant. If you want a decent costume wig this would be it.
3.0,Honest review here. This dress is sexy BUT! The neck is too large or something. They could have done better on the neck. I ordered a medium which fits good.Didnt have time to return it and it was shipped fast.
3.0,"I found the listing misleading.  It says ""earrings"" and not ""earring"" and I had to order another.  As far as the product itself, it's very nice and my son loves them."
3.0,Doesn’t have the built in hand mittens as the regular Carters PJs and material is thin material.
3.0,"I ordered the hoodie as a youth large, but it was more of an adult large.  Be cautious on the size.  However, the quality was good as far as I saw.  I returned the item to Amazon with no issues."
3.0,Arrived on time but it's extremely long and big. Get a size smaller.
3.0,These fit very tightly even on my kids. Not what I expected. If looser they would be better. Very thin.
3.0,Even though I am pleased with the design and length the quality wasn't great. I washed it and it ripped from the bottom. I was so disappointed 😞 I really liked it.
3.0,"Runs a little small a little tight on the elbows, also a little bit short around the sleeves"
3.0,I loved this phone casebut it wore out to quick. Wear and tear took it after 6 months
3.0,"I ordered this dress in a medium in olive and it fit perfectly.  The gray just arrived, also medium, it is much longer and bigger.  I don't know what size to get to exchange it."
3.0,light weight and cheaply made....will probably not hold up too well after a few washings
3.0,Filtra el agua no protege de la lluvia
3.0,"Love this bra and the fit! The only thing I would mention is that I immediately thought I would wear it all the time - I put mine in the wash and it’s already pilling. Planned on getting every color but not anymore, so bummed!"
3.0,"Super comfy. More of a relaxed fit than what I was expecting. Not very flattering, hides your shape."
3.0,Shirt is a bit tight on the chest. No room for shrinkage.
3.0,"Great looking shirt, but had to return because the sleeves were too short in M, L, and L+, at which point the rest of the shirt was loose. Sleeves don't increase much along with the rest as the size increases. May work for people with shorter arms."
3.0,"The shoe charms keep falling off , the glue is not holding so I lost 4 of my charms so far.The butterfly is a different and better quality if you look carefully .Not fitting tight in the hole"
3.0,"Skirt was of course a little small, but I knew it would be. It's intended to be a costume piece so it's more slutty, Halloween themed, than &#34;out for a dinner with your parents&#34; type of outfit. I'm 5'4, 130 pounds and it fit fine. The waistband was stretchy. Wore mine to a 90's themed bar crawl because I was dressing up as Cher Horowitz from Clueless."
3.0,"First, these are European sizes, not US. Also, it recommends to order one size up which is completely wrong. I ordered a larger size and it was so small. The band was about 3&#34; too small for a tight fit. The cup was about 2 cups too small and I ordered a size up! I gave it 3 stars because the material is nice and it is made well, it was just too small. Although my husband got a good laugh out of it when I showed him what it looked like on! LOL I would buy a larger size, but unfortunately they don't offer one."
3.0,It’s fine. A little small in my oppion. Material feels worn. I would have returned if I didn’t miss the window...
3.0,Cute-small... colors look just like pictures the only drawback is that the triangle of fabric are so small.
3.0,Fits on my head just fine but the front portion of the hat where the puma sits is huge!  Sits 3 or 4 inches off my forehead. Looks ridiculous.
3.0,Provides okay support if you have room in your shoe to add foam support. The material is very rigid and has no cushion of its own.
3.0,Not for little ones. It’s way to big for kids.
3.0,This is cute but it's really big. I bought it for my 2 year old but it doesn't even fit my 3 year old who is just a little bigger than my 2yo!
3.0,"The material isn't as soft as I was hoping it would be, and it fits much tighter around the shoulders and hips than you would think by looking at the picture. I would order a size or two up in order to get a fit like the photo shows."
3.0,"Better instructions would be nice. Other than the fact that I can't figure out how to change the volume or get it to stop on a station, the sound is surpringly good for such a small device"
3.0,"El body no me gustó la calidad, trae todo pero yo use otro body distinto! Mi ig es stephotmesss y tiktok stephotmess ahí pueden ver más fotos"
3.0,"Loved the dress style, not crazy about the material (not very breathable), smaller than anticipated. I normally wear a small and this was too tight on me."
3.0,great concept!  If you're keeping more than 5 or 6 cards it comes undone all the time.  Seriously love the profile but in cargo pants it comes undone every time.
3.0,"Its a pretty nice design but, it has a hole in the middle where change fall out"
3.0,Just a little large. But other than that its great
3.0,I’m exchanging them in the hopes of getting one that looks like the model used
3.0,"I didn't expect the shirt to feel like spandex moisture wick shirt, expected it to feel like jersey cotton shirt. It is soft and comfortable, the fit is slim, and true to size."
3.0,"Great slippers, perfect fit and just the right amount of arch support.<br /><br />Update after 3 months of west.  Stitching of sole to top is coming undone rapidly.  Pieces of sole are falling off.  Unfortunately the quality is missing."
3.0,"I really liked this tote and the purse.  Fashionable and great size for travel.  I have only had it a few months and the handles are starting to ripe apart.  I would hope to get longer use out of this item.  Except for that, it frustrates me because I really like the look and size of the tote."
3.0,It looked frumpy. Was not flattering.
3.0,"My son is 3.5 and 40lbs with sensory processing disorder. I wanted to try this out while we waited for his prescription compression suit. From reviews it looked like he could probably fit into it.<br /><br />Right out of the box, the black bled onto the folding paper (kind of a red flag) because I don’t want ink bleeding on my son. I washed and the top and bottom both washed fine with no bleeding on the washer or dryer. I tried them on my son and they were huge. They would be fine if it wasn’t compression but, these were meant to be compression.<br /><br />Now that I washed them, I can’t return them."
3.0,"Super cute.  Material is little thin but, on the plus side  ?<br />It’s the one I grab on those super hot summer days !"
3.0,They are tiny hoops.
3.0,Cleans pretty well but gets dirty super quick and I dont know how to clean the clothe itself - but definitely worth the price.
3.0,"I don't know if I would wash them to much the tread work is not good, but if you want cheap this is your tie!<br />I dont wear ties much so it will probably last me a long time (special occasions)"
3.0,Run small have to have a small face for ear warmer to fit<br />But a great mask if muff doesn’t fit cut them off
3.0,My XL gray charged cotton t shirt is my favorite shirt ever! This one seemed like a no-brainer but it runs a little big.
3.0,They run a little bit small but do provide the separation I wanted.
3.0,"Fit about as I had hoped. 3 out of four of the shirts were what I expected, and the shirt I had been most excited about was a totally different material. The neck is very stretched out and is very loose. They will work for what I needed but definitely disappointed."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Looks good, but also looks just as cheap as it is."
3.0,"Had to return dress, too long and too big in bust area"
3.0,"This product is very cute, however it is short in the front and the stitching that holds the fabric together is very fragile. Sadly, I would not buy this product again"
3.0,"It's cute but small. Couldn't get it to fit on. Maybe my neck is to big, idk."
3.0,"Love these pants, they are just a smidge too tight. Im going to need to size up for sure so I can have a lounge loose feel."
3.0,"This is such a cute outfit! I was really hoping I’d get lucky this time and it would be good quality. The shirt is nice soft fabric, not too thin, not stiff.  But the skirt is thin, cheap material with loose threads hanging off all over and the bottom is not even hemmed.  They just chopped and serged it.  Besides that, there is a totally random bow sewn onto one shoulder which completely takes away from the ability to coordinate the solid colors with my own accessories. I think I remember seeing that in 1 of the photos but thought it was just an accessory for the picture.  I didn’t expect it to be sewn onto the suspender strap.  I might keep it because of the shirt. But part of me wants to return it just for the principle of it being a cheap product<br /><br />Size: my daughter is almost 20 Months and in the 98th % for ht & wt.  I ordered up so she’d be able to wear it a while.  It was a little big but the waist was small!  Save yourself the hassle and skip this fast fashion mishap."
3.0,Very comfortable. But the color is bleh. There’s no type of sheen on the dress like the picture shows.
3.0,A little longer than expected but for the price its nice. Light fabric for summer. It looks exactly like the picture. I'd recommend it.
3.0,It was beautiful but too heavy as a necklace
3.0,"Way too big , otherwise beautiful."
3.0,These are thigh high - for a midget! I'm a 5'9&#34; lady and these come to just above my knees. Barely reach the region id call a thigh. Where are the socks for tall girls?!
3.0,"I ordered black and got grey. The packaging stated it was black but inside the clear plastic bag was clearly grey. Went alright with my black dress, but was disappointed that it was not the color I ordered. I had already read the reviews and was prepared for some shedding, which it also did. Otherwise okay for the price and warm enough on a 20 degree night."
3.0,"Case was fairly well constructed, but had a lot less internal space than I originally thought."
3.0,Style is great. Has a large panel on the back that I didn't realize was there. Makes it cooler but takes away from the looks. Material feels a little skimpy but I'll see how it holds up before commenting.
3.0,"Came in well-packaged and had a beautiful gold color just like in the photo. However, the color of the necklace faded drastically after a few weeks of wear. That was really disappointing given how pretty the necklace is. It’s now a bronze color instead of gold."
3.0,"I love the length, but I expected it to be a little larger for an XL.  Give me a reason to lose a few pounds"
3.0,No stretch. very tight
3.0,I debated about the size. I ended up getting an XL as that is what I wear in other leggings but these were tighter than I like. Tight enough I decided they wouldn't be comfortable to work out in because the fabric was so thick it didn't seem very stretchy. I am 5'9&#34; and 185lbs. I had to send them back and I hate hate hate returning stuff. The ankles were also loose on me which was weird considering everything else was super tight
3.0,"I don't like the prongs visible on the back. They seem really delicate, and I'm worried it will fall out or break apart."
3.0,"It runs small, I am usually a medium in shirts but this fit more like a small. But other than that it is a very cute top! Sadly I will be returning it though."
3.0,Cute but VERY tiny!
3.0,It’s cute! But a bit too seethrough for the work place. Maybe if you wear something underneath it. Size wise it’s fits.
3.0,The color of the swimsuit is very vibrant! The material is not your “typical” swimsuit material but it’ll work. There was no liner in the crotch area for hygienic purposes so I just washed the suit before trying it on. I’m typically a 7/8 Medium in juniors clothing & so I ordered  a medium but I could’ve very well went with the small.
3.0,"Nice band, but if your original band keeps coming off, a new band won't fix the problem...  it appears to be a problem on the gearfit itself."
3.0,Its a little big on me but im happy with it.
3.0,Maybe it's just my discomfort with my body usually I feel very good in dresses that fit like this but I would say this was just a little too snug at my midsection. And it definitely looks like the dress has been worn before despite the fact that the tags are still on it. It came with what are probably deodorant stains along the leg which is usually difficult to happen unless the person was just careless who tried it on last. There's also a discoloration along the bust line which I noticed immediately as soon as I put it on. I don't want to take the tags off wash the dress and it doesn't come out. Almost like someone spilled something on it. It's just that type of finicky material you never know whether something's going to come out or not. Overall not happy with the condition of the dress when it arrived. Maybe if I want to size up I would be happier with the fit as well. The design of the dress is nice with pockets.
3.0,This bra is great for high impact sports and workouts. It is perfect for small breasted women.<br />The padding is thick and comfortable.
3.0,Fit a bit snug
3.0,I had to cut a notch in the back of each shoe because the hole you put your feet in in too small to slip over my kids heels. Also the port to plug them in can rub on the kids ankles if it’s not pushed down really well
3.0,This is a cute swimsuit cover up but after washing one time is shrunk and is very disappointing
3.0,The fabric had one small snag in it on arrival.
3.0,"These plugs are about half the width of similar 2g plugs I've purchased making it much easier for them to fall out. While they're ok for the price, i'd recommend finding better plugs elsewhere."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, well done and soft fabric. The sizing is a little of chest and waistline."
3.0,super fun gift
3.0,They are warm and I've had other pairs in the past but for some reason these keep slipping off of my ears. Bummer.  Spend the money on a name brand and try them on in the store to save yourself the frustration.
3.0,Nice design.  Face of watch is hard for me to read. Like it for unique design.
3.0,Nice purse but the material peels off easily. Only used it a couple of times and it is already wearing down in a few spots.
3.0,Cute. Felt fine on skin.  Should have ordered a size up.  Cut small
3.0,Great for the wedding we went to. Green doesnt show as vibrant
3.0,"The quality of the material was disappointing. After two washes, it was faded and starting to pill. The fit is strange as well. It almost feels as if it is twisting as I move/walk. The style is pretty. It just needs to be made of better quality material, in my opinion."
3.0,Does not stretch very easy to go over heels
3.0,I went with what I measured but they didn’t fit
3.0,"The print was great and the fabric was very soft, just way too small."
3.0,Beautiful dress & material!
3.0,"This is a great necklace if you want a believable (as diamond) necklace at the cost of CZs in a rhodium-plated sterling silver bezel setting. That said, it's not perfect. The necklace does not adjust down to 16"". It's 17"" before the 2"" extender. As a result, it hangs too low to wear as a collar/choker style which is what the small 7/8"" would look best at (IMHO). The length is adjustable but the spring ring is too small to make that task easy. I find it overly difficult, as compared to a non-adjustable spring ring chains OR adjustable chains with a lobster claw clasp to put this necklace on. (On non-adjustable necklaces I have no problem getting necklaces on in a single try.) On more than one occasion in my brief ownership since Christmas I have thought that I had it on securely only to realize that I threaded the extender through the center of the spring ring clasp — after which the pendant will drop to the end of the chain (only reason the pendant won't get lost is because it's fixed in place vs. sliding). Lesson learned: Manufacturers really should pair a lobster claw clasps to any type of adjustable chain to prevent the necklace from accidentally ending up threaded (but not secure) through the spring ring vs. the clasp. The small ""tag"" at the end of the chain won't stop the rest of the chain from sliding through until it hits the fixed (non-removable) pendant portion.<br /><br />This necklace is best suited for those who prefer a minimalist look. Because it was a gift and like the overall style, I am on the fence as to whether or not I keep or return it. The seller really should specify the stone sizes (mm) so that buyers know what they are getting."
3.0,"The material is very clingy. really sticks to you, and the sleeves are tight. If you don't want everything to show, don't buy this dress."
3.0,"I love this style, BUT my idea of rose is not hot pink...and this is. Fluorescent pink."
3.0,The straps are kinda annoying flopping around while doing outside work around the house.
3.0,Ordered a XL. Tight around shoulders and biceps. From China so there you go. Buyer beware. Depending on how big your arms are I would order XXL.
3.0,a little small the band but nice
3.0,"I have a few gaiters that I use in the summer to cool me off.  This gaiter arrived and was in a beautiful fabric. However, the way it was finished off was below standard as compared to other gaiters I own.  It was serged on the raw edge and not very well done.  For this reason I returned it."
3.0,Cute but about two sizes too small.  Listed as US size.  Not true.
3.0,"I like the color of the case but it is too tight for my phone (I have a 5s). It pushes on the volume buttons so that it goes up and down without me pressing them. It squeezes the phone so that the screen is popping out a bit from the backing. I also have trouble plugging it in, as the case does not entirely align with the area for the charger. I am hoping that it stretches over time and is not so tight after a few weeks."
3.0,I like the shirt ..but no way worth $40.00
3.0,Super cute but very hard to put in yourself
3.0,The shoes are true to size but unfortunately after 2 uses they are falling a part . I know with this item you get what you pay for. Hopefully they'll last for the few remaining week of summer.
3.0,Very soft leggings. They were slightly smaller than I expected. They are nice for working because they don’t go anywhere and certainly suck everything in. I ordered xxl and typically wear a size 22.
3.0,"Color of skin way lighter in person, not a match. But it still gets a good laugh from people."
3.0,A bit disappointed i expected material would be more superior. But it's nice
3.0,It is pretty but much larger than I expected and bigger than I want to wear.  I would like to return it.
3.0,They look like the pictures so that is great. However these are ridiculously heavy that I won't be able to wear them. Their weight makes them terrible earrings. Would be better to use them to make a necklace.
3.0,The top is too big while the bottom fits just right
3.0,"In my opinion, these glasses are strange to look through. I can't explain why.<br />They are also uncomfortable on my nose and on my ears.<br />When I bike ride at high speeds (going down hill) my eyes are affected by the wind.<br />They seem to be a nice pair of glasses for the money but I will not be using<br />them for bike riding any more."
3.0,quality is okay but size is too big. ordered xsmall and got medium :/
3.0,Slinky!  Cute! TIGHT!
3.0,The fabric is very comfortable. Need a lean figure to carry this style.
3.0,It's hard to wear them under a lot of my shirt because of the straps are too close to the nick
3.0,Super cool looking but have trouble staying shut when wearing.
3.0,Stink. Stank. Stunk. Bought to wear during  a Christmas parade. But as soon as I opened the package the rubber smell was unbearable. But it’s a cute mask
3.0,The material inside the shirt is extremely itchy to me even after washing. Had to return it.
3.0,I love the seater but does not hold up the “new” look after washing.
3.0,"I am truly between sizes. I usually wear a medium in bottoms. The fact that it was a S/M had me worried. I was right to be worried. They were too small. I sized up and got the L/XL. I swim in those. In both sizes the waistband kept rolling down while I did a few yoga poses to see how they felt on. Rolling waistbands annoy me. A lot. They're super comfy and seem squat proof, so good luck. I hope they work for you. I wish they worked for me."
3.0,"The sleeves are funny....very puffy, so it made my shoulders look broad. The materials is cheap and a little thin, but stretchy so it fits well. Not in love with the dress, but not worth the effort of returning."
3.0,If you looking clout goggles they are a bit too big.  :(
3.0,"This is a short for tennis. I thought it had real pockets that you don’t have to pull your skirt up to get to, wrong."
3.0,Bought for my daughter got it earlier than expected so shipping good. She been using it for over a month and its starting to rip.
3.0,"On the thinner side.  Also ran quite large, so I had to roll the sleeves up, which then stretched the sleeves quite a bit."
3.0,"Well, I think my review title kind of shows all I want to say about this hoodie.<br />First of all, it is cute! I wanted to wear this as an oversized home dress kind of way so I ordered Large size. For your information, I am 5’4” tall and weigh around 105-115 pounds, and wear XS (or S ) for almost everything. So it was quite roomy and comfortable, but the length wasn’t still long enough to wear this alone, which was my fault for not checking the sizing carefully, so not a big deal.<br />My issue is that the fabric didn’t feel soft as I kind of expected from Sherpa. I thought the clothes felt a bit stiff. The reason it wasn’t a deal breaker is that the lining material inside wasn’t (stiff) Sherpa, but rather cotton like fabric as you can see in my photos. The stitching on the seams are well done in my opinion as well :)  To be honest, I requested this hoodie for being cute over being practical, so I am actually okay with the overall quality. Especially for the price, I think this is a decent quality hoodie you can feel cute in it !"
3.0,"The rose gold tone wore off fairly quickly, but evenly so now the studs are just sterling silver in color.  They still seem like a good quality, just don't buy if you are looking for rose gold earrings."
3.0,"Nice, for price but cheaper made then some others I have since came across. The top material is kind of itchy too."
3.0,"Pretty, the color is darker then picture. It is itchy material underneath the dress. The back was a little to low for me. I’m 5’5” it was right at the knee."
3.0,they're socks what can I say
3.0,"I wouldn't classify these leggings and Sport because they do not provide enough lycra to stay put. I ordered a size small, my waist is 25&#34; and they were too large, I had to pinch them in with my sewing machine and they still slid down when I bent over.  Also they didn't stay up in the crouch area, there was always noticed a little snagging when I look down, then I would pull them up.  I think these are great for wearing around town with a cute top that sways across the hips so that you can't see the sagging.  The mesh part is cute and just for that alone, I would recommend for the price but again they are not for exercising in."
3.0,They are really small but I still love them!!
3.0,Received quickly and looks as expected but material is course for a baby
3.0,"It doesn't feel like  leather, it feels like a bathing suit."
3.0,Great concept but way too big to be practical to carry around
3.0,"It looks ok and I wanted to love it, but it clings to your sweaters. And you really don’t want to waste your expensive sweaters. So, it’s a no for me"
3.0,"These shorts fit well and the pockets are great-nice and deep.  However, the fabric seems heavy for summer shorts.  I also can't see why the care instructions say not to tumble dry, given they are a cotton/poly/spandex blend.  Line drying is a nuisance."
3.0,does the job but after soldering one I discovered that some are incorrect from the inside<br /><br />you could be soldering green to green but that green wire might actually be red
3.0,Fabric is very thin. Didn’t get that impression from photo before ordering!
3.0,This shirt feels like paper.  I have to wear a cami under it to prevent it from being completely see-through. Looks nice though.
3.0,If you order one of these and you wear anything but a t-shirt under it order two sizes larger than what you normally wear.
3.0,"I love the material, very soft on the skin. The ruffles were what peaked my interest. I ordered a small and it still feels like a sleeping bag all over me. I think it just needs to be tighter, maybe an XS."
3.0,One ear piece broke off for no reason.  I went back to buying my fit overs locally.
3.0,"I'm so sad, because I liked it, and they didn't have the xxl available once I needed to reorder it."
3.0,"Bag quality is fine, but it arrived filthy!"
3.0,"Smelled very petroleum when received. Not entirely sure if it is genuine leather. Most likely a synthetic.<br /><br /> The clasp/depolyant seems ok, will probably last 10-20  openings before I will no longer trust it with my watch. Everything seems low quality but for the price it is on par."
3.0,"Received as a gift and I love it so much. Not too sure about being ""built to last"" as claimed though. A stone fell out and now it will cost me more to repair than replace. I am hesitant to replace for sentimental reasons and now I don't know what to do. Missing stone seen on right side, several stones up from upper blue stone"
3.0,Looks so preaty the material it’s perfect but runs too big. My daughter will be able to wear it in about two years.
3.0,"it's an OK watch but the pushers for the chronograph wobble a little.  my main gripe with this watch is the timer/chronograph function uses the little dial at the 6 oclock position to mark seconds....which as you can see, has no seconds markings.  most proper chronographs use the big main seconds hand to mark the time in seconds since you can actually see it and the seconds it should mark on the dial.  much attention was put into the box and presentation. maybe more attention on the functionality of the chronograph, on this chronograph watch, would have been better. Got this on amazon lightening deal for 185 but I'm still going to return it."
3.0,"The hat come a little big. I love the style, and the way the hat was delivered."
3.0,The pants are really comfy but they were too long and they stretch bad
3.0,Fit as expected but the elastic frays like crazy
3.0,"The ring is so cute, and can fit an almost any finger. But I've had the ring for a week and the main jewel already fell out.  I tried glueing it back in and now it's crooked."
3.0,Love this set but the top came without padding. Didn’t realize till I was putting it on at the gym. Very disappointed
3.0,"Love the idea, just too small for me."
3.0,The small stud keeps falling from my nose and I lost them both. As for the big ones they’re good but too long for my nose piercing so I use them in the ear instead. I haven’t tried the round rings yet.
3.0,fit and style is cute<br />color is not true to description
3.0,Gave them to my sister-in-law.
3.0,"It broke after a month, but then again you can only expect so much from the price you pay."
3.0,Too large for me but very beautiful!
3.0,"The size is perfect. However, one of the screws came out on the second day and was lost forever. Even at +/- $11, I would still like sunglasses to last more that 1 full day."
3.0,"Well made dress. Lovely green color. The fabric is just thick enough to be quality, but not so thick as to be hot. This dress is a little short on me though. I'm 5'6' and it doesn't quite touch the tops of my shoes (I like my long dresses to be floor length)."
3.0,"We ordered 4 bags of 20, and one of those bags was just plain black sunglasses. Additionally, the quality of the sunglasses varies between well made and durable to flimsy and broken. We will be returning 2 bags-worth of these glasses."
3.0,The sizing chart is wrong. I ordered a large and it’s a medium at best.
3.0,I liked all the designs of earrings but the post is so very delicate you cannot put a stop at end.  Technically you don't need the stop anyway but they do come with the earrings.  I forced the stop and it slightly bent the post - no problem really since I could bend it back but next time I wear a pair I will no use the stop/earring back.
3.0,"It is a very huge purse, which is what I am trying to get away from.  The purse itself is nice though."
3.0,"Super cute, but super small. I somewhat knew this was going to be an issue, figured I’d try it anyway."
3.0,pretty red
3.0,Awkard fit - put it in the costume closet for smaller/differently shaped family members to try.
3.0,I found better quality at the dollar store.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8e9a778c3bbc340a4b73f6db9655ec65]] This watch just seems too average.  No quality “glass”, not a high water resistant, the band feels chintzy, and the actual watch is super light.  The best two best things are: it looks like a luxury watch and it has an10 year warranty.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
3.0,"sure, the actual belt is fairly thin, but the buckle is not, so one cannot easily thread it through standard pants loops.  Also, the plastic buckle looks quite fragile, would be surprised if this has a long lifetime."
3.0,I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of this item.  The zipper is plastic and very hard to engage.  I will be replacing the zipper with a better one this summer.there are bits of the lining (which is not the same material as the &#34;fur&#34; around the edge of the hood) caught into the inside seams of the pocket that needed to be trimmed. But it is warm and roomy and I can keep it closed with the two snaps at waist and neck.
3.0,"this took forever to get to me, which can be a nice fun surprise to receive a shirt you totally forgot you ordered bc it took so long!  But when it doesn't fit so great, you end up keeping a shirt you don't really like bc it took so long and doesn't feel worth returning,  The design is pretty and color is bright, but the fit is too large for a small.  The armpit area is even bigger.  There is no way to wear this without a tank top underneath, unless you were wearing it as a bathing suit cover up and didn't mind it not fitting.  The shape is good, but the sizing is all wrong!"
3.0,I didn't realize that the bottom &#34;cuff&#34; (not one of the arms/claws of the dragon) was attached wrong. It shows it in the picture. There is no possible way for it to attach and cuff your ear. I just ended up tearing that off. Other than that it is a gorgeous piece and came in the mail when it said it would. I've gotten quite a few compliments on this piece as well! I recommend it.
3.0,"It's cute, but not very good quality. The clock still works, but the chain fell off already."
3.0,It's huge but nicely crafted
3.0,Runs small but still looks good.
3.0,"The watch is nicely made but it arrived with the battery low, running behind on time no matter how many times i adjusted the time setting. I will have to purchase a battery for it now so i can wear it."
3.0,"This was a roomy for a ""clutch"" purse but the sequence seem to snag my dress."
3.0,"Very pretty, and looks exactly as pictured, but the clasp broke right away. I didn't get to wear it for the reason I purchased, but hope to fix and wear eventually."
3.0,"Got these glasses thinking they would be around the same size as the Mosteez glasses that I usually wear and love... But were to small on me (got a big head).  The glasses are very koo stylish and at a great price, but I don't recommend if you have a big head or maybe a round face. All around glasses are a matte black plastic frame with polarized lenses very light weight."
3.0,Which they fit right. Sized down because all the reviews said they run big. He only wore them once
3.0,Very cute but run small.
3.0,"This Paitluc Tank Tops for Women Halter Neck Tie Dye Sleeveless Shirt is reasonable and feels cool on. It's not at all stretchy, so it has a bit of a tent A-frame to it, with no waist, understandably. I thought this looked just like the ad pic, so I'd say it's a good product if you want that look. The main reason I'm deducting a few stars is that I feel it's just ""okay"" and that the tie in the back of the neck is super long...so long that it could be a double leash... unless you want to tie a giant bow on the back of your neck, the ends will hang down towards your waist. I may cut them a lot shorter, but don't feel like re-stitching the ends at the moment."
3.0,"These things are ok - they will definitely keep you warm, and there isn't really technically anything wrong with them, but they are just not particularly great, either.  The material is like a thick felt on the outside, so they are kind of bulky and look cheap.  The cinch-cord around the top is not particularly comfortable or classy-looking.  The colors are too bright so I feel like I'm wearing a red or blue beacon on my face.  They do keep you warm though, no denying that."
3.0,for grandaughter
3.0,just didn't look right on me. but my son loves them
3.0,"I ordered these type of glasses before and the quality was quite good, but the most recent order of this same product was not as good a quality. The turn-screws are not smooth, and one side of the glasses was not angled equal to the other. I kept the glasses non the less as I needed the correction in the short term."
3.0,Really cute but it bends super easy.
3.0,"Barely fit, almost had to rip it and did haha."
3.0,Bought for my daughter. The fit was fine & she really likes all 3 pairs. The reason for only 3 stars is that the black pair had 2 small holes in the leg portion of the leggings...which will only become larger very quickly.
3.0,"Nice glasses,  broke above the lens without being dropped. I don't have a wide head so I didn't &#34;stretch&#34; them. Disappointed because I owned them only a month."
3.0,Don't be confused folks. You definitely get what you pay for. Item as described and they are HUGE.<br />If that's what you like then these are for you. You can have MINE
3.0,"I don't love it. It's very big for my slender wrist and it will not stay adjusted when I try to make it smaller. I do love the charms, may take them off and add them to another bracelet that has a nicer finish (I don't like the dull finish, reminds me of the wire I use to hang a picture). Just OK."
3.0,"I was a little bummed that the photo showed long sleeve shirt— and description said 3/4 sleeve. Really hoping for long sleeve shirt. Other than that, it was what I expected. Thin cotton and very comfortable."
3.0,Amazing but hurts because its too tight.
3.0,Seller was reasonable but I wanted to return it because it was too big.
3.0,They seem to be made well and good quality but I think they're made for teenagers. I feel like pollux troy from face/off with them on (google him) I have a fairly small head and face and they just seem really small. They look ok on me though regardless
3.0,The product feels great but it was a little too long. Otherwise everything was great.
3.0,"Was nice when they arrived but after just one week of wear, one sneaker isn't working.  My 8 yr old is very disappointed."
3.0,to small for any toe so i wear it on my pinkey finger.
3.0,"the ear pieces HURT. otherwise, interesting and cute sunglasses."
3.0,I do like them but I had to reorder a large size.but they are nice.
3.0,"I just received it this week for my trip. The compartments in this bag are well proportioned. It is water resistant. Unfortunately, one of the outer straps tore after only one use. Apparently, it is not well stitched.  I am currently in Italy and will be back in a few days. Hopefully I will be able to return it or have it replaced"
3.0,"I like my tops with a little compression - these are not compression tops. The colors are accurate but they are a little loose on me.<br />I'm 5'5, 150lbs, bust 36B, waist 28 inches - I ordered a medium<br />I could have bought a x-small I think"
3.0,Nice quality but bigger than I expected.
3.0,The lens arnt dark enough
3.0,"Arm bands broke, nothing holding together. Overall didn’t get to wear complete with my out fi."
3.0,"Maybe it's just that my face is small but these are huge on me.  I'm going to wash them & see if they shrink a bit (I hope).  They seem soft and do have the adjustable ear straps which is nice.  There is no filter pocket and I'm not sure how breathable the material will be.  The design is cute though, but I'm just not sure these will work out for me."
3.0,It was a nice umbrella. The wood handle and matching leather strap are nice touches<br />I used it a few times and it worked fine.  Then when I used it last time 1 of the ribs broke at a joint. It was plastic. I emailed shedrain 2 weeks ago.  I never got a reply. 2mm to 5mm more plastic in a few spots.  this would have lived a lot longer. It was nice while it lasted.
3.0,Pineapple is a lot bigger then expected. But still a nice hat
3.0,"I like the fit, but the polyester knit fabric is more suitable for a casual dress than a formal occasion. Not bad for the price point but not right for my need."
3.0,"The length is just too long. My glasses hang down to my bra line, and I mean the bottom band of bra that encircles your ribcage. So I'm afraid I'm going to scratch my glasses against the edge of the desk or other things if I bend over at all. If it were 3 to 4&#34; shorter, it'd be ideal. Chain is smooth and pretty in a sporty way, just what I wanted, so I hate to ruin the look by adding a rubber band in back :(  Debating on returning it."
3.0,"Silky like material, bought a medium should have bought an extra small..."
3.0,"The gym wrap is fashionable, but not very functional for me. It did not appear to absorb water as a towel would. I wanted a more absorbent, towel-like wrap."
3.0,Sizing was not clear on purchase
3.0,"&#34;The fit was a little snug, but not to the point of uncomfortability. My only real negative review on the product was the fact that I didn't have an opening in the front. I can see them being beneficial for active wear, such as jogging, biking, or the like.&#34;"
3.0,You have to stick the whole back part of the earring through your ear so I would order a size down
3.0,They 'pilled' after one wash
3.0,"Ok, but not at all the quality of the standard smart wool gray socks. I thought they would be equal."
3.0,"I have to go back and read the item description. This is screen printed, not real lace, oh well. Live and learn. Hoping not to need it!"
3.0,"Looks just like picture.  Note the 20inch description of the chain though....that is accurate.  It falls to top of chest level.  The picture here is very misleading.  The necklace is nowhere near that length.  Also, the chain broke the first time I wore it, but I guess you get what you pay for...  You can probably stick the pendant on another, longer, chain."
3.0,Extremely tight in the arms. Good quality fabric. I'm 5'10&#34; 190lbs and ordered a large. It felt great everywhere except through the forearm and under arm pits.
3.0,It seemed a little cheaply made.
3.0,After a few wears they pill and look cheap
3.0,Cute and stylish. I bought the smallest size and still felt they could have been more compressed. Otherwise love them.
3.0,The cream color was darker than the photo but the main reason I am returning is because the pattern across the neckline was unflattering (it was the dark brown leaf laying at my collarbone—not attractive and very distracting).  I do want to try it in other colors though. I am usually a medium but ordered a small. Love the sizing.
3.0,"It fits and looks great, but the Rose color was much more muted than in the picture so decided to return it. The color of Pepto bismol comes to mind."
3.0,"Love the band, but there is no way to adjust the band to be smaller. I ended up cutting some of it off so it wasn’t too bulky on my wrist."
3.0,It didn't look as good in person
3.0,"Cute Jacket, but runs small! I usually wear an XL but got a 2X just to have it be roomy ... and even that was too tight. I had to send back."
3.0,I got for my daughter for Christmas. They were way too big to crimp around her ear cartilage.
3.0,"I bought these to wear as a base layer under my long underwear and snow pants for skiing.  I still got cold.  I wish they sold a thicker version of underwear for cold winter activities.  I wouldn't care if they were a bit bulkier in these instances.  Comfortable, wash well."
3.0,Bulky ... Looks almost black
3.0,"The top is very summer feeling and very light to wear, the only problem is that the top doesn't keep your boobs in place. Also, the top of the side of the bralette doesn't provide much coverage or support, making the top very sketchy to wear in fear that a little too much sideboob will show."
3.0,Extremely difficult to install AND the little white piece in the middle popped out after only an hour of wear. The curved end pieces are susceptible to being ripped when you are pulling them through the holes.
3.0,"It's a great concept, but the straps frayed open not very long after my son started wearing it.  I will not order bracelets with this type of closure again."
3.0,Not sure size
3.0,"The fabric is very sheer and you can see right through the cream color. It is cheaply made, but will work as the under piece for a costume, but not as a dress as I had hoped."
3.0,My daughter absolutely loved this book bag. Unfortunately I had to purchase a second one because the stitching begun to unravel.
3.0,just not a favorite
3.0,Well at first it was a great backpack and convenient for me special when I go grocery shopping or etc. Now it's starting tear by the bottom of the straps that I use to put on my back which really sucks. I'm hoping I can fix it if not then it was a waste of money.
3.0,If you have sensitive skin to fake metal I don’t recommend these. The bands clasps are fake metal. They left me with a nasty wrist rash after I’d worn it for a day or two. I put clear polish over it to seal it and I can wear it again but without applying that every week or so I break out in a rash from the fake metal.
3.0,It’s large and doesn’t fit like picture. I just wear it around the house to slip on. Material is nice but doesn’t give you that float effect. It doesn’t sweep the floor like I would like. Very tent like. I don’t remember the size I got
3.0,"Normally I wear L/XL, but I think a medium would have been closer to the right size for me.  Aside from the sizing issue, this dress in general isn't right for my body type.  If you are pear shaped, it might work for you.  If not, the hip area is cut for wide hips and you'll be left with baggy material on each hip."
3.0,I bought this helmet about a year ago. Its not DOT approved but if you know anything about helmet you know whats what. It pretty comfortable. Not a big fan of the lacth it can be some what diffcuit to remove at times. But for the money can go wrong with this one
3.0,I loved the simplicity of this design but was disappointed it did not have an adjustable strap.  It was too short.
3.0,"Sizes run small.  The hoodie had a lot of loose strings around the button and seams.  I had read that the zipper would not last and I believe that it might have problems based on how it zipped up and down, when I tested it.  I wanted the Hoodie to be great, but quality was a bit lacking."
3.0,"I didn't realize the cut would be so pronounced, but luckily my roommate likes mermaid style dresses and she looks dope wearing it. Super soft, nice quality. One of the straps ripped out of the package, but a few stitches and it was fine."
3.0,"I liked the suit, but it was listed as an 8-10.  I'm a solid 10 and it was too large.  Had to send back."
3.0,it's not 100% wool
3.0,"If you’re busty, order up a size. The material is thin, but overall pretty soft as comfy. It does, however, stretch a little too thin over the chest, so probably should have gone up a size. I’m 5’3” 185# and 40DD. I got the XL, but would have preferred an XXL. I’m apple shaped and Since having 2 babies I always look ~6m pregnant. Sooo... this cut was a risk, but I do like the dress."
3.0,I was very unhappy with the fit. I just could not get comfortable.  I ordered 3 different colors . Now I wish I would have ordered one . Instead I wasted all that cash only to not wear them . Sucks !
3.0,"I like the dress, however, it fades quickly after a few washes and looks worn..."
3.0,These are very cute and fun to wear casually but they ripped when I was in the gym. These are far from squat proof but they are very cute if you wear them in daily life. I just would not wear these to the gym if I were you.
3.0,Very nice product but I ordered an XXL & receive a MED. it was a birthday gift so very sad.
3.0,"These are so cute! They are about as comfortable as you would expect - they aren’t a shoe for walking or standing all day. I was expecting then to fit a little tight as my feet are a bit wide, but they seem to fit well after skewering them a few times now. The one downfall - the black bottom sole started to peel up on the back side of one shoe the first time I wore them, then the second time the other shoe started to do the same. I plan on getting some good quality adhesive or glue and getting them more solidly adhered. Otherwise, I am happy with them! They are super cute and look great with every outfit I have paired them with so far!"
3.0,Need to read size next time
3.0,"Will keep phone dry but distorts voice both ways, disrupts touch screen. Scratches easily<br /> Currently looking for a better option"
3.0,It is a little tight than i thought and the fabric is not so soft.
3.0,"Oh my...they are so small... I bought these for a kids party, and I'm hoping the kids are small enough...<br />I have others, and these are half the size... I'm very disappointed."
3.0,For my watch can not work
3.0,"These look great, but a flower came off on the first wear - had to return them. Stinks how I had to pay almost $8 to return/ship them back."
3.0,"I ordered the wrong size. I’m sure they are suitable pants for someone, but not my hubs ."
3.0,"I’m 6’1”, weigh 200lbs, have 44” chest. The Large fits snug. I like tank tops a little loose and a little long, I should have bought an XL.<br /><br />The open back is good for boxing. It doesn’t get wet or heavy even if you work up a good sweat. The fabric is not as soft as nylon."
3.0,Pretty little bracelet. You do get what you pay for though. Not very sturdy construction.
3.0,The fabric is very translucent when you have these on. I bought the leopard print and it distorts the pattern when you put them on.
3.0,"I really like the Karen Scott brand.  I have always been satisfied with their merchandise.  Sadly, my last purchase was not up to par.  It's as if one of their mistakes made it past the inspector."
3.0,I ordered celadon # 2 pants in size 28. Pants are not convertible. No zipper to convert long pants to shorts.......I like the pants overall but am confused why it was advertised as convertible pants when it’s not...
3.0,"Very pretty necklace but after a month or two, all of the jewels/stones have fallen out."
3.0,"Little disappoint in the fit. They like to ride up in the “nether region” if you get my drift..The material is comfortable, unti they are so far up you can taste it. I would really  put thought into these before buying them. You are turned into a walking billboard. Just think every time you bend down everyone will see the word knocker. And we all know there are a few meanings for that. So watch out where you wear them."
3.0,"I understand these are meant for bigger/wider heads, but these just look goofy."
3.0,Not sure about this dress faded after washing
3.0,These are nice boots but expect a suede boot with shiny toe tops? Weird. Is that the hipster style now?
3.0,"I measured myself and according to the chart, I got the size needed. WAY TOO BIG!! The look was wonderful, but the legs were a joke and the waist line fell off."
3.0,Fits as expected. I'm a 5/medium and I bought the med. if my chest was any larger I'd need the large but I like my bathing suit being tighter so I don't feel like they'd flop out.<br />Great value for $20 and super cute!<br /><br />Only gave 3 stars because one strap wasn't sewn at the adjuster and I had to sew it.
3.0,I ordered an extra large plus and received an XL just as the others
3.0,One of the earrings was broken when I got it...they are very lightweight so not durable.
3.0,Meant to order a different one.  Do not like the brief style.  My fault.
3.0,"the band in the middle was looser than pictured. it wasn’t flattering, thankfully it was an easy fix and i sewed it tighter. i’m 5’9 and the medium fit me fine."
3.0,The masks has a clear paper covering the clear area.  It needs to be removed before wearing.<br /><br />The mask does not keep moisture out and it sticks to the lips making it difficult to talk.
3.0,Muy ancha en la parte abajo
3.0,Loved the purse but unfortunately my strap broke. I did overload it but still stinks 😫
3.0,Great quality but the tops are tight which cause circulation problems. I was searching for diabetic socks. These popped up in the search and I didn't double check. I had to give them to someone else who is not as sensitive.
3.0,"I bought these as a party favor for my son's birthday party.  The kids loved them, but about 1/3 of them didn't work.  I had to make 25 bags and barely had enough that worked for all of them."
3.0,"I'm only giving three stars because of the sizing. I hadn't read the reviews saying to order smaller  and it's too big. The biggest disappointment was the length. I'm 5'4&#34; and would need to hem it a few inches, even with a petticoat.  However, the fabric is great quality and the dress is a beautiful design. I'm returning it for a smaller size and purchasing two petticoats for more fluff. This should also help with the hemline. I can't wait to get the smaller size and will update my review upon receipt and wearing."
3.0,Cute style but the neckline is not as shown in the picture. It’s too short/not structured correctly to stand on its own like a turtleneck and when folded over looks more like a 60s era low mockneck = wide and low to the garment.
3.0,"Beautiful color, but runs very large.  I suggest you buy a size smaller.  Nice neckline and good length for a 5’7” woman."
3.0,"Very delicate, practically weightless. Afraid they'll get lost"
3.0,"These earrings are nice.  They are not as long as they look in the picture.  Evidently the picture has been enlarged to show the detail.  They are still very pretty.  The only complaint I have is that the backs on the posts are screw on, not slide on.  I wasn't able to screw the backs on at all and had to find another kind of back to use.  Otherwise they are fine."
3.0,I liked the sports bra and design but it was WAY to small.  Gave it to my daughter.
3.0,The dress is plain but ok for the price.  Dress was too large.
3.0,This dress came VERY wrinkled and not near as flowy as the picture depicts.  The sleeves are much less puffy and shorter.  I was disappointed.  I will keep it and give it away once I iron out all the wrinkles.  To bad.
3.0,"it’s overall fine; soft material, pretty color, comfortable. the fit did not work out well for me, though, even after checking the size charts and guidelines. i am 5’4”, 28” waist, 35” hips, 36” chest (normally 6-8 in US sizes). the sleeves are a lot shorter and tighter than they appear and the way it flows out is not super flattering on my body type. i’m going to mess around with it and make a few adjustments."
3.0,Gave to coworker. Broke on first use within the hour
3.0,"Too short!  When I washed it, it shrunk the more."
3.0,I thought that the hole puncher was included. It is a good product but order arrived incomplete. How can this be resolved?
3.0,"Not as soft as the stripy socks I ordered elsewhere (more like nylons than socks--not so much thin as simply stiff/scratchy). Not a total disappointment, but will not be buying again."
3.0,"There is a lot about this dress that I typically like.  I love the red and purple floral pattern.  I wear a lot of maxi dresses and like the high slits.  It is a light flowy comfortable fabric.  Overall, though, it looks a little my little prairie on me.  I'm 5'3"" and it is very long - to the floor.  I like that the buttons are functional.  I like a few unbuttoned and would work well for those nursing.   This is comfortable and the waist band is forgiving and stretchy.  This blouses out under the band on me a good bit more than on the model.  I have this in an XL and I typically wear a large or 12 (38C).  It fits pretty well everywhere but likely is more full because I have the larger size. "
3.0,Love this little dress the neck was a bit tight for me so I don't really wear it but I think that's a preference thing. Other wise so cute and just like the picture
3.0,"I got a medium and it looks like a large. Also, the design online looks nicer than in person."
3.0,These are beautiful earrings - one arrived broken... I fixed it myself as I needed for an event. I'm not sure how well they will hold up longterm.
3.0,"Very disappointed in the duration of the product. Only wore it less than 10 times and the band fell apart. The problem is the inner liner which is not flexible became brittle and cracked. Once it cracked the band cannot remain screwed in.<br /><br />9/19/2017-updated review. Customer service did contact me and replaced my band. However I still had some issues with the design. The band does fit if you install it properly but it's securing the bottom band that is the problem.  The company is taking a look at the design.  I'm still giving it a low rating, however customer service was five star excellent."
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty, I only wish they were not so heavy!  I do like the length but I'm really disappointed at how heavy they are.  I'm not sure about the price also.  They do seem to be a bit on the pricey side.  I might look for a lighter hoop earring.  I really wanted a dangle earring though."
3.0,"Beautiful shoes but the shiny navy finish wore off after wearing them one time for just a few hours.  So disappointed to have to return them - style, color, width and heel height were perfect."
3.0,I'll be 9 months pregnant when I wear this dress .. Im all stomach .. im usually a size medium but being pregnant should I go a size up?
3.0,"The dress looks very nice. It's made out of thick material, so it definitely doesn't look or feel cheap.  However, the corset back was very uncomfortable to wear even though I loosen it as much as I could already. I just order the size that I normally wear, didn't size up or down."
3.0,It appeared whiter in the picture but otherwise perfect
3.0,Was not soft or comfortable.
3.0,Nice soccer shoe but not very wide for children with wide feet seems like a standard fit
3.0,I ended up returning the item. I didnt feel it was sturdy enough to support my apple watch. The material felt flimsy and the connecters were plastic.
3.0,This is a cute set but it isn’t high waisted enough and falls down easily. The sports bra is cute though the pants are just not high waisted or long enough as I’m tall so if you’re shorter they might fit.
3.0,"The ""bracelet"" is way too wide. I can make a fist and it will still fall off my wrist (I don't have small hands). It's more of an arm band.<br /><br />The key chain is really nice. The lettering is clear and it's a good size."
3.0,Super cute and adjustable but gets caught on everything and makes the ring bend.
3.0,Works great for a while but then the claws starts to come off.
3.0,Earrings are exactly what is shown in the picture I just thought they were going to be a little bigger.
3.0,"Cut me weird and tight across the chest but very large in the body, torso area. Also has very weird neck piping that stands straight up. I was hoping it would be higher quality. I'll wear it to bed...nowhere else though."
3.0,I got the cream color and I'm somewhat disappointed with the shade. It's tinged yellow. I was expecting off white. The wrap itself is comfortable material yet slightly loose.
3.0,I feel it was a good product it just did not enhance my natural curves the product look just like package it has a whole of stretch to it I should have ordered a size down for a better the picture is how I received the product I am sending it back
3.0,"This pack complements the KORIN Clickpack X Backpack which I'm also reviewing.  KORIN is known for minimalist bags and this is no exception.  I think design and engineering may have overtaken functionality to a certain degree.  While there are many interesting design features the useable interior space of this bag is limited and the short sling strap inhibits flexible carry options.<br /><br />This pack has the toughest fabric and stiffest materials I've found in a slingbag.  My Patagonia and other slingbags feel like they're made of paper compared to it.  It also has a stiff frame enhanced by the stiff fabric, flap, and interior padding.  KORIN claims the fabric is anti-theft tear resistant and I'd agree.<br /><br />The exterior is virtually waterproof.  The fully lined and padded interior is waterproof.  The additional zippered water bottle/umbrella pocket has its own waterproof compartment.  Water isn't getting into the main compartment from this pocket.  This is clever engineering.<br /><br />The padded interior is small by any measure especially considering the overall size of the bag.  It gets narrow at the bottom.  Add a water bottle or umbrella and interior space shrinks significantly.  I notice KORIN appears to use a small water bottle for demonstration.  Without a water bottle I get my iPhone XS, compact digital camera, small guidebook, snacks, wallet, additional iPhone battery charger pack and cable, and keys in the bag.  Forget a rain jacket or poncho.  They won't fit.  Add a normal water bottle or umbrella and I must start removing things.  It intrudes into the main compartment.  A small exterior pouch with a clever magnetic cover is on the top and accessible with the pack closed.  It's narrow but will hold a cellphone or wallet.<br /><br />The flap covering the main compartment has a magnetic buckle which fits into a latch on the bag.  This enhances bag security.  To open the flap pull down and out to free it from the latch.  Closing is the reverse.  This adds security but clearing the latch slows down opening the flap and getting into the bag.  On the inside of the flap are two small compartments for cash or credit cards.  A secured flap allows carry with the main zippers open for quick access in low threat places.<br /><br />Bag zippers require a good amount of force to open.  This seems characteristic of KORIN's zipper design in all their bags.  They are well engineered, waterproof, and tamper resistant.  However, I find the pull force needed to open them significant.  They are clearly built to last.  If you suffer from arthritis or similar issues in your fingers you might find these zippers a real challenge.<br /><br />The sling strap is well sewn into the bag and will take a lot of abuse.  The sling strap is generally comfortable but almost too short for me.  The strap latching mechanism is an excellent design.  Its magnetic and click latch mechanism work together to make connecting and disconnecting easy.  The strap has a small zippered compartment large enough for a credit card, small amount of cash, or earphones/earbuds.  My main issue with the strap is its length.  6-12 inches more length is needed.  I'm 5""9"", 195lbs and need the strap at its max extension for a barely comfortable fit.  It sits high on my back with no flexibility.  If you are tall or larger you may find the strap isn't quite long enough for a comfortable fit.  I wish KORIN would provide an extension strap for tall and large body types or make the strap longer.<br /><br />Summary:  I gave this slingbag 3-stars because the strap needs to be longer and the interior space is limited.  Otherwise I'd rate it 4 stars or higher.  This bag is incredibly well engineered with a nice design.  Functionality for me is limited.  If you can live with these issues and need a truly waterproof slingbag I recommend you give it a serious look."
3.0,"For polyester it is cute for over tank or to hide arm flaws. I'm small, the arms are quarter lngth, like past elbow, and the extra length dangles so I tied in a knot. Daisies sewn on well."
3.0,This is for looks only. Zero support due to being extremely stretchy. Soft and comfortable if you have no weight on your chest.
3.0,It’s pretty short in the front and not that flattering on.
3.0,"The navy color is good. It was difficult to put on my watch. The strap is stiff rubber, it isn’t flexible so it’s constantly sliding out from the 2 loops that are supposed to hold it in place. I had purchased a Seidel watch with a rubber strap it was soft and pliable, but the loop’s ripped easily. I wouldn’t recommend this strap/band."
3.0,Good style but Too heavy and long skirt to me.
3.0,"I'd love this as a top but I don't like the seam around my waist and the length is a bit long. The cut of the skirt isn't as flattering as I thought it would be, it looks kind of blocky. Give it a lighter material for the skirt with more flow and it'd be great."
3.0,"The color is gorgeous, the packaging was great, delivery was fast, the dress is a bit too small."
3.0,Very cute dress working to fit it.
3.0,"This ""blue and white"" sweater is more green than the blue in the picture.  While it is a decent sweater, it appears to be a cheaper knock-off of the one pictured."
3.0,"they were ok but they are small, more of a kid size."
3.0,"I like that this product will keep my kid ""glued"" to the chair. However, just keep in mind that when your kid sits in this and depending on height and such, eye level may be at the dinner table . Otherwise, it does what it's meant to do. IF you are using this for a toddler, you may consider a booster chair to sit and eat with the family at the dinner table."
3.0,"I was expecting a deeper blue, but still very lovely and the hubby likes them"
3.0,These were waaaayy too big!
3.0,"The paint chips on them very easily. They look good otherwise, but I am down to only 3 sets without chipping paint. I’m bummed!"
3.0,"This suit is very cute, however, only the fron of the bottom is lined leaving the back of the suit see through. I understand it is a swim suit but I dont need people to be able to literally see my butt crack. Great fit and cute otherwise!"
3.0,These shades are OK. They're reasonably comfortable albeit a bit clunky and the quality is decent.  They block out the sun pretty well and don't interfere with peripheral vision.  One unusual thing is the pair I got had writing on the sides that said &#34;Camry&#34; on one side and &#34;20th Anniversary&#34; on the other in red print.  It took so long to get them that it wasn't worth trying to return them.
3.0,Not at all what I expected but I wear then anyways. I ordered all same size of course but yet it feels like the black and blue ones fit smaller than the pink one. Weird.
3.0,"Skirt fit,  top was too small in arms,  slightly in breast area.  Sold it to my sister."
3.0,Smaller than what I thought
3.0,"I purchased these for my mom and I. They were super cute and perfect for us when they came, however, it wasn't long until they were tarnished and I had to get rid of them."
3.0,"material is very thin, but I suppose you get what you pay for."
3.0,"They are light weight and the stitching is good, but the fit is really small and weird. The front of the pants doesn't feel right."
3.0,The cups are oversized. The band is too tight. Very odd sizing.
3.0,To me it looked better off then on.
3.0,"Jacket fit expectations for color and quality but despite following sizing chart, it dud not fit bust size. Disappointing as it was a gift."
3.0,this is cute I get compliments
3.0,Has an awkward fitting. I didn't like it.
3.0,Looks almost like the picture I took 2 stars because it looks like it was made in a hurry so the large blue pieces aren't properly placed in their slots so it's crooked and some glue is visible otherwise the price versus product I would say it's a good buy.
3.0,"I would give this a better review, I can’t believe the flag popped off.  I had to glue it back in.  They were really cool looking cuff links."
3.0,"Nice & sparkly, but the packaging was inapprorpiatem- the earrings were connected together somehow (like the backings were intertwined) and this intertwined lump was just thrown into a small ziplock bag.  I removed them to put into a real box to make a real present, but in trying to separate the two earrings, one backing flew off never to be found again.  I ended up not giving them to anyone. Not a satisfying purchase."
3.0,The pair on the left of this picture is what I received and are not the red in the ordering.  The pair on the right is what I wear and they are red.
3.0,Hand wash only
3.0,"This shurt was way too small. I bought it for my niece, who is 11, and it doesn't even fit her. It is also fairly thin. I would imagine the lighter colors  you would easily see your bra through.  That being said,  I bought it to put under a sweater,  so will be reordering. My niece wears a juniors 4/5, but will have to order at least a large in this shirt.  Order up!"
3.0,This dress looked exactly as pictured and it fit comfortably. The only issue I had is that it was super static-y because of the fabric. I live in a desert so that isn't something I wanted to deal with for a dress that cost $100.
3.0,I like the style and material. I bought a small and it was a bit big. I thought about taking it to my seamstress to take it in but the scallops area would not stay up. Once it's zipped up the scallop folds forward and down and this causes it to look like the dress is not zipped up all the way. The concept is nice but they would need to have some kind of way to allow the scallops to stay up as that's the focal point of the dress to show off your decollete and shoulders. Even if I got a smaller size there is still the scallop issue.  I really wish it had worked out 😔
3.0,Pretty but the color is not what it shows.
3.0,"The money price was fine, the sock didnt help at all"
3.0,The heart stone is HUGE. But for $3 for a necklace that my daughter picked out it was fine. I was seeing if she could be responsible for a piece of jewelry. The catch does have to be forced closed sometimes and I had to clamp the hook that holds the chain and the pendant together.
3.0,"My husband is a truck driver and has to unload 30,000 lbs of boxes per trailer.  He needed gloves with a grip to aid in that process.  I purchased these with the assumption that they would work great.  After the first trailer, he had busted through one of the fingers.  The grip itself is great, but nevertheless, the gloves didn't last for more than a day."
3.0,Wasn’t what I expected. Doesn’t look like the photo. But keeping to wear every day
3.0,Item was not as comfortable or flattering
3.0,"Pretty small for men’s sizing. Warm but stiff, not nearly as long as in picture"
3.0,Good construction but didn't fit well.
3.0,"Did not fit the way I expected....I wish for more movement as a woman who usually wears Medium sized shirts. Picture makes it look a little longer at the hips than it fits me. If it fit like the picture, I would give it 5 stars since the quality of the zipper and cloth is really good."
3.0,"Product was about as expected, I bought it as a joke for one of my friends that graduated recently with her MBA. Quality isn’t great."
3.0,Me gusto el tamaño exacto qué yo queria
3.0,"Fit looser than expected...a little bulky, too"
3.0,Front of cap caves in. Flimsy
3.0,Wound up giving it away
3.0,Turns green after a while so I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something that lasts but it is super cute and durable enough for the price.
3.0,"I love the silver and gold leaves, and they are the perfect size but the bronze leaves the coating is very spotty so I won't be able to use those. However still a great deal even if I'm only using the silver and gold colors."
3.0,run small. itchy lace
3.0,"Cute, but the fit wasn’t right for me. Also, very sheer."
3.0,The material is stretchy so it has some give. I am about 5 2 so they were a little long in me.
3.0,"These boots were heavier than I expected, and they are very warm, especially by the ankle under the faux fur. I can't wear them inside because my ankles get too sweaty. They were also a little tight in the toe, so order half size up. They also lack cushioning under the foot, so it's like you're walking on the rubber sole."
3.0,"I expected this to be a amazing travel pillow. But it was only okay comma not to mention that I truly didn't realize what it look like until I blew it up on the plane. My adult son said &#34;don't get that near me ,that looks disgusting.&#34;And then I realized that it really did look obscene...ooops! Once I realized that .  I didn't want to take it out anymore. Soooooooooo , it did blow up with just a breath or two, and did offer more neck support than the regular u shaped pillows  but this looks a bit Pornographic, I don't think I'll use it again"
3.0,It is big and very shapeless. I have to go get it altered.
3.0,"Seemed to be of good quality....lace was nice.  Padding was plush.  Runs small though, like 2 sizes too small.  I knew that it ran small.  I'm a 38B.  I ordered a 40C.  Still too small.  I should have ordered 42C.  Cup size just up it one."
3.0,"Tends to stretch, causing some mild transparency, amounting to a slight color change. Still good stockings, though."
3.0,It’s ok it’s good for the price!
3.0,"I love the appearance of the dress, the fabric is good quality, I could wear this without worrying that if I move wrong the whole thing will fall apart.  My issue is I went by the sizing chart, ordered a large, expected it to be a bit tight because my measurements are greater than those listed, and it is HUGE.  It won't stay up in the back because it is so loose, no matter how tight I tie it at the neck and the waist.  It's gaping open at the sides and sternum.  I will have to wear this because I don't have time to order the next size down and have it arrive for the event, but I am going to have to tape this to my skin all the way around and pray I don't lose it during the night."
3.0,"This shawl is cute and I received a ton of compliments on it. However, it is very short. I’m used to buying shawls/kimonos that drape over clothing, as pictured. But, this is more cardigan length. If I’m guessing the model has on at least 2-3 sizes larger than her normal size."
3.0,Nice hat but the Crown wasn't as high as I like on my husband.  I found a better one at Kohl's  I gave this hat to our Thrift Store.  Someone will be thankful for it.
3.0,This teal and white tie dye kimona is really pretty and a steal for $16! BUT.. I wear a Sz 16/18. I ordered the 3X as I thought it might be Asian sizing. It runs more like a lg/xl. Fits ok at bust (I'm a 38C but slim in the hips. If I were a Sz 12 it would be perfect.
3.0,"I ordered these earrings from the Stauer website, so I hadn’t read the review here yet. Unfortunately, the pair I received were also a bit tarnished, but that’s going to happen since they are made from silver.  It was easy to use a silver wipe to shine them up.  One of the earrings did come open too easily, so I just tightened it a bit with a needle nosed pliers and now it’s fine and stays closed. I agree though that for this price the earrings should arrive in pristine, wearable condition. Not sure what’s going on with these, but once I took the aforementioned steps, they are lovely earrings and I enjoy wearing them."
3.0,It is a nice dress for around the house. It cuts above the knees (I like below the knees). It is also high waisted.
3.0,"On the positive, the transition lenses work well in the sun for reading by the pool or on the beach for example.<br /><br />On the negative, smudges very easily and often with the littlest touch.<br /><br />Comfort is decent, nothing to say one way or another.<br /><br />Expected better quality at this price point."
3.0,Stretchie bathing suit material. Looks cheap. Fits ok.
3.0,Cute but a little small - won't fit for long!
3.0,After a couple of washes the color looks like its 10 years old.
3.0,it was very see through
3.0,Not as pictured. Looks cheap.
3.0,pretty socks like you like lots of hearts... they are a bit tight in the foot. I stretch them when they come out of the washer & it helps them be more comfortable.
3.0,"Product came pretty fast. The rods are really long, I had to switch balls to a shorter rod. I've already  swallowed two of the flat top balls."
3.0,"Other 11D products I've purchased fit better. the items are well made, Look good, but i have to wear socks if there's any hope of them not acting like flip-flops. Should've maybe gone with 10's"
3.0,Correctg gauge but over all size much smaller than expected; each ring is different color but natural; definitely not black nor even brown as photo shows.
3.0,"Cute, ran TTS. Just extremely noisy pants. Made so much noise when I walked, that I felt it obvious that these were faux. I wish they had this look, but not the swish and crinkle sound when you walk. I am 5'8"" and 125lbs, and felt they were plenty long on my legs."
3.0,"Love, Love, Love this dress!  However, I cannot give it 5 stars because of the fit issues.  I'm not sure why, but they make the button loops out of a stretchy material which allows for more room and for the fabric to be stretched which creates gaps in the bust area.  I'm 5'7, 36DD, size L/12(US).  I ordered a L according to the size chart, but it still has gaps in the bust area.  I feel like this problem would be resolved if they would cut the button holes into the actual fabric instead of adding the stretchy loops that cause the gaps.  I am keeping this dress, but only to wear as an oversized cardigan, which looks really cute with some jeans and a cami!  I think I could try to wear this as a dress if wore a cami underneath.  Another small detail (that doesn't really bother me, but it was just something I noticed) the buttons on the dress are white in the picture, but are black/dark blue(?) on the actual dress - that might be a deal breaker for some, but I still think it looks great!  The fit was the only issue I had with this dress.  Its a shame because I love this dress so much!"
3.0,I got what I ordered and it served it's purpose.
3.0,Way tight waist.  Normally I wear L in bottoms & got XXL & still have to struggle to get these up. Definitely not true to size & shiny.
3.0,"Nice medium weight hat. However, the color is not as pictured: as it is a Dark Brown color; not the Olive Khaki as pictured. Also, the size is somewhat large; I wear a 7-3/8&#34; and I have to place the strap slightly off of the velcro (by about 1/8&#34;). Therefore, I cannot give it Five Stars. Other than these issues ~~~~ it is a Keeper."
3.0,Way too small in the upper arms. Should have been more stretchy.
3.0,"arms were cut way too small, hips were cut way too large and its no ""wings"" on it as it appears in the picture, it basically fits like a regular dress, at 5'9, its a good length, just not floor length! Its a regular dress, no v shaped middle at the bottom either... almost looks like a nice nightgown!  Anyway, no one would care since it will look good on Zoom, thats the only reason im not gonna wear it as a nightshirt."
3.0,"I like the look but the frames are really delicate and flimsy, so they break so easily. I really like how they look and feel, but they break too easily and I’m tried of putting on my glasses just to have one of the lens fall out."
3.0,Smallp
3.0,Bent after a few weeks
3.0,"The skirt is super cute. Well made. Nice embroidery.  Nice little zippered sack on the side. Love that it's cotton. I wish it was 3-4 inches longer.  Especially in the back.  When I tried it on, the back was several inches higher than the front. I'm 5'4"" and it came right up to the bottom of my butt cheeks. I returned it."
3.0,"Was hopeful based on other reviews, but these did not deserve my hope. Material felt cheap and they were too transparent."
3.0,Can’t wear these! Still just sitting in my closet floor cause they’re way too small. I ordered my normal size.
3.0,I bought these for work. These gloves are not good for heavier work. Im constantly moving boxes. The grip wore out right away. If your doing light work they might be good for that. They are white so they will get dirty right away. Overall they fell short of my expectations.
3.0,"Pants are great, the top is not a way too short! Boobs will hang out the bottom"
3.0,"Super cute, but the hair on the beards falls out so quickly. Even when we pullled them out of the plastic there was a ton of fallout already."
3.0,The 2xl tall I bought was a bit short in the shirt tails.  I like the material  and rest of the fit.
3.0,not really that much easier to use than a normal key ring.  might be nicer if it was coated with smoother chrome.
3.0,"This is a very cheap shirt. If you have a large bust this shirt will not fit you. I normally wear a medium or small tank top. I have a 36C chest, size 9 juniors jeans, weigh 150 and am 5'5""If I lift my arms up this shirt goes up like 3 inches above my bellybutton. It is a weird fit. The back and the chest is the same length. There's no brand label just a itchy tag that says made in china. Not worth the price at all."
3.0,It’s a little bigger then I thought it would be.. but it’s nice
3.0,Beautiful slippers  but not good quality
3.0,I like this product it’s very cute it didn’t fit and it is see threw so not impressed
3.0,The &#34;hint hint&#34; font was very hard for people to read because it looks so much like a sweater fabric on the picture.
3.0,"These bands are great for ease of use when slipping on or off.  The cute blinged buckle paired with the colors works great for different outfits.  However, the watch band doesn't hold its position for size so you'll be tightening it up every time you put it on, but it holds the size once you get it where you want it.  Additionally, they don't hold together well as evidenced by the picture.  I just bought these in October, 2021 so 7 months of use, without using them everyday (because I switch them out frequently), makes me think they won't last very long due to poor quality.  This has happened with just one band so I'm hoping the others hold."
3.0,I highly recommend these for people who wear a size 8 or smaller.  Im an 8 1/2 and they are a tad small.
3.0,Kids Size 1 looks like a Kids Size 3 or 4. Way too big
3.0,Its a nice fit but hangs a bit unshapely like a bath robe. The fabric is very itchy and stif. I've washed it twice with fabric softenerwithout much difference. It's nit bad if wearing over a long sleeve shirt but it still scratches my neck. I wouldn't buy it again but I'm nit retuening it either. I'm hopeing it will soften up over time and washes.
3.0,It feels like I have real heavy chain on my neck.
3.0,Doesn’t quite look like the picture. It’s more so 2 district lengths vs the gradual flow. Fits well and is comfy.
3.0,downside: the light is insufficient to tell time in the dark.
3.0,"If this fit properly, I’d be more interested in it. However, it’s extremely loose. The chart is either wrong, or I got a 5 minutes to close Friday night special."
3.0,The earrings are very cute and went perfectly with my black girl magic birthday theme. But I was very disappointed when one of them chipped and I’ve only wore twice for a very short period of time. 🤨
3.0,Kind of big. And go upside down a lot when you wear them so it no longer looks like a crown. But good quality and they're pretty.
3.0,"I gave the dress  three stars because the pink is see-through. The pockets of the dress are great but you can see through the dress and see the pockets when you look at it, you can also see any color underwear unless you're wearing nude and even then you probably could see the outline of the nude underwear.<br /><br /> Also the medium seemed more like a large it was very big on me and I'm 135 LBS, and a 28 waist.<br /><br /> I will be returning this but trying a darker color in a size small"
3.0,"When I first received this purse I was very happy because it was soft and the strap was very comfortable on my shoulder.  After using the purse for about a week I started getting frustrated every time I tried to find something inside the purse.  It's almost like there is too much material lining the purse.  It's very loose and the softness of the purse means the sides don't stand up on their own so I'm constantly digging around to find things in my purse.  It's a pretty bag and I wanted to like it but, sadly, it's getting donated to the thrift shop after less than a month of use."
3.0,Cute but didn’t work for my chest being 36DD
3.0,"It's shear. You can see your underwear in the tan dress I got. Other than that, I like it."
3.0,Very soft afraid I'll bend and break them. I really like them
3.0,"Nice color.holds credit cards side ways,enough room for a few bills But,not impressed with construction of the wallet, falling apart on day two."
3.0,"These shoes are OK. They fit as expected - I ordered a 8 because they don’t offer half sizes. I’m actually a 7 1/2 but I always order up in size when they don’t offer half sizes, so these shoes are a little big on me because of that. Would’ve been nice if they offered half sizes so that they could’ve fit better. Aside from that, they look like your average cloud slides. I own several cloud slides, and when comparing to all of the ones I own, these are not true cloud slides as they have somewhat of a harder foot pad and do not offer that memory foam “walking on a cloud” feeling at all. They’re decent house shoes though, but I would not re-order them with the expectation of cloud-like comfort."
3.0,A little tighter than I expected
3.0,The quality is okay but the lens doesn't reach the bottom of the glasses because the clip keeps it significantly higher on the glasses.  I'd say the glasses are great but the clips stink. Bad design.
3.0,I always check reviews when making a purchase on line.  I am giving this bag three stars because I got what I expected for the price.  The color  is a bright coral not pink.  The pics posted in the review should have shown one more.  The tag inside that says content: polyurethane foam.  There is no tag that states anything about this bag being leather.  All leather bags will have a tag inside that says it contains leather.  So for the price the bag is well made  and could easily pass for leather.  Which is why I did give it three stars.  As for reviews --- Buyer beware!
3.0,I love the look but they are not plus size
3.0,"Earrings are very pretty and are I love the colors. However...having shoulder length hair, the earrings stick to my hair and must be pulled away."
3.0,"Expected better quality, but cute shirt overall."
3.0,Nothing to connect handles....zippers are large... haven't used it yet though
3.0,"Somewhat small on top and the material is thinner than I thought it would be, so it was too revealing.  I'm 36&#34; bust and like to feel covered. This shirt wont work. Also ordered white, it's very much a yellowy off white. The bottom half was fine. I liked the shirring. Sending it back. May try a different style."
3.0,Color is pretty . Material is stiff
3.0,"These had a super weird shape to them and never really fit the baby’s feet well. Our little girl was just under 7lbs and these have made do until she was about 2.5 months. If your kid has super chubby feet, these might work better, but overall there’s probably better options out there."
3.0,I like the earrings  just thought they were longer but they are very nice I have worn then several times  brenda knight
3.0,It fit smaller than it was advertised so i just usually wear it to the gym.
3.0,"Nice, but a bit too large. Size small doesn't fit snugly under arms (I usually wear dress size 2-4). Not a big deal for a nightgown, but it makes the silhouette more mumsy than sexy."
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring- I had it as a purity ring for about a year and got many compliments on it!  However, it is frankly pretty cheap.  The metal soon got bent out of shape, and the CZ fell out after a year.  I really enjoyed it while it lasted though- it was only $10 so I wasn't expecting too much.  In short, its a gorgeous ring- but don't expect it to last too long!"
3.0,Good design and shirt quality however around the chest area it's a bit too small for my girlfriend.
3.0,The medium was generally small. I have thin arms 11’’-12’’ and there was not much room in the sleeves. Length was good. I have a 32 waist and 38 chest but it was too tight there. The size estimates were off for this product.
3.0,Very narrow and sole is very hard.
3.0,Fits but it’s very tight.
3.0,"I liked the size and design of this product. However, the necklace came with a visible rust spot, which made it look cheap and undesirable.  Instead of wearing it everyday, now I am going to wear it occasionally."
3.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful bracelet.  However, if I moved my wrist forward the magnetic clasps would come loose and the bracelet would fall off.  Now that being said, I am a larger woman so it might just be that my wrist is too large for this bracelet.  If you have normal size wrists I would suggest this bracelet it really is stunning."
3.0,This item ran smaller than what I expected but still fit. I wear them when cycling. The padding is light but does give relief from chaffing.
3.0,"It is very comfortable material, the shirt shelves however are short, they hit 2"" above the wrist. otherwise is comfortable"
3.0,"The bra is really pretty and the cups fit perfectly. I got the 38, which is what I always wear but it's tight. Like squeezes the fat, leaves red marks and hurts when you take it off, kind of tight. I have a 36 that's looser than this. So, I would recommend going a size up in the chest, but the cup part you can go with your standard. Or, buy a cheap chest extender at a fabric store. That's what I'll be doing."
3.0,"I am disappointed with these. The portion of the lens that is entirely clear is too narrow. I have to bend my head down and look through a very narrow portion at the top rim of the frame if I want to see at a distance. Otherwise, the glasses are comfortable."
3.0,Smaller than typical for women's slipper size. it also sheds
3.0,"We waited quite awhile for these to arrive.  Be aware that these come shipped from China so they do take some time to arrive.  I ordered these for my ballet crazy six year old.  When they arrived, I opened them and also be aware that they stink.  I mean, really stink.  I honestly have no idea what materials exactly are In these but it smells.  The smell did go away after a few hours thank goodness or else I would have thrown them away.  They fit perfectly.  The lace is a little in-ballet like really, most,y just decorative and a little larger than I expected.  The little leather patches on the bottom do indeed enable her to twirl better and she of course loved them.  I do think they are cute but honest,y if I was paying full price I would be disappointed.  As it is, I was offered these at a discount In Exchange for a fair and unbiased review.  That is what I give and in all honesty."
3.0,This dress was way too small -- gave to my daughter and it looked lovely on her.
3.0,It's a hat. Fits smaller than I expected given it's &#34;Large/Xlarge&#34;. But I have a huge head.
3.0,I have size 12 feet. I should have payed more attention to the size. I thought with them expanding it would be ok but I can zip them up.
3.0,to big<br />Very thin material
3.0,Really cool! Very heavy.
3.0,"I first purchased a pair of the sandals (black/snakeskin) 3 (4?) mos. ago and left a glowing review. I loved the look, fit, and most importantly the comfort of this two-strap sandal. I give it a 5-star rating in those categories but I will never buy this sandal again or recommend it because it has a design or manufacturing flaw. It occurred in that first pair as well as the second one which I purchased only last month (Nov.). The first pair I used mainly to run errands and the second only for indoors. The flaw appeared in both situations.<br />Imbedded in the rubber sole is a plastic or metal support frame. It appears the melted rubber was poured over the frame to bond together. After wearing the first sandals for 3 mos., a portion of the rubber heel began to wear in a slant (typical of that foot). With only 1/4"" or less worn down, the frame was exposed so it meets the floor when I walk and it causes a clicking or tapping sound. It was so annoying that I purchased a 2nd pair (cork/gold) and decided I would only wear it in-house so the bottom wouldn't get scuffed so quickly. Here it is only one month later and the same thing has happened! The same corner of the rubber sole is barely worn and the imbedded frame is becoming exposed. I am again making a clicking/tapping sound like a peg-leg while walking on tile. Either the rubber is too soft and wears easily or the manufacturer has not imbedded the frame deep enough into the rubber. Be forewarned."
3.0,"Its a lot smaller than it really looks,needed a much bigger one"
3.0,I ordered two of the same.  one was ok the other was totally different and peeling.  I just returned them both.
3.0,"These are good and nice and soft, but the waist band is so loose that it’s hard to keep them on around the waist without constantly having to pull them up."
3.0,"I purchased size xl. The moment I took them out of the package, I knew they were not going to fit. My daughter who is usually a size medium tried them and they just fit her. There is no way these pants were an x-large. They are very well made and I love the pockets but your sizing for american figures are way off."
3.0,These ripped up too fast
3.0,"I use these for Barre class. But the satin straps were frayed on some of the socks (new out of the package) right above where they’re sewn into the sock. They haven’t torn yet, but I don’t believe they’ll hold up after a few more washes and use. I still think they’re nice, otherwise."
3.0,"The glasses seem tough. Work well, but the frames are really wide. They will not stay on the top of my head."
3.0,"This is by far a beautiful and well fitted top. I love the way it fit, the way it flowed, and makes me feel sexy. Looks good with Jean's and high heels especially because I'm short and it's long on me, but I love it. It arrived just ahead of schedule. I changed my rating because one of the straps broke right after I hung it up. Didn't get a chance to wear it.  I ended up ordering a similar one another completely different vendor."
3.0,runs very small -- buy 2 or 3 sizes bigger
3.0,"very thin, but soft and decently long"
3.0,I purchased this to wear while at a breast cancer walk. I wanted to make certain that I wasn’t to hot or too cold while walking. When it arrived I immediately noticed that it was not the color that was advertised. I picture shows a deep neon pink like a fuchsia. I received pink but not the one advertised.
3.0,"Nice but thin. I usually fold them to make the mask thicker. I bought these because it came in a pack. My son and I love them,<br />Since its a requirement to wear a mask in the city now."
3.0,I’m only giving this a few stars because it was such a cheap price. But you get what you pay for. Super cheap quality.
3.0,"Returnd it no replacement offered diamond fell out,  hated the chain"
3.0,If I bought my size it would look great but I ordered bigger just in case and it's a curtain on me.
3.0,Very thin!<br />Picture taken after drying two times.
3.0,"Just received this in the mail... Color is ok, but this is not coral.. At least most of it isnt. Under microscope these are sea pebbles(quartz) dyed to look like coral.  For the price point of 9.99 its ok but should never be excepted as coral."
3.0,Very loose. Would’ve like it to hug more
3.0,"I was disappointed that these ran small in size. I ordered a larger size just in case of shrinkage and still too small. I measured the waist of these compared to my other similar sizes and there is at least a 2"" difference.<br />They seem to have a lot of spandex in them too."
3.0,I expected it to be better quality but the material was thin felt kinda cheap. I definitely think you can find a better jacket for that price.
3.0,"If you are looking for the burnout style shirt (like in the picture), this is not it.  While nice, the fabric on this shirt is more like an athletic shirt than cotton."
3.0,"These gloves are okay. I was expecting true Atlas fit 300s but, I received the AtlasSHOWA gloves instead. Pretty bummed the SHOWA gloves wear out quickly. The seller should change the picture."
3.0,These were good affordable sunglasses. I got the bamboo wood pair. But the wood feels a little rough not fully polishes or treated wood like you would find on a good desk. You know the feeling up nails running on a chalkboard and you get the chills from it? It occurs in a small amount here.<br /><br />The angle of polarization is odd. Or all the screens I own are odd. It appears to be at an angle which doesn't affect much if you aren't using any screens but if you use a phone or something for navigation while driving it will be dimmed in horizontal or vertical but not in between. You may say duh it's polarized and that should be what happens but while that is true it could be done with smarter design of the polarization filter. Most screens if not all screens emit mostly polarized light. So if you tilt your head horizontally it should black out. That is how my friends sunglasses work. If his phone is vertical then you can see if it's horizontal you cannot. And it does the same thing with our monitors at work. But these sunglasses have minimum filtering at a slanted angle so about 50% reduction of light at a vertical screen is a big deal and I can't tilt my head always while driving just to see the navigation or even while walking around and texting.
3.0,"I'm conflicted as to how to rate this dress, because it's a very lovely dress, fits well, and looks great. But the one I received was defective. The inner lining on one of the sleeves was attached incorrectly, it wasn't put in the right place, and as a result blocked 50% of the armhole, and would cause the back of the dress to pull and bunch up. Unfortunately they didn't have any more in my size and I needed the dress for an event a few days later, so I just cut it open and patched it as best I could with my machine. If the dress hadn't been defective, I'd have rated it 5 stars, but I have no idea how this unwearable dress made it through a quality inspection. Decided to split the difference and give it 3 stars."
3.0,Material is very thin...
3.0,Either my neck is too fat or these things are super small. And I think they're super small. I'm not an overweight person. Pretty average and 5'7. However I found these chokers to be tight even with the extender clasp? They're still super cute though just wish they came in more sizes as well as the extender. the only one that can literally fit anyone is the tie one.
3.0,"I use it on the very last hole but it's still too loose on my wrist. If you have skinny wrists don't go for this one. Also the wrist band only has one strap which makes it look like it's always untied. I had high expectations and wasn't happy with the way it looks, but everything else is fine. It's a good watch."
3.0,This is an okay dress the fabric is super cheap and stiff
3.0,Okay band. I had no problem adjusting the size; the included tool worked fine. It also looks great.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because of the inconsistency of the mechanisms. One side easily goes on and off my Charge 2; to get the other side off I need to use a screwdriver to push the tab. One side of the butterfly clasp stays latched well; the other side pops open a couple of times per day.
3.0,"its ok. I'm 5'1"" and its too long in the legs but too low in the chest. I constantly have to pull up the front because it slides down. Half of my sports bra is usually out. The back detail is cute and it doesn't go down too low on the but even when doing squats."
3.0,"This shirt varies between colors. I tried the &#34;navy #1&#34; and the material was very shiny and almost stiff. Also the stripes on the sleeves weren't as pictured. The striped panel went straight up and down the shoulder, not diagonally toward the neckline as pictured. I returned it. I also tried the &#34;green&#34; and it was much softer and barely had any sheen to it. The bottom of the sleeves pucker out a little on both colors, almost like a flare pant would do. It kind of drives me crazy. It was much more noticeable on the navy one though... I think because of the stiffer fabric. As for sizing, I'm usually a L but got the XL and it fits nicely."
3.0,Didn't care for the fit. May be ok for women who aren't as busty. Sent back
3.0,"Super cute for fun, Definitely not for a serious sunglass"
3.0,"The pullover material feels really good on the skin. It’s thin, soft and warm at the same time. I just didn’t like how it looks very baggy. It has no shape at all, I feel like wearing a very comfortable bag. Maybe just not the cut for me."
3.0,"Well. I thought that the pattern on them was more like a textural/mesh like thing, it’s just black dots but that’s okay. The fabric is thicker than expected, but they are still very breathable and stretchy. The waist band is compressive but doesn’t hide everything. They rest of it is not compressive at all. Fabric is thick enough to hide cellulite. They are squat proof. Has had a few loose threads on it but no holes! The stitching seems pretty durable. I’m 5’2 and they hit just about my ankle a tiny bit too long but not noticeable. Don’t really do the butt much justice. Haven’t experienced any cameltoe, but they do create that weird v-shape around ur pelvis. Also the fabric isn’t as soft but I’m hoping they will soften after a wash or 2. I’ll probably get more because for the price they’re pretty good. Overall, they are not as great as I expected but still definitely what I paid for and pretty decent leggings. Just wish they sucked in a bit more."
3.0,Smaller that I thought but love the bag
3.0,I think I would love them if they fit - too tight. I wear an 8.5 and I should have gotten a 9 or 9.5 for slip on comfort.
3.0,"Great material! I am 5’9 & 136 lbs, and pants are just a little short. However the length doesn’t bother me as much as the waist does. I ordered a small and even with the belt tighter the pants are to<br />big."
3.0,While it says a size 10 it is a 9 1/2. can't use the insole because it further reduces the size of the shoe.
3.0,not the best belt I've ever had and not the worst. I do wish there were some more holes in it..but meh not a huge deal. it's not great quality but it got the job done (break up a pattern dress)
3.0,I returned this item because the thickness noted in the description was not accurate. It was much thinner than described.
3.0,Bought a size bigger for my daughter it shrank down two sizes :( very cute tho
3.0,Love the color. However came so folded even after having it lay flat for a week (with weight on top to flatten the brim) it still isn’t laying flat enough to see how it will actually look. Debating on keeping still.
3.0,I had to glue stones that had fallen out.
3.0,"got as a gift for someone who is size large and way to big, hanging off her, looked good"
3.0,"The photo let me to believe that the acrylic leaves were contoured like an actual leaf, with veining - a realistic representation. Instead, the leaves on the earrings I received were flat and shiny. Just an orange leaf shape cut from an acrylic sheet. No veining, and no matte surface. And definitely not a 3d leaf shape. Not pleased at all, and I will probably never wear them, but won’t send them back because they cost less than $5."
3.0,"My main complaint is that the grey colour looks darker in real life than in the photos - too dark for me so I returned. The collar is also hard to get to lay properly.<br /><br />However it fit as expected for me, and the fabric is soft and nice quality. The length is great if you're taller. Would be a great Fall/Winter top for someone else."
3.0,"I love the coat itself, however the coat arrived severely wrinkled.  I’m trying to figure out how to get them out so I can wear the coat."
3.0,"Bought this to put on a modded Seiko 7002 so I could wear it to work and not mess up a more expensive bracelet. For the price you pay you can't really expect the quality to rival a $50+ band. The quality of the band itself is quite nice, but it is ruined by the poor quality of the clasp. The clasp scratches extremely easily and does not line up very well when closing it. After wearing it to work only one time there were a lot of visible scratches on it just from the desk I sit at. I will also note that if you are using thicker spring bars with your watch you may have an issue getting them through this band. The ones that I had on my Seiko were too thick and I had to use some replacement spring bars I had. Overall it is ok for the price range, but if you are looking for a cheap replacement with quality that will rival a more expensive band, this is not the one. You get what you pay for here."
3.0,Love the look and feel of these underwears. But muffin top is a serious issue.  Wish they stretched more in that direction
3.0,"It was very cute when I first got it, but about two or three weeks of wearing it the jewels started to fall out. I didn't notice until I looked at my bar and the balls had black spots where the jewels had fallen out. I think this piercing would be nice and good to wear on special occasions or once every now and then, but I would not recommend it if you plan on wearing it day to day."
3.0,Yo lo quiero más grande 62/69 inch si lo harán así para comprarla es muy pequeña
3.0,This product broke after I used it three times. It isn't as sturdy as it appears. And the flower on the inside is difficult to see.
3.0,"Not sure why you would need the goofy string tie when the waist is so tight already.  Is it for people that are “too cool” to be seen using a belt?  These are 1or 2 inches tighter than other 34inch waists I have bought. The material is also like a semi-stiff canvas, and the waist button is some strange pivoting design. The others pocket buttons are snap style. Honestly not sure if I like these or not.  Other shorts and pants I have bought -I knew I would like them as soon as I open the box.  Maybe I’ll warm up to them after a few days out. If it shrinks after washing- they’ll be too tight."
3.0,I did not get a yet
3.0,kinda weak
3.0,"This shirt is ok, very lightweight  and the turtle neck is super flimsy and sloppy looking, not a fan that i can't  wear a bra unless I want my bra straps to show"
3.0,Kirkland Signature Jeans are the best jeans in the world.  I ordered a 34 x 30 and they are a full two inches longer than my other 34 x 30 inch pairs.  They are easily 34 x 32. Damn it.
3.0,"Lovely bracelet, but more for a man or a woman with very large wrists. Had it been smaller, I would have kept it."
3.0,Cheap price but also cheap product. Was torn up by the end of he day.
3.0,Bracelet is ok it should've been written in black you can't see the writing good I will be sending back.
3.0,The material was not what I thought it would be I wanted more dressed
3.0,"The shirt runs small. I ordered it in my regular size and it was WAY too small. Pretty, I liked it. Wished I didn't have to return it."
3.0,"Maybe not a linebacker, but a quarterback. I could tell after putting it on no amount of cinching down would make it any better. I wrapped it up tight and the shoulders were on the verge of overlapping. I'm 5'4, 145 lbs. Not that small, IMO. One size fits all? no. I didn't try the battery power pack and heat. I didn't want to break too much into it since I'm returning it."
3.0,"I ordered my regular side, and it is to small"
3.0,"This necklace has a good quality. It has a great sheen, but feels hollow. Most importantly, it is much smaller than the picture would have you think. Each link is 7/16 inch wide (slightly less that half and inch), and 10/16 inch long (slightly more that half and inch).<br /><br />The picture is very misleading! I'm not sure the necklace in the picture, is the same as the one I received.<br /><br />Buyer beware."
3.0,"They’re so tiny! Based off the picture you would think they are average sized pins. And for the price, you can get a normal sized one for 10 bucks so for a mini one I think it should be cheaper..."
3.0,"I want to be VERY CLEAR about why I'm only giving this product a 3 star rating. I received the wrong size paints (I had ordered a large but received an XL, I didn't want to deal with the time and headache of sending it back for the right size so I tried them on and fortunately they fit, just a little less snug than usual).<br /><br />The product itself is fantastic, great quality and look as I have come to find as the norm with Tesla's product line. I've said it before but feel it's important to note that I am an avid wearer of sport compression gear and own a myriad of different brands. I found my first Tesla's products on Amazon about 6 months ago and have continued to purchase virtually only Tesla compression products since. For the price there simply isn't anything else out there I've found that is even close to comparable, and the quality is just as good or better than some of the more pricey brand names."
3.0,Very cute for a tweens birthday present but when they arrived they had a few that fell apart
3.0,"Fun idea, but not recognizable....Coconuts are more like walnut size in relation to swallows.<br />It is nice that they are not too heavy."
3.0,"as expected, I hope the person they are a gift for likes them"
3.0,Everything was good with the necklace. Just didn't receive it in a timely manner.
3.0,"I am a top heavy individual and these are great if you need 'something,' but they are not a replacement for a bra or sports bra.  If you need something to sleep in or provide a layer, then it is great.  (I wear them when I am sleeping over at someone else's house, working from home, etc.)  They do not offer a 'go out in public' support base."
3.0,Wish I could tuck the hood away
3.0,"I am 5'7"" and wear a 12/14.  I ordered the large and the fit is great...except that it is way too short to be a dress.  The hem of the opaque underpiece doesn't quite cover my backside.  This is a nice tunic length shirt."
3.0,"I agree with other reviews. These are nice enough earrings but have been hung on the hooks incorrectly, when they are in your ears the leaf is sideways. These earrings need an additional ring to turn the leaf forward and to give it a little more movement. Don't think I will return mine, but I will probably disassemble and add another ring. Leaf size is similar but one is definitely about 1/2 inch longer, don't think this will be that noticeable but I would have preferred a little more attention to this detail. Like others have said....this is the pair at the discount price compared to others. Mine were 2-2 1/2 &#34; in leaf length"
3.0,very warm hat.  Sound is pretty good. Volume is meh...<br />However overall good purchase
3.0,Gave them to a 14 year old girl....they fit her good
3.0,"The item was too big for my taste, I did not read the size of pendant before ordering. Opted to send back and find another piece"
3.0,"I have learned most &#34;Hot Topic-esque&#34; media based clothing is for whatever reason sized smaller than it should be.  For reference I wear size XL (or<br /> rarely XXL and occasionally L)  in most major brands button up shirts (Dockers, Matilda Bay, Eddie Bauer). I am 6' 2&#34; ~245.  Knowing this I ordered the XXL, that would not even button on my frame (comparing it to a few size L button ups I have it was smaller and shorter.  I ordered the largest size they offer the XXXL (I size in any other company's line up that would be ridiculously large on me) and it is too snug to wear.  Returns have been easy, the quality (for an all cotton button up) is OK, but the sizing is a joke :(  My advice, unless all your clothes come from specialty media shops, order at least 2 sizes bigger than you think you need and if you need an XL, regrettably this shirt was not meant for you,"
3.0,"Super cute... bought it in the wrong size, have to wait until he gets older"
3.0,"I bought one pair in size 0 and finally a pair of comfy jeans that fit my narrow body so I went and bought 2 more in the same size...when I tried them on i was suprised it was so tight I couldnt buckle them!...one thing I have learned about jeans is that even though they may fit on one pair, you always have to try every pair in same size and color and material, because you do not have a guarantee it will fit the same. Have to return these and hope I get a better pair that fits like the first"
3.0,"Fits as expected, material a bit thin"
3.0,"So, they didn't quite match the modeled picture, but I wasn't wearing my stilettos either. Ok, they are goofy looking, but maybe I can stitch them up to fit a little more closely. They are really too roomy. I do have short legs so most leg wear does tend to puddle around my ankles. The elastic does keep them up. Doesn't feel too tight after wearing for a couple of hours. On the plus side, these are very lightweight and warm, just wish they fit a little better."
3.0,"Love the look, too bad its too small."
3.0,bought this for my girlfriend she liked it. its a very generic sort of belly button ring but for the price its a good deal.
3.0,"The concept of off shoulder with a different color is great, but execution failed.  The white fold creates random pleats and do not stay in place."
3.0,So the top is pretty.. quality is decent. I would have no issue with this top if it was the actual size it’s supposed to be.. it’s at least two sizes too small.
3.0,"They have a hole in the seam and I would’ve loved them more if they didn’t feel so cheap, like they are missing something to make them good. They also seem a little short for being only 5’5."
3.0,I thought more came in the package but only one does. Its a mystery too. But other than that my step son loved it.
3.0,"Fits perfect. I’m a 36 28 40. Can fit up to a 38 bust I feel. Style is cute. Asymmetrical hem needs to be more angled tho because as it is it appears as if someone made a mistake. It’s too subtle. Love the ruffles. Washed well. Ironed well.  Bow ties are a little long. My only complaint as far as material is that it holds every hair and spec of dust that meets it.<br />Edit: having worn it an entire day, I must say I'm appalled at how many loose strings were all over this dress. It's unraveling constantly. Must dock a star."
3.0,"Yeah there’s no “tummy control” whatsoever, but they were thicker than I expected so not see through and the color/print is bright and clear.  Overall good product considering the price."
3.0,It looks really great but the material is not what I expected. I thought it would be a cotton shirt but it’s like jersey material.
3.0,very short chain & it looks pretty cheap
3.0,Fun but messy
3.0,Is not as lone as it shows.  Very thin but i ware tank-top under very see though
3.0,"The bag was beautifully designed. It was much smaller than I expected but to the seller’s credit the dimensions were given. The bag did not have a lot of give which made it a challenge to fit my items inside. The description stated that the bag was genuine leather but I do not believe that is true. There was a little leather tag attached but the bag itself seems to be some other material. There was no indication that it would give over time as leather does, there were some creases which are not characteristic of leather, it has a scent which appears more man-made then authentic leather. I also did a scratch test in a non-conspicuous area and it does not scratch like leather. Nice design but not what I wanted based on the seller’s description."
3.0,"Too small. Ordered size 8, got boots marked 8, but too small even for 6. Got refund including shipping (it was a hassle and so much time spent on this)."
3.0,Fun rings to stack.
3.0,"The skirt fits great and hits me where I want it to. The material could have certainly been a better material, but I can still wear it and find ways to make it look cute."
3.0,The anti slipping don't work and it somewhat keep the warmth
3.0,Not as good quality as I would like. Fits a little lopsided.
3.0,"The shirt is exactly like pictures. It fits like a mens dress shirt with shortish sleeves. It doesn’t feel as much like linen as I had hoped, it is a bit scratchy. Also If you buy the white know that it is very very see through, not surprising, but something you should know. I really love the shorts, they seem to feel more comfortable, fit better and look nicer. The top I may just give to my husband."
3.0,"Get a size larger because they were a little tight for a medium. Especially if you wash them. Don't machine dry them because they will shrink and be even tighter. Even if you machine dry them once and hang dry them from that point on, they will not fit as comfortable."
3.0,They are darker than you think they. Very nice although they are not a look.
3.0,"These go over earrings just fine, however then the post is too big to fit in my ear.  I couldn't even force it to stretch them out.  I can't use them."
3.0,The diamond looks like it’s about to fall out. It actually pops out through the sides and won’t even completely come out. The hook on the back won’t stay closed. I had to manually push it to close. I gave them a three for fast shipping and the earrings beautiful if they did not have that huge store about to fall out.
3.0,Returned the item. Not big enough and had that awful chemical smell. I have other Scarleton purses and they are just fine.
3.0,It's OK. Small and short. I will likely wear as a shirt.
3.0,It fit pretty well
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:164c8af3060944aec2b677d52b260274]] This top is a thick stretchy sweater material. I’m 200lb, size 13 in jeans, 5’6” and size Large fit relaxed, not too tight.<br />The edges where your shoulders are supposed to show don’t stay down, they slide up even as you’re just walking around. If you pick up both of your arms,  half of your bra will show. The arm length isn’t long enough unless you keep pulling it down."
3.0,the &#34;black&#34; insert- was cheap looking.  Returned did not like at all
3.0,Too big. Gives you that bug-eyed spaceman look.
3.0,"It's too short for my Express shirts and double-windsor knots. However, it fits some other shirts. Just varies based on your shirt's collar. It would be nice if this had an extra inch."
3.0,Was super cute at first and fit well but after a summer of wear the sleeves are so loose and stretched out the bottoms are also all gappy and weirdly shaped now and it has faded so much. We use this one and three others she liked and this is the only one to end up a hot mess.
3.0,it is what you might expect for that price - possibly a little less.  There are not too many different options.
3.0,I bought and adult large. It looks and fits like a child's large.
3.0,"A little big, the rear is saggy so i have yo where shorts underneath but looks great!"
3.0,"These are ok for the price, but worry they will break easy. I bought these along with another brand (Pcubes) and the other brand far surpassed these. You get what you pay for. I was able to pack socks and other small clothing pieces in these, they are small."
3.0,This shirt is so adorable but is slightly more orange in person than on the computer.  My friends say it doesn't really look good on me or enhance my features - looks a little costume-like.  But I like it and will wear it again.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium or large skirt, depending on the fit (my waist is medium, my hips are large). After reading reviews, I bought this in an XL, in hopes that I could wear it low on my hips so that it would look decent with tights. Instead, the XL fits at my waist, and definitely could not be worn lower. Since I'm tall (5'9&#34;), it is scandalously short, so it won't work for what I wanted it for. However, it is super cute, and I decided to keep it for more &#34;fun&#34; situations. It has built-in shorts, which I found to be annoying, but they can easily be cut off."
3.0,"It's rather larger, but smaller than I wanted.  I was looking for the over the shoulder look in black panther...but either I'm too big or this was just a tad bit too small to comfortably give that look.  Otherwise soft and looks great."
3.0,"The waist fit perfect on is skirt and the material is great, but it is WAY too short. Without shoes the skirt barely touched the ground. I would have never been able to wear heels. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"Fine to give to kids to wear , something the dollar store would sell . I gave to my 6 year granddaughter, my 16 and 18 granddaughters said to cheap looking for them to wear"
3.0,"I love the softness and style of these leggings however they run large. I am 5'5,130lbs and the S/M were too loose."
3.0,"I'm 50/50 on this 2 piece. The colors are vibrant, but it's almost like a nice 2 piece lounging set. I ordered a medium because I'm a little Heavy up top with somewhat big arms. I'm 5'6 and 175lbs and the jacket fit perfect but the pants were a little loose. If you are fit, it would look really nice, but if you are pudgy( not being mean, because I am) then you will see the fabric get lighter as you stretch it. I just like to give honest reviews before someone else spend their money. I got the purple and black, and it is cute, just not sure how I will wear it, in house or out."
3.0,Was too large and the pearl embellishment looked cheap. So I removed the pearls and tried to shrink it. It’s better now but I just wear it as a baggy shirt over leggings
3.0,"Super cute rings BUT 2 stars off, because on 1 of the rings a stone fell right off right when I put it on my finger! Bummer because I really like the style of these darling rings. To much trouble to return it, so I'm keeping them sans one ring :( I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"After I ordered the dress, I got an e mail wanting to know  my height and all my measurement so the dress would fit correctly.It took about 4 weeks to get the dress back, and it fit well except it was at my ankles instead of close to the floor. I went ahead and wore it to the planned wedding, but I would have liked it a lot more if it were about 3 or 4 inches longer. I had included the measurement to the floor wearing the shoes I would be wearing."
3.0,Like it but it cut up my finger.
3.0,These were really nice looking earring but they won’t stay clipped on and the metal piece that goes through the piercing broke off after one use....
3.0,"These earrings are very well made,they look just like the picture,only they are very very small, much too small for my liking.I returned them the same week that I received them .I sent them to the return address that was on the package via the postal service in may 2015.  I checked my  june 2015  credit card statement and the july statement and there was no refund.I .don't have my order number so I don't know how to get my refund  PLEASE  REFUND  MY MONEY"
3.0,I ordered a 2X but in actual sizing it is a snug 12-14. It is very thin material which could be great for summer. Color was a true navy. I had hoped it would be a bit longer.
3.0,It was ok. Ran much larger than a normal size Medium. Quality was not bad. Felt more like a Woven than a true Flannel.
3.0,Please make sure the product is working before shipment.
3.0,"I like it, though it's still not big enough for my whole wrist. I ended up cutting it in half and making a double out of it."
3.0,"Nice purse- though bittersweet for Me- i wanted a stiffer purse with the seperate compartments...it is serving it’s purpose ...but it’s just something I have to get used to...I’m disabled & don’t have much grip, & it’s hard for me to find a spot to grab hold of it."
3.0,"Arrived SEVERAL weeks after ordering it- like 8 weeks probably. It ran small & I missed all 3 holidays I was hoping to wear it for: Memorial Day, 4th of July & Labor Day."
3.0,Fine set but I was surprised that on a 6 to 18 month set the mittens have no thumbs.
3.0,Will be returning for a refund
3.0,It wasnt fitted well under the arms
3.0,Cute- super thin material. More like a long sleeve shirt
3.0,The beads were a smaller than expected but overall it worked for the person I got it for.
3.0,Fell apart after a couple washes.
3.0,"Worked great for my costume, however, portions of the sock didn't not have any stretch to it - maybe due to the design. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase."
3.0,"It is with mixed emotions that I write this review.  I love, love, love, the design of this poncho and have received many compliments on it after wearing it twice: once to a family event and the other time to work.  But, wow!  Does it shed!!  I wore it the first time with black knit pants to a relative's house---afterwards I was expected at church to do a reading.  I had to stop home and change up---my pants and my black knit shirt were totally &#34;fuzzed out.&#34;  I then washed the poncho ( I had to wipe down the washing machine drum to remove all the lint afterwards) separately from my pants and shirt.  The second time I wore it (to work),  it was a little more&#34;de-fuzzed.&#34;  Wearing a rayon blouse underneath drew no shedding---great!!  Still, there was fuzz on my poly-wool blend black pants but not as much as the first time I wore the poncho.  I took a lint roller to work with me that day and had to de-fuzz a few times.<br />  Would I buy it again?  Probably not, but it looks so nice on if you can deal with the &#34;fuzzies'!"
3.0,"The concept is great but you truly cannot fit more than 6 cards in it because it becomes too bulky for the magnets to hold it closed. The magnets are NOT strong enough to hold an average amount of cards and/or cash. The coin section will only fit 5-13 coins as it is very small. So if you are looking to minimize the amount you carry then this is fine but if you are like me and have several cards, you will be disappointed."
3.0,"I’ve ordered this brand many times and have been very pleased with the quality of the nightgowns. But this hooded robe flimsy material, not very soft to the touch and runs small."
3.0,"I don't have especially large wrists, but this leather band feels skimpy in both length and width.<br />It's cheap for a reason, but a plus is, comes with watchband removal tool and 2 sets of band attachment hardware.<br />Meh, it's OK but not great."
3.0,"My emotions are mixed on this one. First, the burgundy isn't remotely as dark as in the picture, that really bummed me out. It's more medium red. Still very pretty but not what I intended on purchasing when shown a deep wine color. Second, it fits HUGE which I knew from reviews. I'm normally a US size 10 and bottom heavy, so I offered a small. I need like an XXS, but I think I can make it work. The neckline has elastic so it can be worn on shoulders or hanging off, and I like that a lot. Overall, I plan to keep it. Maybe I'll try again with an XS and black. Haha."
3.0,"It's cool, but I prefer for fitted cap"
3.0,This isn't true too size. The sweatshirt is very cute and the color is vibrant.  But it's smaller at the top and looks stretched at the bottom
3.0,"Sweater fits very nice. The style is cute, but the material is thin and not very soft. Got it on a deal and only bought for the sweater. Shorts are ok, not very soft for lounge wear and too short to wear out."
3.0,"It's just a Coors light shirt, very normal quality. Seems overpriced now that I actually have it."
3.0,This item looks nice but looks kind-of funny when the child has it on. Like the crutch was sowed a bit too close so the legs don't fit right.
3.0,El producto parece pijama de dormir  y no traje de playa
3.0,"I was super happy to find this because I have a Batman fan with an upcoming birthday. There isn't time to return it before his birthday and the box (the second coolest part of the set, socks being first) arrived torn open. There are still pieces of the seal stuck to the package. I'm bummed."
3.0,"Relly, well made but very hard to find the perfect fit"
3.0,"Overall, it fits well.. although the neck(turtleneck) is way tighter than I expected and was hoping. Was expecting it loose and floppy.. so disappointed with that."
3.0,Beware - don't buy this unless you're going for the half butt out look! It rides up and exposes everything. Get a thong!
3.0,"My sister chose this as the bridesmaid dress for her wedding. Overall, it's a decent-quality gown. Unfortunately, mine had issued with the cups on the chest being seriously deformed (the other bridesmaid did not have this issue). Also, we both needed major alterations. Mine was about 5 inches too long, with super long shoulder straps, and the other was made to her measurements but still came out over 8 inches too long.<br /><br /> I strongly recommend ordering well in advance, and getting an off-the-rack size for easy exchanges. The corseted back has a wide modesty panel, so sizing it to yourself is super easy."
3.0,"Great looking brackets, feels heavy duty, one of the lights didn’t work so only one bravo is fully functioning."
3.0,"Love the hat, nice looking, good quality, but still can't decide if I like how it fits/looks when on.  The top portion seems to tall."
3.0,"I like the tote, but it was a little large for me. I returned it for a smaller size."
3.0,Compared to purchasing my usual size this customized size was no different in my humble opinion.
3.0,"Not flattering, quite boxy. Medium was larger than expected."
3.0,"Love the look, but the material is itchy and not very comfortable to wear."
3.0,Easy to use. Belt buckle looks nice. Belt itself looks a little on the cheap side.
3.0,"Gorgeous boots and design, with two issues. First, Sam Edelman shoes all run very narrow. I typically wear a 7.5-8 wide. I bought these in an 8 wide and they're slightly narrow on my feet. They'll stretch, but unless you have narrow feet, consider buying the wide width. Length is fairly true to size, though.<br /><br />Second, the saddle leather is far less rich looking in person. In the photo, it's a gorgeous, shiny cognac color. In person, it's a duller deep tan, which is a bit disappointing."
3.0,I really like this case except for the fact that the black one attracts lint really badly. I have to lint roll the fabric to keep it clean.<br /><br />The fabric is a thin cotton canvas material. I was expecting a different fabric. Almost considering returning.<br /><br />Otherwise it’s great for a scientific calculator and pens for school.
3.0,Great price. Not as thick as I thought they would be.
3.0,Good fit. Beautiful shoes. She loves them. But 3 shoe lace loops ripped within a week. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Makes me look huge and I think it’s the material, along with me being fat. It’s like a thin fur sweatshirt. I got the blue one, not really a fan"
3.0,It's alright. Not really great quality
3.0,Pretty cute but heavy polo material was hot in our tropical climate and sleeves and bottom of the shirts were very long.
3.0,I wear a 32 pants size and a 36 in this size barely fits right. Too short overall. Not for tall people.
3.0,"Wrong size, gave it to my nephew."
3.0,"Seems to be working fine, but is quite a large watch for a woman's wrist, the case is also fairly thick, but no thicker than an apple watch"
3.0,Does not fit size it says it does
3.0,Barbells were a little hard to twist on.  One side will not untwist and I didn't want the hassle of returning. Other than that it's a very nice size.
3.0,I had bought two other tops and they fit perfectly!  This top however had the opening of the mock turtleneck too tight.  It has been returned.
3.0,"I first purchased the large, my normal size in almost every brand.  I am 5'8 with light curves (muscular/slim thick LOL)..normally an 8 or 10 in size.  The large was snug but gave me a nice look. The pants were surprisingly long enough but the sleeves were UNBELIEVABLY short, almost seemed in error.  Returned and then ordered the XL. Still a nice fit with a slight bit more room but still a nice feminine fit on the top.  Again the sleeves were 2-3"" above my wrist.  There was no ruching that could make you comfortable.  Material was soft and a light sweatshirt feel.  If you have short or very average length arms, you will enjoy this but if you have anything remotely described as long arms...don't do it!  The colors are nice and I REALLY wanted to like it.  Outside of ill sizing on the top, it is a great find and buy. Good luck!"
3.0,"I think these are designed with a specific body type in mind. I could hardly squeeze my thighs into these, like it took some real maneuvering. Material was nice though and seemed relatively squat proof once I was able to pull them up."
3.0,"I ordered the 0.7mm earrings and upon measuring, it was actually 0.8mm which is much bigger for my taste. That being said, I still get compliments on it."
3.0,"This dress was way too wide. I could grab an extra couple inches on both sides. The material is very stretchy, so better to order small."
3.0,Found the top runs about a size smaller than other short sleeve Lazy One tops.  The top does have stretch which is good.  The white in the picture is really more of a cream and the moose is sewn on about a quarter inch within the raw edges.  I worry about curling or fraying.  The length is generous and there is a somewhat wide red thread used to surge the hem about an inch above the bottom.  I am returning as it is a bit snug and I would have to pay to have it hemmed as it is a tunic length on me and I have a long waist-about 2 inches longer than standard.  Love the Lazy One products and own several pajama sets-this one would end up costing too much with alterations and would be too snug for my taste in a pj top.
3.0,It doesn't match the rose gold on the fit bit.
3.0,"Unfortunately, I received the wrong dress. Different size, color and style from what I ordered. The one I received is cute, and well made, just different from what I wanted, so I’ll be returning it."
3.0,Dress was very pretty but ran small
3.0,It’s made of unstretchy material. Not for adults
3.0,"If you have a nice slim shape, this suit is for you.  If you are a little chubby, this will show every single flaw.  I wear 14/16 (XL).  Otherwise, it is a very cute suit."
3.0,light however much to large
3.0,they were a gift but are a little big
3.0,Nice fabric but the sleeves are too BIG. A lot of armpit room for sure.
3.0,It's made with a spandex material wished it was cotton though. All in all nice print and great price
3.0,The colors weren't as bright as I expected but they were cute and served the purpose!
3.0,I ordered the red one in a large and it fit me great. The buttons are really cute. The only problem I had with it is it looks a little granny on my body with the “scrunchy” part being higher up rather than sitting on the waist which is how I thought it sit. The color is really bright and pretty and the dress is longer than expected. Still a cute dress but just not to much of my style personally. It would look really cute with some wedges or some heels though!
3.0,Narrow width to this brim .. only covers directly in front of your face.  No shade at all from the side.  Also.. brim is shorter than what it looks like in the photo. Well-constructed and nice crown .. too bad it doesn't really shade.
3.0,"Color came in as expected, but the material is stiff and the tunic is really wide and long..."
3.0,"Cute dress but too short in the waist.  I'm 5'9&#34; and about 160.  I don't usually have trouble with the waist being too high, and I &#34;think&#34; I have a normal waist length (whatever that is lol)."
3.0,"I really want to like these pants. I ordered the small, and they fit a bit loose (which is fine.) FTR I am 5'6&#34; and 115 lbs. The material they are made with is fairly heavy and seems of good quality. the design is nice and I like all the hardware and zippers. These pants look good. a couple of the zippers are just for show and are very difficult to zip/unzip. I washed these pants in hot water to try to shrink them up a bit, and two snaps fell off in the very first wash (one of the lower pockets and one of the back pockets). I don't own a snap tool so I don't think I can reattach them. there are two &#34;bands&#34; near the top of the thighs (think of the oldschool carpenter pants- they seem like straps from which to hang a hammer or other tool), that are kind of weird. they will be sticking out either to the outside or toward the crotch, depending on what you do with them. It is a bit strange. I really wish these had held up in the wash, because i do like the cut and style a whole lot. They are just what I wanted for work and for performing or going out to shows. I just wish the snaps hadn't fallen off so easily. who knows what will happen in the second wash. At a $30 price point, i wanted these pants to hold up a bit better. It is likely that I will still wear these fairly often."
3.0,"What I do like is that I got this item when it was on sale, so it wasn’t a huge waste of money. I also like that I wasn’t supposed to receive this item for at least another two weeks and it showed up today but I hadn’t received any tracking info so it was a surprise. I ordered the dark purple and when I opened the package it’s very light purple. Just looking at it overall it’s not bad. Putting it on is a different story. I ordered size medium based on recommendations. The jacket fits decently and the shorts fit okay. I will hang everything to dry so I don’t shrink it. The shirt on the other hand is almost transparent and it falls right below my chest. The model’s top is cropped but not to this extent. It’s very cheap material and I don’t know how well it will hold up, but it’s not the same as the pictures shown."
3.0,"This skirt does fit true to size, but when zipped it emphasizes imperfections rather than hides them. I have a slight belly, and the waistband squeezes my waist so tight, the belly sticks out way too much for my liking. The belt is flimsy, and the skirt itself is rather thin. I expected it to be warmer and thicker what with it being plaid and all. I think one size up would have worked better in terms of looks, but the thinness of the fabric is another thing working against it. Okay skirt but not the best out there."
3.0,Cute but needed a bigger size!!  Sized up one but two would have been better!!
3.0,"My kids' fit ok....they were sewed crooked and look ot, but other than that, super cute....<br /> Mine....however....i never buy things with no or low reviews. I guess i wont ever again, either. The XL shirt for me......is like a crop top. A tween may fit into it. In what world is it an xl? Not this one."
3.0,Cracked and started falling apart upon first use
3.0,Like the style and cut but the jacket was too small
3.0,"Has kind of a weird fit, the top is kind of large and the bottoms are very short. If you're planning on walking around you will end up with the shorts up your behind. Also it goes without saying but, not very easy to use the ladies room in a romper with a back zipper."
3.0,Pretty dress but it doesn't look like the pic
3.0,The dress is so cute but I had to glue all the larger embellishments back on as they fell to the ground when I took the dress out of the bag.
3.0,Looks as pictured. Material is thin though so will need to wear a slip or something underneath. Also if you don't want it too clingy order a size up. I ordered a Medium when I usually wear small and it fits close enough but not too close to be inappropriate for my office. Because it's so thin I would recommend handwashing so it doesn't lose its shape and become washed out quickly.
3.0,Good quality Sunglasses but a bit too small.
3.0,My granddaughter will love these...she loves to dress up & needs the bling!
3.0,Really cute just wish I'd order a size smaller
3.0,"This TBNY shoe is a perfect (albeit expensive) slip-on for someone who has a long, very narrow foot. I normally wear a 9.5 or 10 and I have a normal to slightly wide foot. I got a 9.5 given that this particular model was stated to be true-to-size (unlike many TBNYs, which run about 1 size big). This 9.5 TBNY is like a 10 in length but an 8.5-9 in width. Seems really well made, well packaged, beautiful blue-gray color, and good instep with better than average arch support (Ecco's is still better).  But I'm 0 for 2 now with TBNY and will stop trying them because of the sizing issues."
3.0,I’ve had these for a few months and the “gold” color is almost completely worn off. It makes me sad because I like them so much and they didn’t make my very sensitive ears itchy.
3.0,Big for my small wrist
3.0,not all that warm for minnesota
3.0,nice fit and great fabric - location of clasp in the middle of shoulder blades makes it next to impossible to fasten by yourself. I need assistance or you have to be double jointed to clasp
3.0,"No compression at all. I’m 6’4” 34 inch waist. Ordered large and they were to big. Ordered medium and they fit great but only if using as underwear. Not going to bother ordering small.  I gave it a 3 because they are nice looking, comfortable. But they are not even close to being a compression item."
3.0,Color is more of a mustard color instead of beige.
3.0,Fit fine but the black is pretty see through. I’ve had other pairs from90 degree in a grey color that didn’t have this problem. Won’t buy again.
3.0,Ok but didn't look as nice as I had hoped.
3.0,Cute but the slit in the front won’t stay closed. It opens up clear to the mid drift... let’s just say it’s now a house dress
3.0,"These are pretty cheap quality. But handy for small items. They are smaller than I expected, as noted in several other reviews"
3.0,It looks cheap but it's ok if you're just wanting something to wear on your wrist. Looks like some kids painted it
3.0,cute ring
3.0,I was hoping to love these but I just didn't like the fit of them. They were a little bulkier than I had hoped but I'm already bottom heavy so this style probably just isn't best for me. They were also shinier than I expected from the listing photos.
3.0,The handkerchiefs are an excellent quality. The description says that you will receive 6 handkerchiefs?! I only received 4 handkerchiefs. Definitely would be a 5+ ranking if I would have received the correct amount.
3.0,Ordered a medium.  Fits loosely and the back does not stay on very well
3.0,I ordered “merino wool” leg warmers only to find out it was a “blended” wool material with only 30% wool in it.  It was thought it was 100% wool.  This information should have been disclosed in the product description.
3.0,"The material and fit of this item was fine, but I returned it because I'd been looking for a shirt to wear with jeans, and this was just colored like a 'denim shirt' but wasn't....realized I was instead looking for shirt marked as ""chambray"" to get right material."
3.0,"don't expect to breathe with this mask, it's plastic and you can'r breath in it, it's just that simple"
3.0,"Love the different styles, but some of the rings leave a girl ring around my fingers. I'm not allergic to silver so wondering why"
3.0,The seller returned my money.
3.0,"Arrived broken, decided to go with a new watch altogether"
3.0,La calidad de la tela no es muy buena . Es transparente.
3.0,the pink long sleeve one was made out of poor material and the top was really big. the skirt too but it can be easily fixed with a safety pin.
3.0,"The collar is a little wide than normal, I hope it doesnt lose shape after wash. Got this shirt for a birthday gift, she is very petite and shirt is big for a size S. Hope it fits and she likes it!"
3.0,more purple than grey
3.0,Material seems to be quality. But was not manufacturing was not high quality. Buttons are loose and snap on pocket broke the first time I opened it. Snap on the pocket is not that noticeable defect though. The grasps on the zipper are not the same as the ones advertised online and have a funny look to them.
3.0,They are nice but they come and done kind of too easily so that’s why I gave it three stars
3.0,"Got this swim top and it was too small, had to return it."
3.0,Thought it would be a little longer
3.0,"I truly wanted to love this.  The square neck, detail on the shoulders and color are perfect!  wish the fit was better.  I ordered based on the size chart but it still fit a little small.  I typically wear a Xl but ordered up.  It fit snug in across the chest and it is very short in the body.  this may be because of the lack of room in the chest though."
3.0,"the trunks are about a size 9. They literally did not cover my crack. Luckily, I have other trunks I can wear with the top, because it is adorable and fit great. The color is not light blue though. I thought possibly the white was light blue in the pic and it was just a bad pic. Nope. What I thought was black is navy and the lighter part is white. Still a cute suit. Style work of for water aerobics too. No slipping straps!"
3.0,"The Viintage Golden Chain Jewelry Hollow Floral Adorned Pendant Necklace is pretty. However, I am truly petite, and it's just a bit large for my size. I will wear it, however. I don't know if the artist meant to do this or not, but I see animals, a cross, and other things in the necklace. Some were hard to recognize at first. This jeweler worked to make an interesting piece."
3.0,I liked the color it was exactly as viewed. The dress had rouging which was also nice
3.0,These are huge! It says 1t to 2t but the package I just received said size 4/12 to 8/12! Waaaay too big. I did get them on sale so I'm going to put them up and save them for later on. Quality wise they seem nice. 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,"Product is pretty.  However, the color isn't as deep a purple as I expected.  It's more lavender."
3.0,I wear size 10 shoes. The socks are a little small and too short. They are at least 6 inches lower than knee highs should be. But the design is cute
3.0,"It edges are grey, not smooth or finished. Other than that its works."
3.0,"I bought these for a festival I went to. I got big thighs and small calf’s and a soemwhat in the middle of big and small waist so I thought an XL would be good. Well, too big for my waist, loses color where my thighs are, waaayyy too long and I’m 5’6. My thighs aren’t huge but they’re are considered big to me so I was surprised the pants did that."
3.0,"The design is breathable, with the nose vent and mesh lining, but the ear rings cause the mask to ride up - blocking view.  Received in a reasonable amount of time."
3.0,Good price and quality. Not really aesthetically pleasing for smaller sizes.
3.0,It was definitely way too big... since it has elastic I should have sized down. I gave it 3 stars because it’s comes as pictured. I bought it to try and make shift a dress I wanted and it just didn’t work out
3.0,Seem to be cheaply made.
3.0,Decent price for the amount of bras you receive but you MUST push the strap adjuster all the way to the back for secure support otherwise you’ll be adjusting it all day.
3.0,Order it a size bigger than what you would usually wear
3.0,"This product took forever to deliver to me. And then it wasn’t as long as it’s pictured. It’s still cute, but I’m the picture it looks like it goes just below the knees... however, it’s way above the knees in actuality. I’m only 5’3"
3.0,"Cute, comfortable, but it fit somewhat large."
3.0,I didn't really like the way it looked
3.0,"Completely different hat then pictured (different color and style of plaid)...a little dissapointed, but kept it anyway"
3.0,"I am about 5'6"", 175 lbs and large chested and bought a size L which was too small. Shorter and less slouchy then expected but the fabric was pretty. Would be a good purchase if you have a smaller chest."
3.0,It fits kind of tight in the bust so if you are a big busted girl I recommend going up a size. I do like the dress even though I only gave it 3 stars. It was pretty much what I expected for the price.
3.0,Too small for use.
3.0,After a few washes it will shrink so be mindful of that. When I first got it I really liked it the color is really pretty.
3.0,The product was not what I expected. Did not fit as expected and a belt loop was not seen on
3.0,Cute in the picture but they are way to big once you put them on. Much flashier looking in person though.
3.0,"I got a different color to the one pictured. It clearly looks Black/Gray/Blue, but it's rather Black/Beige/Blue. I don't mind too much because it looks good."
3.0,I bought a XS and it was long & not tight as I expected it to be. I liked the style but too big for me.
3.0,I ordered the brown flower black pattern.<br />The leaves which are light yellow green in the picture are actually a darker orange color.<br />You can see the picture comparing what I receive to work was advertised.
3.0,"fits well, does not hold up real well to washing and drying"
3.0,I like the style. But on one of them the snap pulled out. The edges are kind of rough but I sanded down with a nail file. I like that my snap beads all fit really well.
3.0,"Just received this wallet. Quality is good, plenty of card slots. Only drawback is that this wallet is huge! Very hard to get in and out of the back pocket of my jeans, and it will not fit at all in the rear pockets of my dress slacks. Was not that expensive, so will probably pass it on to my grandson."
3.0,"toddler loves them, but one of the shoes has a short in it so it doesnt stay lit up all the time. it kinda cuts in and out or sometimes doesnt light up at all"
3.0,"I am 5'5"" and weigh 165. I am a bit curvy at the hips. Have a 36D bust. Dress was too tight at the thighs. I bought a medium.I was not a fan of how it looked after it was tied at the waist. The material was nice. Thicker than I expected."
3.0,Needs more quality in the pocket area (threading)
3.0,Very pretty shirt- but two sizes smaller than what was ordered (even though the tag says XL it is more like a medium)
3.0,Nice quality- but not as big as pictured
3.0,Bottoms are small
3.0,I wasn't prepared for how tight these pant would be.  They feel more like body shapers than yoga pants.
3.0,"Very pretty and dainly but much smaller than I expected, more of a child's size."
3.0,"I loved the fit. Made my bottom look phenomenal but the length was too short and the legs had discolored bands, bad dye job."
3.0,It has more of a yellow tint than green.
3.0,"I bought two of these dresses in two different sizes, l and xl. I normally wear a large but different styles may run smaller. I like how the dress sits on my back but not in front. Not flattering and makes me look a tad bit pregnant. I will use them to sleep or hang around the house. Might get a medium to see if that will work better. But the dress is light and soft. I love that part."
3.0,Get what you expect for the money
3.0,"These were a gift for my boyfriend. They were really cool looking but not so feminine which is why I bought them, and The price was great. Shipping was average but I'm giving it 3 stars because there was barely any &#34;marble&#34; design on them. The picture is was more detailed and looks like that's what you'll be getting. But in reality, they're just black... Otherwise good earrings, for now."
3.0,"Ordered my normal size in skirts - size Small. Waist is very comfortable & could fit many sizes. Length was to my ankles at 5'4"". Material is more see through from thighs down & a light layered chiffon type. I have small hips but the skirt gave me a bubble effect between the waist & the hips. Has a seam on each side between the waist & hip which created a bubble look on me. Perhaps on someone with different measurements it would lie better."
3.0,"The girl in the photo must be an XXS wearing a XL, because there is no way this shirt can be worn without pants. It's a decent shirt and I like it, but it just doesn't work the way the photo shows with see through stockings."
3.0,the fabric is a marina type fabric but its okay
3.0,Per my daughter dress does not stretch when doing back bends.
3.0,It’s pretty but the straps on the arms are really tight looks a little weird
3.0,VERY difficult to get on.....but it is nice and the magnet is strong to keep the watch on as tight as wanted.
3.0,daughter like it
3.0,LOVE the top! But the bottoms that went with it were too small even after using the sizing chart great material and price for the pieces.
3.0,The top fit as expected and the bottoms were super small around the hem
3.0,"I like it. Unfortunately, it is a little too tight because of the fabric. It will really hug you and stretch out the bust area, which makes it a little see-through. However, the design and material are actually nice. I'm petite. I ordered a Small and wish I ordered a Medium. I probably will order a size up because it's really nice."
3.0,"Nice roomy tote with great color, but NOT leather as advertised.  Despite the faux leather tag, it feels and smells like plastic.  Too bad I have to return this item."
3.0,"Masks are awesome, I’ve bought them before. When the package arrived one of the boxes of masks was without its box. All the masks were in the clear vacuum sealed bag as they should be but I didn’t like that one of the 2 boxes was essentially missing."
3.0,shrunk
3.0,"Very comfy was sad I had to return it, it was too small"
3.0,It’s cute but nothing fancy totally for a fun Christmas party
3.0,These were very cheap but awesome sunglasses. The only issues were that the lenses were not green. This alone dropped it from a 5 to a 3. If I received what was marketed in the picture I would have been 100% satisfied and happy.
3.0,"Love the material, love the way they look, but will Not stay on at all"
3.0,The product fits great! But my son has only worn this outfit twice and the straps on the pants are falling off. I'm kind of disappointed.
3.0,fits 2 sizes too small
3.0,Poorly made but you know what you r paying for. It does work for what i wanted.
3.0,The mask is too small for adult.
3.0,"These aren't as high- waisted as they appear on the model. They don't really provide much shaping and only just a little smoothing. They have like a rubbery, slightly sticky ""band"" that looks similar to hot glue along the waistband to prevent the garment from slipping, sliding, or rolling. It doesn't work very well as 1. The fabric is not stiff enough on its own to really hold up,  2. The waistband is also not thicker or reinforced in a way that might help prevent rolling, and 3. The garment sits more at a mid- rise point which is more likely to fold or roll down."
3.0,"Great quality in stitching.  Material is thicker than desired, but I suppose that’s a good thing when it comes to a mask.  My son is a smaller 10year old and these were a bit tight for him.  He can wear them, but definitely does not prefer them over his looser, thinner gators.  Probably better for little kids-like 5 and under."
3.0,"My daughter purchased this for me as I had asked for it and it came in a nice zip bag.  The picture on ad shows the sleeve reaching to the elbow but it does NOT, at least on larger sizes.  I wear an 18-20 so I ordered the XXL based on their size chart and that is largest they sell.  The fit is comfortable everywhere, the light weight fabric is very nice 65% cotton, 35%polyester and colors are bright and sleeve cut-out is nice...BUT the bottom of sleeve length should be longer as sizes go up to reach elbow length.  I have heavier upper arms with some folds as pictured in my photo and the sleeve does not reach elbow to cover this area, so bottom ruffle of sleeve should be about 2” longer and it would be perfect.  This is made in China and fabric care tag says dry clean recommended but I think a cold wash on delicate would work also."
3.0,"I really like the color, very true to the image. But way to small."
3.0,This bra runs small. I ordered the medium as I'm a 34D and it barely covered the front of my breasts. I've had an augmentation so I wasnt needing any support which is a good thing considering there is zero support. I'm sending it back and considering ordering a larger size but not sure if I'd need a large or xs considering how small it runs. It is a very pretty bra however!
3.0,Cute dress and nice material. The picture leads you to believe it comes with a bow but it just comes with a strip of fabric you can use to create a bow/headband. Also - it’s DRY CLEAN. Who in the world makes children’s clothes that are dry clean??
3.0,turned my wrist black... wear on special occasions only.  also band scratches easily
3.0,"I just received this today. The packaging was great, but it doesn't really fit the cleavage area as well as I thought. It runs a little too small there but everywhere else fit just fine. I purchased an XL, I usually wear a 10/12 in jeans, bust is 38DD. I would probably gift this to a friend. It's to pretty to not wear out :)"
3.0,Day one. Nice.
3.0,Doesn't even come close too fitting as well as had rips in the pants by the crotch
3.0,"Size run small - especially in length. Its a solid material, but a bit rough. Not for use while grooming outside as it doesn't breathe. Also, you can barely fit anything in the pockets - maybe toothpaste and a brush but you're pushing your luck with that. Order 1 size up I suppose, if you're really keen. Nice print, quality material, but bad fit and highly overpriced."
3.0,The apron was nice until washed on gentle cycle in wash. Then the tie straps became strings and trash. It didn’t look like the same apron. Amazon is sending a replacement and I will not put in the washer. Only hand dry. Overall not bad for the price - just don’t put in washer.
3.0,"The boots are warm, however the straps are really long and the zippers unzip on their own"
3.0,Pretty dress.  Too tight in the breast.  I have 36 DDD. 140 lbs.  5’1
3.0,"Slides up too easily, folding under doesn't help"
3.0,A little smaller than I'd like but they are fine
3.0,Not a sweatshirt and runs large
3.0,"They are VERY tight. My 7 year old doesn't want to wear them because of this, and he has a slimmer than average head. I'll probably hang on to them for littler family members."
3.0,I ordered a large and fit more like a small
3.0,"The dress it self is really cute, but super thin.<br />Keep in you mind that you have to SIZE UP, im normally 14 and I ordered Large<br />But i couldn’t even zip up! Will return it for sure."
3.0,"I bought a different brand last time, and they lasted much longer before stretching out of shape.  But what the heck, they don’t cost much.."
3.0,"Smaller than we expected, but the real problem was they were too hard to get together, ended up not using them in production. Once you got the together they looked very nice."
3.0,"Handkerchiefs that are ok. Looking for a better product for the price, but didn't get it! Not good quality."
3.0,fast delivery. And fits as expected. Just a bit concerned of the quality of the material used. Not set for durability.
3.0,"Maybe I just received a defective pair of shorts, but after going into the pool the hot-pink color from the waistband bled out on my towel.  I don't swim that often, so this happened after the return period expired and the seller would not honor the situation.  Luckily Amazon did.  Swim shorts that do this aren't worth anything."
3.0,"It’s a cute dress, but rides up constantly. I can’t even wear it unless I wanna show everyone my butt"
3.0,"I didnt give it a higher review because the top is not made right. The top basically has one boob covering in the front as it should be and the other is in the back,smh. The colors are beautiful and the skirt is perfect, too bad I cant use the top."
3.0,The size isnt accurate and the split is way to high. My buttocks was exposed. The material is itchy as well.
3.0,BEST FIT:  Smaller Adult face or Elementary - HS kids<br /><br />I have a larger face and this was not a comfy fit. So Cute! But you can use an extender...
3.0,They are a little oversized and are not as dainty looking as they appear in the picture.
3.0,Cute set and quality is fine for the price but I followed the measurement chart and purchased accordingly even though it put me 2 sizes up from what I'd typically buy. Well guess what? 😂 It was huge and wouldnt even stay on my waist. Returned.
3.0,Nice look but runs small.
3.0,This blouse was actually really cute but too short for me in the front. I carry weight in my stomach and it’s just not long enough to cover even at a minimum.
3.0,"The front tops come up higher than I had hoped for the clogs I want to wear them with. I was trying to order the same style of Sperry socks I had in the past, Sperry Top Sider Signature. These aren't the same, though the name is similar. They'll work with low top sneakers though so I'll use them, just not to fulfill the need I had."
3.0,The service was great for receiving my watchband. I am not sure the magnetic style is really right for me. It seems to loosen up a bit when you move your arm around.
3.0,It's a bit smaller than I thought
3.0,Runs smaller than I would like.
3.0,"I'm normally a 10.5, my regular hiking boots are size 10, I ordered these in 10.5 and every one of my toes was pushed against the front. The strap on the side that tightens with the laces makes for a very secure fit, but also makes the boot hard to get off and on. I only wore them inside because I ended up returning them, but the tread did not seem aggressive enough for any serious hike in serious woods. I would also like to see the bottom of the shoe a little more profiled to the foot instead of just flat with edges. The stitching was also a little asymmetrical when I looked down at my feet. While this didn't noticeably affect the fit, I would expect better craftsmanship and quality control for a shoe at this price point"
3.0,It came with a hole and a bunch of strings coming off it. Doesn’t seem like it will last long.
3.0,These look more like womens socks than men. size seems to run very small
3.0,I love this shirt! That being said. The fabric is so thin that you can see anything you're wearing under it. It the fabric were better and not so thin I would have given 5 stars
3.0,It fits a little on the baggy side
3.0,"definitely size down on this, the material is super stretchy and accomodating, but it feels like it'd look better on me if i had one size smaller. i'll be taking this in at the seams for a perfect fit. do not buy this as a corset, it's a top/shirt, does not have any boning or constriction elements."
3.0,"Love it, but its not as orange as I hoped. Its more of a burnt orange than tangerines.  May order more colors."
3.0,"This belt comes packaged nicely in a silk bag.  It's strong, thick and sturdy.  The finish is not so great.  It has a very cheap look and fell to it.  More like polyurethane and not real leather.  The scent of the belt is not overpowering and it's really hard to tell if it is real leather because you just don't get the ""authentic leather smell""."
3.0,I received this dress a day before event and had some threads coming out. Also noticed the tag was removed. Not sure if received an old dress. Please do Quality check before sending order.
3.0,The shoulders are very small.
3.0,Low the outfit but it's cut a bit short. I'm 5'2-160. I purchased a medium and it was still a bit short.
3.0,"Too short, nothing like the picture in length."
3.0,"This was a package of two.  The first one my son used fit perfectly.  However, when he went to use the second one, it would not fit over his head.  It was very small and had no stretch to it.  I had also bought a package for my daughter and both fit her perfectly."
3.0,flimsy but okay
3.0,"I ordered the ASTRO one.  The metal is decent quality.  The metal clasp even seems fairly strong.  The plastic was what I expected, but the stickers on the plastic are faded in comparison to the picture in the description (especially on the Robong version 2 plastic piece)."
3.0,"Ended up sending it back because I wasn't exactly happy with how it fit me. I'm a 36DD, 135 lbs and it didn't quite fit my bust or shoulders right. Love the company, will try and order other things!"
3.0,El vestido es muy lindo pero queda muy pequeño
3.0,These stayed on fine. They didn't fall out at all. The bottom was comfortable and didn't really mess with my speach. The top ones were awful. They were WAYYYYY too big for my mouth. The size and height of the teeth were huge. I couldn't talk with the top teeth in. They worked for my costume.
3.0,"It's made in China. It's like a Men's small tee without sleeves. Tight around hips, loose/gappy under arms. Cute design, soft fabric, won't bother return for price, but wouldn't have ordered if I knew the fit was men's-like."
3.0,"This is the strangest bra I  have ever owned. It is made entirely of lightweight woven non-stretch cotton with only a short piece of elastic in back on each side of the fasteners. The straps are a stiff non stretch cotton. I was very skeptical when I first saw it but I put it on and it's surprisingly comfortable.  I have been wearing it for about 9 hours so far and it doesn't dig, pinch or ride up and the girls haven't tried to escape.<br /><br />On the negative side, the reason I'm only giving it three stars, the cups are an extremely odd shape. To be clear I was looking for bras with retro shaped cups but these are extreme even for me. They're very cone shaped and my &#34;girls&#34; don't fill them up all the way to the tip so there's a bit of excess fabric there. It is comfortable though so I'm going to wear it anyway, but probably only at home."
3.0,"Producto de excelente calidad, pero demasiado pequeño..<br />Por favor considerarlo para talla de niños y no para adultos..segun como lo indica el anuncio.."
3.0,"Skirt fit perfectly but I don't like the fabric, is not like the photo. It's satin shine"
3.0,is to big for me
3.0,too big for my head . had to give away
3.0,These run a bit small.  The XL is a little small  for my men’s 10.5 feet with socks.  The bottom is slippery nylon (same material on entire exterior).  Fine for lounging indoors.
3.0,"It's pretty but the leather is thinner than I expected and the buckle is silver so it doesn't match the face.<br /><br />Other than that, it's as advertised."
3.0,Socks will roll down!
3.0,"Please be sure to order a size or two up. I ordered this for my 12-year old son, and got a small based on the sizing chart. It's way off. I am now trying to see if the large is better for him. This shouldn't happen. Now I have to rush and reorder before Christmas. Please update the sizing chart for the shirt you are selling and separate the women from the men in sizing. Thanks so much."
3.0,Smaller than thought from description. But nice watch.
3.0,I love the design in the arms. It's light and very comfortable. I've washed it a number of times and it has held up fine. It shrunk a tiny bit in the dryer but nothing major.<br /><br />I am docking stars because the sweater is definitely not long like it is in the picture. On me it falls to wear the models white shirt ends. Im 5'2&#34;. It is more like an open front cardigan that drops down to my waist rather than thighs. I wouldnt recommend it for pairing with leggings. It would not covor your butt at all!
3.0,Saves wall space but doesn't hold pool cues well.  They stretch and pool cue falls or slides.  Needs a stopper under neath.
3.0,One star down for not telling where its made (made in china be the way).<br />Second star down for the price of a genuine RayBan.<br />I would have not bought it if i knew that it is not a genuine.
3.0,"The skirt was nice, but I prefer my skirts longer."
3.0,Super cute and my kids love it but the hem started to unravel almost immediately.  :(
3.0,"I love love love two out of the 8 pairs. the other 6 are very cheaply made and I feel like they might fall apart after a few wears. im glad I didn't spend anymore money on all these pairs. they did come nicely packaged in a plastic box, so that was nice."
3.0,"You can't tighten these as much as you would a fully metal ring. The balls are plastic and once they get to a certain tightness they just spin over and you have to tighten again. It's very beautiful, and if you change out your jewelry often, like to match an outfit, it's not a big deal. I like to wear mine constantly though, so I am sending mine back. I dont know if I got a bad ring, or if that is just how it's designed, but I consider this a defect."
3.0,Sweater wasn’t long which I bought it based on the pic. Shame because it’s so pretty. Buy if you like sweater to land above or around bellybutton
3.0,"Nice ring, very large. Nothing spectacular about, but nothing bad either. I've been wearing it, its comfortable."
3.0,"Thin material, broke in washer. Cute pattern though 😔"
3.0,"These are very cute sticker earrings.  They are a little puffy so they look nice and not like flat stickers.  They only stick one time and come off pretty easily. We've not been able to get more than a few hours out of them. You get a lot of earrings in this package, but I won't buy again.  We had another brand that were little gems that my daughter would wear for several days (taking them off at bedtime and putting them back on the next morning - sometimes even taking them off mid-day).  They were a little more expensive since you don't get the quantity, but the amount of wears  easily balances out.  I'll go back to those."
3.0,I bought this dress in several colors and patterns and no two fit the same to be prepared for trying on and exchanging to get it right.
3.0,This is a nice flowy dress. Note to buyers: The front is cut weird so you may need a tube bra to cover your bits. The pockets are on the sides not the front so be mindful the dress can make you look hippy if it's too tight
3.0,"These earrings are very beautiful but after like 3days of wearing 2pairs it turned black, it's not original fake gold."
3.0,A LITTLE TO SMALL FOR ME..
3.0,The fit was good but I wasn’t thrilled about the quality of the lace and since this was for attending a wedding I decided to return. It came with a little hair bow though and the color was a rose pink.
3.0,"The fit and design of the cardigan was nice, but the material is almost that of a Halloween costume. This is not something I can use every day since the material looks rather inexpensive."
3.0,"Very well made, but lots and lots of fabric in the skirt. If you are not very thin, this dress might not be flattering to the hips and mid section."
3.0,Though this product is super cute but I have tiny wrists. The tightest link made it so that it was still way too big on me. I could not secure it around my wrist so it kept slipping down which made the chain around my finger keep slipping off. It was a bit annoying but if you have normal sized wrists then I say go for it! It just wasn’t a fit for me.
3.0,I wear a large and it was just way too small. Soft material but cotton and seemed like it would shrink even more.
3.0,"I bought these gloves to replace latex ones.  I primary use these when I go out to do grocery shoppings so that I don’t need to touch a shopping cart directly.  They are ok, no complaints for that use."
3.0,"The price certainly is right, the color is pretty , the &#34;wool&#34; is not soft ."
3.0,These boots were very soft and very cute. They seemed super comfy but unfortunately they ran a little small and didn’t fit my son in his normal size. We decided to return them.
3.0,Can’t figure out how to use them.  No instructions.
3.0,Tennis Skirt
3.0,BROKE EASILY
3.0,"These are play shoes however if your child plays basketball they will literally hurt themselves in it. My son slipped and slide all over the court. They look great but if you want to save your childs ankles and possible future career in sports, please just buy good shoes from professionals. I learned the hard way."
3.0,"tight in the waist, the fabric is hot -- not in a good way"
3.0,Very cute top but isn’t exactly what is pictured. It runs very small and isn’t as long as advertised.
3.0,Decent length and cut. Material is quite thick I was uncomfortable at the gym wearing it. Better as a shell under a blazer or cardigan than a workout shirt. Definitely makes a great layering piece for fall wardrobes
3.0,"I love the feel of this dress. The sizing is a little off, I'd size up one size. The fabric is SUPER clingy so it shows off EVERY little imperfection and you can see right through it. (dont wear dark colored undies) Colors are beautiful."
3.0,I love the look but after just a few times wearing it the arms are all pilly.
3.0,"Ordered the dress.  Received an email asking for measurements to be confirmed.  I didn't confirm my measurements, asked for the dress to be shipped.  I was told the dress would be MADE and couldn't not be returned simply because it didn't fit.<br />Dress FINALLY arrived.  Too small!"
3.0,It cuts under your knee and is very uncomfortable.  I had to snip the top band
3.0,the charm is okay but the chain broke within minutes
3.0,"Not as sturdy as other bags I've had, but ok."
3.0,"Hay is not wool, it's cotton and polyester. Was ok fit more like a wet cowboy hat."
3.0,The material is too cheap.
3.0,"Runs small, order up!"
3.0,Looks nice but it is a bit heavy
3.0,Lower rise than I generally prefer. Somewhat snug in the thighs; nice for the lower legs and overall balanced look.  Would really like the tall size in gray/pewter..
3.0,Unfortunately the top was too small for my chest size but the bottoms fit great.  It would be nice to be able to select each size separately
3.0,I really wanted to love this but the fit was weird. It was short in the back and the sleeves were too wide for my liking. I love the color scheme but ended up returning.
3.0,"Liked the fabric and color but was a little strange fitting around the middle. Higher and bulkier than the picture. Could just be meant for a different body type. 5’3, 118 lbs."
3.0,Shirt is awesome but does run a bit small.  I would suggest going up a size.
3.0,"The description said they run small, however I did not find that to be true. Great looking shoe, just didn't fit."
3.0,"just okay,I guess i thought they would be softer."
3.0,"I really loved this purse. It had a terrible smell when it arrived but was able to get it out with a few washes. I bought this in the other pattern for myself and loved it so much I bought this one for my mother who also loved it.<br />Pros: lightweight, good strap length, lots of pockets for easy organizing, love the color patterns.<br />Cons: side pockets are basically useless(too small for a water bottle or phone, can only really fit hand sanitizer), zippers don’t hold up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after owning for maybe a month with casual use, the front zipper kept breaking and finally came apart completely. So I can no longer use this purse as the front pocket is just open and not secure (this is where I kept my phone). Disappointed as I was considering buying other bags from them but will have to look elsewhere."
3.0,"Looks great!, however it was already missing a diamond when I received it. Also I noticed when I was getting ready to take it off that it was already unfastened (good for that moment, but a bit upsetting if I lost my Apple Watch). It’s definitely cute, but not with the money spent."
3.0,They were just too big for my fingers otherwise good rings.
3.0,Nice socks but runs small.
3.0,"6'2 270, I've bought 2 other XL sweaters this winter and compared to them, this is a medium."
3.0,It's small and hard to put in
3.0,Size 12 is very small
3.0,"Weirdly boxy and a bit too big even though I paid for my normal size (m). If you size down, I'm sure it'll look better"
3.0,"It's a cute hat of decent quality, but too small for my almost 22"" head, so there is no way it would fit the larger size stated in the description.  The veil is not as long as on some and, from the picture, it looked to be more of a nylon fabric but it is heavier, cloth fabric so not as easy to clean or as cool for summer."
3.0,"This clasp could have so many more uses if the plastic buffer piece, for delicate fabric, could be removed. I put it on the back of a chambray shirt dress, to make it tighter around the waist, it looked amazing! First movement and the fabric slipped right out of the clasp. It would have held just fine if the teeth of the clasps were exposed."
3.0,"Good product, except my red tank came in torn."
3.0,It feels cheap and uncomfortable.
3.0,"I got a lot of orange and yellows Like at least half were orange/yellow/gold which I don't wear ever. I wish there was more of an assortment in my pack. Or at least a color that is versatile and could go with multiple outfits... I didn't get any variations whatsoever of purple, black, white, silver or pink. So I am bummed about that but it was a risk buying a random mix so oh well."
3.0,Too large and bulky.
3.0,average slip. Got the Xl 12/14 and it was more like a camisole. snug.
3.0,Over all nice. strap is smaller in length and width.
3.0,"REALLY PRETTY! Fits beautifully around the waist, but WAY too small across the chest. If it had some give in the chest area, it would work-related however it just makes everything awkwardly flat. Had to return."
3.0,"I used this product for my halloween costume, but it was almost completely see through"
3.0,"Decent strap for the price.  Definitely looks like embossed croc pattern leather, not real alligator or croc.  That's fine with me though, it's a cheap strap with the color that I wanted.  I'd give it another star, but the watch I received was NOT 26mm as ordered.  It measured out to 26.8mm, which made it a huge issue to fit between the lugs of my watch.  It was put on a Jeanrichard Aquascope Hokusai which has a 25mm curved lug width, so a 25.7mm straight strap is just about perfect, 26mm fits pretty well, 26.8mm though wouldn't fit without a lot of fighting and determination!"
3.0,"I've been buying these watches for years.  If the watch bands themselves were 1/2 as good as the watches, they'd be a lot better, but as they are now, they end up cracking or the little 'arm' breaks.  Cheaper construction that they used to be.  If you buy the watch, just count on buying another band before too long as well or better yet, buy an aftermarket one."
3.0,a bit shorter then expected-cute but dont bend over
3.0,Cute but the ears look nothing like in the picture. More pointy and Fox looking than cat ears. Sadly had to return but they are very easy to work with!
3.0,I like the pocket and how easy this was to spot clean. It’s also not too hot even in very hot summer weather. However it started fraying after only a couple of hand washes. I ended up buying a replacement elsewhere.
3.0,"This would make an excellent diaper bag, but I really wanted it as a tote and it's just a bit too large for me, and a little dowdy looking, but my  bad for not reading the dimensions properly. Nicely made and very roomy though. I would use as carry on bag when traveling, or DIAPER BAG (that's really what is most resembles)."
3.0,"Just received the wallet today. I'm not sure what the outer cover is, but it does not seem to be leather. I removed the little card in the window. The slit seemed to stretch out. Not good. The material inside the wallet is 100 times better than the outside. I hope I get my monies worth out of it."
3.0,"This bikini reminded me of 60’s fashion. The suit is well made with both the top and the bottom being lined. The bottom is made of silky swim material and feels good. The top is more like a seersucker knit. The top has cups but the cups move around and sometimes they float above my boobs. The collar on the top of the suit won’t stay open and keeps turning in. I will probably need to tack the corners in place. That said, the top does not fit me well. I am 140 lbs and 5’6’”. My chest is 36B. I think I need bigger boobs to wear this top. The “tie” in the front is for looks only and is not functional.  The suit accentuates my body in all the wrong places focusing eyes on my middle age tummy. Not a fan."
3.0,It's really cute. But the stones fell out fast. Not worth the $15
3.0,Gloves are great EXCEPT liner us not attached at end of fingers.  Remove your cold hands and liner comes out with your hand.  Pain to get back into fingers correctly.  Nuisance to wear.  So close to perfect and screwed up due to a missed stitch on every finger tip.
3.0,Only wow and washed it once and it's bally now.
3.0,"Dress is overall cute for price but very cheap fabric. It's stretch which is nice, but not entirely what I had hoped for or expected based off reviews and pictures. The seam/waist is empire and sits just below my bust which is disappointing....also because of that I'm not really sure how to wear the belt, though it's not needed for this to be a good every day dress. I love the length, slits are pretty high."
3.0,"My daughter adores these shoes but only wears them at home, and even with limited wear, the back bow has come off both of them multiple times.  I keep hot-gluing it back on, but it never stays very long.  If she wore them daily, I'm sure they'd be in tatters by now."
3.0,nice pants but they are really short.
3.0,"My kids absolutely loved their sonic outfits! They still do but after the 1st wash it’s really dimmed out and there is strings hanging out all over the shirt, still not a complete waste cause my kids can wear it as pjs or play clothes and they still feel like like coolest kids on the block in their sonic outfits!"
3.0,I love the world map pendants but both items chains were broken within the plastic bag they shipped in.  So the necklace chain is cheap. But I added the pendants to another chain I have and I love it. I have received many compliments on pendants
3.0,"These do not provide as much comfort as I was expecting. They are overly warm, especially with bare feet."
3.0,I'm taking he review to 3 stars only because of their pckaging choice. It was way too wasteful. It came in it's own Ziploc waterproof bag And a huge box including airpacks fr protection. Wtf?
3.0,I stopped wearing a watch
3.0,"the setting is very pretty. the only thing I am disappointed n is the center stone. it looks like plastic,"
3.0,It was not made well. It was to small.<br />The color was great. I just put it away.
3.0,"I wanted to like them, but they are probably more flattering on a small size"
3.0,Some of the lights didn't work
3.0,"Size 38 is pre wash size at best, after a few washes for sure it will go to way smaller.  Advertized as stretch, but it has no stretch quality.  Misprepresentation of the fact here...  I returned it immediately.  Why 3 stars?  Well, if you have a 36 waist and do not care about stretch, they are kind of ok!"
3.0,the dress fit really well and the material was nice and soft but stiff (if that makes any sense) the collar stands up really well but the problem is that its quite loose while the remainder of the dress fit me well. maybe my shoulders aren't broad enough. it would kind of puff up and i would readjust and pull it back down and it would lay flat and look great. then i would walk around the house and raise my arms and move around and the shoulders would work their way back up again. it would be too much work for me to keep pulling it down. i realllllly liked the look of it though so i'm kind of sad that i'm returning it.
3.0,Sad it didnt come with the white shorts but love the sheer
3.0,It doesn't fit as well as I hoped it would.  There is a loop that pushes the watch to 1 side.
3.0,"I followed the size chart and was even a bit cautious with oversize. But still the size was too big. The shoes are okay. Poor design with how usb plug and button are put away. Well, they pop out so when you try to tug them away, its pretty cramped in the sleeve."
3.0,Cute but sizing is way off
3.0,Fabric is really stretchy making it feels big. Normally I wear Large but I would change for a Medium.  Other than that fabric feels soft and nice.<br />If you’re not big in the breast area go down a size. But if you want a loose fit it will be perfect on your normal/regular size.
3.0,"I had to return my first one for it being too big, I’m a medium in everything and I ended up getting a small. The small was still big on the waist but nothing a quick sew can’t fix. Also not small chest friendly (the straps are needed). It was itchy as well, but keep in mind it’s a costume so don’t expect too much. For reference I’m a 32-34B. On the bright side the gloves are really nice."
3.0,It's waaay smaller than it looks in the picture they used! They might as well have just a super small chain.
3.0,"Good watch, but the luminosity is lacking.  The hands only illuminate for a short time after prolonged exposure to light.  At 3 or 4 in the morning when I try to see what time it is, the watch hands are not illuminated. I wanted a watch that I could use in the dark and this is not the one."
3.0,"While the material appears fine, the sizing is off, the fingers are way longer than you'd expect for the palm size."
3.0,Very pretty.  A couple were damaged and cannot be used.
3.0,"It is beautiful, but within three hours of wearing it the star broke off."
3.0,Mike
3.0,"Pretty, but only for tiny women"
3.0,"I know I should have expected lower quality from buying a set of 6 sunglasses for a decent price, but I did at least expect them to be able to sit straight on your face. They did not. Not one single pair sat straight, so I sent them back. I am an adult though with a small face, and think that these would be perfect for a child who breaks things easily and it doesn't matter if they sit straight or not. The colors are nice and they're actually pretty clear to look through. But I couldn't deal with not being able to get them to sit level, and no amount of moving the nose pieces on the bridge fixed it."
3.0,I received this as a gift and have found it very useful to carry in my work bag. I do wish that it had the inside pocket and /or snap strap that is mentioned in the description as they might be easier to use for storing the bag rather than having to keep track of the tiny zipper bag.
3.0,"I love my shoes they are very eye catching and fits tru to size, i bought a size 8"
3.0,The color on the picture is pink but it’s not pink
3.0,"Super cute, but if you have anything bigger than a c cup it won’t work."
3.0,"These are cheap, so I really can't complain too much. They're a little large for my relatively small face. The bigger issue I have with them is that they seem to catch a lot of glare and obstructs vision at certain angles. I like that they are polarized."
3.0,"Nice size, beautiful clock face. It is the band I have a problem with. It isn't flexible, so when you wrap it in a circle around your wrist it bends and makes a mark on the band that doesn't go away (like you folded it). It also didn't go small enough for my wrist."
3.0,"the pants are good quality the problem is size is off,  my son is YL the pants fit nice but not to tight from his calf up but the problem is that the end of the pant won't go through his feet they don't stretch enough and needs assistance from an adult to get them in and even though is still hard, SUB SPORT fix this and it will be 5 STAR ITEM"
3.0,"This is not as wide as a regular shower curtain, the material is very flimsy (not cloth more like a plastic material). It's for a guest bathroom so I'll use it until I find something nicer."
3.0,"This item is perfect for waist training, but the fit is somewhat large. If waist training, you may want to order a size smaller to achieve the desired results."
3.0,This necklace is VERY LARGE.  It looks pretty and petite in this picture but the larger &#34;bubbles&#34; in the picture here are easily the size of a quarter.  Just so you know ... :)
3.0,"Bought this to be a Christmas gift for my dad, was disappointed when I got it to see that the imprinting on the bottom was not perfect. It's not terrible, but had I seen it I would have picked a different one. I've bought from this company before, so I know it's just a defect but sad it got shipped to me. I bought my husband the John 3:16 one last year and it still looks great! It's wearing very well."
3.0,The top of the purple dress doesn’t match the bottom!! However it fits great!!
3.0,"Worked as advertised, good product."
3.0,"I bought a 3x cuz I wanted it to be loose, I usually wear a 2x, I'm 250 lbs, 5'4&#34; and I don't have big breasts.... this was too large and very doudy and  shapeless. I'm thinking a 1x would be better even if it were kind of tight. I did like the length. But I did a return and they gave it back really quickly which was wonderful."
3.0,"Great fit,  see through material."
3.0,Good quality but a size 11 didn't fit my husband's size 10.5 foot.
3.0,I am 5’2 and 115lbs so I got a small per the measurements. The top was to small and the bottoms were to big.
3.0,"The image shown makes the shirt look distressed, more vintage and softer. The actual item is your run-of-the-mill cotton T. Still cute but, I'll use it as a sleep shirt."
3.0,It’s more of a bright red when I was hoping for a darker color.
3.0,"Rings are super cute. Problem is, they break pretty easily."
3.0,It's lovely but completely see through. I am keeping it because I have a nude cami that works perfect under neath. But I do think you should let people know in the description that it is 100% sheer.
3.0,I’m Given 3 Stars Because The Material Was Cheaply Made I Bought The Burgundy Ones And On a The White Part Of Them There Were Burgundy Coloring Smudged On It and Didn’t Come Out In the Washer
3.0,"Received the dress in a timely manner...pros: nicely made, unique dress.<br />Cons: does not look good on a size 12 female with a size c-d breasts. Very nice dress for tall, thin women with small beast. unfortunately will be returning  the dress"
3.0,They are not true to size. I ordered 1/2 inch and when measure they are the same as 7/16th plugs the quality is nice but the seller needs to correct the sizing
3.0,My package was crumpled so the side pieces stick out instead of in my face. I put it in between some books so hopefully that helps.
3.0,Loved the necklace. Looks beautiful with the charms that were purchased as well.<br />Just could not wear this chain type...kept sticking & pulling hairs out from the nape of my neck.
3.0,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my teenager nephew. In general the watch has all the necessary functions for a digital watch like stopper, alarm clock, date and AM/PM/24 Hours format. The responsiveness of the buttons is not that good as it feels that you have to apply some pressure on some of the buttons to use its functionality. The design of the watch is fair enough as a Men's watch beside the fact that the watch's size is small - much smaller than is seen in the picture which is the thing I liked less about this watch is it which makes it more suitable for junior high students rather than adults. The strap has enough holes in it to fit most of the hand circumference and in general the watch feels good on your hand. The light of the watch is pretty decent blue/greenish light as it is not too bright nor to obscure. Overall this is a simple digital watch suitable for kids and I would rate it as a 3 stars due to the above reasons.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received the product from the seller at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of this product. I do believe that giving the most honest and reliable review may help other customers like me meet their expectations apriori and helps sellers improve their designs to meet the needs of their customers."
3.0,"BASIC TEE SHIRT, DOES WHAT I EXPECT"
3.0,"I read the reviews and size chart and ordered my appropriate size based on the chart (8-10 size L, to fit in the bust). If the suit had some boning built into the black detailing, it would help very much. The thin shoulder straps just aren't enough for me and the cups sagged/folded over on itself. I really wanted to like it but it just doesn't work for a larger chest with a short body."
3.0,Sized on the small size.  Hard to put on because of the sizing.
3.0,"Nice looking and fitting, wrinkled really badly as linen does..."
3.0,"Weird shaping in the chest-there’s a band that cuts across your right boob, giving a weird effect. Cute otherwise."
3.0,Use a whetstone to get a sharper edge. Good grip !
3.0,"Is a beautiful dress, but the bust part is too small for an X-large size. One of the holes where the strings are attached to, came out the same day I got it, it was not well sowed."
3.0,Love these but they are a tad expensive... should be less than $5...
3.0,"I bought 2 pair of these Christmas socks. One came attached together with tags and the other wine color snowflakes socks were loose in a zip lock baggie that someone had hand written Fashion on the baggie with no tags. If you are buying these for gift giving, let them know it's a gift . I'm not sure if the snowflake socks were returns or not. I won't give those as a gift. :-( Other than that they are pretty cute with gripper dots on the bottom."
3.0,Love the fit and style of these shoes. My only complaint is that when the painted leather is scuffed it is almost a white/light grey underneath. So they looked banged up VERY QUICK. We have resorted to a black sharpie pen to camouflage it a bit. However it would have been better if the leather had a darker dye underneath.
3.0,"Great size, some of the edging on the seams aren't as good as I would like but a really nice looking purse. I have not used it yet because of the smell. My husband says he doesn't mind the smell but I do so it has been airing out for almost a week now. I put dryer sheets inside and it seems to be getting better. I do hope to be able to use it soon."
3.0,Not at all what I expected material is very thick and scratchy with no stretch.
3.0,The arms are very tight and the back and bust area are much smaller than the measurements say.
3.0,Pretty thin and they're cut about one size bigger than normal Nike gear (and I have a lot of it).
3.0,"...there may actually be too many pockets!<br /><br />But that’s not why I’m only giving this bag three stars. I’ve taken two stars off because:<br />1) The pictures of the models wearing the bag are extremely misleading. They must be teeny tiny girls to make the bag seem so much bigger than it actually is; and,<br />2) In the photos, the bag shown in purple appears much brighter and more vibrant than it is in reality. The purple bag I received is MUCH darker. So much that with all my living room lights on (white incandescent, not fluorescent), it looks more like charcoal or weathered black than purple.<br /><br />If the seller had been more honest about the size and color, this bag would have gotten 5 stars and I would have definitely made another purchase. (Because - I’m totally serious about the pockets, people. There are actually too many pockets to count. I literally just tried counting them and discovered two more pockets I didn’t even know were there!!)"
3.0,"I like the material. I just don’t like the band on the bottom. It might look better if I were less hippy or were taller. It can’t be tucked in and sits oddly, in my opinion."
3.0,Didnt really like how high the waist sat.
3.0,A little smaller than I expected but light weight and cute.
3.0,The pants aren’t bad they look better on then on the hanger but the material is very weird
3.0,I loved these when I first got them. The heel wears down fast.
3.0,They are very pretty but also a bit bulky & heavy. I have to keep turning it because it falls down due to the heaviness
3.0,"im a true size 6 in every brand and never have issues with shoes. but these boots are tight, both in the foot and the top. i know my calves are a little on the thick side but this boot is super narrow, smaller than usual. both the boot detail and the platform look cheap, too. disappointing"
3.0,"Purchased the black boots, and they aren't bad overall -- but every time we wear them we lose another button. So she's worn them three times, and we've lost three buttons. The buttons are only sewn on to the outer layer of the boot, which is a little cheap, and the material tears where the buttons are, which causes them to come loose. Complete design fail."
3.0,"Not for man hands, or any kind of yard work that might generate callus. The material is thin, looks like the nice leather gloves, best for indoor repotting."
3.0,I actually loved this one piece. Not sure about the sizing however the large didn’t fit so I ended up gifting it.
3.0,Didn't like the swish color and the fabric was thin.
3.0,They are very very small.I like a larger earring but I like it for the summer because of the white bow.
3.0,"its fabric and thin black chain with beads. Very low quality but expected for this price, looks cute was a little loose on me to fit like a choker. Cheap so it's very fragile."
3.0,"Soft fabric and these pjs seemed well-made.  But, the shorts were super short.  I returned this item."
3.0,"good buy. fabric not expected though, thin in quality"
3.0,Seemed nice and fit ok . I just didn't like the length of the cost . Returned and bought a shorter coat .
3.0,"Very cute, love them but put them in my purse for the day without case and they’re completely scratched up. Not great quality. The damage should not be this bad in such a short amount of time!"
3.0,Poor material- had strings and won’t probably end up wearing but too much hassle to return
3.0,"I got this for my daughter and she loved it.  It fit her perfect but on the first day of her wearing it at the lake, the shoe came off and we lost a shoe.<br />Just be aware that it comes off really easily."
3.0,After the second time I wore the bracelet the strap broke.  Still gave it three stars because it is beautiful and I can still wear it but if it breaks anymore I wont be able to.
3.0,"Not a bad looking slipper for a great price, but even with ordering a size larger: they don't fit."
3.0,Looks nice and is easy to use.  The one year warranty listed in the description doesn't mean anything though.  When I contacted the seller a few months after receiving the band to tell them the chains broke and I needed a replacement their response was to deal with Amazon.  Not my problem.
3.0,"My boyfriend got this for me, and I love the pendant. However, upon trying to take it off, the chain itself broke. Poor quality chain, but cute pendant."
3.0,"I've had several of these hats over the years, never an issue.<br />I was surprised to find it for $20. Now I see why.<br />The material is a lot thinner than my older ones. It still looks good, feel lighter.<br />Let's see how it holds up. My old Phillies hats {3} were purchased in the 00's<br />I keep them for a while"
3.0,"The ring is so cute, I did not return it. However, it doesn’t hold the bright shine you would expect from a ring only a couple weeks old. The tarnishing rate of the ring caused me to give it 3 stars."
3.0,Runs large and pretty unflattering. I’m 5’7 and ordered a small yet it still looked like my grandmas muumuu.
3.0,I thought it would have more padding and a little more lift. The material is very nice and comfortable. It also came with straps so you can wear it with or without. It runs true to size and maybe a little on the smaller side but this happens with strapless bras they cant stay up if they arent tight enough to stay on your body. It was shipped very quickly and in a nice package so there was no damage. Not sure I like buying bras online but this was somewhat as expected. I received this product at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review.
3.0,The white is too sheer for me. Returned
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it was a bit snug and the fabric was very thin.  The gathering made for weird loose fabric in some areas while other areas were definitely to tight."
3.0,the watch is heavy and too big have to take it and have the band made smaller there were no instructions on how to make bracelet smaller
3.0,"The top part is ok but the bottom part below the chest is quite small and clingy. I am five ft 1 and weigh 114 and the Small was too small for me. Yet, I wear small in most other clothes. Get a bigger size if you really want this."
3.0,"Overall cute and I like them but they arrived dirty and with one side of the frame cracked by the nose, and the other side chipped."
3.0,"These shorts don't flare at the top like they do in the picture. The length was good, but I didn't particularly enjoy the material. It also had a really weird smell. I found another pair of shorts that are much better. Not horrible, but I wouldn't settle for these since you can find better elsewhere."
3.0,"Cute, wish it were longer."
3.0,I would recommend sizing up on this sweater.  Mine arrived with some small holes in the sweater (which I didn't realize until I washed it so I am not going to return it).  I was hoping this was going to be a nice light summer sweater.
3.0,It doesn’t have a second layer to prevent the sequin from scratching the skin. It itches and it was too big. Didn’t flow well.
3.0,"The color came as expected but the size was on the smaller size, doesn’t fill up large/deep pockets"
3.0,You don’t have a larger size.
3.0,"The goggles are Awesome! 5 stars for them!<br />Has a nice case, suctions great, and had ear things attached.<br />The swim cap though was useless though! 0 stars for that!  My whole head was wet when I go out of the pool."
3.0,I’ll have to have them altered to wear them. Very wide in the lower legs.
3.0,"This shirt has a unisex fit, I was expecting more of a women's fit.  The wording is also crooked.  I got this as a gift and I'm not 100% sure if I'll give it or return it because of the fit and crooked wording.  The shirt itself is a soft and seems like a good quality."
3.0,"They got here a little early which was a nice surprise but I didn't get the red one which was the whole reason I ordered these in the first place. The bars were also WAYYY too long, I had to use an old barbel. For the price they're alright, you get what you pay for but I really wouldn't recommend ordering these if you want to use more than the tops."
3.0,"This was not what I expected-and I am not sure why. The colors are vibrant. The wrist bracelet feels ok (could not wear 24/7) the necklace is beautiful but just a tad too long and the ankle bracelet was lacking in stones. The advertisement is correct, but after I opened it I wasn't overly excited like I was when I purchased it. I think this is that jewlery that you put away and wear with a specific outfit as opposed to everyday wear."
3.0,The slide to raise or lower the horn level can be quite loose and may or may not stay put. Generally it starts out fine but only a few moments later I have to readjust.
3.0,"Arrived as ordered- would have been nice closer to size, recommend you buy at least two sizes larger as material is not flexible or stretchy."
3.0,Looked beautiful when received bracelet but clasp is broken.  It is a gift from my son to my sister.
3.0,"Ran large, I could’ve went down one size however I returned these pants."
3.0,"On the plus side, my toes sweat a lot (sorry.. too much information?). These socks keep them quite dry. They're also nice looking.<br /><br />On the minus side, while comfortable without shoes they bunch up at the toes with shoes, & I would prefer them to be slightly larger for my size 11 feet.<br /><br />On the very negative side, I can't imagine paying $15 for 1 pair of socks. Maybe for 5 pair, but not for 1."
3.0,"Was not as long as I expected,  hardly covers to my waist"
3.0,Used the size help feature and ordered a 12(same size as my old slippers).  They are stretching but wish I had ordered a 13.
3.0,I dislike that it continuously slides down. Uncomfortable when walking.
3.0,"Just received these New Joy-Cons straps, I thought I was purchasing the Original Nintendo Joy-Cons straps like it says in the description but there not, still works but not the original. Beware!"
3.0,"I ordered a pack for my daughter and a pack for myself.  I wear a size 8 to 9 and she wears a 10 and these ran a little small. No matter what shoe we wear, they slide down the back of our heels.  They are cute and thin for summer but the size doesn't quite cut it."
3.0,"I had a Wamsutta bath wrap previously which just plain wore out - but it was soft and very absorbent - this, even after washing, is too stiff and does not absorb well - it was not expensive so I will keep it but try to find the Wamsutta one again."
3.0,"They work fine, but probably would be better if the straps were a bit wider. Polka dots aren't particularly prominent. Does not make you look like a clown.."
3.0,Great style and lightweight. The fit doesn't allow much arm swing movement.
3.0,It really looks good not as big as I thought it would be quite small. But I still enjoyed it and looks really nice.
3.0,"I had to return them They were too short for me. I am 5'7"" and they were well above my ankle.  Not a negative at all but they were much thicker than I realized."
3.0,It is too long for a short person
3.0,"I am not as thrilled with anklet. In the pictire it looks much nicer then when it came. Delivery was quick, but the item is not all that I expected. Last one I had (was the same from another seller) was just like this one in photo"
3.0,"Wasn’t what I was expecting, it’s more like a skirt with shorts underneath. I thought it would be more of a baggy shorts style"
3.0,It's a very nice top. A bit thin but still looks good
3.0,Charm is cute but the chain is not 18 inches
3.0,"I really wanted to like this, but the cut is a little bit too wide for me in both the medium and large sizes. I  have a really long torso, so I like sweaters that are a little longer. I'm 5'6"" , 125lbs"
3.0,"These are sturdy well made, but I can’t  Focus looking through them, I don’t know it’s the fault of the classes or my sight but truly not worth the cost for me. You May have better results than I"
3.0,Nice skirt but I would have rather not had a zipper.
3.0,"I thought the material was nice, however, it was definitely too short in the torso area. Buyer beware - if you have an average or longer torso, do not purchase this product. It will not fit and will not leave anything to the imagination."
3.0,The shirt is very full and a bit short for a 5' 7&#34; person.
3.0,"The pockets are very thin, my keys punched a hole in them"
3.0,Loved the look and size of the necklace.  I have bought two the first chain broke so I replaced it because I loved the necklace.  Then the second chain broke as well so would not but again.  Shame the necklace is very cute!
3.0,Good looking shirt only problem runs very small compared to other things in the same size
3.0,ita okay
3.0,Different fabric than expected. Not as nice.
3.0,"For reference my measurements are 39"" 30"" 46"". Too big and not as long in the back as shown on the model even though I can almost guarantee she's taller than me."
3.0,Awesome looking belt! Really cool. Love it except the ratchet wore out after 5-6 months.
3.0,doesn't stay together well.
3.0,The colors are nice and bright but the material had a strong odor and was very itchy. The sizes of the top and bottom seemed to be two different fits. The top was big and baggy and the bottoms to tight.
3.0,Didn't match the pic
3.0,"This is a personal reference/Opinion, it in no way effects the value of the actual shirt. It was so flattering, but it was not long enough for my personal preference. I returned one, got another size, and it still was not fitting me the way I liked, so unfortunately I had to return :("
3.0,"This dress is pretty well made, fabric is good quality, not flimsy, but I don't like the style!<br />Actually in picture looks a lot better than in person, probably because it runs very big."
3.0,"I was disappointed there was only an image on one side.  When you compare it to existing charms, it kind of seems out of place.  Still nice to have to showcase your fandom, but it could have been so much better."
3.0,-really good quality<br />-did not come with the glasses(kind of bummed)<br />-only had 11 trays
3.0,"This bracelet is so cute! But, I returned it because it was too small - not the sizing around my wrist, but the width of the bracelet.... even after wrapping it around, the actual thing looked smaller than what's pictured. This isn't my usual style, so since it didn't meet my intended expectations, I returned it. If you want something flashy on the thinner side, this is a great choice."
3.0,I used for a concert and at the end after 5  hours it was okay just the adhesive start peeling. I wasn’t impressed with this product Im a cup A
3.0,"A cheep  construct,  you get what you pay for"
3.0,These were almost perfect. They do not stay on the thighs and roll down which caused pain in my legs. Got them to have after surgery.
3.0,😏 but still love it
3.0,Ordered my regular shoe size in 6 1/2 but was too large.
3.0,Doesn't fit my wife's foot quite right. Otherwise they're nice.
3.0,Looks weird. Too long. NO POCKETS!
3.0,"I would have given this five stars after trying it on. It fit perfectly and is really flattering. I'm 5' 6&#34; 140 lbs with a size D and ordered a 12.  However, when I played with my kids in the pool I could keep the underwire in the right place. It kept riding up very awkwardly. I'll still wear it as a laying out suit though."
3.0,"While the design of the hat is fine, the color and size I received were not as specified.  I have a 24&#34; head, and I can barely put it on.  I measured the actual inside cap, and it's also 24&#34;, not 25&#34; as listed.  My order was for white, but what I received was ivory, not a true white.<br /><br />If you don't care if it's smaller than specified or that &#34;white&#34; isn't really white, then it's a fine hat.  If you want what they advertised, it's not correct."
3.0,It's a very cute set. But the elastic on the skirt was too tight for my lil one and I had to alter it. And still it doesn't stay properly. Not happy with the sizing. But it's a cute set...
3.0,Cute but runs small... Had to return.
3.0,Very lightweight but a little too big for my taste
3.0,Good soft material but it shrank on the first wash. I recommend to order a size bigger in anticipation of it shrinking
3.0,"My daughter LOVES Spider-Man so the outfit was a total hit for her. The quality of the material is pretty good in comparison to most kid’s costumes you buy these days, but the feet and shoulders are kind of Mis-stitched with rough edges of fabric showing on the outside rather than stitched to the inside."
3.0,"Bought an XL for my boyfriend, it fit more like an L. Returned."
3.0,The colors (green/pink) are really nice. But the band continually loosens which is aggravating.  I see there are many complaints about this.  Guess I should have read the reviews first.
3.0,Beautiful color. Not see through. My issue is that the next is very loose. It’s more of a scoop than a round. Which is a major bummer.
3.0,"This is absolutely the most realistic copy of the Hermes Double Tour band, BUT they're huge!  My wrist is 6.1"", and if I wear it on the shortest hole and loop the band above the watch on my wrist, it still slides some.<br /><br />I would literally buy these in every color they make, IF they fit.<br /><br />PLEASE make them slightly smaller!"
3.0,Shirt is shorter than expected but very comfortable. Opted for next size up. Still awaiting reimbursement for returned item ( 11 days)
3.0,Some of the stones are crooked on the top of the ring but overall I’ll give it a pass. It’s flashy enough to pass as a real versace ring from a slight distance. Overall I’ll give it a 3 just because I am a size 8 and the ring is somewhat loose on my ring finger. I can only wear it on my middle finger or else I would risk it falling off my finger.
3.0,"A little tight. Not super comfortable around waist and leg openings because fabric isn’t very soft, it’s ever so slightly rough cotton."
3.0,Was okay lost lustre quickly
3.0,it looks cheap and when wearing not comfortable. I am not using this after all. I should have put the money to buy new swatch watch. but I guess if you really like your current watch and just want a new band..you can get by with this.
3.0,Nice material pretty color. And soft.
3.0,"They run too tight  and were way to long in the foot and leg for me. Probably good for a tall,  thin legged man. But for short, heavy legged women, not a good fit."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:5270274a75dda442a3bd972d4bbc6e74]]
3.0,"They didn’t send the patterned one I ordered, instead a shiny purple one. My daughter still likes it and it fits well. On the thick side, seems like it would be hot."
3.0,Really nice hat. Runs super small. Will never fit a man. More for a young boy. Not even a teen
3.0,The shoe is wide and stiff. Does not feel comfy.
3.0,"I ordered a size up I usually wear a medium I order a large should have orderd even bigger, so order 2 sizes up the white and black material is really thin, the mixed gray and black is made out of different material and its thicker"
3.0,I got these for my daughter thinking they would be perfect for her to join me in resin crafts. However these still run big regardless of the age range they say. These are more like XS Adult.
3.0,A true Henley is cotton. This is not. My fault for not reading small print. Return was easy.
3.0,I ordered a small.  This dress is huge.
3.0,"Great packaging and overall quality is pretty. It is not adjustable though, and the length/width was too big for a choker type fit. It hung awkwardly around the bottom of my neck/chest. With no option to adjust, there was no way to wear this properly. It would be soo cute if it had the real choker fit, which this style is DEFINITELY meant to worn."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in black and the hunter green. The black looks very funeral. I loved the green color but my goodness.... people say this is flattering? I am a size 10/12 in jeans. 5'6 and 170 pounds with very wide hips, a short torso and long legs. I ordered a size large and this dress is tight and SHORT!!! I won't be able to wear this without thick black tights or leggings. Even with Spanx on, the bulges show, and when I bend slightly, not even completely over, EVERYTHING shows. Not a good fit at all. I may size up to an XL  and see if it works because I need something for a New Years Eve party and this style was cute with black ankle boots.  But as it stands now in the L, I am not a fan."
3.0,"The quality of each piece is nice however, they fall off very easily. I lost several of them within the first week."
3.0,Though the outfit is absolutely cute it fits more like something I would wear to the gym versus out on the town. The shorts fit more like boy short underwear then shorts to be worn in public. Also company contact is pointless
3.0,"I use an RFID card to access my apartment at home. The Ogon 3C doesn't block the card's signal. I love the weight (or lack of it) and low profile look. However, sorry but if it doesn't block out the radio frequencies, then I can't give any higher than 3 stars. Actually, I give a 3 star because I still do use it despite the pitfall. To be fair, it seems it does protect the chips of my credit cards. It could be that the chip installed in my home RFID is larger and extends into the unprotected are of the card clip."
3.0,No different from the regular ones to get on but of course they work great.
3.0,I bought 3 different pairs of shoes from voberry and this is the only pair I wasn't very happy with. Either one of the shoes is made wrong or they sent me two left shoes but they were so inexpensive it was worth the gamble and they are very cute had they been made properly
3.0,"The material is nice and warm as described.<br />I took the advice to buy a size up. I ware a women's 10 so I bought the extra large which is said to be an 11/12. The length of the sole was a nice fit, but the top of the shoe seems to be too long and it cuts into my ankle. I ware a normal shoe off the shelf, not narrow and not wide, and my toes are a little cramped in these shoes. The upper of the shoe is a little tight as well, the two seams across the top have no give at all.<br />IF YOU HAVE ANY SWELLNG AT ALL THS MAY NOT BE THE SHOE FOR YOU.<br />The sole does not have a good grip. In fact if you have polished wood or tile floors you might be a little nervous warring these shoes. They are not very thick either. I have some small gravel in my driveway and  can feel every rock when  walking to the mail box.<br />The foot bed has no arch support at all. The 3 layers of foam they describe, well it flattens out after one ware.<br />I am not going to return them, but I defiantly will not recommend or purchase again."
3.0,Se despegó la bolita
3.0,These are not easy for my grandkids to keep on
3.0,"Very cute! Sleeves were not soft or stretchy,more of a stiff material than a t-shirt material. The women's 2x fitore like a small XL."
3.0,I have used this for a few weeks now during my workouts. Gives nice support when I lift weights and provides a nice sauna for my midsection when I'm on the treadmill but I feel I haven't had any significant changes so far in regards to fat loss. I will give this product more time.
3.0,It is pretty but too tight for flow. I ordered a large and got a small/medium.
3.0,Ok so the plugs were absolutely gorgeous but only qualm is that the don’t seem to be 2g 😭
3.0,Cute dress. I got the white one to wear as an evening wedding dress. Loved itbut you can definitely see through it and it runs very small. I normally wear between a large and xlarge and I had to get the xxl.
3.0,"Very cute but the material of the top is not stretchy and feels really cheap. The skirt however, fits perfectly!"
3.0,"I bought the yellow and green flowers for my daughter. The pattern was beautiful.  However, we ordered a medium as her measurements suggested.  But it was way too small. My daughter takes a  small or medium in a similar anne klein side wrap blouse  So we were so surprised with how tightly this blouse fit on her.  She gave it to a friend who wears an extra small and it did fit her."
3.0,This is perfect! I got this for my daughter and I thought it would be a little big but it fit perfectly! It is also so comfy. I wish I had one of my own lol.
3.0,"The metal link band was nice, but the mesh band was a disappointment. Very flimsy and cheap looking."
3.0,They didn’t fit right. He tried wearing these a few times but we just finally gave them away.  Not really the best quality. I think they were mainly just for looks.
3.0,Love the color! The purple is rich and dark. Appears to be well made but I would have liked to see more reinforcement around the back of the neck though. And is definitely NOT cashmere.
3.0,Not stretchy as advertised.
3.0,"Material is incredibly soft, I absolutely love it. The only problem is in the bust area. I ordered a 2x, i normally wear about a 40 D bra. MUCH too small, barely covers the front of the bust. Looks so ridiculous in the bust area that I will never wear it. Fits perfectly everywhere else. Has some stretch to it. Lovely color and material, if you are a smaller person this would work for you."
3.0,"look really cheap and break easily, I was already throwing them away a week after purchased."
3.0,"Necklace looks great on, but started to &#34;unlink&#34; after two wears."
3.0,The material is nylon but the top is okay
3.0,Looks cheaper in person and came with three of the stones/beads fallen off.
3.0,Not what I was expecting for $38.00. Night Driving Glasses. Head Light glare is the same as if you were not wearing them. very disappointed.
3.0,It was smaller than I expected. the picture was kind of smeared but it was for my 9 year old so she wasn't too much worried about it
3.0,"They look great, but feel kinda cheap. The polarization makes weird rainbows when you wear them."
3.0,white one was see through
3.0,"I love these leggings, I really do. But right after I cut off the tag (of course) I noticed that no matter how I wear these, I can have a pretty apparent camel toe if I am not careful.<br />The material and fit of these are so nice, so I may wear them around the house or somehow shimmy them to not do that, but just beware of that problem when purchasing.<br />Otherwise, these are stellar!"
3.0,"Cheap quality, but mine are holding up pretty well!!!"
3.0,I really like this style vest; its pretty cool. Taking the advice of other reviews I ordered a XXL as I'm a medium guy. The vest its self fits perfect but the collar was to big and I needed to hem it down to fit my neck. The quality of the stitching is very poorly done all the pockets are false and that's a little disappointing. I suppose that's why it's kinda cheap. I recommend this vest for anybody going for something different. I will make some altercations to this vest like replacing the buttons and having some of the stitching redone but it's unique and im glad to have it...
3.0,Size is inconsistent with other similar items.
3.0,"Very cheaply made, very thin and the letters look like they can fall off very easily"
3.0,This top is super cute but it runs a bit small. I ordered a large based on the size chart but I should’ve ordered a XL. Nevertheless it did remain dry during my half marathon.
3.0,Cute design. Extremely thin loosely woven fabric.
3.0,"worked for the purpose- Halloween costume. however, looked cheap if you are<br /> wanting to wear it out on the town"
3.0,Sizing is off.  I am 6'0&#34; 180# and it is about the correct length in large but way too big around.  Also I use it on a racing bike and when I am bent over the reflective strips are placed too high on the back for the cars behind to see.
3.0,I would give it 4 or 5 stars except the specs indicate band width 26 millimeters. I ordered a 26mm Solid Stainless Steel Band but does not fit. You might get a 22 mm to fit.
3.0,"The flexibility fades over time. I use them at work (I'm a live sound engineer), and I've snapped the bridge in half on three frames, and the paint has peeled off."
3.0,Nice sweater and fits nicely but the color is not what I expected. The pictures clearly show an emerald green color but the actual color is a greyish light green.
3.0,"Pretty design, fit is a little large, fabric is very thin and see thru. When breathing heavily, the fabric doesn't get inhaled, which is better than another I have."
3.0,"I got this in size 18-24 months. It was TINY. I was going to return it, but I gave it to a local charity instead."
3.0,They fit great the material was good but the light colored ones came either dirty or stained with what looks like a print of perhaps another shirt. Having to return to replace was a hassle I could’ve lived with out.
3.0,The shirt is not the top quality of the expensive Nike polos but for the price it feels good. The color of the varsity purple in the advertisement does not match the actual shirt. I was disappointed in the color.
3.0,It was a lot bigger then it looked in the pictures. I'm very small build and needed something small.
3.0,Way small! Order 2 sizes up!
3.0,I am so disappointed that it’s too small. But love the style color and feel
3.0,"My son currently has a size 5 running shoe in Sketchers and a size 6 hiking shoe (a little loose, but comfortable) in Merrell. I thought the 6.5 would be a little big on him and give him room to grow. Unfortunately, it's too tight! He says it seems like a well constructed shoe that would be comfortable if it was bigger. Order at least one full size up from the biggest shoe your child currently wears."
3.0,"I do not like it, I plan to give it away"
3.0,The design is nice but the coin purse itself is too large and clunky looking. Looked cheap to me.
3.0,I was expecring cotton or a better quality fabric. But ita more like polyester.
3.0,Looks prettier than it fits.  This dress is a simple mumu.
3.0,"Fits good, but is really see through"
3.0,"It's  more like a fish gown and even XXL (I am an L) nothing gapped from the skin except sleeves. Anyways,  the price is relevant to the item and can remodel it,  is an option!"
3.0,Everything was great until i washed the red shirt and it fadded as the drawing got washed away. the  blue and grey shirt are very good material and did not fade or washed away the drawing.
3.0,"These are in no way, shape or form “sweatpants.”<br />They are more so pajama pants. No lining inside, very thin."
3.0,Sent wrong style. Kept anyway. Still like original ones best.
3.0,"I typically wear a medium; sometimes a large. After reading the reviews, I ordered XL, but it's still too snug. I've worn it, but I'm not crazy about the fit. The style and quality are fine."
3.0,some weren't working when I opened the package.  Kids liked them on the 4th of July.
3.0,"Craftsmanship - 7/10<br />The actual tie is darker than in the photo, not as vibrant. Fabric is more coarse than the photo as well."
3.0,"The picture looks like the graphics on the shirt are sewn, but they are printed instead. Not as great but good enough for the price i suppose"
3.0,The zipper always has to be closed tight or you lose change.
3.0,The light is only on half of the watch.  It also is used to adjust the settings and can easily get the settings altered from pressing buttons.  Loud alarm though and water resistant.
3.0,I love that it is somewhat concealing around the waist area. I give it 3 stars because it hurts my neck trying to hold my top half up. I don't recommend this suit if you are heavy in the top.
3.0,"When I say &#34;paper thin&#34; fabric I'm being serious.. no mater what you wear under this shirt (a simple Tee-shirt)  it will standout. That said, the color is as expected, the tie is actually the best part of the combo. If you want a ultra light dress shirt this is the one.  As for Cufflinks, I think that description is somewhat laughable.. it s small piece of plastic at best."
3.0,It&#34;s ok.
3.0,You get what you pay for - items arrived as promised but are much tackier in reality.
3.0,Went ahead and wore it but it was just above my ankles in length (I'm about 5'6). Hood was too small as well
3.0,This ear crawler does not really want to stay on my ear. I had to take the cuff part and bend and flatten it in a custom way and then I have to maneuver so that it kind of pinches my ear lobe every time I try to wear it but I really do love the look of it once it is on.
3.0,"Not using until June for vacation, but seem to fit as needed."
3.0,Very fitted. I like dresses loose. Thank
3.0,Love them but break easy
3.0,"I  ordered some time back for use at the gym and posted ""Works great for showing at the gym. Dries fast."" they fit correctly. I ordered a 2nd pair for home use and it was smaller and had many ruff edges. I sanded down the edges with a rotary tool to solve that, but they are still a little too tight. I dropped my rating to 3 starts."
3.0,I bought a 2x tshirt and it fit like a medium. I gave it away.
3.0,The male one is perfect. The girl one the eye holes are weird.
3.0,Gave to my daughter for birthday. She says it fits great but the sides that have some type of stretchy material is scratchy.
3.0,The band is nice enough but it needs more holes. I have it tightened all the way and it’s still loose. I have a normal sized wrist but I’ll have to make more holes<br /><br />Update.  The band has already broken.
3.0,"Loved the design and seemed to be of good quality, However, I don't recall the size I ordered but it was too large. Be careful with the sizing chart."
3.0,"the quality of the hat is great, however it does run significantly smaller than averag"
3.0,Left sandal  Is too small.
3.0,Fits kids not teens.
3.0,"This shirt runs at least two sizes too small.  I am typically a Medium but ordered a Large just in case it ran small, but I should have ordered XL because its very fitted. If you do not have a large bust, you may be able to size up one size, however its still going to fit a little snug.  Aside from this issue with sizing, the material is soft & stretchy and looks to be of good quality.  Definitely not see-thru at all.  The sleeves are ruched & not really puffy, but I'm okay with that."
3.0,The fit is small.
3.0,Quality is good. Color less vibrant than pictured
3.0,"Compact but no room for your bills.  However, it holds lots of credit cards."
3.0,"The fabric of this shirt is thin, and the kind of cotton that fades and pills easily. I has a boxy, somewhat shapeless fit. I wouldn't buy another"
3.0,It is very heavy and adds a lot of weight to your look.
3.0,"Great looking, BUT  THE TEMPLE SCREWS LOOSEN VERY EASILY. Don't wear them much and screws fell out twice in less then a year??? Ray Ban store could not find a screw to fit!!!"
3.0,"By the end of 2hr at church, a lot of glitter fell off of these shoes.  They’re super cute tho!"
3.0,"just received this today and the sweater material feels nice and it's what i was expecting. the only thing is i had ordered up on it bc i wanted it to be really baggy and comfy on me, well looks more like a large and not an XXL, but that's my only complaint"
3.0,it was a gift very good for the price...it started turning after couple months...but what do i expect
3.0,I ordered an extra large and it was still tight and short. I love the tank itself. It's good quality.
3.0,Not very happy. This is a tapered fit. You may have to go 2 sizes larger. A short sleeve shirt will actually get pushed up when you put the jacket on. Very cute jacket though.
3.0,I HATE THE MATERIAL. IT'S SCRATCHY AN NOT MADE WELL.
3.0,"Nice cardigan I Received a lot of compliments but even after washing and drying this sweater twice it sheds, I wore a black shirt under it and I couldn’t even take the sweater off because it was so much fur/material all over my black shirt, and car seat."
3.0,Nice design and fabric. It's XL it's abit big for my dress size 8 and DDD bust. Suggest get L. It's depends on the company made.
3.0,"The canopy is impressive, fabric will last but the frame is badly designed.  My husband said it wouldn't last and he was right.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and the price was low so I said if it lasts one season we would get a new one next year.  Well, it didn't make it through the summer. Couldn't stand up to even the slightest wind.  And no, this wasn't from a big blow.  Seller made it good with a full refund. They get three stars for customer service even though I was supposed to get a free canopy and never did."
3.0,Nice but ran smaller
3.0,"The necklace is gorgeous when you first receive it . It has a silver furnishing and its heavy. The look is gorgeous , but after about 2 weeks it started turning colors .. I would say get this if you planned on wearing a few times , and not looking into something major ."
3.0,"The thong part is too tight and digs into the skin.  I like the cotton but its too thick and takes up too much space, making the shoe feel tighter."
3.0,"Don’t buy these for a septum unless you have a big face. Hangs very low, too wide"
3.0,"The skirt part is perfect. It’s the top that doesn’t make sense. You’d have to be VERY broad shouldered to look good in this. I hide that floppy mess with a short sleeve summer sweater. Otherwise, the fabric is great."
3.0,"So i read the reviews before purchasing and it said to buy a small, glad that i did because it was way too big even for a small. i am165lbs and 5'5 tall. Will definitely have to have it tailored. But it is suler cute once it fits."
3.0,this dress was the first thing I've ordered that was not true to size and I was so disappointed.  I gave the dress to my niece who wears a large and it fit her.
3.0,Too big for third graders!! Shows little kids in the pictures but not for little kids! Pretty and fun patterns but I have to “fix” them by re stitching and making them smaller cuz it’s a pain in the rear to bother sending them back. Don’t get them for little kids!! No one under 12 unless they are on the bigger size for their age
3.0,"I liked the fit of the shirt, the only problem is the material feels like a nylon and maybe some cotton but not 98% that is on the tag.  Itbdoes not feel soft like cotton."
3.0,"No reviews yet , This is a gift for someone.  Not giving any stars until Gift is has been opened tried"
3.0,It is very weird straps and didn't fit as expected
3.0,With the recent Dale Chihuly exhibit at the VMFA my mother-in-law has been in search of blown glass earrings in purple.  I saw these and hoped they would fit the bill for her xmas present.  They are of good quality but I didn't care for the Orchid design inside the glass as much but I hope she will like them.  I would have liked a gift box as well as the gift bag since it is a gift.  The other earrings I purchased from Amazon all had gift bags and boxes.  I do like that they are purple and sterling silver hooks.
3.0,Lacks outside pickets for keys and phone. Wish I had realized that before I bought it. Zipper is good. Nice size
3.0,This is a cute shirt but don’t wear expect a sweatshirt because it is not. There’s nothing to it and is quite thin.
3.0,These socks are so pretty but the material is super thin and not much comfort when wearing shoes.
3.0,"This is a very comfortable shirt and the sleeves weren’t tight or constricting in the slightest. However, I’m a medium in t-shirt size and because of the size chart, I ordered an extra large. The extra large was very very tight and I’m very glad I get to wear an apron and tuck my pants in because WOW I looked like a cased sausage!"
3.0,"Great hat, but the picture showed the old Sharks logo, and the hat we recieved has the new logo. We were very disappointed."
3.0,Small but ok
3.0,Disappointing on how they fit. Smaller then what was listed
3.0,When folded it doesn't show what should be shown
3.0,"good for moms.  i found myself not being able to wear my leather watch or watches with metal buckles because they tend to dig into my baby's neck when i cradle them. also, when changing poopy diapers and bath times, it's just easy to wear a watch wtih durability. that said, this watch fits the bill, however i find myself reseting it probably every 2 wks.  just read a review about similar watch from breo and that seems to have the same problem. maybe it's a rubber watch thing. overall, i like it b/c i can wear it all day and not worry about it getting wet or hurting my baby."
3.0,"Very pretty dress, runs a bit large around the chest and waist area."
3.0,But now it feels like it stretches out a little on me.
3.0,One of the zippers already broke off and I can't use that one anymore. The zippers sometimes pop open if you don't correctly zip them and they are a pain in the butt to fix
3.0,not a bad set but it is not sort into gauges so there is alot of guess work to be had unless you have a gauger.
3.0,There bigger than they really are watch the size
3.0,"I like the socks, but when they arrived they were all damp and smelled like mildew. I am going to wash them and hopefully get the smell out of them. The other products in the box were fine so the socks had to have been packaged in their plastic damp."
3.0,"Very pretty, but started coming apart on me. Had to return"
3.0,Quality was nice... I just need to weight 10-15 less pounds to fit into it!
3.0,I love the print and comfortable fit/fabric.  I don’t like that it pills up after a washing and fades a lot.
3.0,This is not a tank top. It is a sleeveless shirt. If it was an actual tank top it would be perfect.
3.0,"A little expensive, but they are nice"
3.0,Order two sizes bigger.  I'm a medium and ordered the large.  Still too small.
3.0,"I'm not sure if whoever did the packing or the writing of the ad for these pants was on holiday, or just drunk, but almost nothing about them touted in the copy was true in the delivery. They're not cotton, they are see-thru, and they're straight up and down with zero control anywhere.<br /><br />If that's what you're looking for, you'll be thrilled. Otherwise, they're perfectly fine for painting or lawn care gear. I mean, after all, you do have to wear something when you're doing physical labor (and you don't care what you look like!)"
3.0,Maybe because I'm short and more dramatically shaped? But the laces didn't start as high as I would up my thighs and the bottom was loose around my ankles. Paired with boots it's not an issue. And with an oversized top less so. Overall cute leggings but be aware they might not look exactly like on the model. Still cute though! But be aware the laces are REALLY long at the ends of the leggings. Like. Really long.
3.0,"These are super cute but the heel is much taller than I expected. I don't normally go for super tall heels/wedges but I loved the style. I am normally a 7 or an 8, so I went with a 7.5. These do run slightly smaller but they will still work. I like that they have an adjustable strap in the back. I haven't been able to wear them out yet but I tried them in and walked around the house and they seem to be reasonably comfortable.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,There are no white stripes like the photo shows. I’m disappointed it’s not as pictured.
3.0,"Not a fan of the color or pattern. It is a tight fit so definitely order one size larger. Aside from that, it works very well as a nursing top. Just make sure to wash it before use, because it smells super weird."
3.0,This is a heavy dress. I was not prepared for the weight of the dress. I live in Arizona and thought it would be a nice lace everyday dress. I returned it because it was so heavy and think. The lace is a bit of a waxy feel as well. It is a very pretty dark blue color.
3.0,if u have a large band/chest circumference it doesn't fit that well
3.0,Nice cap for beach. But it does not stay on your head very well. Not sure I’d buy again
3.0,The product isn't bad they stay lit up but the only problem is you can't pick the color you want and I ended up getting pink ones and i hate the color pink but I guess they work tho.
3.0,Nice pair of glasses.
3.0,"I love the look of these slippers, and they're so soft! I wear a 9, 9 1/2 depending on the brand so I ordered a 9/10 in these, I would suggest to go a size up as they are very snug on me with this size."
3.0,You get exactly what you pay for.
3.0,Fabric is gauze-like and very thin. Top is very short. It also ran small.
3.0,Like it could be a larger size
3.0,"not a huge fan... even the 2XL was wicked tight, plus the plastic it came in melted to the shirt and because of the material it will never come off as it has fused together.... price was cheap so it wasn't a huge mistake but would not order again."
3.0,they scratch too easily and I took pretty good care of them
3.0,"It's cute but definitely cheap. It comes with 2, one broke within a week. The other lasted longer but tarnished and turned different colors - made it unwearable."
3.0,"I loved the dress and the color. Ordered it to wear on my 1yr anniversity however, it was a little too big. I wanted it to accent my curves, but they were lost in the dress. I sent it back and ordered a smaller size which was to arrive a day before my anniversity. Needless to say I received a message stating the dress whould be shipped at a later date, but do date was listed. Bummer. I cancelled the order."
3.0,"Received 2, opened first package and there was a rip in the side seam, wrinkles all over it, and the tag ripped off. Second dress is beautiful,  so far no flaws. Haven't actually worn it yet."
3.0,This is a re-order. I ordered the same size as last time. These wee to small. and I've lot weight.
3.0,Nice looking socks have not held up well after wearing a couple times. Very tight and a bit of a pain in the butt to put on compared to any other socks I own.
3.0,"This was fine for the price I paid for it, I wasn't expecting high quality, I just needed something to be able to throw on and run errands, that wasn't heavy or bulky and this fit those categories. However,  it had a lot of little threads that came loose and would get caught in the zipper.  It was also smaller than I actually needed for my wallet, sunglasses, cell and some odds/ends that I carry.  It's not a bad bag, and for the price, it's about as I expected, but knowing what I know now, I do think for the same amount of money, you probably could find a bag that is a little better quality even for the low price point."
3.0,"The socks were cute but one pair had a hole in both socks when taking them out of the package. So for that reason I will only give a 3 star rating. Fit my 9 month old ok, she has short legs and the socks come about to her knee but not over top of them."
3.0,Wash well before use.. it bleeds dye/ color while washing. It spoiled my whites.. fortunately not shirts
3.0,These bottoms would be super comfy but I am returning them as they are very small. I ordered a medium thinking I would have extra room in them as I typically fit comfortably in small sweat pants. These were tight just about everywhere but my calves when they should have fit loosely. Ordered the next size up in hopes those fit like they should.
3.0,"I appreciate the darkness of the lenses of these sunglasses for protecting my eyes from the sun. That is, after all, the most important feature of any sunglasses.<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear. However, I don't love the shape of them. They are not flattering on me. Of course, everyone is different so that's essentially a matter of taste. I also liked the leatherette case that came with them.<br /><br />The main problem I've had is with the lenses popping out of the frame. When I first took them out of the package one lens was out of the frame. Later I happened to drop them and again, the lens came out. It's relatively easy to pop it back in, but it is not what you would expect with a nice pair of sunglasses."
3.0,Had to return and reorder.
3.0,This was the right weight and sleeve length. It was still too small in the body. I did reorder in XL and there was very little difference  The color was brighter and more vivid than the picture.  I would order again
3.0,The glasses are everything you expect them to be but mine were damaged. They ship them in a bag and only put a piece of cardboard around them. Mine were bent when they arrived. I was able to bend them into shape luckily but they aren't perfect. Be careful when purchasing these.
3.0,"This top fits okay in the chest area. There is NO support holding those puppies in though. That could be problematic lol. The waste area fits nice. I'm a big girl and it didnt hug my fat. Two things I dislike: it comes with a single halter strap. Its not adjustable and pulls my head downward even with no pull from the chest area. I'm not tall. And the side tie is aesthetic, not functional. I would be leery wearing it without the halter strap. The bottoms fit great.  Comfortable without being too big or too restricting."
3.0,"The pic for this sells the vest.  The one I ordered was for a concert, and it was too large for me, so it looked more frumpy than flattering. I'd recommend sizing down."
3.0,Surprisingly they are baggy when I figured they’d be snug
3.0,I can wear it but I was hoping that it wasn't going to be so short
3.0,Great price; very cute shirt.
3.0,"It’s ok, not great and not comfortable"
3.0,They're very pretty but way to small for my nose. The jewel part went right through my nose. Owell sending them to my cousin!
3.0,I have three of these. I loved them until I received the third pair. In six months with little use they broke. The black part that connects the ear muffs to the headband fell off and now they are unusable.
3.0,The straps are sewn very strange. Love the length but I had to reposition the straps in order to keep them from falling off of my shoulders.
3.0,"The pattern and cut of this dress are great. I also loved the pockets. However, it is a spandex material and the inside is white. So, if this dress stretches at all, it looks cheap and the white can be seen through the pattern."
3.0,Nice jeans just too small.  They run very small.  I needed 2 sizes larger.
3.0,"Material is really thin. Found a hole rather quickly. Wish it had pockets. Otherwise, good enough."
3.0,The tie in the back was weird. It was only on one side which made it hard to tie. It was pretty see-through. I got it for a festival so that didn’t bother me. I can’t wear this everyday but did like it for what it was intended for.
3.0,Washed it once and then black threads started unraveling around the KC...
3.0,"The dress is gorgeous, a little bit too short and the material is extremely thin..... Fits a bit bigger than it should but I love to see it sparkle.... That's the one thing they got right"
3.0,I like but it's something small
3.0,It was ok. It had a terrible smell to it and was really stiff. The neck  stands up too high and stiff  and makes it awkward.
3.0,"The best part is that they don't pinch or uncomfortably rub the bridge of my nose AND they rest perfectly on my face without the bottom of them touching my cheeks and smearing my makeup. However, they are very flat and don't curve around at all to cover the outside corner of the eye, which means you get a little more light coming in from the sides. I love the look of them, and they come with a cheap little black carry case and cloth to wipe them with. I like the way I look in them. Very glamorous. Definitely cheap sunglasses though, but a fair value for the money. At least I won't fret about misplacing them or dropping them."
3.0,"They do work, although the clips don't keep their length.<br />I'll tighten them to the shortest length and have to retighten them the next day.<br />Not bad for occasional use, but not great for daily use."
3.0,I like the watch  but I thought  the screen  moves and when it dident i was disappointed .
3.0,It doesn’t come with the ribbon
3.0,"Small, but pretty!"
3.0,"The lens of these glasses didn't really fit, they fall out when not handled real carefully. Other than that everything looks good"
3.0,It was cute for the first two weeks but then one of the eyes fell out... :(
3.0,"Really disappointed in these. They are advertised as super soft but have a very big tag sewn in the side. Cutting it out leaves a big, scratchy bump, and trying to completely remove the tag results in a hole. In this day of tagless everything, I can't believe they made these like this."
3.0,Ok glasses. They don’t allow for returns even though they’re prime.
3.0,The charm is cute. The chain broke 3 days after it was put on. So disappointed in the cheap chain.
3.0,I wish they were bigger they don’t feed with my glasses on.<br />I would like to return them
3.0,Nice hat. Sure doesnt run as big as all the other reviews say. Tight fit
3.0,I have to return it.  It's swimmingly big.  Even the arms are huge.
3.0,The wrap portion of the dress was off (my guess because of the height issue… I had to pull the front down so my  crotch  wasn’t out and when I turned it was at the bottom of my<br />Cheeks… In these pictures I’m standing still and had to put leggings on but the second I walked it rode up… I ordered a 2XL
3.0,I think these wide chains look fake so I will not buy again.
3.0,"This shirt seems well made, and I think most of the problems I had with it are more of a problem with how it looks on me than the shirt itself. It is definitely not made to accommodate larger busted ladies. I have a large bust and smaller waist, and this shape is usually flattering on me, but this shirt was not. The bust was much too tight, the arms and waist too loose, and the pleats didn't flare the way they look in the picture. It just kind of hung there. the whole shape was very unflattering on me. I would say that this shirt is probably extremely cute on someone that has a proportional or smaller chest."
3.0,"These are inexpensive, and built that way. One of the catches was not secure, so I had to send them back—the seller was very obliging about the return.  Overall a good-looking inexpensive option if you do they a defective clasp."
3.0,good material. very stretchy. Buy a smaller size because the sides (hips) have excess cloth and has an awkward bag on each side.
3.0,"Heard a lot of good things about these, wanted to love them..  you get what you pay for, sure they almost feel like aligns and look like them , stitching is good... but they don’t hold up like aligns. Not even worn , I inverted them... thew them in the wash (delicate mode, on cold), air dried them and noticed severe peeling all over FIRST time washing. Can’t compare to aligns, I’d suggest you just save up a few months to buy a pair of Lulu aligns and actually take care of them ... they’ll last you way way longer."
3.0,"The color of the photo is a vivid neon-like Violet and the real one is a dark blue. The fabric is so thin you can see through it, it came so wrinkled and it absolute doesn't give the volume that the dress in the photo shows. I looked at many dresses until I found this one but it turns out it's like every other dress shown by other brands. It's... nice... but it's not what I was expecting AT ALL. DON'T BUY."
3.0,Got the size I ordered and almost looked like a long sweater than a dress.
3.0,Had to return because the dress was good from waist but was baggy fit from chest. If you are small chested this will fit baggy on you. Other then that i liked the material. It was nice thin for summer weather and pattern was adorable. Wish it was tighter from the top..
3.0,It's nice but it's so see through that you can see the pockets and it looks weird
3.0,This is too small or I'm just too big. Gifting it as it is nice.
3.0,"It fits loose but I got it for a costume and changed my mind.  I started to set up the return the night before, but waited the next morning.  I was one day too late and it would not let me return."
3.0,Runs a big large
3.0,"Great quality but disappointed in sizing. I had to go to the Can-am website for a size chart. Ordered a medium, according to the size chart, but it was WAY too small. Sending it back and trying a larger size. This supplier charges return shipping and a re-stocking fee, so buyer beware. I just hope the larger size fits!"
3.0,"The cap is nice and I like the fur inside. BUT, it is<br />too small!"
3.0,Very attractive but a bit thin when stretched. Definitely for with tunics.
3.0,It's a nice design
3.0,One of the pairs had a hole!!!
3.0,"They fit well, but the purple pads have already come loose and need to be reglued."
3.0,"Much smallee/thinner than I was expecting, and only like 7 “diamonds” on the tail(I know its fake but still, kinda false advertising) , 12 are in the picture posted and so it doesn’t look exactly like the picture but thats me being really picky. I was hoping for the ring to be thicker than this but it is still cute."
3.0,very pretty but x large fits like med pretty though
3.0,"The ring is okay. But once I received it, I was disappointed, the diamonds look very prominent online. But once I received the ring, I could barely see the diamonds at all!"
3.0,The insignia patch is way to far to the left of the shirt.  The shirt is very heavy.
3.0,Nice but not what I needed.
3.0,The colors fit different from the black for whatever reason
3.0,I didn't really like the colors of them. I wish they would have came with plugs to put in after putting the tapers through. When I got to 0 the taper fell out after wearing it for a few weeks. I didn't want to buy a plug since I was planning on moving up in about a week though I should have
3.0,Not all sizes fit one
3.0,"Nice stretch, fits kinda weird also I cut the tag on the side off because it was bothersome. If you're not the size of the model pictured, it will NOT fit you as such"
3.0,"I love the dress, the medium is a little snug."
3.0,"The colors are on point, but was a little too big for my head"
3.0,"I thought these were very beautiful. The studs are much bigger than I expected so they really stand out and it's just a pretty pink! I was very excited about these because I had ordered them to be the very first pair of earrings my daughter would wear after her piercing studs had healed. I purchased the disposable guns knowing those studs were very tiny so I searched and ordered these for afterwards also in case she had a reaction to the piercing ones. I pierced them about two weeks ago and a few days ago that earring fell out as she slept, I could only find the earring so I decided to just put the screw back in now so it wouldn't happen again. Piercing was a nightmare so reputting the earring in was also a nightmare as the back closed....Awful just knowing your hurting your own child. This earring has only been in her ear four days tops and luckily only the back fell off while she slept so I did not have to poke th e earring back in. I used the other earrings back because i cannot find it and am so confused of why and how a screw back fell off and so quickly. I now have two earrings and one back. I cannot find how to contact seller."
3.0,Product was as described in terms of color and sizing but I didn’t like the material. It was very thin and didn’t seem to lay right.
3.0,"This is a very light polyester material. I wasn't thrilled with the fit either, just somewhat small. I guess I just expected better quality for the price. It works but it's not the best quality."
3.0,Slick. Minimalist. But little bit too forced because cards' size should not be measured the exact same for the wallet
3.0,"I love it, but my issue was that it began to change/tarnish shortly after purchase"
3.0,I really like the shirt. It fit as expected. The only thing that I didn't like was that the sleeves were to long. It looked really bunched at the wrist.
3.0,"It's very short waisted. The waist is very high, almost under your bras. Good quality for price."
3.0,Very nice. Wore it once and actually missed it and it ended up in the dryer. Now it is doll clothes
3.0,Works as inteded
3.0,"my fiancé’s bracelet broke, we contacted the seller & they had us return the old ones & sent us new ones (which we greatly appreciated). it broke a few days/weeks later, so we purchased the bracelets again. that next bracelet also broke, so we just gave up."
3.0,Was a lot smaller then expected.  Got a L and should have gotten an XL.  I had to return but the skirt and Material are nice
3.0,"Great value, cool design, but awkward fit.  Neck is kind of loose sleeves are tight."
3.0,This fit is ok but one leg is longer than the other one
3.0,wish they came in half sizes...
3.0,Of course faded at the first sight of water
3.0,"Wish the front was a little longer, and wasn't quite as long. Front hits right at pants line"
3.0,"I bought a white one, and love the elastic material. However, the cut under the armpits is a bit loose. Also the dress make my shoulder look bigger."
3.0,"Great looking watch, I like it a lot. However, the deployment clasp means you have to squeeze it over your wrist to put on the watch. This stressing of the watch band causes the spring bar holding the strap to the watch to pop out. And it is bloody near impossible to put the springbar back into the tiny holes on the lugs. The rubber strap and the placementof the springbar holes makes it **very difficult** to put the strap back on the watch at all. After half a dozen times of the strap popping off, and the last time not being able to get it back on, I've given up on mine. A good watch gone to waste, with the strap hanging off half broken."
3.0,I've had a few stones fall out. NOT well made. If the stones stay in then they're nice which is why I'm being nice about the 3* rating.
3.0,"Great color, good fabric.. However a men's medium should fit a little bigger on me  am disappointed.  Sure won't put it in the dryer."
3.0,"I loved this little guy. But he fell off the second time I wore him. I thought he was on securely... Maybe it's like they say, &#34;Tis better to love and lost than never to have loved at all...&#34;<br /><br />I would give it a 5 star, but giving it a 3 because it wasn't secure enough."
3.0,"I received this item in a very small box that was postmarked from China, and it stated that there were fingernail tips in the box!!  It sounded like a hundred loose fingernail tips in the box!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I almost didn't open it!  I really thought that it was some type of scam, and I was on the way into the house to check my credit cards for any illegal charges!!!<br /><br />When I did open the package, it wasn't even in the little piece of bubble wrap that was in there.  As a result, I am not sure if the one wing that doesn't open easily is that way due to shipping or was poorly produced.<br /><br />It is cute though!"
3.0,It fit great and I loved the fabric but on the picture shown on Amazon it’s a black/gray zipper and the one I received it’s a red zipper I’m sure It might be a newer model cuz it says in package heavyweights but it doesn’t feel heavyweight I’m not disappointed cuz just don’t like the red zipper look
3.0,"Ill cut, uncomfortably stiff and tight around even my slender ankles so that when I sit down, instead of the legs riding up as would be normal, the waist gets pulled down. I'm 6' W 33&#34; so based on the vendor's size chart ordered the XL, which are pouchy below my waist but not long enough for movement. Couldn't bear to wear as long as one minute so cannot attest to their thermal quality but did love the rich navy color and appreciated the hand warmer pockets, so I'll grudgingly award three stars.<br /><br />Luckily for me, was actually fulfilled by Amazon rather than the third party vendor indicated at purchase, so got free return. Whew!"
3.0,Felt like L
3.0,the pattern starts to wears off with normal kid use.
3.0,beautiful but bottom of earring get stuck at a right angle and won't stay straight
3.0,"Too small, but great quality"
3.0,"Quality seems ok but run very small. I wear medium, ordered large and couldn’t them on. I gave them to my daughter who wears size small."
3.0,photo is misleading. it looks like it tapers in at waist but in reality it fits like a sack. Also very low cut and I had to keep my chest covered with a scarf.
3.0,The color is not light pink - its a mauve - not the color I displayed on the screen.  I was looking for a light pink.
3.0,"Love the color and shape. Though I ordered a size up, it still seemed small, especially after washing. I wanted something that I could wrap around me a little. This will not. Could just be my body shape."
3.0,This seemed to be decent quality but sizing charts didn’t match up and it was too large. Company was good with the return though.
3.0,Super tight but I can still get it on with lots of squeezing super cute though
3.0,"Fit in waist and length is nice. Like others the top is extremely low cut and revealing. I’m small chested, but was still exposed due to the wide v-cut. The arms also run small and there is no stretch I. The shoulders making it tight fitting through that area."
3.0,This is a push up bra and not noted in the description. The tag says &#34;push up&#34; and the cups are very padded. Other than that it is OK. Very thin band with only a single hook in the back.<br /><br />UPDATE: Someone listened and the description now states &#34;push up bra&#34; in the title. Thanks!
3.0,a good buy for the price
3.0,"Fits a little small, rather poor quality, got bent out of shape after one wear. easily bent back, just rather annoying to have to keep adjusting them."
3.0,Love the soft feel of the fabric but it is slightly see through material will need a slip.
3.0,"These look to be well made and the color is great. Unfortunately, I had to return them because they're a little too wide for my forehead."
3.0,Material was heavier than expected . Fits a tad tight in the chest area . Nice shade of pink !!
3.0,The purse is much roomier than the smaller bag.
3.0,Snap broke on first wearing.
3.0,I ordered a C even though I am a D and it still might be somewhat large. I don't find it does anything in the way of lift at all. It does pull the girls together but then they fell like they are being pulled down. They are very perky so it is odd. I probably will not use this at all
3.0,Super cute shorts! I wanted to love them but they were too snug and uncomfortable. I returned my size medium (I'm size 8-10 women's US) so maybe the large would work?
3.0,More for a child than adult
3.0,I like the material of the bag. The straps are a good length. The only thing I am disappointed in is the size. I was expecting it to be a little bigger. Over all I would buy this bag again.
3.0,Big flower broke off after about a month. Sad day. Loved this belly ring.
3.0,Our friends daughter ended up using these to “be Elsa”. They’re super shiny but not warm.
3.0,Not as comfy as I wanted it to be 😞
3.0,Nice but too much
3.0,Cute- a little cheesy
3.0,"Seem up the right sleeve does not match up with the thumb hole in the right hand,  The arm is twisted in order to use the thumb hole for wrist warmer."
3.0,"If you have a long torso, I recommend going up a size."
3.0,Runs small and the fabric pills after one wash. It also shrinks!
3.0,The dress was pretty with good material but it just didn’t fit my shoulders right. I’m 5’3” and 125 lbs and the shoulders were sliding around and the whole middle region was slightly too lose and I didn’t have the time to get it tailored so I’m returning it. If it was slightly smaller I would’ve kept it! Comfortable!
3.0,Really unique hat.  It was good to find a Chicago hat that is not sports themed.  It seems well made and the logo is not flimsy.  The only issue is that it seems to run small.  It is adjusted to the largest size and it’s a bit snug for my husband.
3.0,"Husband not crazy about this hat, never wears"
3.0,belt is too short.
3.0,"Like the bracelet but is runs big so mine flopps around and I can't wear it all the time, like I wanted to."
3.0,"I have yet to see this glow.  Chunks of ground rock? Supposed to glow?  Cheaply poured, mass produced clear resin trinket, with cheap Phoenix placed within.."
3.0,Loved this and wore it a couple times. Then washed it and it shrunk and now I’m sad
3.0,I thought it was going to be bigger but overall it serves the purpose
3.0,"UNDERCURRENT SURGING Classic Wrist Watches,Men Business Dress Watch with Day, Black Face, Flywheel Multifunction Luminous Men Stainless Steel Wristwatch<br /><br />This wristwatch has a classic nautical style with a more upscale looking face (fake diamonds for the numbers).  It has a nice look to it.<br /><br />The problem is that the band doesn’t match the watch.  The watch has polished silver and gold tones while the band is brushed silver and polished gold tones.  It’s definitely noticeable - it looks like they put the wrong band on the watch.<br /><br />As for functionality, the Japanese quartz movement gives the watch excellent accuracy.  I compared the watch’s time for several days with the nuclear clocks found online, and it’s very accurate.  I also really like the day/date function on the face of the watch.<br /><br />If it weren’t for the mismatched band, I’d give the wristwatch 5 stars."
3.0,"Cheap but do the job. Quite stiff and not that comfortable on the nose but if you're looking for something to throw in multiple locations for quick reads, they do the job."
3.0,"The top fit okay, but the skirt was far too small."
3.0,Looked better on the model then me. Was a little moo mooish looking and thin but super sexy with a high slit on one side. I didnt really feel comfortable wearing outside. The wind was in control of people seeing my goods. Lol Great for around the house..
3.0,"Some of them are too big to be knuckle rings and I'm worried that they will turn me green, I've been wearing a few for about an hour and so far so good."
3.0,Came packaged so tight the dress is almost permanently wrinkled. Otherwise cute!
3.0,"UPDATE:  I’m not crazy about how the tape ripples down the leg. This is a nice jogger but the colored stripe down the side is grosgrain ribbon, not a knit tape like most.  I'm a little concerned that it will effect the drape of the jogger as the grosgrain is stiffer than a knit tape."
3.0,Nice product  size larger than expected
3.0,The fabric is kind of pilly if thats a word.  It looks worn and  and it's only seen the washer 3 times.
3.0,Graphic looks more like a splattered egg than a daisy.
3.0,For me it could be a little longer. I don’t like the elastic part coming up. Love the sleeves and everything else.
3.0,These are cool. The material is lacking some weight and they feel a bit flimsy.  I would not repurchase.
3.0,My boyfriend has a normal sized shaved head he is 47 and it eas very tight almost uncomfortable
3.0,Upset it wasn’t white it’s like ivory/beige looking
3.0,Too gaudy!!
3.0,"SO SMALL. I am 5’10, 150lbs and I had to order the XL. I am a 34DDD and I had to safety pin the top to my bra to keep from my boobs falling out when I lifted my arms up lol. The bottoms fit ok, but was wider in the  waist than needed to be and was just an awkward material. The leg covers constantly folded down and my dress tape wouldn’t stick to the fabric. All in all, it did the trick for the night and was expected to not be perfect fit the price."
3.0,"Fits good, comfortable. Band for the front goes up nicely, the back not at all!"
3.0,Good lights for the money.  Got about 10 low battery or completely dead though.
3.0,"I bought these from Adidas direct since they had more sizes.  I wear 12 in most all Adidas soccer shoes but after buying a 12 in the Tango 17.2 I bumped these to 12.5.  They fit larger than 17.2 model but pretty close to normal. They are comfortable but I have others that simply feel better. They are going g to be 4_5 star shoes for.many I am sure but I have many indoor trainers that I feel are higher quality. It's always tough comparing leather or even synthetic shoes to this type of mesh material. Pros, light, look solid, fit well out of box and decent support.  I don't feel.much.padding in heel area and all and all this should be a $75 shoe.  Having worn the lower end 17.2 there almost identical and would rather have those and save the money"
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress! It’s just too long for me! Because of the material, I’ll have to take it to a seamstress to have it shortened!"
3.0,Too tight to wear to church. Ok for casual hanging out. The dress also rises.
3.0,"It fit great on my daughter but the first time she wore it the pants split down the middle on the seams, so I had to sew it."
3.0,The gems fell out in every jewelry piece within a week.
3.0,"Let me start out by saying I LOVE this watch and I would've given 5 stars, but the side pin (lug) and nut that hold the watch band to the face of the watch together fell off on one side the first hour I wore it! I have the same watch in a different color and have had it over 5 years and this never happened! I do recommend this watch just be sure to tighten the lug nut. Plus, there was no way to exchange the watch and I didn't want to return and repurchase as it went up in price $100! Couldn't find the replacement piece so I ordered the same watch used for really cheap on Poshmark just for the replacement part (still was cheaper than returning and repurchasing). Had their been a way to exchange, I would've left 5 stars. The watch is stunning! Just be sure to check that everything is tightened!"
3.0,Ordered a small and it was still large and baggie. Doesn’t come any smaller so I had to return it.
3.0,A simple dress you can dress up or down. Material is thin [not sheer]. Lines from anything you wear will show underneath.  Overall its just...meh.
3.0,Nice dreds
3.0,"Even washing it inside out, the message on this shirt started to flake away.  It's still readable, but the message is all cracked.  It is a comfortable and warm sweatshirt."
3.0,"After using it several months, the fabric that covers the card slots in the inner side, ripped."
3.0,It is not for putting on a Jersey.
3.0,Deep widespread wrinkles won't come out even after soaking in water. I have purchased other brands that were not wrinkled and needed no special care. Returning this item.
3.0,After one weekend of use the zipper broke.
3.0,"Told you that I would send pic when my Cuz tries it on, She loves it.  Fits her well, now I know what size to get for my self.  This is a 3x."
3.0,"Cute, but doesn't stay up unless you squeeze it on really tightly. If you can endure the pain, get it!"
3.0,"item looks cheaply made. However, it is nice for the price I paid."
3.0,"It is a ok belt, a bit on the flimsy side compared to the made in the usa made belt it is replacing."
3.0,Nice outfit just don’t like the spaces in the seated<br />area where you can see his undershirt/diaper
3.0,A little too long for a medium size.  Also fabric more course weave than other C&B shirts I have bought in men's store.
3.0,"I love the look of these jeans, unfortunately they have no give in the material and a size 30 wouldn’t fit, I have others in the same brand that are 30 and fit good."
3.0,Too small for adult necks. But for kids...Great warmth.
3.0,I’m 5’1 And orders XS. I still had to tailor it.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, runs large."
3.0,If it touches anything it wipes away the symbol.  Very cheap quality.
3.0,They should have better quality control....<br />There are many little bubbles on the metal part of the necklace so it messes up how visually pretty it could be
3.0,"Shoes run big. The quality of the material is good. Order a size smaller, for a better fit."
3.0,"I thought it’s 8 pairs, I only get 7 pairs."
3.0,Well made band but keeps popping off on the original band the levers to release the band are smaller and harder to get to on this one they are much easier to unlatch so I believe that's why the band pops off. update-I have since use the pins on the original band and they seem to hold better so far
3.0,I received this dress tailored horribly! Thankfully I have someone who re tailored it properly. However the design is lovely.
3.0,"Worst color description I’ve ever encountered.  True Navy turned out to be a greyish purple!  Fit was a little larger than expected, but still ok.  Fabric is undeniably smooth and soft."
3.0,Very cute and stylish but was a little too big for my baby!
3.0,The wires in the bracelet keeps getting caught
3.0,Good quality but it’s really short the length is about waist long or a bit shorter
3.0,"Kinda small, but still very nice"
3.0,I really liked the smilplicty of then but the gold became discolored quickly.
3.0,"the choker with the small triangle on it was broken when i opened the package. the other ones are fine, but i was bummed that i wasnt able to wear it."
3.0,I bought the hat and gloves for my ten year old.  The hat was to big for him but does fit my 12 year old and the gloves shrunk after first wash so they don don't fit any of my boys.
3.0,"Pulled the first one out, laced it up, put it on and it fit. It looked great but the string is almost too short to tie. Pull the second one out, lace it, put it on and it fits about the same. I turn my wrist and realize either the point or the lacing is way off center. I have to wear one or the other on the side of my wrist and it doesn't look great. Other than that they're ok."
3.0,"I received the bracelets in the mail, however, just as another person stated, the metal hardware managed to come off of the orange bracelet (I'm assuming during delivery)...I haven't been able to wear them as of yet, bc I need to glue the metal hardware back on..."
3.0,"It was a great dress, however there's no slip underneath so it is very sheer."
3.0,"Its really cute,  bigger than expected, I do use it"
3.0,Kinda small and has a weird smell to it. The buttons don't work nor do the pockets. Typical woman clothing.
3.0,"Cute suit, love the bottoms but the top in the same size is cut a bit small for me. Purchased an XL, bottoms are perfect."
3.0,This clutch is beautiful. Very tasteful and expensive looking. The reason why I gave it a 3 star is because there were jews missing off the front.
3.0,Love the softness of the bamboo but the Velcro isn’t the best quality. Got stuck to a silk burp cloth and when I pulled to separate them the Velcro detached from the boot. I ordered 3-6 month size for my 11 week old and his toes go right to the edge. Very wide shoe lots of extra fabric on the sides just small in length.
3.0,"I bought these shoes for my son about 6 months ago because my daughter received a pair and he just fell in love with them. The shipping took ages, I didn't pay attention to where they were shipped from, so that's my fault. But they were great for the first few weeks. They arrived charged, too, which is good because the charger didn't plug into the shoes very well. However, the placement of the switch (inside the shoe by the arch) means that it gets bumped and the button pushed, and within a few weeks they only worked intermittently. The wires have pulled out of the switch and by now they are only regular shoes with wires that get in the way. The quality of the shoes themselves is decent and my son continues to wear them, but the entire point of the shoe was that it was supposed to light up, and that really was a disappointment."
3.0,"Wore this set for about a week-not getting them wet, no beach/pool, and the ball bracelet is starting to lose it's plating. Thepther bracelets are ok so far. Whomp whomp."
3.0,"Too big and stretchy, they're also itchy, but they're really cute"
3.0,Me gusto esta muy lindo pero es algo fragil
3.0,"This skirt was really cute, but it runs incredibly small. The waist has no elasticity. The ""bum"" is made for women with small glutes. Other than that, the color is great, & the fabric actually looks better than what's on the pic."
3.0,"Super fast shipping ,is bigger than the picture and also kinda cheap looking but overall pretty good especially if you're using it for a few hours, can't beat the price."
3.0,"Is it luxury? no. Quality? Sort of.  Does it hold your shoes and keep them off your clean clothes? Yep.  Good enough for me.  Unless you need something super fancy, this does the trick.  Fits a pair of size 10 dress shoes/sneakers with a little room to spare.  Probably wouldn’t fit hi tops, but I haven’t tried.  3 stars is spot on."
3.0,"This is a single piece of tulle folded over 3 times. It is NOT 3 independent layers of tulle.<br />When I tried to shift the tulle to look more full I noticed the whole thing moved. I was expecting 3 individual pieced of tulle layered. It will take some real skill to figure out how to cut the fabric to be 3 distinct layers. Just shows that when you try to go cheaper, you get what you pay for.  I doubt I will be able to get it to look as full as the images. Disappointed.<br /><br />The nice things are that the tulle is the super soft type. Very elegant and flowy. It is also very long which is better than being short.. I will have to cut off about of foot of fabric."
3.0,Really wanted the tag on the item :( it is a gift.
3.0,"The boots are nice ...but the smell is horrible.  Nothing I did could get the smell out if them even took them to shoe repair and they said there's nothing they can do, truly a waste of money. Will never purchase again"
3.0,"These seemed like decent masks when I got them. They are too small for my large-ish face, so I gave them to my son. Within a couple of weeks the stitching in the middle started to come undone. So, not bad, but small and don’t seem to last for long."
3.0,Ok quality. Fits really small
3.0,A bit tight and thin. I wear around the house only.
3.0,While it is pretty the band broke in less than a month. Very disappointed
3.0,"Great price,  very nice shoes. Unfortunately, the  blue stitches that cut through the Nike symbol make the shoes look fake, so I cut them with a seam ripper and filled the holes with shoe paint."
3.0,It’s fine. Shapeless. Oversized.
3.0,"Nothing like picture.<br />They fit , good stretch, not ugly but , again, doesn’t look anything like the photo"
3.0,"This isn't very well made, looks good, but a bit big."
3.0,has no support i like the original dr marteens with support that have a heel
3.0,Nice shirt after a few washings. Not comfortable on the first try.
3.0,"I thought this would be more padded.  Maybe if your girls are bigger, this acts as a push up bra, but if you’re not as gifted, it’s really just a normal sports bra.  Now.. it’s nice and stretchy - so no pulling muscles or injuring yourself trying to get it off after a sweaty workout, but it’s just a sports bra.  I like the material though, so I’ll be keeping it."
3.0,Fingers too long you have a lot of space left over ...
3.0,The colors are very bright unlike the ones shown in the image
3.0,Not shipped from the US like the say.Came out of China.
3.0,Cute but smelled like a musty basement
3.0,"i love this top.  it appears that it would hide my momma belly.  i ordered my size, medium, and the top was to small at the bottom.  i didn't bother trying on the bottoms so i don't know how they fit. i recommend ordering up."
3.0,"Loved the top,but I would have needed an xs as a 5ft 100lb woman"
3.0,"Very cute necklaces but unfortunately mine arrived defected, definitely returning"
3.0,Great material super soft just runs small.
3.0,"Bought as a gift, but sizing very small, order 1 size bigger to fit."
3.0,Nice bright print but cheap material. Runs small.
3.0,"I was disappointed in the sizing. I wear a 27 pant. Ordered a 30 belt. It was so small it didn't even close. Not sure if others had this experience?<br /><br />And the company doesn't seem to do exchanges. I am returning, but wish Amazon did the processing to make an exchange easier."
3.0,If you are an extra large in us this suit will not fit you. It runs very small.
3.0,Jacket fabric is slightly shiny so 3 stars for that since it looked matte. But i am still keeping it since the sleeves are cute and fits well.
3.0,I wear a 16. This was a 3x. Still ain't fit.
3.0,The wrap/slit in the front of this dress is much shorter than pictured.  I had to pin it down more to make it work appropriate otherwise it would've been very revealing.  Also it's very form fitting so I'd recommend wearing some sort of shapewear under it or you'll show all of the lines/rolls/lovehandles.
3.0,"Left temple broke at metal to plastic juncture, just came apart. Second pair I have used , both broke after a month or so."
3.0,Ya best to order a whole size up
3.0,I wear them as pajamas because they are extremely too big
3.0,Love love this blouse but it fit ok but couldn't keep the shoulders down if I moved my are at all it went straight to my neck and that doesn't look good. Super cute but you would have to stand in a corner and not move.
3.0,Value for money was not a surprise. Just a simple design. Quality not bad. Need to order in larger size. I gave mine away. Ended up going to a store to buy.
3.0,nice shirt but you might want to order a size smaller
3.0,They were a good quality but the fit was too small. Had to return them.
3.0,The dress felt kind of cheap... but it was cheap to buy so you get what you pay for.
3.0,"It is very nice as the picture shows, however up front the Sapphire Blue Cabochon stone extends out from the ring that you can not see from the angle in the picture."
3.0,"I find it hard to believe that this very blue, stone is actually aquamarine"
3.0,This is a xmas present so I cannot give a rating at this time.
3.0,"I didn't expect high end material for the price, however, laces were very thin without bound ends, very hard to thread into holes, I suggest buying a set for it. It looks and feels like a thick garbage bag, I cut off sleeve to match both sides, and hood. If you are handy with a sewing machine, make a thin black liner for it, it will hang better, and last longer. Will not order anything else of this companies' material."
3.0,Runs  large...
3.0,The packaging of the shoes was bad. You can see the dent marks that it created to the shoes. I've tried stuffing it with paper and a shoe holder but it doesn't work. Look at the picture.
3.0,"These are a great looking shoe but run large in the length, not width. I have ordered a number of pairs of Naturalizers lately and each of the shoes fits completely different. I normally wear a 9.5, which is what I ordered, but these were to long.  Other Naturalizers in very similar styles run small.  I'm not sure why they can't be consistent with their sizing, but it is hit and miss what size will actually fit.  These shoes are super cute I just wish the sizing was consistent."
3.0,It was awkward. The ring that crossed over stuck out too much.
3.0,It’s adorable but a little smaller than I like and not very comfortable those thick straps rub your ears
3.0,Nice wallet but cheap material
3.0,Not good for boys.
3.0,I cant wear these in public because the material is so thin. They're soft but overall nothing I'd ever order again.
3.0,"The quality of the dress is nice and the sizing does run small so for those curvy girls like me... I would say go up a size!  It does have some stretch to it but not so much so beware (go up a size!) The bust has no type of structure to it sits rather odd but with a little &#34;shuffling&#34; of the &#34;girls&#34; you should be okay if you don't wear a bra (like me).  I also want to take a moment to vent about something that annoys me... if you look closely the dress that is ON the model is NOT the same dress pictured on its own... do you get what I am saying? If you look at the model showing the back of the dress, it does not have the same shape as the picture showing the back of the dress alone, it's not even the same type of &#34;denim&#34; fabric... it obviously didn't bother me enough to not order the dress but I don't appreciate vendors who do not show REAL pictures of their products."
3.0,Nice but quality is not as I expected
3.0,"This is a very cheap belt.  I ordered this for my husband as he wanted this style of a belt for his snowpants.  The buckle is made of a thick plastic, which is fine.  However, when he was trying it on the whole belt came apart and it took the both of us way too long to figure out how to get it back together.  Once we figured it out, the belt works fine.  He's a 33"" waist, so I ordered the smallest available size and it wraps around him one and a half times. He could cut and burn the edges to get a better fit, but he doesn't want to mess with the buckle again (I don't blame him).  It's serving its purpose for his snowpants, so he's overall okay with it.  I wouldn't repurchase it, though."
3.0,Done what small but still fixes the cleavage issues on v neck clothing
3.0,Recently received this item. I tried them on and they are extremely long. I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 125lbs. They are on the loose-fitting side. They look exactly like the image. I'm sure I'd like them better if they were fitted like my other active wear.<br /><br />Disappointed customer.
3.0,"It could be more curve, and Lens could be darker"
3.0,It’s a nice design and looks great. But the material this is made with is definitely not my favorite. It definitely ran on the smaller side as well.
3.0,"Nice, works as expected."
3.0,Pretty dress but too small even though I ordered larger size than I usually wear.
3.0,Ordered using size guide on Amazon. Item was still too small. Gave away to a friend.
3.0,It fit as expected but is very sheer.  I need an undershirt or I feel too exposed.  Would be ok over a swimming suit.
3.0,"Darker than pictured, cannot really see that it's green. Necklace is nice. Good length."
3.0,Cute dress fits well but pockets keep trying to stick out.
3.0,"After a few hours at the pool the silver started peeling off the shoe. Plus the rubber part near the front of the shoe has a gap. Overall my son loves the shoes, however for $20 I did not expect for the shoe to fall apart."
3.0,the neckline was a tad small
3.0,It's cute and it feels well made but I'm 5'8&#34; and this dress was a solid 5 inches too short for me. I found it fit exactly true to size -- if it weren't so short it would have been perfect.
3.0,I wish they were a little softer and heavier
3.0,"a little disappointed in the color that was received. Definitely not the vibrant blue as shown, it's more of a grey/blue color."
3.0,"Though it fit as expected quality of product wasn't to standard. I thought it would be a lot thicker, material is thin."
3.0,The shade of green was darker than expected. The black floral pattern was overwhelming. Proportionately far more pattern than I detected in the online image.
3.0,"The quality of this chokers is not great, but for the price of it i thought it was a good buy. They feel cheaply made, but i am usually very careful with products, but if you are one of those rough on product type of person i would not recommend to get this. They don't look cheap on you unless you are being neat picky about it. One of the chokers however (the one with the 3 stripes) i just realize that two of the stripes were put on twisted so it is and looks tangle all the time. But again for the price of it i don't even want to go through the trouble of returning it. Other than that i am very happy wit this product, the choker trend wont last forever anyway."
3.0,"Fit well, but needed a spot of glue to hold.  Also, not as padded as original."
3.0,"Style is as expected, fabric is super-soft and comfy, fit is smaller than anticipated."
3.0,"Pretty, comfy, expect to wear it once because it is incredibly  breakable ."
3.0,"I went up a size and it was still snug. The print and color are gorgeous,  but the fabric has zero stretch"
3.0,It was a gift. Still waiting for a reply. Thanks
3.0,We bought 2 of the dragon urn necklace and can't get either one to open so that we can use them.We will mail them back for a full refund unless someone can contact us and help us to solve this problem.The other urns that we purched we are happy with.Thank You
3.0,Like others said they are for smaller heads so I cut the band in back and used a piece of heat shrink tubing now they fit
3.0,The stud on them us not very long. Not good for fresh peircings.
3.0,"This dress is okay. I bought it because I thought the silver links looked different. My biggest problem with it is that the end of the links are awkwardly on the top of the dress between my breasts. I tuck it under so it is hidden. I also haven't braved washing it yet because I am afraid what the chains might do (haven't found a way to easily take them out). The dress is pretty cute, though. Just a little awkward."
3.0,"I took a chance on getting a these masks and they are super nice and super soft, however, they are not for prolonged use. They are not easy to breath in because they are not just silk like I thought, they have and inner cotton layer that makes it thicker then I would like. And I know that sounds dumb because we want to make sure we are covered in this crazy covid time but you easily get over heated and light headed because its suck a thicker mask. I have to say, the seller was super kind and refunded me the price of purchase and let me keep the masks. I will use these for quick minimal uses but if you are someone who needs these for a long wear...I would look at other options."
3.0,These are so cute for the price but one of the bows already came undone. We always get compliments though and my 2 year old loves them
3.0,"I like the tanks, the material is thin enough to fit under a shirt but unfortunately it doesnt provide much compression. It does make you sweat so I guess that's a great benefit from wearing the shirts. Maybe if I buy the tanks a size smaller it'll provide what I need."
3.0,"It actually runs really big. I'm a solid 175 pound athletic. I'm 5'8, this a long torso. I have only wore it once because I feel dumpy in it. It's thick cotton and very long. It's a cute shirt, I like the sleeves, it's just way too bulky feeling in it for me. I'm typically an xl or lg in shirts due to long torso and I'm fairly solid, thick, muscular in body type."
3.0,not as it appears on pictures
3.0,"You have to wear white undies or no underwear, do to the pattern or different color undies showing through the light color of the dress. Other than that, I have received many compliments on the dress and it fits well and is stretchy fabric."
3.0,"Very disappointed. It's a nice ring, nothing fancy. The gold plating is pristine, it shines and the zirconia sparkle, but that's where my praise ends. I wanted a ring for my middle finger, so I ordered the size that fits my middle finger, a 9... I'm not sure who they get their sizing info from, but they need to be fired. This ring is a size 8, not a 9. Though I like it, I don't love it enough to wear it on the finger I didn't purchase it for. Disappointed."
3.0,This dress was huge & way too long. The picture made it look like it was shorter than it actually is. I’m pretty tall at 5’5.5 & the dress went way past my knees.
3.0,"It is too big, I ordered a small but it looked like a medium. The fabric is thin and stretchy. It’s wonderful for layering and exercising but, not so great for wearing it by itself."
3.0,Not really a rose gold tone more like a copper tone
3.0,I read reviews before buying this dress and ppl stated it ran large so I bought a large instead of a medium and the large was big on me. I could have gone with the medium and it would have fit great. Cute dress
3.0,"Le eh dado durante más de 2 minutos cuerda, y no avanza el reloj! Necesito alguna solución"
3.0,I love big purses and its super cute. Color is darker then you think it will be. I would not recommend it if you use the king strap because it broke after 2  months of gentle use.
3.0,"I’ve worn a few different brands and styles of “separator” underwear, and as a category they tend to be “difficult” to wear. They have to fit JUST RIGHT in order to be comfortable - and not just standard size-wise, but because they have pockets and pouches and flaps and separation pieces, etc., it’s difficult to find one that works for you. For me, unfortunately, while they fit great around the waist, the leg, the bum, etc., the little “flaps” on the sides of the pouch area (meant to keep “the boys” from rubbing against your upper thighs and chafing) just weren’t comfortable. There was too much fabric for them to stay tight, the fabric moved and folded, and they just weren’t comfortable. The fabric is great and they’re nice quality overall, but not for me."
3.0,Sizes run small ... but these are cute fun shorts
3.0,I really like the look if this watch band. However the clasp on the band will not stay closed. This is the 2nd band and I have the same issue.  I like the band enough that I am keeping it but need to find an alternate clasp.
3.0,They were not sturdy not easy to stay on. Mardi gra party
3.0,These are cute but if you pull down on the tassels on accident they will move around and detach from their places. I have them on zippers so I wouldn’t recommend that. Would be good for a regular keychain though. They’re cute
3.0,"Would have scored higher as it is a very nice bag, but the key chain and puff attachment are nowhere to be found in the packaging or bag.  This was a Christmas present and now, cannot be given.  VERY disappointed."
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress but is very thick/heavy.  I was looking for a dress to wear to a summer event and while this dress was cute, the fabric just didn't work for me.  I was starting to sweat just trying it on so I can't imagine wearing it during the summer for an outdoor/indoor event."
3.0,"The dress runs small, I'm 4ft 11 inches, but the dress is too short, and I'm not impressed with the quality."
3.0,Small timeframe to return pants
3.0,Listed as a sweatshirt but basically a polyester shirt.
3.0,Definitely runs very small
3.0,The bow is more like a red/whine colored and doesn't match the burgundy suspenders...
3.0,Un poco trasparente o en decir verdad totalmente transparente
3.0,This dress is cute. It is definitely more like tshirt material. A little thicker. It flares nicely. But it's not very thick.
3.0,"The top is definitely not a large and doesn't have any support, although it is nice because it's lined, I just wouldn't recommend this for bustier women.<br />I do love the bottoms, they fit very nice. I honestly wanted to show a little more cheek and wouldn't consider them a Brazilian cut on the bottom but nonetheless they fit well.<br />Material is great, for the price I don't mind keeping the bottoms and pairing them with another top."
3.0,They were fine for my toddler but were way too small for my other kids.
3.0,"It looks good, but the material isn’t good!"
3.0,"Wasn't quite soft enough. It is a gift, I hope she likes it"
3.0,Not a kids size it looks way too big even in my 10 year old. 5 ft high and 100 pounds.
3.0,Unless you have wrists like the wings of a small bird these will be tight on you. It's more like teen sizing on the wrist if anything but it's nothing a well placed mini rubber band can't overcome.<br /><br />There were slight differences in the lengths of the cuffs with both of my sets so bear in mind they might need a bit if altering to look right.
3.0,Runs to big.. usually i wear a size S but in these case i think size XS fits me good.
3.0,These are cheap and thin. One pair ripped on the seam the second wearing. Another pair was bright yellow and is now a dull ugly color (and yes I know how to do laundry).
3.0,I love the comfort of these pants. The only downside is the quick wear/tear of the fabric.
3.0,Looks nice!❤️❤️❤️
3.0,Ripped on the chest almost immediately but easy fix if you can sew. I wish the belt was attached as well but again easy fix!!
3.0,Very nice quality but not true size.
3.0,"Great costume, but ripped by the neck the first day we got it. Very thin material."
3.0,Polyester..HOT!
3.0,This is a light weight hoodie - However the hood is large and heavy and pulls the shirt up in front.  Okay but not a favorite!
3.0,no the leggings i ordered still going to keep cause they’re cute
3.0,"Dress is very nice and material is not cheap at all. However, the dress is too long. I’m 5’4” and it came just above my ankles. Sadly I must return it."
3.0,"Material is thin, pocket for phone is very small, unsure of how well it's going to work for running. But sizing is perfect."
3.0,"I tried ordering Reebok ""basketball type"" drawstring shorts for my husband, as he has several pair that he loves. These shorts were advertised as having 11"" inseams, on all 3 Amazon sites, so I ordered them. All 3 pairs of Reebok shorts that came in were 7"" inseam!!!  These definitely are NOT what my husband was wanting for his birthday and Father's day!  We were both very, very disappointed!!!"
3.0,"I'll be honest the necklace feels cheap, very cheap. It is pretty and have worn it, however I don't expect this necklace to hold for too long. I didn't even bother with the earrings, they look like they came from the dollar store."
3.0,Cute and durable but not made for small wrists. They are too big and no way to adjust them
3.0,Could have bought these from a local store for cheaper.  I do however like the depth of the frame and the way the shades wrap around my face. Afraid that is they are dropped even once they're done for.
3.0,"The jacket is pretty, it has a nice look, zippers give it a nice expensive touch. I got complements on item, I took 2 stars because: 1. Runs small, still I could use it but I could see one of the shoulders looking snug, 2. Sleeves are not lined, I bough this on white and it is more visible, lining really gives structure to a jacket.<br /><br />For the price I got this is decent, but it won't be your best jacket, is thin, not on the high end side. I consider jackets an investment a good fit jacket really complements any outfit, I got tempted with this one because of the style, but I doubt is going to last too much, I can see zippers getting a lititle bit of tarnish already after one usem I knew what I was going to get for the price."
3.0,"I am size 16/18 and 5'7&#34;. I bought this top in L,blue. Material is nice,but tinner than expecteed and stiff. Embroidery is gorgeous.Looks well made,but very short in front and INCREADABLY tight sleeves. I really can't understand that. ..making such a wide,oversized dress with such a tight sleeves. And this item is overpriced in my opinion. Disappointed. Returning immediately.<br />The top is 2*,but added one more star for beautiful embroidery."
3.0,"It is good, seems a bit different than other bucket hats that I own.  I may get the orange one when I have enough money for another hat. Thanks."
3.0,shorter then i thought. liiks very differnt. but i prob wont wear ir in public
3.0,Cut small very tight around the hips
3.0,"The shoes were too loose, I have narrow feet and they didn't fit at all. I returned them and I'm still waiting for a refund."
3.0,"So cute, but were way, way too small. I normally wear a 4-6 in pants - the medium could barely be pulled up past my knees."
3.0,"The initial chain is very long even on the shortest option. The first chain is bulky for my liking. However the second chain fits perfect. I attached the initial to the second chain and just wear that one. The third long chain is beautiful though, too bad it’s too long."
3.0,It's  a good fit on the head and pretty close to accurate however the brim was way too large to the point where it curls up and that's just not how it's supposed to be so I modified it and cut it down to size and it's anime accurate now and my favorite hat I have
3.0,"Poor hat arrived in a bag, sort of smushed the spikes, but with gentle handling, fixed most. Hubby was irritated that it was not in a better package, but it runs small... not a one size fits all, but I just have an extra big head, lol."
3.0,Nice fabric but runs very small- read the size range closely.
3.0,"Its a nice hat, but it is larger than I expected. Though, I have a smaller than average head. Was hoping to replace one similar that I loved. Thought about returning it, but haven't done so yet. Tested the Bluetooth speakers and they worked."
3.0,"Back was very low and wide cut, so if you are thick at all it makes you look REALLY thick in the back. I did not have rolls hanging out, but I felt like it made my back look wider. It is beautiful in the front, and sturdy. The material is a little cheap like polyester, but for the price, I was willing to deal with that. I did not end up wearing it because of the back, so I returned it."
3.0,Lenses are too dark for me. Fit is nice.
3.0,They fit and are comfortable but are definitely not for high impact exercising.  More for causal walking... no running or jumping.
3.0,"Fit as expected.  Only one problem. It does't have much give.  I ordered an X-large, and it fits as an X large, but there is no stretchiness to it.  The cuffs on the sleeves have NO give at all.  They are small, you can't push them up past your elbow.  They fit me perfectly, right to the wrist.  So if you're long armed, they will be pretty short."
3.0,"I am 5'8"" tall and ordered a large of this dress.  The elastic waist of the dress is very high up, causing the cinched waist to sit around my rib cage.  As a result, the dress was not very flattering.  Additionally, the fabric feels very cheap and plastic-y and after two washes I was unable to remove the wrinkles that were in it from shipping.  I so wanted this dress to fit well, as I think it is very cute."
3.0,"Super cute particularly with a contrasting belt. So comfortable and has pockets! My one headache has been that the wine color runs in the wash, and I now have a very pink and wine stripped top to my once white and wine dress. Sigh."
3.0,"I am very disappointed in this robe. It is a pretty plaid and a nice cozy warm plush material(thats how it earned a 3) but the problem is it doesnt wrap around enough. I am 5.2 petite frame. I bought a size small and although the robe fits perfectly my legs are still cold as there is not enough material to overlap after tied to keep the legs warm. The robe actually opens from above the knees down as I walk. It doesnt cover my legs enough when sitting. It doesnt close at the bottom when standing  like the picture shown. So if you are buying a robe for warmth, this is not the one. I would not buy again:("
3.0,Much larger in person than looked to me in the photo.
3.0,"I ordered a small, I am 5’2 and about 100 pounds and they are a bit large on me but even still, they have INSANE camel toe! I pull them down as far as I can, try everything, but it’s literally like they sewed the camel toe into the pants. I’m going to try them with a panty liner to help but if camel toe bothers you I wouldn’t recommend them."
3.0,"The pockets, including the license window (or whatever it's called) is tight. It's been less than a year, but it feels like it won't loosen up even after many years. Only time will tell."
3.0,It's a beautiful ring but I thought it would have a little more weight to it.
3.0,The material is typical of a hospital gown. It runs long and breaths really well. Good for adjusting from hospital gowns to pajamas. Not sure it’s the best for the $. But does the job.
3.0,Wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. The colors are very dull and it does not look as advertised. Will probably not use it.
3.0,The arms seem short and the bulky fit was not flattering on me.
3.0,Pretty heavy for me
3.0,"I really liked this bag, enough that I was using it daily. My cell phone started having problems and I realized that the bag was sweating and my phone was picking up moisture. Probably not wise to use it for day to day wear. I loved it otherwise!"
3.0,It is smaller than I thought it would be. Hard to read but pretty
3.0,"Great color, look expensive but run a half size big in my opinion."
3.0,I really liked the Bracelet except they were on the large side but very beautiful.
3.0,Black one Doesn’t fit Over my shoulders the same way floral one does of the same line and same size
3.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and super curvy. As much as I was hoping to wear this as a dress, I can only wear this with pants or something underneath, for fear of lack of decency. Or, if that's your thing, just get a bikini wax before wearing! (No judgement, ladies!)"
3.0,"This is a nice shirt. It's soft, thin and the color is very pretty. The issue with it is that it runs at least a size larger than expected. My husband is a large in everything he wears, but not only was the shirt too long in the torso and the sleeves, but it was also very baggy on him. So if you're looking for a thin, reasonably priced Henley shirt, then this isn't a bad option. I'd just suggest sizing down before you purchase."
3.0,Was dead on arrival. Had to look up how to change battery and was a waste of time
3.0,Ordered the kit with the elephant pendant.  Loved it.  Was so excited to open it and see the pearl in it and sadly it doesn't fit.  It's too big and so the pendant won't close.  Sad that I spent the money on it just to have it not fit.
3.0,Product says it fits a fitbit versa lite watch but it is too small.
3.0,"If the torso was about 2 inches longer it would be great, but this hits exactly under the bust and looks very maternity."
3.0,"I purchased this pair of earrings for my MIL - they were on her wishlist. I like them okay, but they are smaller than they appear in the picture, so don't be surprised when you open the box. Pretty, but not as impressive as I thought they'd be."
3.0,"Even with the banding around ankles for tightness, socks are tighter around calf proportionally as compared with ankles. This creates almost reverse compression. I don’t have large calves. Maybe product is designed for larger ankles or maybe I got a defective pair. Hope this review helps others."
3.0,Everything in one word which is CHEAP. We really can sell or buy something different with better quality and service. China can produce really  excellent stuff.
3.0,"Somewhat small in depth/heighth, not round."
3.0,Bottoms for great. Top is not made for busty girls. It looks terrible.
3.0,clip is hard to use
3.0,"cute item not as small as i expected, will make a nice stocking stuffer for someone to have at christmas"
3.0,Ended up returning this in favor of another similar top but it was a nice-feeling material. Was a little looser around the hem than I expected - I had some room (but not so much that I wouldn't wear it) where it looks like it's tighter on the model.
3.0,These run very small and the two bras were marked the same size but they are definitely different sizes.
3.0,The bead is smaller than the usual Chamelion or other named bead bracelets. It does not look right on the bracelet.
3.0,Happy with the purchase just bigger than expected.
3.0,These are very comfortable it the pockets poke out and make them unflattering. I definitely could not size up to try to fix this as they would fall off even though I am 30 weeks pregnant.
3.0,"Good option for the price, but it frays & gets dirty very easily. I probably would not buy it again."
3.0,"Smaller waist. larger hips. The elastic seemed not to be too stretchy. But, I can still wear it."
3.0,"It does great at keeping sweat out of my eyes, I just wish it came in more sizes than one fits all.  I have a stupidly large head and its really tight on my head, so it can hurt after a while."
3.0,"The second, inner loop fell off almost immediately. Otherwise, it is a decent belt. Instructions on shortening the belt are very clear."
3.0,You only get the pentagram bracelet not the rest of it.. Dragonfly etc..
3.0,nicer heavier sweater but I still thought something else looked better on
3.0,Para un regalo pero deseaba una mejor tela
3.0,This shirt is pretty juvenile. The straps don't adjust so it has an awkward pre-teen fit. Probably will just give it to my niece.
3.0,It's a very pretty skirt that fits well. It's also partly lined. The fabric is stiff. There is no identification of the fibre from which it's made. Neither are there any care instructions. The texture of the fabric leads me to believe it's synthetic.
3.0,"I was really excited to get this dress as it is a classic that never goes out of date. After consulting the size chart listed, I ordered size 6/8 believing it would be a medium, however, upon receiving the dress, it turned out the dress is size large. The tag on the dress does not have the sizes listed in the post but rather S,M,L. The numbers on the chart for size large are 12-14 so this was a huge bummer. The dress does not fit nicely because of the larger size. Its more loose around the waist and does not fold nicely as shown in the picture. I will be giving this to a friend who wears a larger size than mine and hopefully she will like it.<br />I received this item at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"This necklace's luster is nice, and the promotion for free earrings with the purchase is impressive. But the pearls are not round -- they are oblong with the string going through the short side--and this a clasp-free necklace, which I only realized too late to cancel. Why does the picture show the necklace as a double strand, when you could only double it if your head was less than 13 inches around? In short, this is going back, I have better."
3.0,meh.. they are okay.. Was not impressed.
3.0,I have gotten this style of pants from other sellers on Amazon and loved them.  I liked that these came in a petite size.  I wear medium so I ordered medium but they were too tight so I ordered a large and they were still too small and expecting they would fit I had washed them so now I can’t return them. Very disappointed. I so wanted to like them because I love this style of pants and was looking forward to having them in petite.
3.0,Shoes run a lot bigger than size
3.0,"I needed a stylish sportsbra with accents on the back, and at first I thought..this is exactly what I want. But this is a rather small garment, doesn't have enough stretch for me to slide over my torso. Heck, I couldn't even fit it over my shoulders!  The fabric is nice, for sure! It's a compression bra, thick fabric with, I'm assuming, enough to prevent bounce. But I usually need a size XXL, or 1X like in Macy's sizing. This runs really small. But not even the largest size I tried on (XXL) was going to do it for me. Back it went!"
3.0,"Nice comfortable hat. The camo pattern was mostly one solid color up front. Not very camouflaged. So, I bought a second to see it was better. It wasn't."
3.0,Shrinks after a few washes...
3.0,"Thick and warm, very good quality. However they run big, I put in the dryer, the pants shrunk and became a bit too short."
3.0,Very tiny and short
3.0,"Looks much more plastic than I had hoped. Not “realistic” at all if you are going for a scary look. But since it will be dark outside, this will do. Strong plastic smell so give it plenty of time to air out before using"
3.0,.Smaller than expected but cute anyway an.  No color changing or irritation to my ears .<br /><br />Update.  They broke in a month or two.
3.0,Came out of packaging with a strong plastic smell? The pant were very very long and even after washing filling the directions… the wrinkles never came out. Wouldn’t buy again or gift to others
3.0,"The hat itself is of excellent quality, strong and well-made. The straw color and the band make it look very stylish. And the fit is nearly perfect for my 61-cm head. The problem is the STYLE. The brim appears to be too wide, and then it is curved up so far that it looks a bit clownish. I feel like trimming off a half-inch all around the outside of the brim (if that were possible!) would make it a perfect summer hat."
3.0,"Let me clear something up for anyone wondering: the &#34;Italy genuine leather Light brown&#34; strap is NOT quick release. I was really disappointed when I received this strap and it wasn't QR after specifically reading through the questions and seeing the seller say that it was. Otherwise, the strap is nice, but I was really only interested in a QR strap."
3.0,Colors faded and wore our quickly. I work 3 days a week & this didn't last a month.
3.0,Extra large was tighter than I expected. These run very small. Will wear under another shirt.
3.0,Good for .22 .380 and stuff of that range still got ringing in my ear from .223 and 7.62 but good comfy fit just need more installation material for higher calibers.
3.0,I tried this shirt because I thought it was cute and the price was right. I ordered larger than my size but it is still way too small. My size wouldn’t fit. The fabric is very this but in the south that is welcome during summer. I would hesitate to order if you don’t want to have to return if it doesn’t fit.
3.0,I ordered an XL but got a XS instead. I couldn't wear it at all but I'm sure if it was the right size the costume would be perfect
3.0,The glasses are super cute and it’s nice that it came with a sleeve to protect them but there is white paint or something on the side of my pair. That was disappointing.
3.0,could be better.
3.0,Very pretty  thanks!!!
3.0,It’s pretty and what I was looking for but it STINKS. That is not a slight odor.
3.0,"This is a nice hat but its hard and doesn't have much give.  I found it uncomfortable so I returned it.  It's very well made, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,Feels off brand from other fantasie bras. Parts squeak
3.0,"Band looked good. I wore it for a few weeks and got compliments.  Band is super easy to adjust because each link is a latch.  However, the latches came open easily.  Also, I had to disengage the password protection on the apple watch because if it was loose enough to be able to latch one handed (which seems  like a reasonable request of a watch band that you need to remove to charge every day), it would lose contact with skin and require re-entry of password.  Ultimately bought a new band because of the unlatching problem.  I was worried I would lose or break watch."
3.0,"I had an issue w fit on all of these.  shoulders, chest. I also had a problem with the zippers not being durable enough to get the started. The bulk of the material made it difficult for me to line in up"
3.0,Very cute but sized small.
3.0,"Cup size is way too small, but if you are an A or B cup it's got that Maralyn Monroe...Hollywood  feel."
3.0,"The style of the sweater is not what is pictured. The neck is much smaller, the waist is cinched, not loose, and the colored stripes are duller.  Disappointed. The quality is nice but it’s not what I ordered."
3.0,"Good quality, but not as soft as previous Hanes boxers.  I can feel the fabric netting rather than soft cotton."
3.0,My daughter loved the color however it ran about a half size too small and the material was super thin. My daughter felt like it was going to rip so easily. Wanted to love it but had to return it. Wish the material was better quality.
3.0,"I ordered several of these PJs because they feel so silky & comfortable. However, this pattern used different material for the bottoms—It’s not silky at all & doesn’t wash well."
3.0,I bought other shirts by this brand that all fit fine. This shirt was 2 sizes too small.
3.0,Cute but really small in the arms
3.0,My daughter loves the bracelet but it broke the first day. We were able to fix it but it was a disappointment.
3.0,Per my daughter who I bought these for.....Would have liked these to be thicker and also with more support.  They will be worn more as a lounging pant then something worn outside or to work out in.  They are a comfy pair of lounging yoga pants.
3.0,"These were recommended to me for tall, thin kids. But the waist is definitely standard size, not slim, and the drawstring is not functional. We’re returning them in spite of nice fabric and cute style."
3.0,I purchased these to offer as gift packaging to dress up items sold as gifts at a craft show. They are inexpensive and do dress up the items. The quality could be a bit better as they fray just taking them in and out of a baggie to put on display.
3.0,These earrings clasps are so tight that I can't open them. I got one opened and couldn't close it. Very tight. Not usable.<br />UPDATE - GREAT COMPANY. They contacted me and made it right.
3.0,Should have known that the dress was made of super cheap material at the cost I paid for it. Looks like the material of Barbie clothes...except for a human.<br /><br />I will say that the shipment and delivery of the package was super quick!
3.0,"Was a cute top, just a little tight in my shoulders and I realized that I can’t stand collared shirts on me. Just wasn’t comfortable enough for me to wear it the way I planned. Also couldn’t seem to pair it with anything other than black or white pants, so I couldn’t find much use for it personally."
3.0,Ordered a medium which is usually a bit baggy. This shirt was tight. I strongly suggest ordering up a size or two.
3.0,Es lindo el vestido pero es muy delgado
3.0,Got for my girls to play dress up. Did not take long for it to break.
3.0,"Comfortable, but Very snug. Can't go out of the house in it."
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE the sunglasses. It just took 3 follow up e mails to get them shipped out to me. The label was created and then it just sat for 2 plus weeks. After my 3rd e mail asking why it hasn't shipped yet they got it in the mail.<br />Great sunglasses, just be sure to watching tracking! That's why they didn't get 5 stars."
3.0,The pants were very small so order the next size up. The material is very thin and akmusee through. But would make for great pants to just sit around the house in.
3.0,Definitely has a cheap feel to it.
3.0,Great find especially if the bottom of the dress wasn’t stretched
3.0,Much too baggy and large in the hips and behind. Material is not as structured as shown in photos. Color is true tho.
3.0,Not the same cap as pictured.
3.0,"Color is accurate, I got them in mint. Size is very small. I normally wear an 8 1/2 and got a 9. Feels like a very snug 8. I'm concerned a 10 would be too big, so I'm just going to try to stretch these out."
3.0,"Looked nice. Appeared to be good quality but due to tightness in the thumb area, started unraveling after first wear."
3.0,"These shorts are ok for$10, but you get what you pay for. The fabric is very thin and they ARE see-through. Just holding the fabric away from my leg, I can see straight through it. There is no way I would wear these in a situation where bending over or squatting is going to be likely. The hem is tiny-- maybe 1/4"" -- and because the fabric is so thin, the legs creep up. The waist (on me) is nice and high in the front, but kind of weirdly low in the back. There are pockets, but they are very shallow. My phone mostly fits in one if I'm standing still, but there is no way I would do any sort of exercise with it in that pocket. It would be on the ground in no time. The material is nice and stretchy, although some of the stitching is sketchy: before I put them on, I gave crucial areas a preliminary tug and heard some threads snapping. I got these to wear under short summer dresses and they are very comfortable for that, and they probably should be marketed as an undergarment, because the fabric is more suited to that purpose. They are comfortable enough for that, but I wouldn't recommend them for gym or, as the listing suggests, with a crop top and blazer. They aren't thick or stylish enough for that."
3.0,"Material is much thicker than appears. It doesn’t lay like that on the body. Runs a little smaller too. It’s pretty warm on the bright side, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,"It's a nice top but looks horrible, like a maternity blouse. A nice black belt fixed that though. I ordered an XL but usually wear an M and the XL fits nicely."
3.0,"You get a lot for the price but you also get what you paid for, they're pretty cheap and seem like they're about to break"
3.0,"Not the most comfortable pair of gloves I have owned. Feels sort of ""stiff"". They do the job of keeping your hands warm, but I wouldn't recommend them for the price."
3.0,Pretty dress just not what I needed
3.0,Runs wayyyyy too small
3.0,No plastic to prevent paper insert from wear. Also plastic rings are cheap and easily come undone. Disappointed.
3.0,"A couple of them broke straight out of the package, but the ones I did use are good."
3.0,Not used to all the colors
3.0,Not thigh high
3.0,"Capris are my go-to choice for exercise bottoms.  I like that they keep you cool but do not show too much either.  This pair caught my eye because I love the great space-dye design.  My exercise wardrobe most consists of all black capris and yoga pants, so I thought it would be fun to have some variety.  When the capris arrived, they appeared to be much smaller than I was expecting.  When I put them on, however, they stretched to fit as expected.  I like the ruching along the calf and the overall print.  What I do not like about these capris is the feel of the fabric.  It felt like I was only wearing tights, as in hosiery, not running tights.  I inspected them from every angle and will say that there was no show-through, so they are not too thin, despite the feel of the fabric.  Ultimately, I decided to return them because I just did not think the fabric was doing this middle aged rear end any favors, despite many, many squats."
3.0,"The earrings are very pretty but somewhat small, smaller than the picture you show on the site."
3.0,"I purchased this as a “wear over” top for chilly days. In that sense, the size was perfect, even if I wore a t shirt instead of a cami underneath. The fit is bulky, not a bad bulky but a soft, “well worn” bulky...the sleeves were actually even long enough to wear down around my hands. (It would be easy to open a side seam and add a thumb hole, just a thought). The bottom hem is a bit odd, but it’s workable. Be sure to check the images closely to get a good look. The sewing is good, nothing stellar but it’s a casual shirt. My bigest problem was the color. I expected a darker rose but instead the shirt bordered on pastel pink....not exactly my color, but I’ll keep it. I’d order more if I was sure of the colors but for now, I’ll wait for better color resolution photos."
3.0,It's to big. I thought it was smaller.
3.0,"I liked it, however no matter how tight it keeps slipping off. I had to stop using it for fear my glasses would fall."
3.0,"Does not look like photo, as it is not purple. It is see through, but very elegant 3D design, which I do like very much. But the photo is not what you will be getting. Sorry I don't have ability to load a photo"
3.0,"I work in a warehouse climbing ladders and abusing my feet everyday. I go through work boots at a steady pace. At the time my last pair separated at the sole, I didn't have a lot of money to replace them. I tried Workboot Warehouse, but couldn't find a pair of boots in my size for under $150. I hit up Amazon and got the Rockports for something like $40. I gave them three months to live. Well, its been about twice that time now and they've just started to wear out.<br />The leather itself has developed holes, though the stitching has held firm. I threw an $18 pair of insoles in these shoes and that really helped. These are okay boots. They did what I asked of them and have lasted twice as long as I thought they would. I'd say that if you need a pair of boots for light-duty, occasional physical work; or possibly a boot to hike in from time-to-time, these would do you well. Or, if you were in my spot and needed a temporary fix between workboots to tide you over, they did okay."
3.0,I would have preferred them to fit like the Fila Sport sock.
3.0,Have not worn this watch much.  Also bought a different model  I wear more often. Both work great.  Four star rating is based on expected  service if as durable and accurate as previously owned Casio wathes
3.0,"This product is super stylish, practical and was very functional up until a few days ago when the zipper teeth stopped catching. Now, until I can order a new wallet, I have to tread very carefully for fear of everything toppling out since it can't zip closed. I've only had this one for about six months, so I'm not sure I feel it's worth it to order another of these."
3.0,"A little bigger than I like, but seems like a good pair of sunglasses."
3.0,Usually wear a med. Ordered large. VERY tight.
3.0,Had to return. Too small. Seemed like good quality.
3.0,It was a pretty necklace and cheap at that. Overall I am happy with this product.
3.0,"The Bag is really nice but it is heavy!  I was looking for soemthing lighter weight to help off set soem of the weight of the contents and this just added to it.  The capacity of the bag and the quality of leather is good it isjust a little to heavy.  The Strap length makes carrying it awkward as well... a little short to carry comfortably over the shoulder and a little too long to comforfortably carry like a handbag.  Althought the bag looks nice, I probably would bnot have purchased it had I had the opportunity to see it in person."
3.0,"Simple, this is a very sharp looking coat; however, it runs at least 1-1 1/2 sizes too small. I wear a medium in clothing so I got a large in the coat  and it was too tight around the arm pit and chest area. Even though it gives you the chest measurements, still go up a size. That is if you want to be able to wear something underneath it. Beware."
3.0,Will have to wear this one as nightgown. Not the best quality. Didn't pay much so I don't really care.
3.0,not too small but they're  too darn short - i hate pants which do not fall below the ankle - my own fault - i didn't check enough - someone will like them
3.0,Great product but the pearls are so small
3.0,I love the top. Very cute and supportive. I will not be able to wear the bottoms. They are cute but VERY CHEEKY ( hardly covers any of the butt).
3.0,The dress is beautiful! Yet the arms are too slim for my arms could not fit the arms but everything was a go! I got the 14 which I typically wear.
3.0,"This shirt is so short, you could never tuck it into pants."
3.0,These are great shows shoes but they do not breathe well and After 3 wears already have an odor
3.0,"It’s a pretty cheap costume like jacket. The picture looks like it is a better quality letterman jacket. Runs small, so size up. My bf is usually a M/L. We ordered an XL and it just fits snuggly. He is 5’ 11 185lbs with wide shoulders. It is what it is for the price."
3.0,the latch that closes holds the wallet close doesn't have a crisp snap which is disappointing build quality other that this is good.
3.0,"Weird fit<br />Cute fabric, but it was just all wrong."
3.0,Not what I was thinking
3.0,"Don't be fooled by their sizing. I am a 2X in shirts, so I bought a 3X shirt for my upcoming surgery. It was SO small there was a 4-inch gap between the two sides of the front; there was no way to zip it up!  Whoever decided what amounted to plus-size clothing did not take into account that women have breasts. The plus sizes might be wider in the shoulders, but I don't believe most plus-size women would fit in their shirts. I should have paid attention to the fact that all of the models on their website are athletes."
3.0,"Length too long, sleeve is too long"
3.0,Turns fingers green after a week.
3.0,"Cute bows, headband is soft and fits my 3 month old nicely.<br />The mustard color is ugly and I'm not sure what it will match.<br />But my biggest complaint is the stitching under the flower, it  sticks out and left an imprint on my daughters head. I can't imagine that is comfortable."
3.0,"The only arguable evidence that this might be gold is the “K18” stamp, but otherwise I see no evidence that this is gold. It is definitely not heavy nor shiny enough to be gold. That being said, if you just want a cute accessory, this is the necklace for you, just don’t wear it overnight."
3.0,Gloves appear better quality in the picture but in person is another thing.
3.0,"Fits very snug, the white with flowers is see-through."
3.0,Much shorter than it looks in the pictures. It sits on my collar bone but the quality is good and the stones look nice.
3.0,"It took awhile for it to arrive, but they are okay."
3.0,I like everything else.
3.0,"This came direct from China, but since so many things are made there it probably doesn't matter; has no tags except one small tag w/ ""M"" for medium so I don't know what it is made of, my guess is polyester; fits more like a small than a medium, it is wearable for me but snug; but having said all that it is cute and I like it. Don't know yet how it will hold up, washes up well. We mostly hang our dark permanent press clothes to dry so don't know if it would handle being dried completely."
3.0,I love the earring but the backs are so tiny I lost one of them trying to put the earrings on for the first time. I need to buy better backs before I can wear them
3.0,"Shoes are simple just like I wanted them, unfortunately sizes are small"
3.0,It is very cheaply made. The light up concept is adorable but the material they use is cheap.
3.0,"Broke the VERY FIRST TIME I put it on, and one ball fell off.<br />Quite disappointed.  Will gather packaging to return. Refund expected."
3.0,"I give it 3 of 5 stars because the fit isn't exactly as expected. The sleeves are a lot shorter and the length as well. It fits well across chest and shoulders, but still looks like an adult wearing a child's shirt as opposed to an adult shirt that's cropped<br />The color is not as described. It appears black and teal, but the actual colors are baby blue and navy.<br />I'm 5'8&#34; and weigh 124lbs. I bought the M"
3.0,I love this pin.  I purchased this for my nephews wedding and when I went to put it on the pin popped off and I can’t fit it back.  I should have taken it to a jeweler while in Calif but I didn’t (my bad) and now I’m sorry.<br />Can’t return because it’s past date but order info was at home not with me.
3.0,These are fine but they create a lot of lint even after multiple washes. The fit is good and they are comfortable but the lint is a big detractor.
3.0,"I would have preferred for it to be longer, but I really liked it with leggings.  Material was soft and I liked the color."
3.0,"The plug itself fits great. The magnification of the design is almost not at all as you can see in the picture. I'm not mad, just disappointed. Maybe good for marketing because now I want to buy a different kind. Maybe stay with same brand since the quality is good, just poor design.<br />0G"
3.0,Not a fan of the design but fit okay. I would consider sizing up if you are bigger in the leg and butt area.
3.0,No instructions sent with it.  Had to look for online instructions
3.0,I am a mother of two and these were not very flattering for me. I have a little belly left over from my pregnancies even though I did loose the weight and these were not flattering at all. I can see me liking these before I had my kids. They simply didn’t work for me.
3.0,"Floppy, like just-came-in-from-the-rain floppy.  The leather band isnt secured and is annoying, but the hat does have some stretch so good for larger heads."
3.0,Doesn’t look like picture. I expected more layers of tulle.
3.0,6 were already broken
3.0,"I ordered large size which is my usual size, however the chest/top part is too tight. Perfect length for women's who is 5'2.  Quality is not what I expected, fabric is too thin, with excess thread along the seam line.  Price is too high for the quality of the shirt. 3 stars though for the floral design."
3.0,My drum kit is a Ludwig and I like the logo of the shirt. It was made for a guy and I knew that a medium would be too tight in the chest. I got creative with cutting up the neckline and sleeves. Now it looks rock and roll. I would have bought a woman's size if it was available.
3.0,"really nice quality, but too small"
3.0,"First to note, there is no bra piece . In the picture where the yellow is , that’s not included . That piece just sticks out . The hook and loop is decent . It props your bust up which I mean isn’t necessary but ok . The actual belly piece was too short for me and I have a short torso . I ordered a 2x and wear a 1x so go up a size . It’s a decent concept but execution is meh . I wish it pulled you in better"
3.0,"Buy this for your grade school grandson. Another reason to buy it is, to add to your Casio digital collection. The size is comical."
3.0,"Really liked the watch, one suggestion would be the numbers on the face or the lack of numbers."
3.0,Size ran very small and color wasn't as vibrant as the picture portrayed.
3.0,This is probably my least favorite Grace Karin piece. the material is such that once you sit down (and the skirt naturally will bunch at the waist and hips when in a sitting position) it stays wrinkled looking.
3.0,It works for what I want but I'm not really happy with the quality of the &#34;silver&#34; finish.
3.0,"It was a touch too big but the real issue are the straps! They are sooooooo long that when you put the dress on, it hangs down to your belly button.  I had to wrap the straps around a hanger twice on each side so it wouldn't rest on the bottom of my closet."
3.0,"The one they sent is not wide enough for standard watch, need to order wide sport model, but works well"
3.0,"I looks nice has good length, but is small"
3.0,"Not as tight as I would like, very thin fabric."
3.0,"I ordered thinking it would be a little big, but it was almost too small.  It is a very lovely dress, but will not be able to wash it, think it may be really too small then.  Will order larger size next time.  Thanks"
3.0,"I was very excited to get this dress in quickly with prime two day shipping. However, the size chart runs very small. I would definitely order two sizes up from average. I got the white version and it is very see through. Beautiful dress though. Wish I could keep it."
3.0,"Little disappointed, these are both short and thinner then I expected. I am returning the product. Note: the quality is fine, just not what I was looking for. I ordered a medium for my 5’6” 13 year old who is thin and they just are too small to keep. Too bad I ordered two pairs, will return the second one without opening."
3.0,Wasn't as nice as I expected cheap and not well made
3.0,"major pilling at rub points after just a couple months of wear, looks like I'll blow through a heel before too long. Would have preferred something thicker and more durable but they're not bad while they last. Nice colors."
3.0,"Material is good, and collar keeps it shape.. just a little big in the sleeves."
3.0,"First I think these are very stylish. I didn't notice any progressive, I don't know if that was suppose to mean darker or from the reader part. But the reader is like a bifocal. The first time Bob worn them they came apart. I was able to put them back together again did take a bit. So I would check all screws cause that was the problem. So with all that being said they worked exactly as they were suppose too. Bob wasn't having to take his sunglasses off to put his readers on. He loves them. I think maybe some better quality control. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
3.0,"Love everything about this except the zipper breaking after 1 month of wear. Had to get rid of it because having the zipper replaced cost more than purchasing a new one. Cute design, washed well, and baby loved it. Too bad!"
3.0,"The small is like an XL, way too big"
3.0,"I've got a bit of a thick neck (no shame) and found that only a couple of these worked out for me. The one that ties around multiple times is perfect because the size is customizable, but if you're like me and have a chunky neck, you might have to do a little tweaking with some necklace extenders that you can find at your local craft store. For the price however, they are trendy, and my friend appreciated the ones that didn't work for me. The quality isn't amazing but for the price I can't complain."
3.0,"Looks realistic in your halloween yard but is made (the broom) of cheap plastic.<br />So, just take good care when handling it."
3.0,The little link that joins the pendant and keychain came loose. Is kept on a bunch of keys and was the only link that came loose smh.
3.0,"WAY HUGER than expected.  Nevertheless, cute!"
3.0,"It's been a while since I ordered and tried theses on but I didn't like how they fit.. I'm 5""5 about 123 lb and I ordered small. They were snug in waste but baggy in the legs. I sent back.."
3.0,Watch band broke and is not very sturdy
3.0,The Velcro snaps began to fall off by the second day I wore vest! You get what you pay for.. not a good product 😢
3.0,"Not exactly as I envisioned. Stone was rather opaque as well as really very small. I bought it for my wife as a Christmas gift and she too was disappointed visa vi its cost and asked me to return it for a refund, which I did.  The refund process had a rocky start, but moved along smoothly, much to my surprise (I was surprised because when I called the vendor , the girl was even unable to find my order, which immediately caused a chill.)"
3.0,"These boots are adorable, my granddaughter loved them, but she wore them a lot for about 2 months and they look a year old. they start cracking and the medal toe bends. Would rather pay more for some that last. :("
3.0,I really like the design of this product. The reason why I didn’t give it four stars is because the quality of the fabric wasn’t what I expected
3.0,Too tight around head and hard to put on!! had to take off in the middle of the night...uncomfortable
3.0,"Very cheaply made, down to no liner for the private parts. Color stayed well after a few washes, but the bottoms pilled quickly."
3.0,Ordered the yellow bag and the color is actually more of a goldy brownish color. Not as attractive as in the photo. Listed as a light travel bag but is actually quite heavy. And after 1 day the smell is still pretty bad - almost like a barn. I’m sure It will air out eventually and I will use it but just not as nice as it appeared online.
3.0,"Love the look of the bag.  tight squeeze for my macbook air 11&#34;, adapter cord, notebook and wallet<br />Royal blue color is so pretty.  will use as a purse."
3.0,I liked the quality of the sweater but didnt like how long and big it was on me
3.0,the jacket was ok but the pants were too small
3.0,"Gloves were very stiff out of plastic Stiffness is expected with leather though. Rated low due to strange sizing & way too tight opening which was smaller than size chart<br /><br />Cons<br />Strange sizing - fingers are quite long. Easily an extra inch or even more.<br />Palms were small & very tight - not matching size chart ( size up & fingers will be double long, size down & way too tight)<br />Opening was too tight also<br />Tried stretching them by wearing around the house before gifting - but literally the fingers were so ridiculous long - couldn’t even grab something!  Likely they will loosen & soften with wear.<br />No gifting box- packaged in plastic<br /><br />Pros<br />price is good  for a real sheepskin glove<br /> leather is nice & smooth<br />cute detail button trim.<br />Glove covers some of wrist<br />- You might love these if you have extra long fingers with narrow palms or if you wear very long nails."
3.0,Cute but small in dimensions I thought they were larger but there not.
3.0,"Got this for the buckle aspect on dec.11th. Lost my first fitbit when button clasp popped off on ride at disneyland.Super comfy, loved design but came apart on the 24th  so i guess if only worn once in awhile might last longer but you get what you pay for here."
3.0,The picture of the sock does not reveal the constricting ribbing around the arch of the foot.  The ribbing of the cuff is much too tight.  Will not purchase again.
3.0,"While charming, these earrings are NOT murano glass, but standard green beads with delicate painted flowers."
3.0,This wasn't what I expected for the price. I bought this for my son and wasn't impressed. Neither was he. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.
3.0,"Pretty, but A LOT longer than they look."
3.0,These glasses are cute but easily scratched
3.0,I love the earrings but I gave it 3 stars because in the picture and description it shows wicker on the top of earrings too but mine came with gold on top and I’m not a big fan but I love the rest!!
3.0,"Some not very good quality, but for the price they are ok. Maybe just not what I pictured."
3.0,"Size I bought should be too big for me, which is fine, since using yoga pants for...gasp...yoga. But waist is about 2 sizes too small for me and legs are way, way, way too long.<br />Fit is random as hell.<br />Which is a bother, as the fabric is lovely."
3.0,"Had to give it to a teenager, sized more for misses sizes. Knockoff pink product."
3.0,Good quality. Runs big.
3.0,I like the right color but the Bow material is too hard
3.0,the fabric is light and I was expecting a higher grade of fabric
3.0,Love the earrings except they turn my ears green. Nothing a little clear nail polish won't fix. Note i am anemic and have very sensitive skin so unless this affects you I'd disregard my review.
3.0,It's a beautiful scarf it's just not silk.  Very disappointed that it said silk in the order information and then when I received it it's polyester.
3.0,Kinda tight i know its suppose to be a tight fit but its small tight it that makes sense
3.0,To small and to short.DISAPPOINTED
3.0,"Cheap looking dress that comes straight from China, I believe.  Very thin jersey.  I haven't been anxious to wear it"
3.0,"It's okay. Yes, it's layered, but it's rayon backed by rayon. I washed it once and it came out okay, but it probably only has a wear or two left before it pills. The length is nice. It's a cute dress for a dinner out, but I wouldn't save it for anything formal."
3.0,Not as flattering in person. Very frumpy fitting
3.0,"It seemed nice, but I expected it to last longer before wearing out. It might be good for welding, and for gardening it worked fine, but it wore through fairly quickly."
3.0,It’s good and warm for skiing or snowboarding. But the picture of the woman with it on did NOT help explain the product lol
3.0,Too small for my face but I like the style and the quality wasn't bad.
3.0,"The hat is super cute, but it arrived the day I was already on my cruise. I’m returning it. :/"
3.0,I usually order a size up on bodycon because I like them not to be skin tight.  This is one you would not want to do that with.  I think it is a cute casual dress for running around in during the day.  What I don't like about it is the way the shoulders are cut.  Your bra straps will show if you don't wear a strapless bra or go braless.  l cannot stand strapless bras myself especially for daytime wear.
3.0,Arrived on time but posts where bent flat. Husband had to straighten them. Not exactly straight but afraid they would break.
3.0,The print is so tiny you can barely read it
3.0,Nice slipper for the price. This last pair ran small though. Will give them as a gift now.
3.0,"The first time I ordered mine, came with black writing on a white apron as advertised.<br /><br />The second time I ordered mine, the colors were flipped.<br /><br />No consistency."
3.0,"Belt looks very fancy and nice, but husband has had it for about a month and it already has decent wear on it. Probably wouldn't order again."
3.0,"The diamonds in these earrings are very pretty...however the settings seem to be less than high quality.  I had some issues with the order, but the seller was very cooperative and helpful in an effort to resolve the issues."
3.0,Ordered black. Small was a little snug. 5’4<br />130lbs
3.0,"It fit great,and I looked elegant"
3.0,The colors were amazing. The only problem The adjustable wire for the nose was towards the left side of the mask. Had to throw one away.
3.0,"Nice quality material.  It fits, but looks too large on me; I guess it's the way it's made.  Will have to return item"
3.0,"Bought 3 pairs good while they lasted, film inside glasses wore off on all 3 pair."
3.0,"Like the product, goof length. Only com is that when I received the item some of the colored part was already wearing off and within few days for already starting to chip."
3.0,they are just okay they dont fit my glasses exactly but they work. i was quite annoyed they shipped from china i really hate waiting 2 months for some thing i need now. the quality of manufacture is passable.
3.0,"Purchased this for my 9 month old to wear to his brother's Batman birthday party. Super cute Robin outfit. But it runs a little small and is pretty slim in the legs... And as some outfits do too, this one drives me crazy because there is no middle snap in the crotch and therefore his diaper shows through... Would recommend as a costume but certainly not an everyday outfit."
3.0,I like the cut of the shirt and the color but I’m not crazy about the material. It’s definitely not wash and wear because it needs ironing after every wash. It’s made well but doesn’t hang or flow like it looks like it would..
3.0,I wasnt aware that it was made for toddlers. Its for very small wrists
3.0,Love the shirt but there are a lot of loose strings hanging off and the color looks nothing like the picture.  It is more of a goldenrod.  Not a fan of the color.
3.0,"These are comfortable great socks but I am disappointed that they do not last very long.  After a hospital stay I wore a pair of this type of sock in the evenings and the pair I brought home from the hospital lasted me 4- months or more.  These socks I ordered for summer being shorter but they last maybe 4-6 weeks a pair and are wore out, the tread is gone and holes are starting to form."
3.0,Don't expect high quality... but it is ok. Nice collor
3.0,"Tighter over the mid section than I wanted and if I ordered a bigger size, I would have had a lot of side boob exposed. This dress has found its way to the gift cupboard for someone  with a flatter tummy 😎"
3.0,I wanted to love these shorts so much but they are not true to size at all. They run very small!
3.0,The dress is very pretty but if it's very small. I can get in it but the skirt is very tight and has no stretch so when I sit down I feel like I'm going to bust it open. I normally wear a size 10 or a large. Order one size up.
3.0,I wore this jacket to a music festival and it looked amazing at night with all the lights. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because a significant amount of the sequins fell off after just one night to the point where I likely will not be able to wear this again. I’m disappointed because it looked so pretty and I got so many compliments! :/
3.0,The case itself is nice but the screen protector that comes with it is the same size as the opening so there’s literally nothing holding the clear plastic in place. It just falls right out. The directions were all in Japanese so that was no help either.
3.0,"wish there was a picture of them in an ear attached, they were much smaller than i wanted"
3.0,Cross is okay.  A little small.  Design was not that great in person.  Returned it.
3.0,I was expecting something a little bit smaller but it looks good
3.0,This is too big for a small.<br />The stomach sags and different parts sags too<br /><br />I’m 5’5 and 130 lbs
3.0,"It runs a bit smaller than the size. I can fit in the Largest of the sizes, yet this came a little bit smaller and is now useless. I'll have to give it away. Otherwise, the quality of the shirt is fantastic."
3.0,"I always like cuffed earrings, and when I saw this one that has a kinda native american flare to it I had to buy it. The only problem is they it is not shown in the picture is this piece has a small &#34;douchebaggy&#34; stone that resembles a diamond that quickly kills the native american look. It is an exellent price but now I am just looking for a way to remove that fake duchebag diamond"
3.0,"The material is not thin. A very thick material, was hoping it was thinner material"
3.0,"The material of this dress is heavy and soft and the pattern is beautiful. But at 5'4&#34; and 125# I could wear a small at least 3 times. So, so big, everywhere. I'd say the small fits more like an XL. Returning."
3.0,These were the only shoes that I bought it and turned the small size. It is not going to measure the size. But it is very nice and I am very sorry that it turned out to be small...
3.0,"I ordered a size 16. It is a size 10. They are cute and look fairly well made, but they are not even close to a 16. And are pretty short for a a size 10."
3.0,We were sent to left feet. Return and replacement request was easy. Waiting on the replacement. Slipper seems durable and comfortable.
3.0,"They were perfect for what i needed them for. However, they separated really quickly. I had to super glue the rest down because the closing side would fall out and then the picture. So many people were left with just the clear plastic on the key ring."
3.0,"A little small in the shoulders, very comfortable. Happy overall."
3.0,I was trying to duplicate the original finish like the boots come with by re-dyeing them the mahogany color then applying this oil. I did not like what this oil did to my boots. They made them super dark and oily looking so if your are wanting that look then this will do it. It's just not for me.
3.0,Big on my face
3.0,"The quality of the vest is so far so good but the size is incredibly small.  I bought the one with a XXL label on it, but it could hardly fit for my wife.  Cannot use it!"
3.0,it doesn't really shape anything the material is loose fitting and very stretchy so it doesn't really hold anything in very much its pretty much a glorified wife beater I wouldn't recommend it
3.0,Its not as dressy as I like but I can dress it up with a nice scarf
3.0,"Fits fine. On one of the chest cross sections, the pattern is almost non-existent. So I have one very flowery boob and one almost all blue one. It looks a little weird but with a jean jacket or something I don't think other people would notice."
3.0,I got the size recommended by apple but It just felt too snug for me. They do not make a larger size.<br />Besides being snug it went on easy and would be better on someone with a smaller wrist. It felt great the first few hours but after awhile it just wasn't right for me.
3.0,they are so/.so
3.0,I imagined the color to be darker -- I do not have much to wear with this color.  It is more an off red when the light shines through the fabric.  I embellished this hat with a gold broach.  It still needs work.
3.0,I do not remember this  so if it came to my home I am disappointed I like things that are memorable. If I had it sent to their home I was not told about it so must not have made a impression on them . Sorry nI can not say anything about it as I have forgotten it.
3.0,The hat was horribly wrinkled and smashed. So much so that it could not be used. Suspenders were okay. I returned the packet because the hat was needed as part of the costume.
3.0,I loved the quality but it was too small and it doesn’t come any bigger I’m very upsett
3.0,"Like the others, I received the wrong color shirt. It wouldn’t be that big of a deal except it’s a gift and the person I ordered for really wanted blue.  The sizing looks right though"
3.0,Too dark. Impossible to see while driving.
3.0,"This item came fairly quickly and it looks pretty nice.<br /><br />However... the way, or rather the place where the chain is connected to the pendant is off by about a mm or two. Thus two stars off.<br />With the chain attached where it is, it causes the quote part of the pendant to sit to one side so that about 3% of the edge of the quote sits under the moon part of the pendant.<br />It was a gift, however with the quote part not sitting in the center, its basically become junk. At $6 and coming form China (I believe) there is no sense in sending it back.<br /><br />Please note, everything else about the pendant is pretty solid."
3.0,They are cute just too big run big
3.0,Not a hug fan
3.0,"for all the guys out there either cheap or broke, this ring looks like you spent some bread for her..it actually is a good ring...shipping is forever, plan ahead or pay expedite"
3.0,"Pretty, more for a coin purse than anything else...looks good but not very practical for everyday use...doesn't hold very much"
3.0,"Nice color, fit slim fabric is sheer"
3.0,Arrived on time but fits small
3.0,These panties are constantly going up my butt crack and it's not comfortable at all. They fit. They're not too small. They just ride up.
3.0,Dress was cure but Medium was very big and lots of fabric. So I ordered a Small and it was drastically smaller. Tight everywhere. Sizes should be closer. Returned both.
3.0,HAVE NOT WORN YET BUT A LITTLE TO SMALL!!
3.0,"These just seemed way smaller than in the picture. I felt like they did not go down at all. They were also really thin and I felt like everything would be showing (not a good look for me after 5 kids). The material is stretchy and does seem high quality. It is a good deal for three of them. I am letting my teenage daughter wear them for her in the house exercises. So I think they can work, depending on what you want them for."
3.0,I didn't think it ran true to size and still waiting for my refund to go back on credit card after 6 days.
3.0,Super cute.  Kinda thin.
3.0,The look of the dress is very nice. I’m very disappointed in a couple of things. I ordered the mid calf length but it fits all the way to the floor.  The neck was supposed to fit off the shoulders but it’s so small that there is no way it will fit off the shoulders  It’s going back
3.0,Not as much stretch as I expected. These were meant for a 5'5&#34; 125 lb woman and they were tight and not as stretchy as I expected.
3.0,"I'm not so sure about this dress. It's not ideal to my pattern of dresses that I buy. I liked it because of the fish tail look but the top part has to much material. It's the neck line, it's a bit much. Might return it."
3.0,I returned them as they are HUUUUUUGE! I like big sunglass but these made me feel like I had bug eyes.
3.0,"This scarf has very soft and beautiful coloring, however a thicker material than I thought.  For wearing with a blazer and shirt, as I intended, I felt it would be uncomfortable and too warm."
3.0,"Shoes are cute, but run at least a size small. Size 4 was smaller than all of our size 3 shoes that are now too small."
3.0,very pretty but the fabric seems a little thin and probably needs more spandex in it. It is not as form fitting/tight as it should be.<br />you can get a size smaller than you usually wear but I didn't think it helped. Material will never be form fitting.
3.0,They run small. Not fitting in as described.
3.0,"I really liked the design of these, however I was disappointed when I received them. I had to return them due to the stud aspect of the earring that goes into the ear, which appeared to be slightly larger than normal stud inserts. Additionally I noticed what appeared to be tarnishing on the pair I had revived. They are packaged nicely and I would say give them a chance and see for yourself, you can always return them if you don’t like them."
3.0,Very crooked when worn. But they were super cheap so you get what you pay for
3.0,Doesn't  make me feel as secure as a regular bra. Did not work well for me for support
3.0,My baby likes it because its fun to see the ears going up and down. it fits well and its very soft but it doent feel to warm especially on windy days
3.0,It is much bigger than I thought and a little difficult getting used to wearing such a big bag.
3.0,"The fit is great- I gave a long torso & this works perfectly. Sleeves are cute caps, color is as shown. Material is not soft like higher end workout attire but light weight for warm weather and not sheer. Satisfied"
3.0,"I purchased this because I love opals and I loved that the shape is the same as the AA/Alanon symbol.  I am a big fan of minimalist jewelry and was excited when I ordered this piece. Unfortunately, this necklace just doesn't really work. While the length and diameter of the chain are nice, the gold tone is much too brassy. No one will confuse it for actual gold. Ever. The biggest issue though, is that the triangle has no weight to it. It is so light that it doesn't hang properly. I was constantly adjusting the necklace as it very easily twists around backwards. If you can get it for $10 or less I'd say go for it, but for any more than that you will likely be disappointed. While attractive, it simply isn't a high quality piece."
3.0,Cute dress but lacks shape.  Good for very casual settings
3.0,The sweater was very soft but also 2 sizes too small. Very disappointed because o really liked it. Maybe I can find someone who would like it!!
3.0,too tight at top
3.0,Material feels kinda cheap. Collar area is a lot thinner than in the pic. Seems like a knock off of the one pictured
3.0,Fogging is the issue here. They look cool but they fog up. If your looking to use them for your 50 meter then they wont last to the last 25. If you can't swim the 50 then they might be ok for you.
3.0,Doesn't Stay charged long
3.0,"While these are of good quality, I order these specific ones because they show the smaller ones. While I know they are meant to be an assortment, I usually receive lots of the ones pictured by the various vendors. In this case I only received 5 of the kind pictured and none of the others in the picture. None of the largest one and none of the 2 smallest which is what I really needed for my project. I did receive an array of others in various types and sizes shown in the 2nd picture. BTW, I ordered 2 bags and both had the identical contents."
3.0,"The fit was a little small, unlike other Breezies bras."
3.0,Same product my optometrist carries.
3.0,The material is very thin. It runs small and is tight in upper arms.
3.0,Overall quality is great! The top is true to size but the pants are HUGE! Super cute but the pants were way too big for my daughter.
3.0,"I say this fit as expected but that’s because I read the reviews that said these run very small. I normally wear size small in leggings but these are size large and fit well. Slightly loose but that’s fine because the material is VERY thin, see through, and cheap. A little itchy. I am okay with this, I love the design and planned to use these only at home where it doesn’t matter if someone can see through my pants."
3.0,Drawstring breaks after two weeks of use
3.0,"Cute devil horns and red face jewel mask.  The horns aren't the highest quality but they do the job. The headband for them is very lightweight and doesn't stay on my head well, I have to pin them in to get them to stay put for longer than a few minutes. The face gems are super cool, love the bright red color!"
3.0,cheap looking but you get what you pay for. It does the job.
3.0,Earrings are beautiful! The other reviews were accurate as far as the backs coming off easily.
3.0,"This is a nice henley, but fits a bit large, even for american standards. When compared side by side with other brands, it is between a medium and large."
3.0,The shorts fit as a smaller size as advertised. The quality is also low.
3.0,"They're somewhat small. I may give them to my niece, she's 8 they'd look appropriate in her ears. They just look silly in mine. They also make my ears itch a little bit. Not too sure if they're really as nickel free as they claim."
3.0,Pretty shirt but did not wash well. Garment shrunk some and seam twisted a little.
3.0,"Good price, but 1 of the 3 was poorly sewn. And there were different zipper togs on each, so materials and quality were not consistent. One zipper tog feels very frail and flimsy."
3.0,"it's odd that they measure it in ""feet"" that being said it says ""3'2"""" waist on the mens small. That's 38"" people!!! I am a small woman and have a 29-30"" waist at most and I zipped up my skin trying to get it zipped, this has at most a 28-29"" hem/waist... so it's ""2'2"""" you left an entire foot off of the measurement, that being said, I have never had a mens small shirt not fit me...."
3.0,This was very snug (Ordered an XL) and paper-thin so I kept it and gave it to my 12 year old daughter to wear over her sleeveless summer dresses.
3.0,"Yes the top of the slippers are thick but that's it. I dislike that the heel parts definitely are not padded well at all! It's very thin for a slipper. I am disappointed with how the heels (on top, not underneath) quickly became worn only after a few uses. Colors are nice but I'm surprised they put yellow on the heels, will get dirty rather quickly. If you want to purchase them solely as a display item not to be worn then that would be fine."
3.0,Fun cheap bracelet.  There are a few stabby wires that had to be corrected with needle nose pliers.
3.0,"It looks beautiful BUT when I received the ring one of the stones was loose and I am afraid to lose it :(<br />Also the ring fits big and even though it is supposed to be adjustable, I found it really hard to squeeze it together."
3.0,Maybe it will look better when I put it on....but it is cheap material cheaply made.
3.0,I must have gotten the wrong size because it fit too big on my carry on. I love the pattern
3.0,"I bought this as a gift. Two weeks after, my friend told me the charms fell off."
3.0,Nothing special.<br />Seeems to be overpriced
3.0,This advertised model of boxers isn't the same as advertised and sold by Target stores. These boxers are just ok. They are the standard model. The Target version are the widest and softest waist band I've ever bought. The panel material is awesome. Save yourself the hassle and buy them @ Target
3.0,"These did not work as well as I expected.  I have several rings that twist around my finger and this was supposed to take care of that problem, but really didn't.  Hopefully, they work better for someone else."
3.0,Fits good but feels different than other shorts. Feels like I have 2 pairs on. Just takes a little getting used to.
3.0,It was cute to wear to my son's Mario birthday party but after one wash it shrunk a lot.
3.0,To thin of  material
3.0,A bit large and I wish that there was a way to actually adjust the tightness on these.<br />Once they are broken in I think they will be fine.I'm waiting to see how they hold up to wearing? I will certainly up my 🌟 star rating if they hold up and fit<br /> well.
3.0,"It was easy to attach, but too big for my wrist with no way to adjust it. Looks nice on the watch"
3.0,"The material of the shirt is not what I expected. It's like a stretchy/shiny material. I have workout pants that are the same material and it's great but it seems a bit odd to me on a shirt. I was thinking a normal tee shirt. Maybe its my fault for not reading the details close enough. I have not yet worn the shirt, I ordered it for work at a school so I will update if needed. Doesn't seem see through when I place my hand under the material. It fits a bit loose, it sorta hangs on me (when I tried it on)"
3.0,"They came on time and they seem like they will  work as described.<br />Unfortunately not on my sunglasses, might be the style."
3.0,I bought 2 of these.  The first one broke within an hour.  Not sure if it is repairable yet.  They are very pretty. The stones are really nice.  It is the rest of the bracelet that is not very durable.
3.0,"Really love the style...super cute cut outs but not overly sexy...kind of sporty looking.  But the material is cheap and looks like it would snag super easy thus ruining the top.  Also I have a larger bust (38C) which takes up all the room of the size 8 shirt and makes it super tight.  Wish they offered a larger size and better quality material.  Cute idea, but not so great execution of garment.  Sad.  I really wanted to like it."
3.0,"Most likely because of this price, this seemed more of a costume than a real dress fabric.  Gave it 3 start as my daughter was excited to have it."
3.0,"Unflattering, straps too short, not comfortable material."
3.0,very nice but I'm a size 4 and bought a large and it was too small in the chest area
3.0,"large loose fit. great cloths and good fit for me. the sewing isnt the best but it seems to be holding up better then i expected. its a thicker material. overall for the price, not a bad buy.<br /><br />~* I received this  tank top, at a discount in order to evaluate it and leave an honest review. When looking to buy a product i always read several reviews first, so while reviewing i try to leave as much honest information as possible to aid others in the buying process.

If you found it helpful, please let me know by selecting &#34;yes&#34; below."
3.0,"These socks are cute. These are great for me, I will wear them around the house and at night, because that is what I do. They fit well and I can wear these with my tennis shoes."
3.0,"I love the shirt, but ordered a large and received a small."
3.0,It's a nice jacket but the team logo is more of a plastic material and feels like it'll fall off after washing it a few times.
3.0,somewhat small for a size large
3.0,Fit on the small side and are not the best quality. Material feels weird to me.
3.0,"Seller was great to work with, but the product is lower than expected quality."
3.0,"Gosh, I wanted to love this romper.  It’s true to color and size — but the fabric is poor quality...so thin, I’m afraid to move too much and risk tearing it or catching it on something.  Save your pennies, girls, and resist the pull on this one - there are other rompers in the sea!"
3.0,It's really cute PRINT WISE the meterial in my opinion is cheap but I didn't pay alot anyway I got a extra large which is to big the shorts are huge had to roll them and the top I stretched it to fall off my shoulders I WORKED IT OUT🤷🏾‍♀️ BUY IT
3.0,The stretch on the waist was raveled up.<br />This has not happened with other ones<br />I have bought. Otherwise great product.
3.0,Cheaply made like all of things out of China but was not expensive.  You get what you pay for .
3.0,A bit narrow but overall great for the price.
3.0,The sleeves are short sleeves
3.0,"although the look and feel is reasonably good, each of the individual links had leftover pieces of plastic from the mold which limited the smooth articulation across the pins.this required that I take each and every link apart, and then use a fine diamond file to take down the excessive plastic. I then had to completely reassemble the band taking care to keep each link in order and lineup each of the link pins. Interestingly each of the pins is slightly longer then the next, so be careful that you don't confuse them. With all of this modification, the band is overall quite nice, very light and now that I have repaired it, it is a suitable companion to the Navy seal watch"
3.0,The dress is cute but it’s so thin it’s transparent. The sleeves are entirely too short and I’m 5 ft for reference. The dress itself fits nice but be prepared to layer under it and wear a coat because the sleeves will hit halfway up your arm.
3.0,Ran a little big and I returned it.
3.0,Flimsy needed stuffed with cotton to stand up
3.0,"I would not call it unisex, more directed for women. It was too big and fluffy for my liking, but my girlfriend saw it and loved it for herself."
3.0,I would have really liked these but the size is small and narrow and they don't come in half sizes or wider.
3.0,"Love the fit of these leggings and the fabric is shiny, thick and not see through. The only reason I’m giving three stars is because the black dye rubbed off on everything and stained my hands and light colored furniture. I had to wash them a few times before the dye stopped rubbing off."
3.0,The dress was pretty but the fabric was very heavy and it was too large.
3.0,This is a cute top but it definitely runs small.
3.0,The fit is great and it looks great but the fabric looks cheap.  If the fabric were nicer I would have kept it and added a few more colors
3.0,"This is not the orientation of the trademark ""Swoosh"" a pictured item nor is the cut similar to that of the pictured item. The fabric is not the same either. I have purchased the shorts as pictured, these are not them."
3.0,Way too long for me. Returned them.
3.0,It breaks (the string) easily so you'll have to be careful with it
3.0,"It served it's purpose.We only needed the jacket and we got 2 sizes up because it was slim and it just barely made it on.The pants were more like a med than a 3x, wouldn't go past his knees.He is  normally XL but we went for the 3x which should've ben a 4x for a better fit and the pants could've been a 6x"
3.0,Too small! This dress is super cute. The exact material I was looking for. Unfortunately I waited too long to order it and now I have no time to exchange for a larger size.
3.0,"This is a beautiful top and very well made. However, it runs so small. I normally wear a medium but I followed the size chart and ordered a large. The large is tight!"
3.0,"They are beautiful shoes but as a 9 and half, they were to tight for me to wear. They worked out great for my mom who is a 9."
3.0,"It's a bit sheer. But that's okay with an undershirt. I've always like sheer tops anyways. Not sure how to explain how it fit though. From the sleeves it's too large as seen in the photos. The top part fit okay, but below the bust towards the waist and end of the blouse it became a bit tighter. Not too tight that it won't fit and I can't breath, but when I sit it is a bit tighter (not saying that it's too uncomfortable to wear, just not to my taste) but on the correctly proportioned person for this shirt, It's a very nice blouse! But the fit is somewhat weird and off. I will likely have to take to get the sleeves adjusted. I will still wear, but most likely with a jacket blazer or cardigan."
3.0,"I liked the keychain, but it wasn't exactly as shown (black lettering). You could hardly see the writing. I was a little disappointed. I would give it a 2 1/2."
3.0,"This is the 3rd pair of ESPIRO Premium Mirrored sunglasses I have owned, and every pair has broken by loosing the left nose cushion. I love these sunglasses, and my first pair were replaced free of charge, so I was very happy with customer service. I ended up buying another pair, plus the replacement pair, and tight around the same time, both pairs that I had been wearing also lost the same left nose cushion. I'm hoping to get these replaced as well, and maybe they won't break this time!"
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up (I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs and usually a 6/8 and I ordered size 10) and it was a perfect fit (not skin tight, comfortably loose, but showed everything), so I am returning the dress because it wasn't a gorgeous or flattering color and fit on me and not the right dress for the occasion I bought it for). I may reorder another size up and another color another time as the quality of material and the sewing were impressive and that price was just fabulous!!"
3.0,"They are beautiful.  But.... I have had the similar problem where the post is too thick for my ear hole.  I did notice the stamp was not on the drop, but on the side. Took a long time for delivery, well over a month.  Still beautiful, gave them to a friend to see if she could wear them. K. P."
3.0,Love the hat but the buckle broke after 2 weeks while it was on my head.  Had to sew the strap to the hat.
3.0,"I’ve only been wearing this for a few months and somehow this piece in the clasp has popped out and been totally rusted around the edges.<br /><br />It does rub against my wrist and chafe if I wear it too long, but it has a good hold through intense workouts."
3.0,I didnt like how this dress looked on me
3.0,"Necklace is fine and looks nice, but I specifically bought it for my son to wear with a couple of charms and they do not fit on because the clasp is too large.  So overall, I am disappointed that I still have to find another cord or chain that will work.  He can only wear the necklace by itself."
3.0,"I ordered them one size up in red. I am excited about the lenghth. However , the overall fit is awkward.  The legs are cut narrow and the waist is about 3 inches too big. Therefore if I ordered another size up to fit my legs, I would have to get the waist tailored to fit. I am a true size medium long."
3.0,Adorable used it as a  costume
3.0,Very loose bit comfortable
3.0,These gloves are okay but I found a better quality at the beauty supply store. They're not necessarily elbow-length either as they fall a bit short. They are not Satin but more of a cotton material.
3.0,"Beautiful set, however it did not fit me well. I am pear shaped and wear a size 10/12. I ordered a large; The bottom was tight around the hips and short (it stopped above my ankles). It will work for ladies 5'5&#34; and below. The top was way too big for me. I attempted to make it work but couldnt so I will be returning it."
3.0,Shorts pockets go down way farther than picture and fits small
3.0,Poor quality control.  Some were useless because they had no threads on the end.
3.0,"I sized up two sizes and it fits a little loose and the length is up to my thights, I like the fit but the material is more of a polyester which is way hotter then cotton as advertised."
3.0,"This is a great bracelet, except that it is very loose and stretches quite quickly."
3.0,The material isn't ehat you would expect for a hoodie.  But it's OK I guess.
3.0,Darling style! Ran a bit big and the material is a wee bit thin but a good deal considering the price
3.0,"These are great, lightweight, and so soft. Only downside is the legs roll up without fail! Definitely just going out underwear and not workout underwear. Other than that they are good quality."
3.0,I like the velcro back strap. However i gave it a 3 because the nose bridge clip fell off.
3.0,Great fit very strechy fabric but the cloth was not a matte black it was bit too shiny. I’m 5’3” and weigh 178. The dress length was below the knee.
3.0,"Cute look, shirt is soft thinner material.  But design is thick, rubberish applique, or iron on.  Hopefully it won't peel easily.  Shirt runs small. Order a size up for comfort."
3.0,Love the way the bracelet looks but one of snaps broke after wearing it once. The &#34;leather&#34; started to peel off at the edges after just a couple weeks.
3.0,"It was delivered quickly, it's a very pretty ring but it's very lightweight. I'm keeping it but I won't wear it all the time because it seems a little fragile."
3.0,I liked the dress but was hoping for a shorter length. The length was mid-calf and I was wanting a just above the knee length as pictured. I sent it back.
3.0,"Not as dark as they looked, but fit good."
3.0,Didn't fit but was beautiful.
3.0,"Cute top. Only issue, the elastic at the shoulder is pretty tight so it comes up when you move and have to adjust every time. If not for that would give 4 star."
3.0,nice fabric ... I donated it
3.0,Looks cheap but ok for the price
3.0,"It's a scarf, it will work nicely for winter. But coloring is not as described. It's too much hassle to return it, but I was disappointed."
3.0,It didn’t fit well .
3.0,"The goggles are great and can seal successfully. There are the normal goggle adjustment straps. The thing is, the nose bridge is too big, even the smallest size.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend getting these unless you have a very large head"
3.0,"Fits great, but doesn't look like the picture"
3.0,Not the best hoodie fabric.
3.0,Product is poorly made
3.0,im keeping the white underdress. It is see through but I plan on wearing a Cammy under it. The over piece is a pain to keep adjusted. I ended up tossing it and buying a corset to go over the white dress.
3.0,"The color is not like the picture, more like a light peach and not pink. Some of the fringes were loose and tangled."
3.0,The reason for such low stars is that it runs so small. It’s almost like you have to size up 2-3 sizes. There is no stretch whatsoever. It’s cute though.
3.0,"The title of &#34;white plastic watch&#34; did not match the photo or description.  I took a chance that it would be the blue color, and was pleased that it was.  Oddly, the watch arrived with no manual/warranty, no paperwork?!?!?"
3.0,It’s a nice top but not as in the picture it’s a different pattern completely
3.0,"It seems poorly made, not high quality. Not bad enough to send back, but not good enough to buy more."
3.0,Way too long for me.
3.0,"sizes are misleading.  My wife loves Elephants but was tight across the chest,  not a good Present."
3.0,Fell apart. The leopard pattern fell right off of the earrings. Will glue them back but not held together well. Otherwise pretty set
3.0,Next time I'm not gonna buy just because it's pretty. Definitely not enough to protect from a clumsy toddler. I've bought 2 other cases at the same price point that were really good quality. This one is super thin and flimsy. The image is pretty much a sticker. Overall just not very good quality.
3.0,Did not have the  look I was thinking it would flatten stomach more n did feel it was to long but did not go all the way to pelvic area disappointed but a low price
3.0,They are nice but I didn’t notice the s on queens when I purchased … would look beautiful if the S was not there !
3.0,made not as pictured pleat was crooked nice otherwise
3.0,keeps opening up hard to keep closed
3.0,"Looks nice but I received it without a box, so I wasn't able to present it as a gift until I went out and bought a box, but it didn't fit perfectly looked funny. In the end, not coming with a box included, took away from the value of the product."
3.0,"They are cute enough. But I ordered them to use as a lip ring, and they were way too short for that. I don't have thick lips by any means, and they only went 1/2 way through for me."
3.0,The straps are not big enough for adults to properly wear them and not hurt the back of their ears.  I have a small head and it was difficult for me to put them on my glasses and then fit it on my face.
3.0,"Very interesting long sleeve shirt.<br /><br />Made of a waffle like material, very stretchy. Lovely color.<br /><br />But, I didn’t realize it has to be hand washed. The instructions go on to say that it’s recommended to dry clean. Not a big fan of things that have to be dry cleaned. I’m a little confused because it’s made of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex. Not sure why it has to be hand washed or dry cleaned."
3.0,"This is one of the ugliest colors ever created, mud brown.  It does cover any problems.  Wrinkles quite a bit."
3.0,I would like more protection for the pants
3.0,The glasses arrived packaged nicely including a case and key chain with a screw tightener. These details would make me want to order from this company again. I did return the glasses along with the extras because the plastic was very light and seemed they could break easily.<br /><br />If you are just going for look these are the glasses. They are very cute.
3.0,"The bra is fine, but the size did not fit me. The waistband was only snug (not tight like most sports bras) and the rest of the bra was too loose. I am a 30A so that's probably why."
3.0,Much smaller than i thought.
3.0,"This swimsuit arrived yesterday and I was very eager to try it on. I ordered the large and it did fit well, however my DDD's did not fit so nicely.  The neckline is already plunging,  which did not help in my situation,  but they also were spilling out from the side since the back is wide open, and there is only an extra tie under the chest for support.<br /><br />The material feels nice and it seems like a very sturdy and good quality suit. The style is definitely my type, especially the polka dots. The color is very pink for what is labeled as red but that was fine by me.<br /><br />The skirt does not cover your behind; you can fully see the bikini bottom, it just covers the front area.  I would have liked for that to be a little longer.<br /><br />Overall I really did like the look of this suit, just not on my body type. I'm a little bummed out by that but oh well, there will be other swim suits. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Kind small  did not draped the way I wanted it too. I thought about ordering the next size up.
3.0,Arrived extremely wrinkled. And is 2 sizes small. The quality was probably good but  hard to tell because of the wrinkles.
3.0,I don’t like how bulky the gloves are and they aren’t as warm as advertised. The touchscreen function also doesn’t work because of how bulky the gloves are.
3.0,It's nice but too tight
3.0,Fit better on an adult.
3.0,"I mean,  the pants are very nice.  I wanted them to work.  But the smallest size was too big.  They're very comfy,  nice fabric. I'm not a fan a high waist though.<br />I'm 5'3 115lbs. They were way too big."
3.0,"The band is beautiful, looks nice, and is easy to wear. But, as mentioned in other reviews, the pins fall out. Two days after putting it on, one end lost its pin in the grocery store. No chance of finding it there! I plan to buy some extra pins and keep this for a backup. I bought another band right away that had integrated pins and they have stayed in place so far."
3.0,"I like them because they do keep me warm during this winter season in Boston. However, the fit is loose, and becomes even more when I use them all day and with movement. I wish they are a bit more snug."
3.0,"It is extremely big, very cute with tights and boots, would have given it a 5 but it is WAY BIG!"
3.0,"The gown itself seemed fine, but the size was way off.  I ordered 2 XL, even though I usually wear large/ extra large.  This was so tight I couldn't get it over my boobs.  And as I am tall, the neckline dropped to the non sexy level of upper chest."
3.0,Run extremely small!! Order up at least 2 sizes!
3.0,My sister is large size but she tried it on it was small . This is more of a medium size fit.
3.0,"It's a cute necklace and earrings. My daughter was so excited. Just a few hours of playing around, the sunflower came right off. :("
3.0,"These gloves are comfortable and easy to put on and off, but they are not warm"
3.0,"4- black looks charcoal in the picture but is actually black black. I wanted it tunic length for leggings, but it's loose and not long at all. I'm 5'5 / 170 lbs and ordered XL. The fabric is very comfortable, but not sure I'll keep it since it's not the length I expected"
3.0,Case was very pretty however I had to remove the chain since everyone complained they could hear it through the phone rattling.
3.0,"It seems okay, except I didn't realize it was a used item. It seems more than slightly used as well. Packaging was opened and it was fairly wrinkled. There's also a flap with recycle information bulging out when my cards are in it."
3.0,It’s nice but it’s not the same as pictured. It’s a little cheaper of quality looking.
3.0,It was an okay dress. It fit me but the pockets stuck out and made my hips look bigger than they are so I returned it.
3.0,"I could barely fit my cell phone in the purse as the opening is smaller than the actual length, so I had to return it."
3.0,"Harley ring. Sterling silver, beautiful but sizing is way too small. I returned for refund and they sent another.....too small!"
3.0,"The material was nice, but this shirt did not fit right. The front criss cross had to much slack, it was baggy. But at the same time, it was so high that it bothered my neck. I ordered the same style in the Amoretu brand and it fit perfectly. Just wish they had this pretty purple color."
3.0,This dress is not as thick as I thought it would be. Not very flattering unless you are pretty skinny. Pretty design though. L
3.0,Company did a great job in advertising however I didn’t notice any difference in clarity and i thought they were Al little small for adult sunglasses. Then again I i didn’t pay much for them and I’ll stick to being able to try product in before i buy. Did it this one time and I pretty much donated money. I will say they come in a nice box and were delivered a day early than expected and craftsmanship was up to standards for the price.
3.0,"The outer pouch is just barely big enough for my phone, but I only needed this for getting through TSA for my job. It's big enough for my wallet, keys, and meds, but not much at all more.<br /><br />Great product, deceptive marketing."
3.0,"This scarf is very pretty. My only complaint is that the description says &#34;Butterfly Print&#34;. It does not have butterflies on it, only flowers."
3.0,Top is tight in the armpits
3.0,And flimsy.
3.0,item stretched quickly after few uses
3.0,"Cute but runs massively large, had to return"
3.0,I bought this shirt for my mom because she gets hot and cold. The fir is nice and she can pull the sleeves up if she gets warm.  Thank you
3.0,"It's very cute, but it does not fit as described and I got the largest size offered."
3.0,The design for as small as these are is very nice but be aware that for an adult they are small. I'm wearing them in my third hole. Good for 'day of the dead' celebration.... If you want small.
3.0,Super cute loved them! Only problem is the back fell off within a matter of 2 days so I lost the earring.. totally bummed out. Wish they would make the backs tighter.
3.0,"I purchased the stainless steel mesh band.  The band is more like 3.5 stars. It was easy to put on and easy to change the length, but it doesn't have the look of well built, stainless steel. It really looks more like aluminum. I paid $24.99 & I feel like that was about $10 too much. Doesn't look bad, per se, Hurst doesn't look or feel like there best quality."
3.0,So adorable but holy cow. It came in a sealed bag that was dry as a bone. But when I opened it it is wet and smelled like urine. Washing to hope it comes out but that is so wicked gross!
3.0,"Like the colors, read size chart, runs small"
3.0,Kinda snug but will get the job done
3.0,"This is looks pretty sweet, but fell apart after the first week of wearing it.  First one of the braided cords came out, then the side unraveled and by the end of the week the whole thing came apart.  Rated this a 3 because I like the style, but until the manufacturers improves the quality of this product, I don't recommend purchasing it."
3.0,"The end of bracelet (where is in NOT shown in the picture) is hard wire that is uncomfortable and actually digs into my skin, leaving marks every time I wear it."
3.0,"My wife ordered this, it arrived on time, she says it's nice, but not at all the color shown in the picture, it's not red, it's mauve, she was very disappointed because she ordered it for family pictures."
3.0,The shirt material is very light. You need to be very careful to not get it caught. I ordered a large and fits like a small.
3.0,"The bracelet engraving is much smaller than expected and it is hard to slide the heart clasp open up and down. Will probably need help putting it on. Overall, just ok. The black is not shiny or anything so it doesn't look very feminine. Good look for a teenager maybe, but not me."
3.0,"Dress is ok. The material is cheap. Upon opening/trying on, the dress smelled like glue or something??  Will see if the smell lingers after washing. Overall, ok dress for the price. Could use as a swim coverup if anything."
3.0,"These joggers by Vivienne are worthy of 3.5 stars. Why?<br /><br />1. The material is soft, although thin.<br />2. They are comfortable.<br />3. The waistband is wide and can be (a) folded down or (b) gathered.<br />4. They fit true to size or I would suggest sizing down if I were honest. These are also nice since they can camouflage problem areas like the hips, stomach and thighs.<br />5. The jogger legs are flattering and feminine.<br />6. They don’t have pockets.<br /><br />In conclusion, I can only give these a 3.5 because while the material is soft, it is mostly rayon which means after a few washes, they look a little worn. But in terms of laying around the house or running errands, these can be your go to pants."
3.0,really like the length of this chain as well as the charm. got a lot of compliments on the look. Would definitely recommend to other people
3.0,Padding at top against leg is no where’s near enough painful to wear u til more padding added. No instructions on tying them on just give you straps.
3.0,"I still use them, not for the purpose I night them. They’re smaller than what I expected"
3.0,Fit me a bit snug. I do like it but I better not eat wearing it!!
3.0,I had ordered them before so knew what I was getting
3.0,"I absolutely love the look of the watch, but the clasp is horrible.  It takes some effort to shut it and I'm scared every time I try to open it that I'm going to break a nail."
3.0,"The shirt is 10% linen and 90% cotton. What this means is this is not a linen shirt. Second, if you order a small the shirt you receive should have a &#34;M&#34; tag for medium (Asian size). If you order an extra-small the shirt tag will say &#34;S&#34;. Third, the sleeves are too long (for me). Fourth, the shirt looks okay and is thin and bit see through which is not bad becuase I want to stay cool. I will add further comments when I test this shirt during the heat this weekend and compare it with a 100% linen shirt."
3.0,"Writing is a little small, actually the entire face was a bit smaller than expected."
3.0,Nice ring but over all not that great. The stone came out when the ring fell off my finger and hit the floor. So l'll give it 🌟🌟🌟
3.0,"Part of what I liked about this necklace was the bow. When I received the necklace, the bow was about a third the size of the one in the picture. It is an inexpensive necklace and will work, but is slightly misrepresented in the photo."
3.0,"The top is very loose, unless you have a super big chest."
3.0,"This dress is okay. I’m 5’4 and 150lbs and the large was not very flattering. It was also longer than I expected. It came to my knees. I’ll probably keep it to wear to church or something, but it’s not what I expected."
3.0,"Neato! Glasses came bent, or would be a 4 star review."
3.0,Way too small.  Says adult size but the fit is too small.
3.0,"The dress is cute but the material is a little thin & the top is not actually denim like the description  says. Also the buttons were loose, I plan to remove  them & sew them back on tighter. I did purchase this with a discount code & honestly I would have been more disappointed if I had paid full price."
3.0,"While it’s a good prop especially for the price I was a bit bugged by the fact that while I ordered a size 8, what I got is very nearly a size 9.  The picture shows my ring on my mandrel. That being said, it’s sturdy and since it’s not for everyday wear it won’t get wet and should last plenty long enough for me."
3.0,Not sheer but you'll wanna play attention to what you have on under it.
3.0,Fits great but looks cheap.
3.0,It is OK for that price
3.0,Cheap product. Will not last very long with aggressive usage. Lots of frayes
3.0,"If you order this, pay particular attention to the sizes- these are not American sizes- an 8 is considered X- large.Calling this a &#34;sweater&#34; is a bit of a stretch-This isn't really knitted, it's a polyester fabric made to look knitted. the craftsmanship is shoddy- none of the seams are finished off (only sewn once.) Still, if you are looking for more of a t-shirt, it's cute.  It's very trendy, so , style-wise, you'll probably only get a year out of it anyway.  I received this at a discount in return for a review, and , all things considered, I'm happy I didn't pay full price!"
3.0,"This apron is adorable, but I would have loved it even more if it were made from a better, more durable material. It is very thin and it could easily rip if caught on anything."
3.0,Too boxy looking. Not long like pictured
3.0,la litle large
3.0,Es mala calidad y muy mala cofeccion
3.0,Tamaño y calidad no muy adecuados
3.0,Very comfortable.. it's not a full shirt it is a bra with overlaps but still really comfortable and cute
3.0,Very thin material--hoped for winter wear.  Ill have to add a turtle neck or something under it.
3.0,"They're a bit large for my four year old daughter. They are not adjustable, either. They fall off of her face constantly, so she just doesn't wear them very often. I'm going to try and get something to put on the sides to hold them on her head better."
3.0,"runs small, the quality is about what you'd expect for a $20 dress"
3.0,I need to return it as it doesn't fit the breast
3.0,My waist is 24 inches & does not fit. It folds on top of each other to fit me. I wear size 2-4 in jeans for reference. Cheap material
3.0,"This product looks just like the photos. Soft, stretchy and good length. Because of the spandex in it, it pulled across my big bottom and created an unflattering look in the front. I was looking for some sleepwear that covers everything for a group trip. This was not it for me."
3.0,Not like they said.
3.0,"Got for my son, they were cute, but looked a little cheap and with out a velcro strap..its not that great of a fit"
3.0,"I HATE ordering bras online... I order the same size and yet I'll get to big, or just right so I was hesitant and odder this and it's to small 😔. It's very tight and that's with it on the Last notch."
3.0,Absolutely love the artwork. Size is a liiiiittle snug. Screenprinting is a little blurry and is already deteriorating after two washes. But it's such a cool tshirt that I don't care.
3.0,Probably better if you have a butt. The jean material is stiff. Quality was ok. Will need to broken in.
3.0,Too tight at the neck. The top It’s self is uncomfortable fit I like the colors but the design didn’t work well for me in my body type I never have any luck with these two piece outfits
3.0,Very cute and the price was good but the gold is not what I was expecting and came off as a little too “gold” if that makes sense.
3.0,Very tight on my head and is itchy. Even washed it a few times- still itchy.
3.0,"My five year old son really loves this outfit.  He loves paw patrol and has made friends at school who like paw patrol because he wore the outfit.  However, after he wore it a couple of times the seem at the armpit came undone.  Some of the surged stitches came loose.  Luckily my mom sews and fixed it but it should have lasted longer than that before it needed repairs."
3.0,I bought a XXL and I am a size 14/16 pants because I have a big butt and these are somewhat small on my bottom half but it’s perfect other than that. Super cute!
3.0,"I was really excited to receive this dress, (I bought it for my sisters baby shower that I hosted) to match the color scheme. The dress itself is very pretty and I love the material, it is super soft like your favorite t-shirt, and based off of my other purchases from amazon and other reviews I bought the suggested size. I tried the dress on as soon as it arrived, because I was excited and I LOVE dresses with pockets!! But while the dress is cute, it was not flattering on this mama of 5 who has a little bit of a belly left on her. The dress clung to all the parts I don't want people to focus on (my post baby midsection), which made it not super flattering on me. I ended up wearing a different dress for the baby shower that I already had in my closet. I think if I would have bought a size bigger it would have been perfect in the mid section. The dress fit PERFECTLY everywhere else. I did not return it, I am slimming down, so I hope to be able to wear it soon because I do love the dress and material! So if you are a post partum mama with some fluff left in your middle section I would recommend going up a size so it doesn't hang on every ruffle and ridge. If you have a little more of a flat tummy I'd say the recommended size is perfect!"
3.0,They legging is nice but the waist runs small. I usually gave no problem with a medium. Have to return. Disappointed.
3.0,My daughter loved it. We kept the “sweater” which is really a very this material more like a lose shirt. It’s kind of see though and it fit a little more snug then I expected. But she loved it and the image so worth it for that.
3.0,"Some clasps came apart quickly, but were able to be put back together, but frustrating."
3.0,Product was fine just smaller than anticipated. I added a few more feather to it and it worked fine for what I needed it for...an at home Derby party.
3.0,Good just little at the bottom
3.0,5'4&#34; too short for me
3.0,You get what you pay for. One pair was broken and both were bent.
3.0,Feels like a box and baggy
3.0,Nice product but the shocks are to short for a 1/10 scale crawler.
3.0,"Ordered xl just like my other shirts that fit because they said order normal size, to small"
3.0,"I love this top for my daughter, but she feels the material is little hard and feels her itchy.<br /><br />Very good for winter and the grometric pattern, but the material is not friendly to kids."
3.0,"The nose piece melts easily and is kind of mushy. I like them better than the non-polarized black ones, but the non-polarized cheaper ones have a better nose piece. I need to be able to see without darkening things out too much. I do a lot of visual inspections and these are nice for that."
3.0,These rhinestone lace up heels are pretty but they are cheaply made. They look nice on but the rhinestones on the back look a bit cheap as well as the clear strap on the front the insole is poorly glued and the lace is really stiff. They are a bit high and do get uncomfortable after a while I sized up just 1/2 a size and fit was perfect I got the gold color and it’s a metallic gold tone I really don’t see myself wearing these much.
3.0,I bought an xl usually I’d buy a medium or large for a sleeveless dress but with the sleeves I went a little big(my arms are a little bigger) and the dress was too big but arms were too tight 😞 beautiful dress though the quality was great for the price
3.0,Nice and cool dress for summer. Material is great its size runs a bit small. Must have been made over seas.
3.0,Fits a little large. I only can wear it with leggings when I go out for runs.
3.0,"I am so angry because I ordered the 2 pack of 8-15MM knee hi Jobst compression stockings. I always buy Large because I have size 10WW-11 shoe. No where on this page for this product does it say any size, & my brain ASS---U-ME-D I was getting large. The item came yesterday & I put it on today, & the box only says 7-9- not ""size 7-9"". I thought it was some kind of manufacturing code. It took me 12 minutes to get it on my rt lower leg, & I figured ""Jobst must be really making these smaller now"". I wore both stockings today for 2 hours, & just dealt with the agony & burning in rt. Leg.  I finally had to cut stockings off because the indentations were so deep in both upper legs, they wouldn't come off.  It's my fault for not calling Amazon to check on the size before ordering, but I feel the Sizes should be CLEARLY posted."
3.0,I had purchased a M/L. My pant size is 8 and I usually fit pretty nicely in Mediums and I even have extra material around my thighs/legs. These leggings are pretty tight and I'm concerned that if I stretch too much or do something it could rip. I do like them but I can't really wear them outside the house because they're pretty tight. I guess I'm still on the lookout for the perfect workout leggings.
3.0,"They’re different from what I thought. They will work, but I ordered a 28” length, and they will have to be hemmed about 2 “"
3.0,Good product would have liked for them to be the color in the picture
3.0,"The package was missing the heart footprint mold. Everything else was there and looks great. I contacted them and they are sending me the missing mold, but they said it would take a while so hopefully it still comes!"
3.0,It's ok but my head barely fits through the hole.
3.0,"They don’t have stretch to them other than the waist band. I carry my weight in my midsection, the fit too snug. I returned them and will be ordering an XL."
3.0,"The product and the theory are great,however the company and its policies are terrible. I've been a customer for several years and have mostly been very satisfied. there have been a few issues along the way. Just today, I called about my most recent pair, in which the back strap has slipped through the clip due to an open seam on the strap. This pair was bought 45 days ago.The lady that I spoke to told me that I should look for a seamstress to re-sew the seam! No offer to replace or repair the braces. The reason offered to me is that they do not manufacture the suspenders and cannot be involved with repairs.<br />Not a very customer- oriented company. I'll do business elsewhere."
3.0,The Print was beautiful but the boning in the sleeve was so stiff it scratched. Sorry I had to send it back but I would have never wore it.
3.0,Nice looking pants but was smaller than the average size 14.  I would have kept them if they fit.
3.0,Es muy oscura no parece nueva
3.0,"I played with the straps for a while and could not get this dress to look right.  The best I could get still left a huge gap in the arm holes, showing a lot of side boob.  I already have enough dresses that require a cami or tank under to be decent in public and I did not want to spend my tenure owning this garment endlessly wrestling with the straps.  The material is so delicate, the dress was virtually weightless.  Absolutely love the beautiful print.  This would probably fit best on women with a much bigger chest (bigger than C)."
3.0,"This skirt looks fine. Pretty much as expected. However, it is SO long. I am 5'6&#34; and I tried it at my natural waistline. I even put on 2.5&#34; heels and the skirt was still dragging on the ground."
3.0,"I was SO looking forward to getting these! I am disabled and in a wheelchair- my legs are cold all winter. I couldn't wait to get them to help keep my legs warm. I was so disappointed they didn't fit!! They are way too small. I am about 25lbs overweight so I got the largest size. I wish they came in larger sizes I normally just wear a size large in Hanes brand and Land's End sweats. I shouldn't need a 3 or 4x!!!  I will say, the pants felt so soft and warm inside. If I didn't want them to pull over my hips I'd love them!! LOL"
3.0,"This dress is the color and length that I expected as described online. However, it is much wider than I expected. I may have missed that in the description or it just may be the style of dress, but it's not very flattering on me. At any rate, I would order a size smaller than you normally wear."
3.0,"This looks like a very cute waitressing apron, but when I received it the size of it was probably triple what the picture makes it look like. It may be ""one size fits all"" type apron, but it did not fit me and the apron went clear past my knees (I am 5' 2"" and 115 lbs). I could have pulled it up all the way to my chest, but it didn't look right. I think if it was made to be customized to size, or smaller it would be very cute. The material is the same as a regular apron."
3.0,i WILL RETURN THIS ITEM.
3.0,"Very tight. I am 5'5"" and 135 pounds. My cup size is a 36 B and I ordered a medium. It was pretty comfortable around the breast area but the elastic is very firm and a little too tight. Kind of hard to take off. However, its super cute"
3.0,Almost perfect.  Prongs come out in bra area and if I'm bending over I feel like I might have a slip but haven't yet. Really great suit for larger chested women... CON- PILLS FAST. Color fades...
3.0,"My carpet is now covered in white stuff. The costume started shedding as soon as I took it out of the bag. (Insert eye roll here) I remember thinking with other zippers that I wished I had a more slick one. Now having a slick one, I will never again wish for one. I couldn’t zip it up because it kept falling down. So I tied a string to the zipper and was able to zip up by pulling it up over my head. Buuuuut as soon as I let go of the string, it unzipped completely. (Insert more eye rolls here) Already packaged up for return...."
3.0,"My daughter loves them, they arrive pretty fast but the edges were scratched. Maybe wrapping the earrings in some bubble wrap would be better. My daughter was able to repaint the scratched edge."
3.0,So so cute on the model.  Less so on me.  The higher neckline made it a little less flattering than I'd hoped.
3.0,cant really rate it good because I don't have it..guess it is taking so long that I ordered my mom something else for mothers day
3.0,"Absolutely love the wallet. Perfect size, but the zipper part is really hard to open and close."
3.0,Longer than expected.  Clingy material.
3.0,More &#34;plastic&#34; and &#34;costume like&#34; than I was expecting
3.0,"Huge sweater. I have purchased several sweaters from this company, but this one was huge. I liked the feel of it and the look of it but I had to send it back because it was too big."
3.0,"good for the price, but i happened to be allergic to the metal ):"
3.0,It's okay but will not recommend
3.0,"Not a bad shirt, but nowhere near the size advertised. Maybe a simple mistake, but slightly lighter shade and waist was more than a bit snug. I'm currently wearing 36&#34; jeans, so I'm curious how an advertised 40&#34; waist doesn't fit. I went a bit larger than I thought I needed because I know these kinds of knock-offs run small. Also the brand I received was &#34;everliss&#34;, which appears nowhere in the description. Not that I care overly much because I was literally buying a random cheap work shirt to begin with, but still it'd be nice if they mentioned that I guess.<br /><br />All told if you need a generic polo for work for the summer, you could do worse, just order a size or two larger than you measure and you should be ok. I'm sending back for the next size up, will update when I get it."
3.0,"The product had a strange smell, but otherwise was nice."
3.0,"Here's the thing...the dress I ordered pictured above with the lace sleeves and black flower skirt...that's not the dress I received. However, the dress I received is quite nice and fits perfectly so I have decided to keep it. I'm giving a 3 start review since I received the wrong product, but still like the product that was received."
3.0,"Very cute shorts that fit well! However, don’t wash them the first time with any lighter colors because they do release color with the first washing and fade slightly. We even washed them by hand to be more gentle with them."
3.0,They're a little too snug to put on. One of the pairs was fitting too tight to where we snapped the elastic shoe string trying to put them on.
3.0,"I don’t like the way the material rubs on the inside of the arm where the two sections meet, but it’s a good basic black shirt that fit as expected."
3.0,These are nice but not as long as pictured.
3.0,"The loop that you connect to the hook broke, I had to drill into medal to attach a new hook, maybe it is made for a cat?"
3.0,Loved the variety. Hated the stones falling out! Not all but maybe the settings needed to be tightened more!
3.0,"I love Nixon and I loved the price for a good quality watch.<br />However, I thought the size was going to be slightly larger and I thought the color was going to be more of a tortoise shell look. Inside the watch almost looks like it is black in color. But I kept it and wear it all the time."
3.0,SO CUTE. TOO SMALL. THATS ALL THAT THEIR IS. OH YEAH. you only get one.
3.0,Took a  Almost a month to receive but love texture of shirt<br />My baby face is darker on the shirt
3.0,Wish they wrapped around your eyes a little more to prevent crows feet.  But very nice otherwise.  Polarization is great.
3.0,"Ordered a size 14, it bigger than expected. Waist line is not fitted like picture shows."
3.0,The white based dress is see through; you’ll need to wear something underneath. Cute as a cover up for a bathing suit possibly.
3.0,"I normally wear an XL, and based on some of the reviews I read, I ordered a 1X.  It came in today and I tried it on and it fit me like a medium.  When you order a hoodie, you're expecting a baggy fit, not something slim fitting and small.  It's super cute, but no way will it work for me.  I could order a bigger size, but I still worry about the length, as it was pretty short as well."
3.0,"The pendant is nice, but the weight and size was smaller than I expected..."
3.0,I’m 5’3 with 32DD the shirt hit right under my boobs so wish it was a little longer but fit well on my arms. Head hole is VERY small also cut the neck line lower bc it was turtle neck tight. Cute top though
3.0,"Cute hat, nice and shiny, relatively holds its shape, but the little badge on the front does not stay on, it’s a plastic badge with a sticky wedge on the back. I’d say it would hold up for like 1 Halloween Party but that’s about it. Then again, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Not as pretty as the image and a bit too big but good value for money
3.0,I absolutely love these pajamas but I was shocked to see that they are 2 sizes too small. My bottoms were above my son's ankles and he couldn't even get his arms into the sleeves.<br />I sent them back the day after I got them.
3.0,"Nice design, good materials, breathable but I didn't have a chance to test them out for warmth.  Palm width was true to the size chart and the finger fit was fine for me but the palm length was more than a little short and buckled on my hand instead of my wrist.  I had to return them because of the fit issue and I had already ordered the XL so I couldn't judge durability but there were several frayed threads already so I have concerns about longevity."
3.0,My second pair but wish they had size 12. Size 11 just fits
3.0,Not really a compression sock. More like a fitted knee high
3.0,"These are only okay. Maybe it's me--they seem oddly short and a little too big. Like, if they sit at my waist, they hit above my ankles. They also seem a tiny bit too big--I got a medium, but maybe I should've gotten a small.<br /><br />I do like the drawstring, which is substantial and stays tied. The fabric is thick--almost a little too thick.<br /><br />For taller ladies, they might be too short on you. Other than that, they're okay."
3.0,"Very nice shoe, however I disliked the &#34;snap&#34; closure where you must unsnap it to loosen the strap to take the shoe off or snap to close and then twist to tighten the strap.  It is hard for me to reach down to turn the snap.  I also didn't like that I can't just kick them off easily."
3.0,"Normally wear 36C in bra and waist is 29"". Normally wear Medium and sometimes Large in tops. Bought this top in Large hoping for a casual and relaxed fit. But it fits too snug. Couldn't wear it for its intended purpose, but I'll find another way to make it work. Runs small. Material is also a bit thin. Kinda feels like rayon material and a bit see thru"
3.0,Thinner material than i like... i may need a smaller size.
3.0,The shoes are nice but they run really big
3.0,"I really don't know why everyone loves this.  The fabric was not breathable.  It was not cute and flowy like the pictures.  It is a very heavy, warm fabric that does not lay as nicely on the body as the pictures suggest.  Definitely not something I would be comfortable wearing in warmer weather like most of my dresses.  The design/colors are nice.  The length is good (I am 5'10"").  It's an ok dress.  It will not become a favorite of mine, at all, but I may wear it occasionally (in cooler weather)."
3.0,Was a difficult install. The attachment points were not fabricated correctly and I had to modify with model knife. Needs better QC or new mold for factory.
3.0,Pretty.  Can't see the writing very clearly.
3.0,"Cheaply made ive only worn 2 times, 2 different sets and my ears cant handle the metal they used so unfortunately I cant wear them."
3.0,"I cant complain TOO much cuz they were cheap,<br />although shipping was 3x the price,  they're cute and comfy but I only got 7 pair. I didn't get the pink ones :( shame.."
3.0,It was as expected. Not disappointed with the look but the necklace left lots of black stains on my neck and clothing when I wear it.
3.0,If you're 6'+ these will be a little short for you. Other than they are comfortable and light weight.
3.0,"It’s alright. For thirty/forty bucks it wasn’t terrible but should’ve been less. It was great for a Halloween party, not great for mask collectors. It was a bit big, nothing a pair of scissors didn’t fix. The straps are very loose, low quality. The mask was loose and large, could’ve been cut down on the back/sides with more holes on the straps. the one size fits all deal I can understand. It just wasn’t great, which was expected. It was okay, Halloween party was fun, vision was fine, hearing was fine, it was just big. Smelled like latex (which is expected) and the mouth/nose fit was a bit wonky. Eyes were just mesh, face paint around the eyes helped a bit (no image available)"
3.0,"Very cute and fits as expected, but not long enough. I'll wear it for my weekly picture, but probably not out of the house. (Don't want my belly hanging out)"
3.0,I LOVE THESE ITEMS!!!... JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO END DISHWASHER HANDS!!!😃👍
3.0,"The had is nice as a hat but the cooling band is a waste. It starts out okay; but if you wear it for more than 10 minutes, cooling doesn't laste."
3.0,Different material then expected.  More silk. Small in size. Tight fitted.  Shorter then expected. Still like but cannot wear with leggings too short. Very flattering though. Will buy more colors. Bought blue.
3.0,I did not know that the view through the lenses would be green. The reflective mirrored exterior is pink/yellow and very pretty.  They are sturdy and the trave case is great.
3.0,Loved it. My colleagues and patients loved it.
3.0,As described. Material is not a true black. Shows white when stretched the least bit. Very flowy on the bottom. I’ll have to have the sides taken in so I don’t look like a ballon.  Okay for lounging around.
3.0,"Just received the package today and I was excited to try it out. I swapped my previous band with the black, slim band and the clasp broke off as I was trying to fasten the watch. :( Luckily, there are three other bands I can choose from but it was disappointing as I had only worn it once and it already broke."
3.0,"I ordered these because I was having issues with a recent piercing not healing properly. These claim to be 316L surgical steel; however, after wearing the tinted ones (black and rainbow), my ear started to bleed. I did not have this issue with the plain gold or silver ones; I have not tried the blue or rose gold ones yet; I'm a little afraid to try the blue ones, feeling whatever color coating they put on them might cause the same reaction. I also believe the ones they sent are 2mm and not 3mm, but that's not really a big deal. They are just a little smaller than expected.  I plan to keep them, hoping that if my ear ever heals properly, I will be able to wear them someday. They are pretty and match a lot of everything. I can't recommend them to anyone with really sensitive ears, though."
3.0,some of the straps were sewn in wrong so it's always twisted
3.0,I love how it looks along side my other nostril piercing I just wish it didn’t tarnish so quickly.
3.0,"Looks great! Fits really well... However, the seams aren’t as stretchy as you’d think. Just be careful putting it on and taking it off because it will rip easily. I heard a few seams break as I was putting it on, but other than that it’s perfect. Wish it had a stretchy hem/seams."
3.0,"The material is very soft & comfy, size is OK, but its different than the picture provided. My order has 3 large black buttons on each side which I dislike"
3.0,Cute dress but not the pattern I ordered
3.0,It was a good looking watch.seemed to keep good time. But went to wear it a few days ago. The minute hand and second hand as well fell off .
3.0,Its a decent scarf.To hot for summer though and a bit itchy. Im sure in winter it will be fine.Its very big so you do have to pull over your ears not to poof oddly if you have thin or short hair.
3.0,"Awkward fit; a little short even though I don't have a particularly long torso. The breast area ties in the back but seems a tad loose around the outer breast. The side cut-out shows some of the less attractive side/back features (the rolls I'd prefer to keep tucked away & hidden). Other than that, it is really cute and the fabric seems pretty good quality."
3.0,"I ordered two of these necklaces. When I received my package today, there was one of these necklaces and one of a different necklace. I hope to be contacted about this soon. Nevertheless, both necklaces are beautiful."
3.0,Love the robe but I can't wash and dry it enough to stop the fabric from shedding.
3.0,"Not sized for Large or XLarge women. Returned. Item is soft, good quality and as pictured."
3.0,"I like the color. However, there is only a little stretch on this skirt."
3.0,"These slippers are very cute, but run small and aren't as cushioned as I had hoped. Nice for the price though."
3.0,I returned these because the waistline on them is super super super duper high! I felt like i had a jumpsuit on. And I'm tall!
3.0,I am musclar so definitely order size or 2 up
3.0,"Shirt is fine, but it arrived AFTER the event I ordered it for.<br />Ordered on Dec 30th. Arrived Jan 12th. Not what I expect from Amazon."
3.0,They are very comfortable but run very large! I should’ve bought at least one size smaller
3.0,It said glass beads but was acrylic. Very lightweight. Wouldn't purchase another one.
3.0,"The bands are comfortable, however I am only giving it 3 stars because the colors I received are not the same as what I purchased. I’m the picture displayed there was a gray band. When I received the package today it was a brown band. I was excited to get these but was a little disappointed to see that one…."
3.0,Incredibly soft leggings. Great flattering fit. I love mine but they haven't held up well. Holes along seams after 2 months of wear. They also seemed to have stretched out some.
3.0,"Clipped just fine, but the length was way too short for my ankle length pants that I wanted to keep inside my short boots. Kept pulling the pants down off of my waist even at the longest length. Gravity works."
3.0,Somewhat small but it was wearable.
3.0,Snags very easy.
3.0,"I wore these for working out, running, lifting weights. I liked them a lot because they fight right and as expected. Only thing I didn’t like is that they didn’t absorb sweat really due to the type of fabrics. I would sweat and I felt it just stay on my skin between my shirt- weird feeling."
3.0,"Very nice glasses, good quality and case, but I didn't notice any difference in the night driving vision. Not to say my eyes, but I return them since did not work for me."
3.0,I wear a size large at all other stores (ex. Express) and bought a large. It fit true to size. The shirt is cute. It’s definitely not a v-neck. But I’ll keep it cause it’s soft and comfortable.
3.0,Have another pair of reefs and they are a 1/2 size bigger. 13 would be too big.
3.0,like the product it is just too small
3.0,I thought it fit a little large.
3.0,Not as long as depicted in the photo
3.0,Material look cheap
3.0,If the dress fit me I would give it all 5 stars it looks exactly like the picture and it’s super ratty I love it I just wish it fit me
3.0,"Fit snugly, didn't slide off, and lace looks great. Unfortunately the seam between the lace and sock material is weak and my big toe has pulled through multiple pairs on the first or second wear. I trim my nails short so that isn't the issue. Very similar experience to other reviewers here. Might be less of an issue for small feet. I wear women's shoe size 8.5."
3.0,Colors are vibrant however this shirt is not made from sweatshirt material whic is what I expected.
3.0,It's a good quality. Great with straps. Does not stay up as well used as a strapless.
3.0,"I bought the black shirt with the grey contrast.  The shirt fit extremely well, and the material was good.  The downside is the grey isn't really grey: it's a crimson-grey color which doesn't mesh well with anything, which was very misleading from the pictures."
3.0,good price for this boot
3.0,Good watch and the price is right
3.0,Better on women than for men in my opinion.
3.0,"Nice fabric and collar; Too short for me, barely came to my waist in the back and I'm only 5'0&#34;."
3.0,"This product stated it was a silver watch however the one I received had a light gold band around the front. Also the batteries must have been low because the watch will not keep the correct time. I'm going to buy new batteries and see if this this the problem. If not, I will return it but I guess what can I expect for $5. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"The bracelets were just as described, and would have been great for wrist corsages. Unfortunately, every person I tried them on before making the corsage said they were too tight and pinched their skin. Maybe if someone had a larger wrist it would work better, but not for small boned teens."
3.0,"Top is a good fit, sleeves are long to your wrist, pants are too small"
3.0,The masks are fine but the costume it self was made from such loose material that it was not form fitting and made it look a bit cheap.  It sagged in certain places and for the same price I could of gotten a more form fitting one had I not waited until the last minute to get my kids their Halloween costume.  Other than the fit it the design looked good.
3.0,"The outfit is good quality but, after a few washes, the material starts getting little balls all over it. Also, I suggest sizing down if you like a more fitted look like the picture of the model.  I ordered a size medium I am 55 and 140 lb. The fit was quite loose, more like a large."
3.0,Je suis pret is always ready. Je suis prest means nothing
3.0,"The black and blue shirts fit great, but the grey is smaller than the other two. How one shirt in a three-pack can be a different size is beyond me, but I am not thrilled about it."
3.0,Shrunk two sizes after washing in warm water.
3.0,I was really disappointed with this dress. Based on the measurements and reviews I ordered a size large and I didn’t like how it was too big for me. I tried taping so it would fit tighter. But the worst part is the slip always pokes up at the top. It was the most annoying thing ever. Only giving 3 stars because the dress was beautiful and I received lots of compliments. I just didn’t like how it fitted.
3.0,"They fit fine, could have used a smaller size.<br />Thin material,  so I wont.be wearing them in public. However, using them as work out shorts in own home.is.wonderful."
3.0,These are good but offer no more support than other bras. Was hoping or better support
3.0,"A very cute bag. But it is quite small and was disappointed that it is not all leather. It says on label polyurethane foam, however the pocket , front and back maybe leather.  Very light weight and well made.  It is a pinky coral color with tan accents. Do not buy I f you want all leather.  For the $178 original price I thought this would be leather Too much to send back so will keep. Comes with a dust bag.The drawstring does stay snug tight for closure."
3.0,"The picture shows that is is trim in silver, but it is purple that is why I gave it four stars. Another star taken because it is too short for a church event, SIZE UP"
3.0,Makes you sweat butnnisnt tight
3.0,"Material is rather stiff.  Nothing to get excited about, but useful on a trip where one just wants to be comfortable."
3.0,The idea is cool and once you mess with them enough they look nice but it's a pain to get them set up and takes more effort than I prefer. The backings they sent me didn't fit so I wound up using the plastic backups that were part of the package.
3.0,These are cute gloves but are waaaaaay to big for my two year old. They would probably fit a 5 or 6 year old
3.0,"Fit is great! The color here vs. the color in real life? Not so much. Here it shows the yellow as sunny and summery. At home, it comes off as an autumnal mustard. Very muted. Not Bright at all. If you can get over that, still a great dress and a great color!  Just not the one I was expecting!"
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful but easily breakable. Broke during first use. Because it is a beautiful piece,I'd buy it again"
3.0,These are too small for norma- sized adults.
3.0,"I find it way too stiff, even after several washes, and  with fabric softener."
3.0,The fingers of the gloves are poorly sewn. The pink finger can be as wide as the middle finger
3.0,It holds up fine for running a heated vest for 4 hours but you should have extra batteries ready because it will let you down when you need it most
3.0,Check list price.  It is incorrect.  Cute doll.
3.0,They look great but a seam in the back split instantly. I have a sewing machine so it’s no thing sewing it back up myself.
3.0,"I got this dress for a wedding. Let us just say if you are on the plus size and carry a bit of weight in the middle, keep in mind this dress can make you look pregnant. The top, however, looked amazing. I am actually thinking of having this dress tailored into a peplum top, only cause I love how the top portion of this dress looks."
3.0,not enough room for your junk in this trunk.
3.0,I'm 36dd bra size. I read the reviews and some said order a size up.  And i ordered an xxl and it was to big.i should have order an xl
3.0,"I ordered 5 and 3 of them have a BAD spot on back of them! Love the Magnetic clasp,"
3.0,"I would give 5 stars for the top, and 2 stars for the bottoms.  The top fits great, it's roomy enough with sleeves long enough (I have long arms) and it's really cute too.  I can wear it with other bottoms or just as it is. The bottoms are not so good.  They really should have designed them without the cut-up sides which shows all your cellulite.  It would have been perfect if the shorts were actual swim shorts and would have looked so good with the top.  And there's no gusset in the bottoms which makes them even more uncomfortable."
3.0,"It worked well with bills and I liked that I could also put credit cards in it.  It was just a little small for my use so I returned it.  If the price had been a little lower, i would have kept it.<br />Update 5/22: Still 4 stars.  I hesitated due to the high price for what it is, but i decided to re-order it.  Their time to ship it seems slow for one small item, but maybe I'm used to amazon shipping sooner.  I re-ordered it 5/17, and they shipped it today 5/22.  I'm supposed to receive it 5/26.  Also I wish it came with an extra card to push the bills in the slot, I doubt that part will last that long."
3.0,Runs a little large and the material is not soft.
3.0,"The flip flops will do the job for me. All I need them to do is be a barrier between my feet and the dorm shower floor. However, these flip flops feel quite uncomfortable to me and the do not seem very high quality. One of the logos have already started to peel off."
3.0,Lovely dress! Nice fabric and flattering. Many loose strings.
3.0,"Keeps me warm and I use it for sleep. It feels a little weird at first (almost like a unnoticeable itch if you will), but I got used to it.<br />The only reason I took off stars since it pills after a couple of days, and it does not look like it will last throughout the year.<br /><br />For the price, it is fine, but would love to see the price go down on these heavy weight wool shirts. I can't imagine getting a medium or light weight, since the heavy weight is not that thick.<br /><br />I'm going to try the polyester ones, and see how warm they feel compare to this."
3.0,"I wanted to love this little clutch, I really did. It was cute and small. However, the front closure did not want to open or close easily. As a matter of fact, it was extremely difficult as times to get the front flap to fold over and onto the clasp unit. The delivery was wonderful as was the packaging."
3.0,"These shoes are well made with high quality leather and gorgeous off your feet.  They run true to size and are very comfortable for such a tall boot.  However when I put them on, the toe box was too long (probably why they are so comfortable) and my size 11 feet looked even bigger than they are.  The shape of the pointed toe looked elf-like to me.  The calf opening fit nicely-It wasn't too wide like most calf-length boots I've tried on.  I hate to send back such a nice comfortable shoe, but they just don't look great on.  I returned them."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, however if you are a bit heavy this is not the dress for you. It made me look really bulky and frumpy even with the belt detail. I'd say really flattering on someone slim"
3.0,"I was expecting frenchie to be embroidered vs iron on. The photos clearly looks like it was embroiled! Other than that, it’s a nice hat."
3.0,I did not like the fabric. It feels very slinky and of course the picture looks nicer than the actual product. True to size.
3.0,"Because the boot is a “Moon-looking”  boot, it really has no way of staying on. Mom says No; 3 yr. old says yes!!!"
3.0,Ok concept never wore.. Too hot and filters are useless
3.0,"Nice material, I'm 5'6 170lbs 36D and the top portion was too large for me. Also I figured this would be shorter, but it came up to my knees."
3.0,"Shirt is a little big and i ordered a large. Delivered earlier then expected. Quality of shirt is okay, I thought it was softer fit as picture but feels stiff and oversized."
3.0,"This dress is lovely and fits well, but sadly it is very see through so I had to break out the old slip to be able to wear it for pictures or everyone would have gotten quite the show."
3.0,Daughter can wear at least another year
3.0,Dont buy This is not made for shorter women. I'm 5'7 they were under my shoes
3.0,"Its a pretty dress,bit its to big on the side"
3.0,Strap snapped off but still love
3.0,It runs extreemly small...I gave away and ordered another in the larger size...runs a size or two smaller
3.0,"I really love the style of this gray nightgown, it fits perfectly.  The reason I give 3 stars is because of the fabric.  It’s not as soft as I expected. The seam feels a bit scratchy."
3.0,They are cute but seem poorly made. Some of the stitching on the inside holding the inner layer against the outer layer was coming out.
3.0,I really love the gauges. But when I went to put in the red pair I had one that was a size 2 and one that's a size 4.
3.0,I gave 3 stars because the snap buttons are keep opening and there is no lining also the straps are keep dropping from my shoulder
3.0,"If you're okay with setting it every day, it's a decent watch. If you leave it be, it will slowly get behind the correct time. It's an attractive watch and the clip is sturdy."
3.0,Picture shows lighter glass than the ones I received.
3.0,They are ok look fake
3.0,The photo makes the shirt seem to have an a-line shape. It does not! It is a straight side seam as men's wear shirt fit. For a woman with hips this does not work!
3.0,Sent too granddaughter onesie fits fine dress way too large for a six month old other wise good
3.0,"This is a really beautiful piece of jewelry. I really liked it, but the wing broke from the heart and I just haven't had time to see what to do to fix it. I only wore it once."
3.0,Too short.  Why can't this be made longer?
3.0,"The pearls are lovely.  The necklace closure however doesn’t work.  It is defective, won’t stay closed.  Not sure if I am sending this back or just trying to get it fixed."
3.0,"Ok quality...<br />Regarding Colors and Print they are not true to picture!!! The red is dark more like terracotta and there is too<br />much of it!<br />The blues are also too dark.<br />Colors are not flattering, they seem for older ladies!"
3.0,"nice shirt,nice color  but fit was small - decided to keep it but maybe too small once it is washed -"
3.0,Ordered my husband a medium which is his normal size - should have ordered a large.  Quality of the prodiuct is goodl.
3.0,It rides up very easily
3.0,"Super weird sizing, they’re really long and narrow, and I don’t know many toddlers that have feet shaped like that lol. Otherwise they seem to be great quality boots!"
3.0,Product looks cheap. I just kept it to avoid the hassle of returning.
3.0,"Beautiful, but it broke so had to be returned!"
3.0,"While it says that it is lightweight, it is much lighter than I expected. Don't know if it is waterproof, as it hasn't rained here since it arrived. Will have to reserve judgment on waterproofing until another time."
3.0,"Very stylish, but a little too large for my small face. The major downside is that they do not really provide much protection from the sun."
3.0,it's a little bit to short I have to keep pulling it down below my belly
3.0,The jacket feels pretty cheap.
3.0,"This has an unusual fit on me- I am about 5'1&#34; with a 38 DD cup.  The skirt goes down past my knees. My breasts are way too large for this to fit true to photo.. I've received compliments, but I'm not really confident about how it looks on me.  I received this with a long thread that was loose around the collar.  Other than that, the material is actually okay quality and the dress will look fine layered with some other accessories like a scarf."
3.0,The coat seams are opening a month after buying the product.  Since day 1 there have been strings that were loose.  Currently have a hole in the pocket and have had the coat for only 6 weeks.
3.0,I would pay more for it to have it real silver or stainless steel. I wish they offered that option. But it was nice...just don't think it will last. :-(
3.0,Hard to find the right size
3.0,Extra black rings’ “studs” weren’t as defined as I thought they’d be or appeared in other customer pictures. Returning them even though I like the main ring. Just found some rinfit silicone bands I like better.
3.0,"This was a lot flimsier than I expected it to be. The felt got very dirty and ugly looking very quickly from carrying it in my purse. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3.0,"This is much darker grey/silver than I expected, with bigger pearls than I realized. It's ok but I was looking for something more dainty."
3.0,The jacket feels nice but the inside of it is just some cloth which not ever useful for when it’s cold and also it’s not as good for rain I would get the jacket more for looks then anything else
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress based on the pictures and everyone else's reviews!  However, it was just slightly smaller and clingier than I was expecting, the green was a lighter/brighter shade than the dark forest green I was expecting, and the fabric seems a bit on the cheap side.  It was also pretty wrinkled, but I think the green color probably shows wrinkles worse than one of the darker colors.  Unfortunately, for these reasons I'm returning it."
3.0,"I’m 5’11, 200 lbs, 34-29-50.<br />I bought this dress to wear for my bachelorette trip to Puerto Rico. The cups are too small, the bodysuit under the dress rides up a lot. It’s super cute. I wore flats, but could’ve worn heels with it too and it’d still be long enough for me. I received many compliments on the dress."
3.0,"Pros:<br />1. The mechanism works really well, and you can adjust the tension<br />2. It does keep your key in position and easily to be pulled out when needed<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The black finish is very easy to be scratched off, and I tried to be very careful but scratched it even after using paper towel to isolate the coin I used.<br />2. The ring on another end is a joke since it is too small and basically anything can go through it. You have to purchase another ring for it, which is completely unnecessary for a minimalist style design."
3.0,Smaller than the sunflower pattern
3.0,"Yes, it organizes things well and it can hold just about any appliance...but it doesn't really save any space in packing, and it doesn't really fit into a small EDC bag.  I ended up just hanging it in my office and not using it for travel."
3.0,"Its okay....another item that is DEFINITELY NOT AFRICAN..it has a tribal print and is a knock-off of by a business located in Brooklyn..but I did not want to spend that type of money at the time. I have always been told that you get what you paid for..smh. It has some stretch but does not and WILL NOT fit like the picture because it is a different material. It is NOT a coat, it is a top and should only be worn that way but if you are petite and like to dress 'sexy' be my guess, not here to judge. It fits very snug and you need to wear the correct undergarments. I have officially decided to only purchase African related items from authentic companies, China...uh...no...nothing personal but the product is always unauthentic."
3.0,My grandson looks good and comfortable wearing it.
3.0,Looks good and trendy. The size is too big so it needs to be adjusted regularly while wearing so it doesn’t fall off.
3.0,"Seam came apart, balls up Easy and stretched around the neck. I love the look of the shirt wish it was better quality."
3.0,These would be great little hankies if the lace wasn't so cheap that it melts when you iron them. I'm using them for wedding hankies that I'm machine embroidering and they work great for that. I'll just have to put a little note in with them to let people know they need to use a pressing cloth!
3.0,Looks nice but has a cheap clasp. Got it because they offered an in between size that Kay jewelers does not and the quality of the clasp was poor compared to Kay's.
3.0,very difficult to buy house slippers on line.  I ordered according to my shoe size and they were too large.  I then ordered a size smaller and they were too small.
3.0,"These are pretty earrings, but we’re way too big for my taste. It’s hard to tell the size from the picture, but if you like big earrings, these would be good for you."
3.0,Was expecting much better quality. It is not soft. Kind of disappointed.
3.0,It's beautiful. .but too big
3.0,Smaller than I expected for. 2x but the shirt is nice otherwise.
3.0,"I received this wallet on Friday, and today the strap broke. My favorite part of the wallet, too. Everything else about the wallet I love."
3.0,"The color and silver is great, but this is not the lenght as advertised.  I ordered a long one last year from another vendor on Amazon and it was perfect.  Disappointed"
3.0,These are cute but huge. Too big for me to wear as an average person.
3.0,"Shirt is really thin almost see through, kid loved it tho"
3.0,"The hat is great, the mask though, its too small and it stays completely frozen solid. I can take the mask off, and it feels like hard plastic and it cannot be bent until its placed on an exhaust pipe or a heater. If it were looser, it might be able to breathe more."
3.0,I’m using it for cosplay and it doesn’t fit to close it but good for a Steven Universe cosplay
3.0,"fit was good but very clingy! I returned dress due to cling but if you like clingy, go for it!"
3.0,Dress fit very well in every area except under the arms. Way too baggy and showed off the side boob area.
3.0,Great she'll support. Makes you feel tall but its not for me
3.0,Such a cute and soft outfit. Love that it covers the zipper tab! It does pile after washing.
3.0,"The design is good in that it holds cards, drivers license, money, boarding passes, and even iPhone, or iPod...but BOTH of my wallets' posts that the closing loop ""hooks"" onto fell/broke off.  There's no way to make use of the closing loop, so I used rubber bands.  After a few years I've decided I was worth spending some $ to replace them with something that looked more professional than a rubber band wrapped around a $20 Swiss Gear Airport ID Ticket Wallet.  LOL!  I will NOT be purchasing a third one of these.  Come on Swiss Gear a small but important design change could make this the best travel wallet on the market."
3.0,Not what I was hoping for! They are on the thin side and fit kind of tight with not enough stretch. They are not made of great quality!<br />The thing I like are the designs.
3.0,They are very stiff but better after a couple washings.
3.0,Fit is a little loose for leggings.
3.0,"The sweater itself is really nice.  It's thin and exactly what I wanted.  However, The sizing was way off.  I ordered a 2XL.  I typically wear 1XL but like sweaters to be loose.  I gave it to my 12 year old niece and it fits her perfect so I didn't try to return it since she liked it and it fit her.  This product is even titled WOMEN's Open Long Sleeve Knit Sweater.  Any 2XL in a women's size should have fit me and been loose.  I did pay attention to the size chart.  It arrived quickly and has held up in the wash and not shrunk much.  It's wearable and looks nice.  The sizing it just ot correct."
3.0,"Nice looking boots, but feet hurt, not much foot support"
3.0,"I wear these golfing and cycling. All such shoes are tight. At first I had my doubts. They are OK. I don't like putting them on because my cracked skin catches on them, and I hate that feeling. Once on, they are just fine."
3.0,"STONES loose in box, disappointing, not well made."
3.0,They were perfect for a Mardi Gras party that I had.
3.0,"These are cute, easy to get on and off. I wish they were a bit shorter or had length options."
3.0,a little bit sacky looking. afraid to wear it.
3.0,"The length was perfect on me, I’m petite at 5’-3”, it hit just above ankle.  The waist was a strange fit however.  The belt tie seemed off somehow.  Also note its very sheer so you’ll need a slip underneath."
3.0,"Looks nice, feels nice, is very quiet. Keeps time fairly well and the Chrono works.<br />Color isn't accurate, as seen in the photo, the inner dials have the same color as the rest of the face which is a very dark blue. The color was important to me, hence the 3 stars.<br />Not sure about the mineral glass, as I've already gotten a scratch on it after two months of very infrequent wearing. Scratch is visible over the dial at the 3 O'clock position."
3.0,"For the price, I can’t complain, but some of them arrived broken and couldn’t be used"
3.0,I ordered this for my son and his new wife. I have not seen it personally.<br />They said they liked them.
3.0,"The watch is VERY pretty. However, the second hand often gets stuck on the minute hand causing the time to lag. I am considering returning it for this reason."
3.0,"Hair nets are the large hole nets.  I ordered the same brand and number like some she had before but they weren’t the same. Also the first one opened had a large hole in the middle and was not usable. I only opened two, and the second was in good shape. The color was what I was looking for to match my grandma’s hair."
3.0,"Fits like a glove and hugs your foot if you have good arches. Very comfortable, I wear all the time not just for showering. Only issue is the nubs on the bottom are wearing fast."
3.0,"Really cute dress, cut is great, pattern and fit are great as well. My only complaint is that it’s very thin and seems low quality. It seems similar to the dresses at h and m or forever 21 that would be priced closer to their value, at least ten dollars cheaper."
3.0,Very cute swinwear. run small and is thin
3.0,"It's beautiful, only thing is whatever it is put together with has little ends that stick out and scratches my arm.  I can't wear it for long, but I do like the way it fits and looks."
3.0,Major side boob happening otherwise the fit was ok
3.0,"...I expect you're wondering why I use the word &#34;slippery&#34; for my headline. Well, these socks were just that. Slippery. When I put them on they fit perfectly, by-the-way, no complaints there, but when I put my footwear on...slippery. Meaning my shoes slip slide around. Slip sliding away, as the song goes. Sounds rather amusing, doesn't it. Here's the upside though! (There's always an upside, and remember the ditty: &#34;Always look on the bright side of life&#34;). So here's the upside: I have a fanTABulous pair of red heels that always start to pinch and hurt after just an hour or two of wear - I wear them with black pants, so it's appropriate to wear socks as well. Get this: the slippy slidey slippery sockies (Allegra K) are the perfect solution! Can you believe! They cause my red shoes to feel 'loose' and I can now wear them for longer! Yee-bleedin'haw! Seriously though, I'm very pleased about this, as I LOVE my red shoes!!! (Now I'm looking for some slippery sliding tights so I can wear my sexy red heels with a sexy black dress and impress my sexy old man of a husband)."
3.0,Not as high rise as expected.
3.0,"The metal chain part of the necklace is not that sturdy.  Trying to get one through another piece for diffuser necklace broke first time.  Don't remember how much I paid for this, but will look for a sturdier model next time."
3.0,I love these but the ear piece came off and it won’t slide back on without bending them. I’m so disappointed! I haven’t even had them a month!
3.0,"I like the mask and 10 filter bundle. My biggest issue is that the mask runs on the small side.  It does cover my nose and mouth but barely reaches to the bottom of my chin. I've found the most success (size-wise) with cotton masks that are pleated like the disposable surgical masks since they expand easily underneath my chin.  These filters are a bit different from the PM2.5 activated charcoal filters that I'm familiar with so I don't know how they will compare head-to-head.  Other reviewers have noted that the seller does not sell replacement filters but frankly at $8.00 for the bundle that doesn't concern me.  For the cost of another cotton mask you get 10 new filters and you build up a supply of masks at the same time.  So if you have a smaller face and most cotton masks typically fit you well, then this is a good, inexpensive way to get a reusable cotton mask with a supply of disposable filters.  For me I prefer a larger mask.  Again, my biggest complaint is the size.  It's advertised as a ""free size"" mask that stretches to fit but I wish the seller offered one in a larger size."
3.0,"Earrings are nice, however the fit on the ears is extremely tight.  I cannot wear al day."
3.0,This broke after a week!
3.0,"These earrings are really nice, however, getting the backs off is very challenging. I made numerous attempts to pull the back off and still had to get help."
3.0,"I used this for prom like 2 years ago and just wanted to give an update, it was good. HOWEVER the first night I warn it for prom, the thigh chain broke. So it won’t hold up if you have thicker thighs. The quality was the quality you would expect for the price. It is what it is and acceptable for the price. So if you are looking for affordable prom jewelry then this is a great alternative."
3.0,Super cute…only bummer..the watch claimed it did a series of sizes but the ends stuck out a bit still 😔
3.0,I ordered three and one of them was received with a spot  on the shawl and the bag was poorly embroidered in one area. If I didn't need it in such a rush I would return it.
3.0,"Was broken when I received it in the mail. I had to do minor repairs before giving it to my wife. My wife love it. For costume jewelry, it's not bad."
3.0,"Ordered these for a hippo loving little girl and she was very excited to receive them.  They are true to size and are very cute.  They are very lightweight so they are comfortable for little feet but with that comes them being pretty cheaply made.  I don’t expect they will last all that long but kids grow so fast anyway, that’s not a huge deal.  Overall, I am happy with them."
3.0,It's just okay. Not impressing.
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful, but the gold coloring comes off quickly. I had this necklace for two months, and the gold coloring is coming off leaving a dark metal that does not clean well."
3.0,Cute dress but did not get the cute belt as show in the description picture
3.0,Do not recommend for the 38mm. You can see the metal sticks extended out of the frame. Thought it would be a better fit but nope. Other than that band looks nice.
3.0,I love the softness to it and the item itself is adorable but there’s no way to adjust the size so I’m unable to wear it 😞
3.0,charms fell off within a week
3.0,"They're all too big for my neck and obviously cheaply made but you get what you pay for, I can't really complain."
3.0,"Its way too small , the lotus that is . They showed it on a manniquine and it looks alot bigger there .<br />And yes i love the design and all but i wish they had a better comparison . I compared it to a normal sized match , and if it helps when i rewied the picture on my phone i placed the match over the one i took a picture of and it matched up completely,  no pun intended."
3.0,Okay but kind of bulky
3.0,La tela muy caliente
3.0,Only things missing there are no buttons for your mask
3.0,"Very stylish and simplistic, I just wish the edges were a bit bigger because after a week or two, I catch myself accidentally knocking them out all the time."
3.0,It's a little smaller than my close size which is medium / large and I chose an XL for some reason and it's a pretty tight but still do able.
3.0,This dress cud have been smaller still. Bought it for a family lunch. But i can still wear it.
3.0,They are at least six inches too long.  (I am 5’5” tall.). But the texture is lovely.
3.0,"the fit of the pants is OK but the fabric feels a bit weird and clingy. Also, be aware it pulls up pretty far so it makes your behind look bigger."
3.0,"Well In my opinion these are pretty cheap quality , I don't like how flimsy they feel. I could literately break them so easily and they don't go into the hole very easily. They are alright, But I've seen better.<br /><br />I understand these are probably so flimsy because they are so thin but i feel they should be higher quality. Now this is just my opinion as i am use to thicker jewelry, So if you love them great :) Just not a purchase I enjoyed"
3.0,Me encanto como me quedo
3.0,"At first I was very pleasantly surprised how nice this bracelet was, especially given the cost.  I simply didn't believe it but the image made me give it a try knowing I could return it.  Unfortunately 6 or so months later the bracelet tarnished and the color changed.  It's not sterling silver so don't believe it can be ""cleaned"".  Too bad... I really liked this and wouldn't mind paying 10x more for a sterling silver version of this design."
3.0,Somewhat small across the breast
3.0,"I was looking for  clip on sunglasses, these scratched my new glasses very bad."
3.0,They broke before I could ever wear them. Dropped once. Very fragile.
3.0,Very cute but unfortunately I have to return it because it’s made of 95% polyester. So sad I wish it to be made of cotton
3.0,"This watch was advertised for a ""girl"", but the wrist band is way too big!"
3.0,The dress feels sexy on the body but it has a tie in the front that is just strange.
3.0,Printing on the front was faded and ran very small.
3.0,"I'm 5'10"" and around 240 lbs. I'd describe my physique as muscular dad bod. I love the way XL fits and the design allows excellent range of motion with no fabric tension or bundled sleeves like a T-Shirt does on me. I have two small-ish complaints. Firstly, after a couple months of wearing each color once a week, the fabric is starting to look picked at and older. Although, it's not so bad that I'll quit wearing them. Secondly, the bright blue color is quite dull in comparison to the ad. I point this out specifically because I was really looking forward to the vibrant blue. All other colors have been on point. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product."
3.0,My feet aren't the same size in some shoes. My left foot is wider than my right due to an injury so the right foot fit but it was too tight for the right. I hate shoe shopping.
3.0,"I ordered a size bigger than normal, and it just fit, so this runs small"
3.0,Cute shirt but it ran pretty small.  I like my shirts to be a little loose and flowy—this wasn’t5
3.0,"I am 5&#34;6 around 135 pounds, in good shape and medium fit but was snug.  This design made my shoulders look square and big, scoop neckline.<br />Very pretty design and nice fabric, seemed to run more tight then my other Patty sweaters. returned it but might try a large"
3.0,Not stone ... they are nice looking but it’s plastic “stone”
3.0,This should come in different sizes. One size fits all does not work
3.0,The tan color is great but the little spaghetti straps arent very long and the fit is cuter when I tuck them in or if I were to cut them off. The bottom is REALLY flowy. Better with leggings than jeans due to the fit being more like a tunic.
3.0,"The waist is tighter than expected, but otherwise, I really like the pants."
3.0,I will agree with many of the reviewer's here and say the cup shape is weird. I felt like Madonna in 1985. I really like the material and the craftsmanship. Plus the fact that you get so many bras for such a cheap price is amazing. If they could just work on the cup shape just a bit these would be the most perfect things ever. I am probably going to return them because I just can't get over the pointy boob thing
3.0,"Nice bracelet, but the clasp was messed up.  Had to return....."
3.0,"Cute and sparkly BUT impossible to unscrew (had to use pliers). Once unscrewed, screwing the top back on is a pain and it does not align and looks crooked."
3.0,My daughter is 28lbs 3 years old and not very long. This was a little too tight for her.
3.0,Great fit. Stretchy material. Slightly see through...I suggest wearing spanks underneath. The fit well and the high waist design is very figure flattering
3.0,"I was expecting it to be larger and slouchier. It does quite come off the shoulder, so I wear it more as a coal neck. It's still very cute"
3.0,"This was pretty pricey and the colors are already fading from the Batman logo after just a few washes. Also, my daughter complains about the drills being itchy."
3.0,"I read many of the reviews about this product and was a little worried the heel protectors wouldn't fit my heels for my wedding.  I had good reason to worry, because they in fact, did not fit my heels.  I have a standard heel for my wedding, but the heel is too skinny and does not stay in either size of protector.  I'm going to keep them and try to figure out a way to make them work as I will be getting married outside and would really like to not sink in the ground all day.  I don't plan on re-wearing my wedding shoes, so I might try using some super glue to keep them on the heel or try wrapping some cloth or a piece of paper around the heel to make it wider.  Hopefully I can make them work for me!"
3.0,Its impossible to comfortably use all 3 slots for your cards. The bottom card over laps the middle card too much. If you try to use all 3 it's too tight to get them out without a fight. I still use it but only 2 card on each side.
3.0,"Nice looking watch, but paint comes off easily. My first time wearing it was at work and the paint doesn't seem to do well against tabletops. The watch works well and looks great besides that!"
3.0,Very big. These loosen up so easy that I had to tie another knot. These aren’t very comfortable.. but they’re cute
3.0,Braclet just fine. A major problem with removing links so can make smaller. The tool they sent to remove the links very cheap and stem broke trying to remove a pin.. This was a valentines present to my husband. I am taking it to the jewelry store today and get the 2 links out so will fit him. I even watched the video 3 times how to remove the pins. The braclet is very pretty. Just problem with removing the pins.
3.0,"Update: changed from 5 to 3 stars. The end of the belt ends up looking really tacky with normal wear. The black end piece cracks and scrapes away or something revealing a peach color. I love the belt otherwise, but this is a sufficient problem to cause me to search for a new belt.<br /><br />Good quality. Simple design. Nice materials. A little stiff, but that's typical with all new belts."
3.0,"LIKE BUT I AN 92 YEARS OF AGE NEEDED HELP TO SET UP,STILL DO NOT HAVE THE WATCH BUT THANKS.CHARLES"
3.0,"Super cute and breathable material. It looks as pictured. It lost stars for me because I didn’t realize it didn’t unbutton on the bottom for diaper change, you have to take the whole thing off. My girl is only 9 months so this will be a pain."
3.0,"My shoes made it through one week.  I wouldn't not say I wore them too often, mostly around the office."
3.0,Didn’t fit right so I gave it away.
3.0,"The description that it is a ""velvet"" bag is false, it is more like velveteen. It is still a nice bag, but it shouldn't be stated that it was velvet. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,Sleeves too tight. Thin material
3.0,Fit ok but fabric very light weight so was less than flattering on plus size body
3.0,Velcro came open several times great costume and quality but I do not recommend this because there is nothing worse than your top falling off at a party
3.0,It's a nice looking ring but the &#34;diamonds&#34; reach around so far they hurt my finger.  Looks pretty however.
3.0,"Took much longer than expected, thought it was lost or not coming at all, but finally received it. Picture is beautiful."
3.0,But it's more of a spring and fall jacket. But I love the style.
3.0,"I'm a size 0 and the small was a little big on the top.  Plus, it's not as flowy and chiffon as the picture looks.  I need to return it."
3.0,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZTUUJ4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6<br />They are very pretty but rather uncomfortable for walking in them, also they are one size too small."
3.0,It was great  except after I washed and wore itca few times the bottom end keeps rolling  up
3.0,It doesn't keep time while closed.
3.0,Whistle not loud but better than others
3.0,It's a very cute dress. It's was a bit too long on me and the bottom of it was wide. It wasn't flattering on me.
3.0,Nice quality material but dress runs quite large<br />I’m 5’4 134 lbs ordered medium<br />Too big and waaay too long even after washing and drying<br />Will have to have it hemmed<br />I suggest buying a size smaller than what you would normally wear
3.0,"So I washed two of these shirts and they fit just right on me. But once I threw them in the dryer, they shrunk! If you do buy these go a size bigger."
3.0,They are cute when you don't wear them but they are really big on my face
3.0,"one of the O's in POLO was messed up, but other than that, there was nothing wrong with it. my boyfriend still wears it"
3.0,The Dress doesn't look like pic.... It's okay.. I'm 5' 3.....120 lbs.... It's a little big.
3.0,"Fits nicely, but the color of the item received is nothing like the picture. It’s closer to hot pink / coral than red."
3.0,returned this purse
3.0,"Very similar color to picture but sizing is definitely a bit tricky, use sizing chart and measurements not the Amazon one. Didn’t like how this fell on me, expected a little bit longer. I’m 5’7” and it hit me right at the top of my calf, I wanted it to fall at mid calf. Material ok, not amazing. Overall not the best purchase I’ve made."
3.0,They were very cute on! Only complaint is they roll down of you have larger/muscular thighs. I’m 5’4” and weigh 140 but I lift and my thighs are large. These were for a consume that I only had to wear a short amount of time. Had to take them off as soon as got home.
3.0,"I ordered this after looking everywhere for a red cardigan style top to wear with leggings.<br /><br />It's very thin, which I don't mind and actually prefer. I hate sweaters. But it was very wrinkled. The label says not to iron but I did anyway, with steam, and had no problems.<br /><br />It did wrinkle back up while I was wearing it but with the thin material, it kind of looks like it's supposed to be wrinkled.<br /><br />It's plenty long in the back to cover my leggings clad behind and a nice length in front.<br /><br />Overall, I like this and will probably order at least one more as it comes in a large variety of colors to match whatever leggings you have but I do think it's overpriced for what it is. Less than $10 would be appropriate pricing."
3.0,It’s nice but you can’t see the sloth anywhere. Just a heart with a figure in the center.
3.0,"The pink dress looks a lot like a nightgown, but works as planned as part of a costume."
3.0,"Sharp looking watch but VERY loud, more so than my cheap casios and timex weekender. Crystal feels very thin but otherwise it seems to be a nice watch."
3.0,"This jacket is not a winter COAT by any means. It is not suitable for extended below freezing temperatures or snow! Even though I live in the south, and our winters are relatively mild, I was expecting something more (being that I am used to harder climates up north). In a heavy rainstorm, this jacket would prob get drenched and water would seem though lining and/or it would take forever to dry. I hope it fits my niece, but I will warn her mother to make sure she has on long sleeves and more insulated clothing with it"
3.0,Runs small (XXX) - so incentive to get down a size for me!
3.0,"I am 8 weeks postpartum 5""5', 142lbs, 34D. I actually liked the product until I saw that the mesh is also on the T zone of where your thong lays in the back. The bra is a bit low cut on the side so some some boob does show."
3.0,"Muy mala calidad, no lo recomiendo"
3.0,I wore the dress for a wedding this past weekend. I am 5'1 125 lbs 36DD and i ordered a L. The V-neck is deeper than I thought so a really good supportive bra is needed. Its more rose gold than gold.
3.0,"These glasses have quite good quality considering the price, but I ended up returning them because they are too big for me."
3.0,felt cheaply made.
3.0,This jacket fits true to size for a juniors sized item. I'm usually a women's medium or large if I want a looser fit. But ordered this jacket in an XL and it fit good. It's a very cute jacket and love the embordered flowers on it. One down side is that the fabric wrinkles very easily and isn't a soft material. Not the ideal fabric that I would choose for a jacket. Hopefully washing it a few more times with lots of fabric softener will soften it up some more. But still a decent little jacket that's perfect for fall weather.
3.0,"This top is cite. Not made to be off the shoulder, because it makes the sleeve too long on one side. Also, the fit is very boxy."
3.0,"It seem when you not knowing, are ordering from China. They don't fix or they don't look the same as the pictures on line. So I gave them to my granddaughter because them were so small. The size I order was XL."
3.0,Didn’t keep shirts tucked in properly. Still areas where it untucked. I prefer the single connections vs the Y.
3.0,A 3x should have fit but it's definitely snug.  I'll keep them and hope they'll stretch out.
3.0,"The length of the pants shrunk after a few washes so I had to donate them. Otherwise, they were very nice"
3.0,"Good quality skirt but it sticks out a lot more than I expected. If you want the poof, this is for you! As for me, I returned it"
3.0,"I've ordered these before and the first batch was great.  Good fit, no-slide downs, ample room even after several washings.  Get the next batch and even though the same item/size, these ride lower, slide down, and feel tighter.  I think this is a case of ""each batch varies"", so probably will not be ordering again."
3.0,They are nice to the touch but a little bit larger on the finger tips so when I tried to touch my phone screen the pads on the fingers (as a special feature) they don’t work.<br />Not very happy with the fact they don’t keep your hands warm at all.
3.0,It is not as warm and thick as it looks. It really a wind breaker with a light sweater. Not what I expected. Not for the snow.
3.0,"Too small, doesn't fit all the way"
3.0,"I ordered this brighter color set after LOVING the set with navy blue, deep purple and all. The prob with the first set was no light colors except one heather gray pair. So I got these and, while still pretty nice, they are not high waisted like the earlier set. They are normal hip level. Not what I thought I was getting. If that’s what you want they are nice but if you want high waisted-go for the darker colored set."
3.0,"The product I received was of nice quality and had s nice coach gift box. However, it was not the product pictured as it did not have a handle or the zipper pocket on outside. Those were deal breakers fir me, had to return."
3.0,This item runs small.  I bought a large and it looked more like a medium.
3.0,"Love the look, fabric but runs small."
3.0,"This dress is super cute, but it was way too big for me. There was so much extra fabric that I felt like I was swimming in it. This dress would probably look better on someone who has a curvy figure."
3.0,"Sent the wrong item. But what i received was same brand and style, just different charm on it. Keeping it anyways and reordering the other cause can never have enough Zelda stuff.  It’s your standard HotTopic quality product. Good from a distance, minor flaws up close, and likely not able to stand up to major use or beatings. But for the price it’s good."
3.0,I really enjoy the fitment of the mask and the fact it is made of a metal mesh makes it very moldable to your face.
3.0,"It's a meh product, at first I was really impressed with how sturdy it was, but upon taking it completely out of the package I noticed it was snapped in half. It also came with a fowel smell as if someone was already wearing the mask for awhile 💀 the smell went away with a small sanitizer wipe. At average this is a solid 3 star mask."
3.0,I love the design & functionality of the bag as a whole. What I don't like is that the USB charging area does not work. How do I exchange?
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but it was a bit sloppy. Reason for that is. I had to cut a lot of threads from it."
3.0,UPDATE! ......Maybe it is the design of this vendors product that is an issue. I have used this belt for about a month or longer. The elastic has stretched out near where the adjustment buckle is. I can no longer adjust it to a tight tension and the adjustment piece will not stay in place. The belt is too loose now.<br /><br />I will just have to try another vendor's belt to see if I can make another design work with a different kind of adjuster buckle.<br />...............................................................................................................<br />I bought this belt because I drive a lot. I even have a leather cell phone holder attached to the belt on my left side.  I have only used the belt for one day and I already know that I wished that I had known about this type of belt sooner.<br /><br />I know what I am giving for an Xmas gift to some friends this Christmas.
3.0,"Dress was a little big for the size, the material was thin and somewhat stiff. Chest size on dress was large. Okay dress but we returned it."
3.0,These would be perfect if the toe area wasn't so large (it comes up to about the middle of the foot).  You certainly can't wear the skimpy sandals shown on the package without seeing the seams.
3.0,"The socks themselves are made from a great material and are soft on your skin. They have great designs and a nice mild compression as well. Unfortunately,  they are not meant for someone with a larger calf. My calves, at their largest, measure 16.5 inches around. This being said, they don't quite go up all of the way and by the middle of the work day begin to slouch on me. They are a comfortable material and I love how flashy they are, but really wish there was a bit more to them in length. So, I wear them on days that I will not be walking around as much at work."
3.0,"Colors match from pictures but it’s a lot smaller and kiddish looking bag charm. Ok product, not great."
3.0,Cute but small. Seems more so for kids definitely not for wider faces
3.0,"I purchased this pair of sandals for a wedding.  I previously purchased a brown pair, same brand.  These were not as comfortable.  The band that ran over the top of the foot was tight (I have normal sized feet/arch)  I don't wear wide.  Gave them to my sister."
3.0,They fit nicely on my arms. Not a big fan of the thumb whole design.  Lasted a summer of construction work  but the elastic on the upper arm started to fray.<br /> Best part about them is I didn't get a sun burn on my arms and my arms stood clean at work.
3.0,"They run a little small, they were tight."
3.0,Glue holding the metal part on the stones is very visable. Explains how cheap it is.
3.0,"This dress is cute, but the fabric is very strange and seems to trap heat."
3.0,The sewing detail is NOT white or light gray as indicated on website.. it is gray therefor not as detailed as shown on website.  Looks much plainer than as shown
3.0,"Item was too small in the bust area... no plus size options past XL.....  this was not a normal XL!!  Sad because I really liked the dress... color, material,  look, etc."
3.0,The length is a little shorter than I expected . I would say it is more of a swim cover up than a dress.
3.0,"I BOUGHT TWO UNITS. MEDIUM FITS A LITTLE SMALL, LARGE FITS REALLY  SMALL AND FABRIC IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT. ON OTHER HAND DESIGN IS NICE AND BOTH FABRICS ARE OK."
3.0,The dress is super cute and I am normally a small and everything but I have 34D breast and this smushes my boobs and makes them look like a pancake. Even with the extra stretch in the back it’s not stretching to keep from flattening my boobs in the front.
3.0,"It's not that great as shown in picture.  I should have checked other customers reviews.  But yet no regrets, it's OK"
3.0,"it is okay, but the quality is not as good as I expected."
3.0,It is starting to rip already but it is very pretty! and it came on time. If you have a bigger head then i reccomend not getting this item
3.0,They  are  ok I thought  they  would be  bigger.
3.0,THESE ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THAN OVER-THE-CALF SOCKS OR HOSE.
3.0,"love the fit, and the pockets, but it is very casual,  not sure everyone could get by wearing it to work. I can because of where I work but it was definitely more casual than I expected"
3.0,"You need to be small person, made for small wrist."
3.0,"Fits good, sometimes gets stuck in open position at slight angle.<br />What else tonexpect from Chinese."
3.0,Get more than two cards and it becomes difficult to slide cards in and out. The two plastic cards are not attached to the elastic strip so they come out with the cards if your not paying attention.
3.0,"This dress is cute and fairly well made. The polka dots were larger than expected in the design when it arrived. Ended up returning. As a busty woman, it was too tight across the chest but looked very much like a potato sack around my mid section and hips. The pockets were not flattering on my body type. The dress did not hang anything like the model. I suspect this would look great on a very thin framed person, but did not look good on my average body that has curves. I also expected the dress to be soft and cottony; it was not. Had it flattered my body type, I would have kept it."
3.0,I bought a small and ut fits like a big medium.
3.0,"Very thin see-through fabric. You’d need to wear a slip under this. I’m 5’6” 145lb and the M is way too big— I look frumpy in it. Love the pattern and the pockets, though."
3.0,This is just like the watch in the Army with the only real difference being that this one is about 1/3 the size of a normal watch. This watch is not for adult men or women.
3.0,"The band that I received is not the band pictured. The reason I picked this band is because of the smooth finished edge, as the one I use now catches on my clothes. Even the magnetic piece looks completely different and the rose gold color doesn’t look like the picture.<br />I think you need to update the picture or send the product that is actually pictured.<br />What I did like is that I ordered this yesterday and it was delivered in less than 24 hours. Unfortunately the band is too similar to the one I already have so I will be returning it."
3.0,"Seem to be of good quality. However, the glasses feel too loose on my big head (wearing XXL snow helmets). Bought to play tennis. Had to retire them to car driving."
3.0,"I ordered an XXL whwn I normally wear a medium becaise of the reviews that state it runs small. Even with the XXL, the arms cut off too short so I was disapointed about that but otherwise it's okay."
3.0,Was disappointed in the size of the pin. Bigger than I had hoped for a tie pin. It’s about as big as a quarter...
3.0,"These are cute, kinda cheap looking with material, I personalized a few of these for a party. The headband itself is thick and does not stay on the kids heads. They were so cute but I couldn’t even get them to stay on for one photo. Loved the colors but just didn’t work for wearing them."
3.0,I have been wearing Saucony's exclusively for years and this is the first time I have been disappointed in a pair. These are very narrow and don't breathe well at all. I only bought these because they were on sale. Going forward I will stick with Kinvara's and Cohesion's.
3.0,"From the picture it's beautiful, but when I opened it, I found that it was very cheaply made. On a good note, I wore it under a white blouse with brown denim jacket and have had compliments. Price was really good but yo get what you pay for."
3.0,"Wonderful dress. Material is strong, not that thin stuff. My only problem was the top portion was a bit too big but overall wonderful dress"
3.0,"I liked the pajama pants, but the seams on the inside of the pajamas came undone.  I didn’t even wash them and this happened.  The item is cheaply made."
3.0,Very cute on the outside; very poorly made... the product was very inexpensive  - I Like it and it serves a purpose..  I would purchase it again
3.0,"I just got this in the mail a few minutes ago and it was definitely too small. I looked at the size chart and found my size, then after reading reviews I even ordered a size up. I have been looking for a good sporty swimsuit to use for water aerobics classes, and I think even if this fit better, it would still scoop a little lower than what I would like around the cleavage. I also do not think the color was very flattering on me. I love the orange in the picture, but I should have known better that it isn't very flattering.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 140lbs. I might try to order a size up and in a darker color. I will say that the fabric seems really nice and thick."
3.0,Comfy but I'm disappointed in the length. They are capri length not crop flare.
3.0,Good for sun protection BAD FOR COVID. You can blow straight through them and nothing is stopped.
3.0,"Was so excited about these, I have another pair I love. But these I wore 3 times and the seams are coming apart! Super disappointed for spending $25 on one pair! Will definitely be trying a different brand."
3.0,Nice chain and necklace.
3.0,These pants are made of a comfortable material but the pockets are funny looking and these are NOT made for people on the shorter side. I’m 5’1” and the bottom goes at least four more inches past my ankle. As for waist sizing I would go up one. I normally wear a L (12/14) and bought an XL which fit perfect. Unfortunately these aren’t worth spending more money to get the length altered so I’ll be returning them.
3.0,It works. It would be better if the end were round instead of a tee.
3.0,should have sent this back when I had the chance...not a fan
3.0,"I like this watch, but am disappointed that I didn't get the more sophisticated looking one I had my eye on (also Fossil), it haunts me. This would be more appropriate for my 12 yr. old daughter, I would look mbetter in a more grown up looking one. I must say, it keeps time, and the delivery came quickly, as usual for Amazon!"
3.0,I love the design of this cap but it doesn't have the usual adjustments strap in the back to make it work with a variety of head sizes. It seems well made and the design is better than most cadet caps but the non-adjustability was a deal-breaker for me.
3.0,Not my size actually
3.0,I was disappointed that it didn't come in a small enough size otherwise I probably would have liked and kept it.
3.0,"The bag, while totally cute, is smaller than I anticipated. Before I made the purchase I referred to the pictures which showed the bag having an interior middle, zippered section, so the bag had 'three separate sections' inside. However, upon receiving it today, the interior is all one open compartment. Maybe someone else can make this work, but my organizational OCD requires space and dividers. I love the Montana West brand, even though I don't need to conceal-carry. It's difficult for me to find bags I love, but this line has attractive, sturdy, well-made purses. I may be returning this one, but I'm sticking with Montana West."
3.0,"I wore it once, but the sleeves were way too long and the shirt just looked like a pajama shirt on me, tried to wash it, and it didn't help. I really wanted this shirt, and now that I have it, I don't want to wear it."
3.0,"Fits perfect everywhere except they are a little snug around my thighs. They are comfortable and look nice. I wore them working around the yard, and while cleaning the house. I think they would be good for hiking provided I don’t need to bend my legs too much. I wouldn’t consider these “plus size” because the thighs are narrower than other plus size shorts I have. If I had tried them on in a store I would not have purchased them because if I got a larger size to attempt to get bigger thighs it would have been too big in the waist. They would make a great gift for anyone that is  active outdoors. The material is thick, yet cooling, and they feel like they were made to last. The stitching is nice, and appear to be of high quality. It is a shame the thigh is snug. The manufacturer should consider making the thigh a little wider."
3.0,"It's alright, got it for my mom, its not the prettiest looking and perhaps i should have just gone to the mall and picked a pretty wallet."
3.0,One battery got swollen in less that 3 months. The other one is sill fine... so far
3.0,"This product is displayed with the late model Cadillac Logo. However, I received the Crest-less 2004-2009 Logo on this keychain as pictured. This happened with another brand recently-this was a reorder and the first order is correct. Why are products that are sent not matching the images displayed in the product page? Disappointing! Sending back!"
3.0,Nice product. Love the fleece lining. But the size is way off. This would be maybe a med/lg and I ordered a 2xl after reading the reviews on the sizing. Seems as though they may only have one size.
3.0,Colors and chain not bold enough.
3.0,Bought for my 10 year old sons costume but it was too big for him to wear without falling into his face. Its cute thought
3.0,"I’m 5’3, 115lbs and I usually always fit a small, everywhere except the crotch fit fine, but the crotch area was baggy and looked weird. have to return them."
3.0,"GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY IT COST. I LIKE THAT IT'S AS PRETTY AS THE PHOTOS. I REALIZE IT WILL LIKELY TURN MY WRIST GREEN SO I'M ONLY GOING TO WEAR IT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS. ALSO, I THOUGHT THE HEART WAS DOUBLE SIDED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT FLIPS TO THE WRONG SIDE WHEN YOU'RE WEARING IT. I LIKE THE PRETTY SIDE TO SHOW."
3.0,Seems smaller than ! carat each.
3.0,Refund was taken care of<br />Everything is satisfactory now
3.0,The fit and overall look are great but a bit disappointed that the color isn’t as vibrant and crisp as in the picture. When it arrived the color looked more like it had been washed a few times.
3.0,"What the instructions stood for the item  with durability,  thickness and the value."
3.0,Very cute but not that comfortable. They need some padding in them.
3.0,In my opinion these are not true spandex....they are made out of very cheep material.
3.0,"I had high hopes for it, but I don't like the shoe compartment at the base... which slows me down at the gym.  :-)  It's a nice enough bag, and has some good compartments. I got it to match the size of my gym's locker, but I'm not sure it will suit my needs."
3.0,A decent shoe at a reasonable price. I purchased them for walking and wearing around - which is what I would recommend them for.<br /><br />If you are planning to wear them for jogging I would caution you away from them. They are very lightweight without a lot of cushioning and not for an unstable runner.The forefoot feels wide - or maybe it's just the midsole and outsole that are.<br /><br />Breathable and light make this comfortable - but are also the reason a serious runner should look elsewhere for a trainer.
3.0,"the 'stud' earrings are smaller than described, as are the hoops, though the size of the hoops is fine."
3.0,These are not the best quality but good for the price. The length of the fit is fine but they are quite wide so if you have a narrow foot you're not going to be happy.
3.0,"I wish I had taken a picture! I absolutely loved the dress and tried to figure out how to wear it. However, the bust area has absolutely no support and reveals too much side boob to feel comfortable. I'm a 38C so someone with bigger boobs will really have a problem. Again, I did love the dress though. It does run big. I ordered a medium but the small would have been better. It would not have mattered for the bust area though."
3.0,The cami tank was ok BUT my issue with it was that it was described to have some spandex in it.  It did NOT.
3.0,"The shirt was a bit larger than I had anticipated. It fit great around the neck, however the sleeves were slightly loose and the torso area was also loose. A nice shirt but I was hoping for a slimmer fit."
3.0,The quality is fine but the sizing is off. The small size fits loose line a medium
3.0,"I followed the sizing chart for these pants and they fit as expected, but they are very long and I am 5'9""! They're tight so the pockets look a little weird, especially if I put anything in them. Overall, they are fine, but wouldn't order again."
3.0,Dont fit size L
3.0,Fabric (furry) is ok for the price.  Ears are good size and fit my adult head.  Bow tie is small and cute.  The &#34;TAIL?&#34;  Is TINY.  Even too small for a child.  Perhaps good for an infant.  Less than 12 inches long.  Seriously.  I know the reviews said it is short and the price was low but donestic cats have longer tails!!!  I have a black cat tail ( adult size) that I  attached the leopard bow tie to.  Sort of cute.  Necessity and the mother of invention and all that.
3.0,Loved this but it broke after wearing it 3 or 4 times.
3.0,"The crotch is a little too long, but they're the typical sexy and edgy legging you're looking for! I just decided to wear long shirts with mine. I'm 5'6 and they're not too short at all, a little tight, but not too bad. If you're a size 5 in skinny jeans, then get the small."
3.0,Overall these are nice watches but the quality is really lacking on the woman’s one. The piece seems to be a bit fragile when adjusting the time/date
3.0,"Not what I expected, but will keep."
3.0,"It was listed as a sweatshirt, but totally is not like the normal sweatshirts!!"
3.0,"Super fun, but be sure to wear a long shirt- they aren't as thick as I'd like. Waistband is scrunched elastic - I prefer the wider waistbands without the elastic."
3.0,"Can only wear sweat pant at home as it is baggie.  It is cozy, though."
3.0,Not up to Hurley standards
3.0,"Weird, staticky fabric. Never the less. Son loved them."
3.0,"This hoodie was way too small. I ordered a 2xl and my granddaughter couldn't wear it. She is normally a size medium. The graphics on the hoodie were well done with no smudges. The color was a bright black, not faded. The material was a little thinner than I was expecting. I would have been happy with the purchase if it would have been truer to size. I ordered it for someone who is normally a large.  Ordering two sizes up wasn't enough.<br />  [[ASIN:B01MFEPM08 Theplus Women Pullover Hoodie Basic Long Sleeve Shirt (Solid / Printed) XXL Printed-Black]]"
3.0,better than sleeping braless but offers little support for larger cup sizes.
3.0,"I ordered this for one specific handkerchief that's pictured. There were 18, not 20 and three of them are the same. The one I wanted wasn't even part of the bundle. They're pretty. They work. But I was largely disappointed."
3.0,"This belly button ring came earlier than expected which is nice and in the regular mail.  Packaged in a small baggie, then put into a big envelope type bag, it was a little excessive, but protected it none the less.<br />Putting this in and taking it out is very simple and easy, it screws and unscrews easily. The light blue and clear gems are very pretty and have a nice sparkle to them.  It is comfortable and does not irritate my skin or turn it green.<br />I have noticed that a lot of reviews say this belly ring breaks easily and the stones fall out.  I have not experienced this as the silver baking circle seems well attached to the bar.  It would take a big bump or pulling on it to break it off.  I will say the top blue gem in the smaller ball seems a bit loose and does wiggle.  I  gave this three stars because I do believe wearing this over time that the gem will fall out of it.  All the others seem secure for now.<br />I have not had all the unpleasantness that others have had with this product, but for normal price of $8.99 I would expect this to be made a little bit better and for nothing to be loose."
3.0,"I actually really like the dress, the description and pictures above are very off though. The material of the body suit is caramel colored, much darker than the product pics show it. The seat of the bodysuit is VERY narrow, very little coverage! My booty ate it like a snack! Immediate and constant wedgie city, which was all the more obvious due to the stark contrast between my pale skin and the medium brown material. I ended up adding an couple more layers of tulle and wearing full coverage panties that match my skin color. However you could still tell if you looked long enough.<br /><br />Other than that, I loved the dress. I ordered based off of old measurements; the fit would have been dead on for those measurements, but was (thankfully) a little big on me the day of my party."
3.0,I wish that they had more colors of this belt. It was more silver then I thought It was going to be :) It is a nice belt and it looks good on and fits well.
3.0,"Pretty wallet in the traditional &#34;Taxi&#34; style. But the vinyl-ish material used is easily nicked just taking it in and out of my purse, revealing a white layer underneath."
3.0,Size up and it’s a cheap material but if your looking for cheap-ish they this is your dress
3.0,it was ok at first my brother did love it. but then it started to do something to his skin. so now he just hangs it on the wall :(
3.0,Super cute but WAY TOO BIG for the size stated.
3.0,"This tote bag with organizer inserts will truly keep you organized. Included are plenty of custom pockets on the inside to keep all your items separated. The zipper closure gives you a secure pocket for those smaller items that tend to get lost in the disorganizing shuffle called a women’s purse (lol). The bag although measuring 17.7”x 13.9” x 15.7” (B) is lightweight weighing in at under 2 lbs. I think this would be a great gift for a teacher, student or even a on the go mom. It would be great to keep in your car full of art supplies for the kiddos to use in the car. I haven’t tested the bag long enough to comment on its durability. I’m not sure how much weight this bag could take before the straps tore off? The straps do not feel like they would hold up very long carrying a lot of weight.<br />I purchased this item at a highly discounted price."
3.0,"This dress didn't fit me very well. The plunge was a lot lower than I expected although it shows a deep plunge in the pic. Wasn't a huge fan of the material either. Overall, the product was as described just not a great fit for me."
3.0,"It was very pretty, wore it one time before it broke. A very faulty design in the way you have to put it on."
3.0,I like this bra for comfort but its definitely not your typical sports bra. its very stretchy and doesn't keep you flat or hold you in when exercising. but it is very comfortable.
3.0,"My 7 year old daughter loves this!  She doesn't want to go anywhere without it.  That being said, the chain broke the second day she wore it.  I repaired the chain myself, but may be best as a keepsake rather than a necklace."
3.0,"Very thin material. The arm patches are made with a sort of silky material and this is tighter than the shirt. Colors are great, size is smaller than expected, order 2 sizes up. Not too pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Wish the rose was more brighter. It looks alittle faded
3.0,My son really liked them. I think there nice for the price. I had to send them back because they were to small. I just ordered the next size I hope he can fit them when they come.
3.0,Feel nice but show ever bump in your legs. Returned.
3.0,"The reviews said that these run small so I got a larger size for my husband and still they didn't fit and were very tight. He's thin, a perfect 32/32 and still the large was very tight.  I'm not going to order an extra large."
3.0,"I like the coat.  Some nice pockets, effective camo and keeps you warm.  Only complaint is the main zipper... It a bear to zip up.  Takes several minutes to work it up.  After cutting up an elk I was so tired I didn't have the energy.  I fought with the zipper for 5 minutes and then just took the coat off, zipped it up with everything perfectly straight and pulled it over my head like an anorak.  Even with everything perfectly straight its a bear to get to work.  Frustrating."
3.0,"After the band is on, the inside sticks out and stay symmetrical around the wrist. Otherwise it’s just “ok.”  Looks to much like plastic."
3.0,The frame did not fit very well over my glasses. The plastic was a bit rigid.
3.0,"like the bag ,but is hard to get inside,very deep and tight.I may return."
3.0,Material is thin but soft. Don’t like the fit on me but I also just had a baby.
3.0,"I am 5'10"" and have a somewhat long torso, but in my opinion I'm not that long. This suit unfortunately was not long enough to cover my front comfortably. After tying the top, the bra cups barely covered my girls and the string obviously was pulling down on my neck to try and accommodate for how short the actual suit is. This MIGHT work for swimming but I would not feel confident or comfortable taking this out in the water for fear something might slip out. For a lounge suit or for pics, this would definitely work. You will also want a French bikini wax while wearing this."
3.0,Their did the job
3.0,Cute Set of onesies just wish they didn’t have two of the same thing in this package
3.0,Very thin fabric. Looks cheap
3.0,"This is really cute, but the texture is rough so you won’t want to wear this on your arms. I would recommend layering it."
3.0,I love this blouse and the quality however I had to take it and get it altered because the neckline cut so high that it was uncomfortable.
3.0,Nice looking hat but decals are like a sewn on patch with a backing that rubs on your head
3.0,"Cool idea, but wouldn't buy again.  Everything falls out of it in my laptop case.  This would be great for keeping cords organized in a drawer, but otherwise they fall out and end up less organized then if I had just wound them up."
3.0,Nice watch band. Too small for 8 3/4 inch wrists. Giving away.
3.0,"Seems well made, but as other reviewers noted, it's right around the head and slips off at night."
3.0,women's XL fits about size 14/16
3.0,Seemed odd they were part clear part cloudy. Just an odd pair of opalite plugs.
3.0,not too impressed with color and quality of fabric but fits well
3.0,Pick 2 sizes larger
3.0,Seems nice but I could use it for a ankle band.  I need to get it sized.
3.0,Too big. The cut appears tapered in the photo but they are not. Very baggy and I bought one size small.
3.0,"Fit well but entirely too short- could fit a short torso - it’s described as a tunic, but it is not. Pattern and texture are pretty so I did give it 3stars, but length is what I wanted."
3.0,"VERY SMALL...  I ordered a XL and it is still very snug.  I normally wear a large.  It's a beautiful, well made shirt but way small is my only complaint."
3.0,Some of them broke but besides that it seemed to do the trick. A lot of people though I had pierced my nose for real.
3.0,"I really like RJC Hawaiian aloha shirts, and have a number of them. This time I bought two, at the same time, of the same size (3X) with similar descriptions but different patterns. One of them  ([[ASIN:B015P81GNQ RJC Men's Kona Evening Hawaiian Shirt Black 3X]]) fit just fine. This one, however, is just HUGE. I don't understand how two nearly identical shirts of the same size, presumably made at the same factory in Hawaii, can be so different in actual size and fit. It's a nice shirt, but RJC really needs to practice more diligent Quality Assurance."
3.0,Bought this for a Christmas party and had to return. Bought a small and it was too big overall
3.0,Material wasn't what I expected. More of a nylon feel than cotton.
3.0,I think they are ok for the price
3.0,Comfortable but see through. 👀
3.0,Didn’t hold the smell very good.
3.0,"not sure if title is clear , had me thinking it has 6 hats , only has 3"
3.0,"I thought I ordered a 12 month size, but this looks like it would fit my two year old! The pattern is cute but the fabric is VERY thin and there are visible threads coming out."
3.0,picture shows it hitting below the knee and it hit me above the knee??
3.0,"the bi focal part of the safety glasses extends a little too high.  When I look straight, my eye catches the top of the bifocal"
3.0,"I purchased this hat last year - I loved the over-size fit. I had painted it white and this year wanted it just black so ordered it again, but they've made it  a tighter fit. Probably fine if you didn't have the previous version and expectation, but I'm bummed it's not like it was."
3.0,Product quality is great.  The fit on this style I don't like as much.  The side beads/bracelet are lil too long and stick up more than watch.
3.0,Really great brand but the ties were too much. Prefer the standard style capris.
3.0,These are very soft but the fabric doesn’t stretch much.
3.0,It needs to be sown better one of the straps fell out right away!!!! On another hand wish the straps where longer. But other than that it was nice
3.0,string/ribbon tie popped an hour into wearing it.  Mask itself if nice and good quality.
3.0,If you are thin and long this dress is for you... if you have sizable breasts and a short frame it will look like too much fabric and will not compliment your figure.  The fabric is very nice.
3.0,"The dress was a nice colour, unfortunately for me the slit showed to much of my upper thigh's.  I thought I was a slit that closed but it's a wide opening, no way to close so I returned.  Ran a little big also"
3.0,"Made my ears swell up, but what can I expect for 70 pennies!!😆"
3.0,"If you want something temporary that's easy to remove, this is it.  Otherwise, you'll have to use additional adhesive to get it to stay put."
3.0,Super cute but not made for bigger women it looks like it was made for a tiny woman or kids
3.0,I really like the swimsuit however it fit a little smaller then expected
3.0,It doesn’t stay on my ears. Some what awkward to use. I wouldn’t buy again for sure. Material is okay.
3.0,Beautiful dress- however top is too sheer.  Top isn’t proportional with midsection
3.0,It’s a nice top. I’d have worn it when I was much younger but it’s not for me now. I didn’t realize it was that short. Does it say crop top somewhere and my myopic eyes missed it? In any case I returned it. Nicely made though.
3.0,"These are ok.  They're a good value for the price and are functional, but the lenses are HUGE!"
3.0,"I was really happy with these at first. The colors were good and the fabric appeared to be good quality. However, after one wash the fabric started to frazzle and fray. Not overly impressed"
3.0,Very tight on the stomach and large on the legs. Weird fitting.
3.0,It.. broke...
3.0,Too heavy for day to day travel
3.0,Look nice?
3.0,"Runs small, somewhat uncomfortable across instep"
3.0,A lot bigger than I thought it would be.. kindve sad. I wanted a little dainty coin necklace with my dog on it but this is like a conversation piece and I’m not super into it.. I think I’m going to return it..
3.0,Some of the stones are already falling out and they pulled away from the back when I took them off. very pretty though!
3.0,Came scratched
3.0,"I love it, its exactly what the picture shows. It's just too small for me. So nicer for b cup and under!"
3.0,"The pajama bottoms are red, gray and blue. The top is red, white and blue. I was disappointed that they didn’t match colors."
3.0,"I think that these are more for spike heels than a larger heel. I didn't measure anything before I purchased. I have a pair of heels with a fairly small point and the largest size in the pack was the right size for that heel. I don't think I own any heels with smaller tips, so the smaller ones will probably never be used by me. But they work as described. Seems like my shoes are a little more &#34;clompy&#34; with these heel caps than the originals, but . . . Oh well. They do the job and saved me sending the shoes to the cobbler and/or replacing!"
3.0,"Thin, but it does the job.  The tie is useless however, you can't tie it without tearing it.  We use a clip to keep it on."
3.0,The watch was nice looking and as it was shown online but the battery died in less than a month. Too late to return.
3.0,It’s pretty cheap for the price even. The beige is a weird fleshy nude. Not stone or taupe.
3.0,"it is OK, nothing fancy, hopefully serves the purpose. No place for any other id. No place for an airticket, otherwise acceptable"
3.0,"Size up if you want it to fit like it does on the model. I ordered my usual size and it was much tighter than I expected. The material is very soft and thin, but the color was rich and beautiful."
3.0,"It is too large and when I tried to change the size, the price was higher. I might just return the shirt snd get an Amazon gift card in its place"
3.0,"I got the ivory colored one, and the model must be wearing 2 or 3 of them.  It's so sheer, every freckle shows through.  The description says it's great for lounging around company, but was missing the eyebrow waggle that would let the reader know what type of 'company' was meant.<br /><br />That said, it's marvelously soft and comfortable.  The fit is as expected."
3.0,It broke when I took it off to shower. I’m pretty disappointed about that.
3.0,The actual bar part of this is way too bendy
3.0,It’s very small and has no stretch so beware if you usually get stuff that needs stretch. Also why is the apron one piece?!? Seems unnecessary but yeah kinda sucks i literally can’t zip it 🤷🏼‍♀️ But i mean it looks cute from the front lol
3.0,I normally wear large so ordered XL to give me room. Probably should've ordered a medium
3.0,I ordered this item larger than normal even though I read that it had irregular fit to it but it was still a little too tight. I plan on keeping my shirt and hope to lose a small amount of weight because it is not significantly to type just a little and mainly in the chest area. This shirt is adorable and would look great with leggings or colored jeans or any other type of pants or skirts. I would definitely order this again in a larger size if I had that choice. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest product review. All ideas and thoughts are my own and have not been influenced by the seller in any way.
3.0,Looks good. Too big for my mount.
3.0,I wasted my money.  I do not like the way these fit.  I am just too traditional for this type of fit.
3.0,"Love color and material, but only the problem:  Tighten parts were too low and it hit to your ears, felt uncomfortable."
3.0,Awesome ring  great shipping but not even close to the size advertised
3.0,Beautiful sandals- too big though! (I followed the sizing guide). Ordering another pair one size smaller.
3.0,Adorable ring but turned brassy ver quick
3.0,The bolero is very beautiful. They did a nice job on the detailing of the lace. I loved this product however the sizing is wayyyy off. I’m 5’5 and 142lbs with a size 29 inch waist. I sized up and ordered an 8 which was two sizes too small! I couldn’t even fit my arms in the bolero! I would size up at least 2 sizes if you decide to order this product. I requested an exchange since I still love the bolero. I would hope they would allow me to exchange it for a bigger size.
3.0,It was a little too much for me. I snipped off the two shortest rows and it was much better.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but it had a small tear in it that can be stitched up, just a little inconveniencing."
3.0,These were cute but the crotch was a little too long to be flattering on a female. I ordered a small but they were a little loose. I wear a size 4 in jeans. Would’ve purchased an extra small had I known.
3.0,"Touch screen feature does not work, but they fit nice."
3.0,The design of the item could improve.
3.0,"They are super comfy, but they faded very fast"
3.0,"Got for my mom, she loves them but the silver part in very clear."
3.0,2nd pair I've purchased.  Great arch support. Dont use them wet.  The first pair lasted 3 years ... Got them wet and they fell apart!  Otherwise very comfy & durable!
3.0,loves this but ran a tad small.
3.0,good for price paid - heard some snapping of threads when putting it on the first time but appeared to be intact...
3.0,"I was concerned about the width of the band being on the slim side and would not hold watch securely. Wrong, it’s strong enough. The problem arises with the links of the chains. They tend to snag on clothing and then a rough link is exposed. I’ve had this happen on this band 3 times. So I’m pulling snags into clothing or trying to untangle my clothing and watch band.<br />I’ve had a similar watch band but wider. I probably wore 2 years everyday, used for working out. Finally, was so tarnished from wear I opted to get a new one. Never once did I have a problem of the links catching my clothing and pulling thread."
3.0,I like them just wish the material wasn’t so stiff
3.0,It is shorter than I like and the material is very hot.  It would work for cooler weather if you don't mind wearing a short dress in the Winter.  The large runs big for a junior size dress.
3.0,"Overall these shorts are fine.  I think I was expecting a softer, more flow material based on the photo provided. I am sure it all looks better on their models than on my thighs anyway. They are a little darker green than I expected but not bad at all. And the material is a little stiffer. I do find that the elastic waistband is pretty wide and folds in half throughout the day, however that is not visible as I wore it. I hope they don't shrink because the small fits fine but if it get any tighter in the waist or upper thighs I would probably advise to go up a size."
3.0,Dress runs small and the neckline is higher than I anticipated. It's ok but wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"The cost to value is solid . The one area that did  bother me is that the adjustment piece for my size , (when fully adjusted to my wrist comfort ) ended up on the side of my wrist ; which is visible … should be under my wrist ."
3.0,The Breezeway were too big for my face .I've got a medium size head and the Wiki Wiki style fit me much better .  Great glasses for a larger man .
3.0,Packing needs to be better. Shirt was folded into a small envelope.
3.0,My boyfriend has had the ring for not even two months and the coloring on the writing is gone. It looks plain black now. For $40 i was hoping for a better quality product. On a plusAtleast its still wearable!
3.0,"For a few dollars more you can get surgical steel gauges which are much higher quality, I wish I hadn't bought these."
3.0,"Perfect fit, but faded when washed.  I am a fan of this product line, but this top did not wash well."
3.0,"Ordered 12 to 18 months, since the 18 to 24 months I received was way oversized.  This looks as big or bigger than a 3 or 4T.  Tagged with 90.  The two 18-24 months I received were marked 80 on one and 100 on the other."
3.0,"Very nice dress but after a couple of washes, it shrinks a bit and clings to your body. I only wore it 2 times. :("
3.0,they do not look like the picture
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, looked well made, not a cheap item from what I could tell. Sequins and all the details were well done. However, this dress runs SUPER SUPER SMALL!!! I couldn’t even get it pulled up past my hips to even attempt a picture of it. Keep that in mind!"
3.0,Looks nicer In person. Little tight with checkbook. Passport is a little loose in pocket. Nice devider for both currency.
3.0,Cheap feeling fabric.
3.0,"Very short!  I bought this for my 8-year-old daughter, who is a little above average when it comes to height, but the bodice and skirt are very short.  The bodice is made of strechier material, but I will still end up having her wear black leggings under the costume because of the length.  Head band is cute.  There is no tail with this costume."
3.0,"Its for show only. I thought it was a real bathing suit... there’s no lining in the top or bottom.  It’s super cute on but because there’s no lining it stretches out as soon as you try it on. This means as soon as u get it wet, it will become very heavy and want to fall down (especially the top)"
3.0,"I liked the look as seen online. A dress that was warmer and comfortable for winter yet fancy. Once received, the fabric was very thin - YOU MUST WEAR SOMETHING UNDERNEATH! Very see-thru. I made it work with a black cami and tights but was constantly pulling it down throughout the evening as the material is super strechy and slippery. Was kind of uncomfortable, but it worked. Now I end up wearing this moreso as a top with pants or a skirt. Definitely order up the biggest you can. At least for me, the fabric is super clingy and rides up. Good sparkle though!"
3.0,Kind of small for my face but at least they are blue tinted lenses. Very difficult to find for some reason
3.0,It's a lot bigger than expected
3.0,I’m usually a small but ordered a medium to be extra baggy. It is way too small and the shorts are tight. Comfy fabric and will be returning for a size up
3.0,Not sure about the glow in the dark part. Perhaps it has to be in the sunlight to &#34;charge&#34; first. Still testing that possibility.
3.0,"Really neat looking pendant! The chain has a nice heft and box to it. My big issue was it arrived with a broken clasp ring. Not a huge deal, I figured a way to fix it, but it causes me to lack confidence in it staying on my neck."
3.0,Significantly too big for my baby’s head
3.0,These are good.  They look as shown in the photo.  Not exactly my style but yes....look exactly as shown if this is what you are looking for.  Good clarity in the lenses.
3.0,"This is not a caftan.  This is a straight long lounge dress.  Bsubseach needs to stop calling this a caftan in it's description.  I own a few caftans and and they are billowy and the seams are on the outside of the garment to form the falanges on each side of the garment.  I ordered this in another color and it is the same cut.  The colors are vibrant which is a plus and if you are larger than a size 14, do not order this item because it will be too small.  I am 5&#34;3 and the length is is down to my feet which is good.  The rayon material is nice and lightweight for the summer.  I gave it three stars because this is not a caftan."
3.0,fits small.
3.0,"I love the style of these socks, but the fabric is pretty weak, so they rip pretty easily. But I’m still happy with them."
3.0,The hats a little baggy when worn backwards.
3.0,"Very thin material, very bulky, wasn’t flattering."
3.0,"blade not very sharp, a bit loose, moving up and down, but works"
3.0,"While I really like this (merino wool 95% & elastane 5%) racer tank top, it's gaps open in the back on me. Guess I need to lose some weight before it will drape properly. I really liked the back open feature about it initially or the idea of it. I love the plum color as most workout clothes are black or gray. I've been trying to introduce some purple and blue into my yoga and workout clothes so it's not so boring. I also like that this top is anti-odor as I can really build of a sweat after being on the elliptical after 30 minutes. I will keep this top and use it in my home gym when no one else is working out with me. Once I lose some weight then I won't feel so timid about wearing it around others. It's nice and soft, and I really like it except on me. Seems it's pattern is for slender individuals."
3.0,It's Most beautiful in picture
3.0,"Lose around the neck, but fits my arms and almost a crop top but not quite so it looks like I’m wearing a to small of a shirt, and kinda a elastic fabric."
3.0,"Quality is so-so, the latch on one cuff broke the first time I tried to open it, I repaired it with some epoxy and it's now holding fine.. But what do I really expect for something made in China."
3.0,Item is cute and I liked purple color.. (striped).<br />It was too long for me and a bit clingy for my shape.. I returned item. It may have been my body shape though.
3.0,"I followed the advice of the chart and some reviewers and ordered a size up. It was too big.  The sizing of this top is accurate. An XL fits like an XL. Material is thin, but it does not cling."
3.0,Ordered for co worker
3.0,Es muy pequeño para la cabeza de mi hijo de 10 años 😞. Pero la calidad es buena. Lastima que no la podrá usar.
3.0,Runs small I returned with no issues
3.0,It's not as pretty in real life. The pictures are much better. It's ok for a pre-teen or child. Not really a grown-up jewelry.
3.0,Cute masks too bad all 50 came with the same design my daughter was disappointed she didn’t get the 5 different styles it said it came with all masks were the same design disappointing but guess they’ll do for now
3.0,"The front of the headband looks okay. In the picture it had silver colored sequins. When received, the sequins are actually gold. Also, the back of the ears on the headband are unfinished yellow foam, not sequined like the front."
3.0,The battery was dead when arrived. I now have to go get a replacement battery in order to enjoy the watch. The watch is pretty and I like it just wished the battery wasn't dead.
3.0,like the look of it anyway. I get many compliments when I wear it. Would consider buying in different color.
3.0,10-12 just fit my average sized 10yo son. It came in an Amazon bag. No box or wrapping. He loves it. Says its very comfortable. You may want to order a larger size.
3.0,Lightweight & comfortable to wear
3.0,It not true to size I’m a 10.5 it’s a little to small and I got Lg to Xl.
3.0,Great quality but seems very narrow in the chest/waist.
3.0,The band is very light weight almost plastic like feeling but very stylish. Just seems like it could feel a little more sturdy as far as weight. It was very big for my wrist and I will have to have three links removed to wear it. I am a female so that may be why. Overall I like it and it's nice.
3.0,Was smaller than I expected. Great quality even though it’s smaller side.
3.0,"I got S, for reference I am 5'9, 26 inches waist, 37 hips and 32D bust. It fits well and it looks fairly sexy but ugh it hurts. Material seems like a fish net for actual fishes :o :p. Really scratchy, it leaves marks on the body. Ummm not sure what to think here."
3.0,"Very nice quality, but too expensive for the price."
3.0,"Not enough color play. I should have ordered several, surely one of them would have made me smile. Love the weight of this<br />bracelet. Will try again. Beautifully packaged and arrived quickly."
3.0,Super thin and only received 11 instead of 12. Not impressed.
3.0,No exactly what I thought
3.0,"I bought 2 pairs of the button-fly style, 1 L and 1 XL. The L, which is supposed to be a 10/12 fits more like an 8/10. The XL , fits more like a 12. I returned one, and bought 2 other colors, in the same size as the pair I kept. The new ones came, and they are WAY smaller, even though they are the same size as the pair I kept! I don’t know if the zipper style just fits smaller than the button-fly, but it appears so. Generally, they all seem to run small. I’m also including a pic of the grey, since their picture makes grey look like a faded black. It’s actually a true, lighter grey."
3.0,Fits snug. Super warm. Got pearled after first wear.
3.0,"Waaaaaaaaay too small for American sizes. Gave it to someone it would fit instead of returning, so no comment on quality."
3.0,"First off this is not a sweatshirt by any means. But the bigger problem is that at the hips, it juts out as if a fist is punching out from inside the shirt. It's not even a sway or A-line it's literally the shirt you see in the picture with little wings attached at the hips jutting outward. It's one of the weirdest things I've seen. I had ordered two based on the picture and returned both. :("
3.0,"I didn’t like the fact that the cord is extremely cheap and so are the ""pearls."" Another thing that was very disappointing is the blue bead that came on one of the necklaces did not have the marble on it, so it’s just a blue ball. But the smaller one to hold the necklace in place is marbled??? I do not recommend this product"
3.0,"Just didn’t love this. Had more of a boxy look than I expected from the pics. Material is very soft though and love the color. Seems good quality, but will return due to fit."
3.0,"Based on sizing chart, the large should have fit me but it was TOO small. Plus features are the styling and color of the bra (turquoise) plus the hook & loop closure in addition to the zipper. I would have bought a larger size but it is not offered."
3.0,needed a bigger size
3.0,"Made me look like a Baggy sac of potaotes. Not a great suit for short torso curvy girls, unless your wanting to hide a belly, I thought it made me look bigger."
3.0,Don’t use in airsoft or paintball only for cosplay
3.0,no way that fits over hips/shoulders
3.0,Cute outfit but was way too big!
3.0,"I like the shirt, but the fabric felt like whay kids pajamas feel like, and it piled up after washing."
3.0,The magnetic band tends to come loose and the pins that hold the band in was difficult to get to stay in place while you connected it to the watch.  They were separate instead of being connected (pins and band)
3.0,Went by the size chart and its snug.<br />The material is more of a spandex type material so the fit was very different than what it looks in the pic.
3.0,"Really cute dress, but thin material and fits two sizes to small."
3.0,"When the tanktops arrived both the green and brown colors were different from the photos, and all around the tank tops weren't what I expected.  I will keep these to wear under flannels and work out in, but other than that, they aren't very flattering to wear alone. I also strongly recommend sizing up."
3.0,"Inside pockets would be great.<br />I use a backpack instead of a purse because it keeps my hands free for holding leashes, my mom’s wheelchair.<br />I always use it when I ride my bike. I also like that it is lightweight."
3.0,Great for a child.
3.0,Time goes off by 10 mining in a day which is toooo much
3.0,"They are a little big, but cute."
3.0,Cute sunglasses but I think they might be kid sizes. They stretch around face but the lens are just too small
3.0,This ran a bit smaller than expected and the straps in the back were a bit too much. It was cute in the front though.
3.0,"The fit is not as shown in the picture. The material is much cheaper in person but not terrible. However, the dress is cut to be extremely extremely low deep v cut in the front. Prepare to have to wear a cami or something to get this fit just right."
3.0,"A little too see through, the material was slightly itchy"
3.0,Very Short for a kids xl and slightly too narrow
3.0,It would be great if the clasp actually worked. It falls off way too easily.
3.0,Got my dress in the mail today.  Really cute.  But not crazy about the material.  .and the smell of the material is awful .  Will  have to wash before i wear it.
3.0,"Although the fabric is costume-y, the fit of the dress is perfect. The arms aren’t too snug, and the length of the dress goes past my ankles (I’m 5’9”). The fabric is really stretchy, and as a result the darker colors will appear lighter on top if you are bustier.<br />I wasnt really sure if I liked this dress. I was torn between the amazing fit and the poor quality. The hole and little white spots near the seam made the decision easier, which is why I’m going to return the dress. I’m worried that the tear will only get larger with washing, and since it’s right in front it’s super noticeable. Fixing it would also be noticeable. Inspect your item thouroughly before you decide to keep the dress. If it’s blemish free, it’s very cute!"
3.0,"theyre okay, actually did not need them and then they wouldn't let me send back"
3.0,Very nice vintage look. Only problem is it's made in China. Wish we could always tell before buying.
3.0,Fits fine. Material could be a bit litter. Feels stuffy after a while
3.0,Box was smashed but shoes in good condition.
3.0,Execlence love it
3.0,had to replace after three flights
3.0,Es lindo pantalón pero llego una talla muy pequeña  y tengo que retornarlo.
3.0,This looked cheap when it arrived  and it was too big. I returned it
3.0,I liked the style however the quality of the fasteners are not as good.  The claw fastener is good but the loop receiver comes completely open and chain falls away...
3.0,"Pros: They are high, easy to put on over a sneaker, keep your legs and feet dry in the pouring rain. I keep them in the car if I have to park far and get inside without my pants and shoes being soaked.<br />Cons: As you walk, your feet slide forward and the bag slides down your leg. Easy fix: you have to wrap something around your ankle to keep the foot area separate: could use a ribbon, thin cord, masking tape, first aid tape, whatever works for you. Not the best look: but since you are wearing plastic bags on your legs it would be safe to assume you are concerned with staying dry over fashion!"
3.0,"The shades were lightweight,not too high quality as i expected,but they served their purpose."
3.0,Like the product but would had liked for the shirt to be bigger.
3.0,I loved this pair of sunglasses until one of the temple arm snapped without any extra pressure. The make is simply not sturdy enough. It's such a pity because I really like how it felt on my narrow temple. It fitted pretty well with my face shape and looked nice on. I just wish they have made it stronger with better material.
3.0,"The wallet is a nice size, soft leather and an iPhone 6 Plus fits perfectly, unfortunately the brown color is more like a shiny copper and not the look I was looking for so sending it back."
3.0,Wish it came as a pair but cute<br />Now I have to search for another earring that matches someway
3.0,Chain is short
3.0,I love the style of this dress but it’s not a pink blush as the picture suggests. It’s more of a dusty rose. I did choose to keep it because I like the style. If your on the hippie side you might not like the placement of the pockets because it does make you look broader in that area.
3.0,I did read other reviews stating this has a boxy fit and it lived up to that standard. The neck line is higher than pictured i had to cut it to go off the shoulder. I ordered a 2X and not sure if I received the wrong size or what because it was not oversized. It fit like a small XL. Colors were nice and vibrant.
3.0,It’s a lightweight sweatshirt which I like. Only problem is the lettering is very hard to see and the saying on it is the most important part of the shirt
3.0,"I had high hopes for this handbag.  But the leather is very stiff, and the color is darker than the photo--kind of a grey beige.  Also the purse is larger than I pictured, and doesn't sit comfortably on my shoulder (I am 5'10&#34;).  I returned it.  Lacked the &#34;Wow&#34; factor I expected for this price point."
3.0,if you wanna wear it around the house. I wish there were more sizes to choose from. this is very very large
3.0,I've never seen anything like this purse.  But it is a huge glitter fest which makes an otherwise classy looking clutch look tacky.  I think I will keep it since it's so unique but I wish it were just a little more muted.  You can't tell from the picture but it blinds you in real life.
3.0,"We got these for my wife and our airplane trip since she's pregnant. We used the size chart, but these were WAY too small. I had to help her get them on and it took all of my fingertip strength to get them all the way on. Then it was really tight around her calf. Order larger."
3.0,Runs small. Had to return. Usually wear a 2xl with room it was skin tight. Loved the color and way it looked just to small.
3.0,Ordered my normal size but the body suit was so tight! I recommend sizing up! But other than that it was cute body suit!!
3.0,Ok. Not as cat-eye as I expected
3.0,Runs small. Order up!
3.0,"What a disappointment this watch was. Nicely styled. But, the minute hand, unlike that shown in the listing, is practically invisible. At a glance, the second hand gives you a false reading, since the eye, in normal  light, does not perceive the dark minute hand.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon's fair return policy it is on its way back."
3.0,Felt like I was too big busted for this plus it was clingy at the sides. The bottoms fit well.
3.0,Not as good as I expected but works perfectly ok!
3.0,Kids were playing with them a little rough and they broke.  But for just costume and light use they're great.
3.0,I do like the gloves but they are a bit small so I haven't worn them much.
3.0,It feels nice but the ears could’ve been better fitted. It stays in but feels a little weird. Still a good mask though.
3.0,"Bottoms fit perfectly, the top was too big and loose!"
3.0,Not as large as in the picture.
3.0,My daughter didn’t like that it was itchy. If you have a sensitive child probably not worth the fight. We put clothes underneath but it was still a bother.
3.0,"We ordered the size normally worn and it was a bit snug.  After we washed it, (in cold water) it shrunk and no longer fits.  He really liked the shirt but can no longer wear it.  So buy it big."
3.0,If it all right except for the arms the arms are too tight I am sending it back in ordering another a different one sorry
3.0,The second day I had it the inside lining tore apart. I use it for work to carry a cell phone and epi pen it shouldn't have torn so fast. The good thing about it was the price and it is still sturdy even with the lining torn
3.0,"The dress itself was very nice, but it was WAY too big. Usually when I order clothing online it's too small, but I was swimming in this."
3.0,I'm going to get straight to the point. The description is misleading about this being something to wear in the winter. Unless your winters are warm climates be warned buying this shirt might  be a bad idea. It's very light its almost as if you're not wearing a shirt. I held the shirt up to light and you can see clean through it. It's not what I expected it's 20 degrees around here. I was actually looking for a Henley to keep me warm. I'm not sure if I want to return it or not I mean in spring time it may serve a purpose. It does look decent.
3.0,"The design is good, but please note that it is too thick"
3.0,"Product is what it claims to be , however it arrived with the stone detached from the ring itself."
3.0,"Very thin quality - not good for outside wear but good for pajamas, runs small"
3.0,"It fits fine, a little big. You have to have curves to achieve the look of the model"
3.0,Like the idea and design. Overall fit is good too but the print of the image is terrible. Like most reviews on here one side you can clearly see the other side is like the color ran out and printed everything in black.
3.0,Itchy and tight. Didn’t really like the fit so I returned it.
3.0,"Pretty!  I didn't love the slick-ish fabric it's made of, but would have (in the words of Tim Gunn) made it work, if only it hadn't been too small.  I didn't like the fabric enough to re order a size up, so returned.The sleeves were pretty, and looked cool.<br /><br />I am 5'0&#34; with 34DD.. a ladies Largeit wasn't snug, but sure as hell didn't fit as a shirt of this style was intended...keep this in mind and order up.  I should have ordered a large but due to the type of baggy fit to the shirt thought it might be too much.  I WAS WRONG.  Order up a size, especially if you are busty."
3.0,too sheer for me
3.0,Cool looking shades that are different than boring black ones and fun for vacation. Metal hinge is better than plastic. Wore mine in the pool and ocean. Plastic clear coating started coming off. Is expected with pool/salt water. They served their purpose.
3.0,"Length was fine, waist was a little bit tight compared to other pants I wear. Fabric was completely stiff with no stretch.  I guess the price for what they are is ok, but I ended up returning."
3.0,This shirt is thin and cheap. Runs small so order a size up.
3.0,Color in real life is not as vibrant as is depicted online but qualify is very good and my son loves the jacket
3.0,"I liked the colors, but not the fit. I prefer more loose-fitting clothes that don't show every bulge. I returned them."
3.0,It shouldn't say sweatshirt because it is just a hooded shirt. I also ordered a large but it is a large/xl and that wasn't mentioned about being 2 sizes. The colors are beautiful!! It took many many weeks to get delivered.
3.0,Not waffle material as shown. It was striped like beater boy material. Also ran small and short.
3.0,The cup size fits perfectly but is very tight. Puts alot of pressure on shoulders and caused neck tension. Probably won't wear it again. Super cute design though.
3.0,"The blouse is pretty, but you need to go up at least 2 sizes for it to fit properly. It does not stretch due to the type of material it is and it is more see through than the image shows so be aware of that."
3.0,"It is cute and the color/design is nice.  However, it is very large under the arms.  I cannot wear and it is not worth sending back."
3.0,For the price in the time I had to wait I was hoping it was a little bit better quality. When you wash it it has those little lint balls that form all over it. But I have to say my daughter loves it! Also it's pretty true to size.
3.0,"Returning coat. Too pale for my complexion, Even with XL, the armholes and chest are cut tight and small"
3.0,It took placing the ring over closed scissors and then trying to open the scissors ✂️ to get this ring to adjust. Still not thrilled with it because it’s digging into my finger at one end because the only adjustment I could manage was making it a touch wider. I don’t know where they got this metal but something that is a little more pliable would be better.
3.0,The mask is very cute and seems to fit my daughter well but the filter is much too small for the mask so essentially the filter is useless
3.0,"This was such a cute dress, I wish it fit. I'm 5'6 and 130 lbs. I usually am a small, maybe I should have ordered up. The fabric was nice and soft, NOT see-through and looked comfy. It was tight in the top and arms. Hoping it fits my daughter as it is cute."
3.0,Soooooo I got these and they're really cute and awesome and I like them (let them sit in light first) but when I put them in it didn't feel &#34;right&#34; and later I looked at it and there was actually blood And redness and pain o.o so I dunno I got mine pierced 2 months ago so it's not like it's &#34;all the way healed&#34; but still my belly felt healed after like 3 weeks so .. Idk I'm still wearing it ! I'll let it heal up again so I can keep wearing these .<br />Note : I got mine pierced at the traditional gauge . (Supposedly the same gauge as these rings ?¿)
3.0,The earrings are beautiful just a lot smaller than I expected. About the size of a quarter.
3.0,"I received this dress today and was a little disipointed. The bottom hemline isnt as distinct as in the picture, and the color is  an aweful shade of red. I would not even consider it ti be red. It is comfortable, however i bout it to wear for Christmas and im not even sure i will now."
3.0,"The glasses fit fine, but what I didn’t expect was the fogging that happens when I started to use them.  Spend a few more dollars and get anti-fog safety glasses and you will be saved the aggravation I now have."
3.0,"I bought these for wedding season. I got one wedding out of them before the sole started to separate from the shoe. They were comfortable to wear all day, walking on uneven ground, some dancing too. I had to glue and staple the sole back to the shoe at the toe area to wear to another wedding. The straps didn't bite, no blisters but the quality of the sole or the glue would have given these adorable wedges a 5 star review."
3.0,Bought around Christmas and already flat in the sole. Decent quality but will wear down quickly.
3.0,really large in the thighs - I have large legs - and these are too wide - not like La Police Gear
3.0,"Considering I didn’t want to purchase this but the seller didn’t refund me like I asked, my sister liked it and thought the quality was nice."
3.0,"These are really cute, but for the price I would go for something else.  The lacey one is kind of scratchy and uncomfortable, but it's the cutest of the three.  The feathered one kind of looks like a bolo tie, and doesn't two strands coming from one choker like in the picture; it's just a long rope necklace with feathers and beadwork at both ends.  The third has a sort of velvet feel to the material, nice and soft.  I like two of them (the lacy and the soft), but I wouldn't say it's worth paying $15."
3.0,I bought and XL. It did fit me and the material is not so bad but the pants are not wide at the bottom. I put the pants on and they was in the water on me. So therefore I am returning them.
3.0,It's cute but not exactly what I thought.  For the price it's cute.  Definitely NOT luxury.  It's pretty small and opening are tight.  My wallet doesn't fit in it.
3.0,"Love Wentz! Nice shirt to support our franchise player, cool colors. But after about dozen wears and washes the collar started to get small lint balls( fuzzy) on it and show signs of wear. I have never used the dryer to dry this shirt. I took two stars away for this reason."
3.0,Nice glasses.. Were a little small for my face but still wearable.
3.0,I returned it as the sleeves were too long.
3.0,"I’ve purchased a set of these mask 3 other times and was please - 5 star ratings. This time I ordered a set of 5, 1 showed up. After emailing seller through Amazon and providing a picture that the seller requested, the other 4 were sent but not expedited. Also, while similar the mask were not the same as the product picture and my previous orders.  There was no built in wire molding piece for the nose, the elastic feels cheaper, the mask is a little smaller, and the adjustable piece for the ears is a little cheaper."
3.0,"Sizing is way off, ordered 2 sizes larger than normal and wish I’d ordered 3 sizes larger. Not sure if they’ve changed as some reviewers said true to size!<br /><br />I’m keeping as I planned as an underscrub and very affordable for this. But I was thinking I may wear them at times by themselves and they will not be good for that at all."
3.0,"After reading other posts saying the arm holes were large, I ordered a small rather than a medium. Is tight in the bust for me. Is a true small."
3.0,Super cute hat a little big in the head piece. It doesn't travel well in a suitcase and it comes folded up in the mail.  Not a big fan of that. I tried spritzing it with water like other reviewers said but that didn't help. Wore it out cause it was my only option and I still got compliments from a lady who &#34;loves Kentucky derby hats&#34;. So there you go.
3.0,I loved everything about the outfit from the material to the way it fit. I’m 5”4 140 lbs and I got a medium . The only negative thing about the set is it really doesn’t look like the picture I got dark gold and it’s mostky black with gold almost organe sparkles if your looking for the really gold set I would say get the yellow gold fit
3.0,It it okay....not sure I like the color combination once I was able to view the item.
3.0,Ok the material is good thicker than i expected only thing is its too loose on me i should have gotten a size down but being a plus curvy girl i didnt want it to b too small
3.0,The set is beautiful especially the necklace and the bracelet but didn't like the earrings too big and too heavy...<br />You will have difficult removing it!!
3.0,"Didn’t fit me the way I wanted, ran a little large. Perhaps to stretchy. I gave it to my friend who is a bit bigger than me and it fit her perfectly. If yr to n the slim Apple shaped size, go one size down. If yr curvy same. Enough stretch to have some wiggle room"
3.0,This skull mask is too small for my 13 year old son. (He wanted it for his costume.) It does fit my 11 yr old. The nose portion is uncomfortable too.
3.0,"Nice and comfortable, but a little too short for my tastes. I'm 5'4&#34; and the hem comes to a few inches above my ankles."
3.0,"Not very thick material.  Sizing is very small.  I normally wear a small in Gap, but could not get into the small at all.  Luckily, I also ordered the medium which worked, but was still pretty tight."
3.0,"The pattern doesn't seem to have held together very well and is unraveling from the back.<br /><br />Additionally they don't stay up very well. Which is partially to be expected due to my eight month old crawling, but not entirely because even if she is only sleeping they seem to roll up.<br /><br />Still a good buy but seem to require special attention to keep on"
3.0,"I'm sure your experience with these depends on the seller, but the utopia store seller wasn't consistent.  My first order was for 3 silver ties, I received 3 silver ties that were of decent quality (especially at the price), but 2 of them had something smudged on them.  One of the ties was fine.  I washed all 3 of them by hand to see if that would get the smudges out, they came out of one of them, but not the other. So, left with 2 good ties and a third that was iffy, I decided to give them another chance.  I ordered 2 more.  Supposedly they were delivered to my house according to the tracking (it could be a mix up in the mail or they could have gotten stolen i guess), but i never received them. They came from China (if i remember correctly) so they took a long time to ship (which is fine with me), but I've ordered things from other countries before and never had a problem until now.  Like i said before, just watch which seller it comes from, because some of them are fulfilled by Amazon (which is probably better for this item)."
3.0,"Just as I had hoped for.....except the color! Just got it today and could not wait to open package so I could use it. Everything in the ad including their pictures were right on but the color. It looks more like a mustard or gold color; I was expecting a couple shades darker. Like the purse, not the color, but I need it now so I’m keeping it.<br />Update: mine measures less than advertised and the bottom corners need to be stuffed with tissue so they don’t look sucked in unless of course you have something wide enough to put in the very bottom."
3.0,I ordered the black ones with one day shipping to wear to my husband’s work Christmas party tonight but unfortunately they sent the wrong ones (gold ones) so I ended up having to wear something else. So very disappointed as they are actually really cute if only they had been the ones that I had ordered.
3.0,"Bought this item 2 times and each time it's started falling apart after a couple of months. The pouch fits my iPad perfectly, but the straps do tend to loosen up some on their own. It could definitely be better."
3.0,They are incredibly shiny
3.0,[[VIDEOID:43b22889ae45641656aea3075906ea1f]] Keep in mind this product is from china so is large asf
3.0,"Totally cute, but the sizing runs strange."
3.0,"Pretty and average size but the clips don't hold well. It kept falling out of my granddaughters hair (I got it to match her Easter dress), so she had to take it off at a restaurant so she could eat. She forgot it at the restaurant and when her daddy returned to get it it was gone. The young man bussing the table had thrown it away. She was heartbroken. If the clips had been more secure or if it had a headband she would have been able to keep it on and would still have it today. It ruined her Easter because she loved it."
3.0,"So comfy. I'm wearing them when I work outside and my shirt doesn't have an imprint of boob sweat (sorry if TMI). Maybe not enough side support...but hey, we can't have it all! I wear a 2X in shirts so I bought a 2X in these bras. They're the best thing when I am not dressed up to go out and I'm home in my lounge clothes. I am happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Edit: changing 5 stars to 3. These aren't holding my chest up as well after the first wash. The cups are out of place a little and have to be readjusted after washing. For backup in keeping them,  but no longer appropriate for work!"
3.0,"They are cute and worked well for my coworkers, only issue it that they were all crammed in one box so some of them were damaged when we opened the box."
3.0,"earrings are very  pretty, but the lever backs are cheaply made. J R"
3.0,i wore it for a week and the charm fell off and i don't know where. but i can still wear it. its just not cool that it broke.
3.0,The pants fit well the shirt is too big
3.0,"Its okay, but the bag doesnt open wide enough so its kinda hard to put some solid stuffs in it."
3.0,"I wanted to love these but, they are just to clingy to be modest.  They are beautiful in color and  the quality of the workmanship is awesome.  The price was phenomenal  I have 2 thin teenage daughters and they just clung to their hips and buttocks.  If you want to show off what the Good Lord gave you these would be perfect for you!  Otherwise they are not modest at all!"
3.0,At first I loved These. I bought two for working in. I work outdoors and average 9 miles a day of walking. After a few months I started developing a sore spot on my back where the clasp is and it’s gotten to the point of almost bleeding and is a large scab now. So for a quick gym trip I’d recommend this but for a long day I definitely wouldn’t.
3.0,Came beautifuly but I put it up and when I went to get it to put it on one of the gems fell out :(
3.0,"cute top ,runs small, shrinks when washed"
3.0,"I'm a bigger girl and like my comfy clothes to be just that - Comfy. The material is soft and color is nice, but it's also pretty clingy and not super flattering."
3.0,Cute dress. Fits as expected. The lace detail is very nice and not itchy at all.
3.0,"After about a week of my daughter wearing the necklaced, the string started to loosen up and now all the beads are all spaced out. Quality is not that hood but what can you expect for the price"
3.0,Fabric too loose for breasts
3.0,"My grandkids got me this bracelet with Grandmother engraved on it. I wore it for a couple of weeks however when I make cakes I take it off. Well I couldn't remember where I put it at, so I didn't wear it for about 4 mos. I finally found it in my basket, and put it back on and rarely take it off. I was really disappointed when I noticed the engraving was disappearing, and has now all but pretty much faded completely. I really loved it when I could read grandmother on it because I am a proud grandmother. The Engraving needs to be done a little deeper. :-("
3.0,"Fit ok, didn’t like the pattern when on or the style so I sent it back."
3.0,"Cute but low quality, broke easily"
3.0,"Pendant is cute, it is worth the $3 dollars and change however, the chain that came with mine was broken so I had to find something else to put the pendant on. (see pics). Ordered on April 9th and got on April 21st."
3.0,I got these for free since the first pair I ordered was to tight of a fit. These are lighter wait and do not pinch at all. Can barely feel that you're wearing them. The lenses are nice but not real dark. Not to keen on the shape or style but they are nice for the price.
3.0,I wear a 32B and I would go a cup size up for sure. The quality is great and the adhesive silicone allows for it to adhere to your skin. Wish I got a size bigger; only complaint.
3.0,"There is no way to leave a review without choosing how this product fits so my choice doesn't truly reflect my experience with the fit of this suit.  I bought this swimdress in both medium and large.  I tried on the medium first and it's very cute but the torso is quite long on me, so I didn't bother to try on the large.  I'm 5'1''/130 lbs/36D and with a rouched bodice, all the gathers collect in the middle of my back and, with so much extra fabric, this feature does nothing to flatter my middle in front.  The print is darling, the bust is shapely & supportive.  It's well-made and very affordably priced.  The skirt is a bit too long (for a petite build).  This cut is just for a taller woman overall."
3.0,"I originally ordered these to wear at the gym but they were a bit to thick and not form fitting at all. The ankles and waist seemed to be stretched out compared to the rest of the pants. There were tension marks  starting at the waist going down mid thigh. I ordered a small but the length still came up over my belly button, I’m 5’ 9. A positive note, they are very warm. I’ll be using them as a base layer for hiking in cold weather."
3.0,"I’m giving this 3 stars, but only because I ordered a size 12-18 months and it was large enough for my almost 4 year old to wear. It’s really cute so I’ll just put it away. I’m disappointed though because I wanted my son to wear it in our family pictures next week."
3.0,"A large was too big for me and it's also very sheer. I gave the large to a friend and I bought a small blue set. The blue is also shear, but  it fits better then the large did. 5&#34;6, 38 d /36 dd, med bottom 31. I usually buy medium or small tops."
3.0,I don't like mouth hole
3.0,I bought this as a christmas gift for a friend..<br /><br />  At first the novelty of it was really cool and he loved that it said the doctor who quote for the family of blood episode. but quick you realize it only says one thing and the sounds recording is very poor.<br />Second Flaw is that once you hold it you realize its plastic. All the picture and everything from far away make it look like metal but what do you expect at the price you get it for.<br /><br /> All and all a cool to add to a collection but the novelty will wear off but it still does make a nice watch fob..
3.0,Child loves it b/c attractive. No shock absorption.  Not made for running or rough play.
3.0,"I have a sapphire and diamond ring that is just amazing.  So, I was excited to see these earrings as they're so close in style to my ring.  I checked them against a smaller looking earring and ordered.  Imagine my surprise to see the most minute earrings ever.  They'd be a perfect post earring for a child, that's how small they are.  Needless to say, I returned them.  Very disappointing."
3.0,The bracelet looks better in the picture actually.  It is cute but I probably should have sent it back.  The clasp is too small and may be a problem in the future.
3.0,"5'2 with a relatively long torso,Im 160 lbs and it fits nicely not form fitting but I don't look like Dobby wearing a dress so I'm happy.the colors are a 6/10 but the size of the picture is a little on the small side.the shirt length reaches to halfway over my butt and no belly shows when I raise my arms up so if you have a very short torso,it might be a little long for you.its not my favorite shirt but I ad'myer' it."
3.0,"It was lovely and well made, but it was too small for my average- sized head. I expected it to be snug to stay on but it barely fit and I felt it was stretching a lot if it wasnt perched precariously atop my head."
3.0,"The bag is adorable, I got lots of compliments wearing it. The material of the strap is a little flimsy and not super comfortable to wear for a long time."
3.0,"When I received it, the suit was worth 5 stars, but the shirt has utterly collapsed in only one summer.  The front still fits, but the back is a huge bag.  Very disappointed."
3.0,Not designed for petite and curvy bodies. It's too long. The slit goes too high. The top is too tight. The straps are too loose. The waist fit okay but was a little tight.
3.0,These are comfy but the Dark Heather color is see through. I have the same pair in black and they are not see through at all.
3.0,This was a gift for my son<br /><br />Runs small.
3.0,"This shirt looks great in the photo but looks very cheap in person. The string lengths descending from the neckline are two different lengths and it’s very noticeable. However, it wasn’t crazy expensive and if you tie the strings you don’t notice how uneven they are. I will keep it for work but won’t buy again."
3.0,I thought the material would be better.  I didn't like the material
3.0,Starting to tear after a couple of months.. Does not keep you hands very warm even in moderate cold weather ...
3.0,"I bought these for my 2 year old because she wanted earrings like mine. She loves them & they’re so cute & the perfect size. However, we’ve had these less than a week now & have already had to order replacement screw backs & even those didn’t last. The screw is defective on one of the earrings so we are struggling to keep them in."
3.0,"Look cute on, I got tons of compliments.  However, after about 48 hours of continuous wear one arm fell off."
3.0,will start getting very loose and not form fitting after a wash.....will look like granny panties without the waist control. didn't have waist control to begin with. its like a snug granny panty
3.0,Good in cool weather but too heavy for summer.
3.0,Print not as cute as pictured but it’s alright
3.0,Was much smaller than I expected.  Used it anyways
3.0,"I love the way these look, but the post is too long resulting in it rotating in my ear. I have to constantly fix it."
3.0,"I do like these earrings, but I would not have spent as much on them had I seen them first. They seem like a $10 pair of studs."
3.0,"This product was way, way to small."
3.0,"This shirt runs big. I’ll be using it tied or when I want a loose style but I’ll need to buy another different white shirt for work.<br /><br />The fabric wrinkles a lot, so that’s not great either.<br /><br />Over all nice shirt, but not what I was expecting. I’m XS, bra 32A, 105lbs, 5”1’."
3.0,It's cool. But I thought it was a really guage. But it's not.
3.0,fits but not great quality
3.0,Looks better in small photo than in “real” material seems cheap
3.0,"The bag is smaller than I  thought it would be, but nice looking. No interior dividers or compartments - only holds my wallet, lipstick and a few items. Use it when I am making a quick visit to the supermarket an want to travel &#34;light&#34;."
3.0,"The skirt looks exactly as pictured and is cute.<br />I'm 5' 2"" , and 180lbs (4 months post partum). I normally wear a 13/14 and ordered a 16w and it's a little tight around the waist, which could just be my post partum shape vs. the sizing/fit of the actual skirt."
3.0,This dress was a bit baggy on me even when tied pretty tight. I'm hoping once I wash it in hot water and dry it on high heat maybe it will shrink enough 🤷‍♀️ if not one of my friends is getting a dress😂
3.0,Loved it. Was a little small and the piece was coming off. I really wanted to keep it.
3.0,"This tshirt fits snug around the belly/waist area and puckers right in the middle, below your neck. I find myself wearing this only when I'm staying indoors. I will not buy another one, even though I like the colors."
3.0,Loved the style. Loved the idea of it. But ultimately returned it because the speakers were too far apart and didn’t mine up with the ears.
3.0,the white part of the dress (the skirt part) is kind of see through.
3.0,"It's too small and tight, maybe I should buy a bigger size"
3.0,I'd pay three times as much for a pendant twice this size. I'm so sad that it's so small.
3.0,"It is airy in design, but, the material does not ventilate well."
3.0,ok ~ kind of cheap looking
3.0,It’s a decent hat. I just received it today but there’s thread already coming out from the letters and stuff.
3.0,"I originally liked how the style appeared online, but after trying it on, the waist is way too high. Sure it will cover stomach scars, etc, but it looks funny to me, like long granny panties, in the back. Also, there's not too much reinforced ""tummy control"" in this. Construction is solid bathing suit material with lining in the needed areas. I just wish the style was more flattering on me. It might work better for others though."
3.0,"This is a good little bag for gym clothes, but not for an everyday carry bag. The color is great. The material seems durable but floppy. I used it for a while but found a better bag that allows me to see what inside the bag at a glance that was much more structured and durable."
3.0,It's very cute and draws a lot of attention if you're out dancing or there are strobe lights. It is EXTREMELY form fitting so if you have even a small stomach it will show.
3.0,"I recently bought these walking sandals. They are comfortable, but poorly made. As seen in the pick, after light use for two months the sole has detached on one of the shoes. It’s like the glue deteriorated. These are essentially one season, disposable shoes. Not worth the price point. I won’t but another pair."
3.0,A little loose when wearing.
3.0,"Got these for my 9 year old daughter, and she likes them.  Thankfully they seem to have a small-ish fit, so they work just fine for her size-wise (and they aren't adjustable).  The burgundy color is disappointingly darker than I expected, and is a very dark brown - not much lighter than the black headband.  I thought they'd be lighter in color.  The quality seems okay but not great - just a thin presumably plastic frame covered with fabric and muffs.  The ear pieces are quite comfortable, with ample padding and a soft touch to the faux fur.  Overall they're acceptably cute and warm but not great."
3.0,I wish the lace was backwards. I think it would have looked better and the white material was too see through. But it fit very nicely
3.0,These short sleeves go all the way to my wrists. Weird.
3.0,I ended up returning this product. The cloth was not tight to the 1st layer of cloth causing it to sag in some areas. But with that being said I still would recommend it if your looking for a modest yet super cute swim bottom.
3.0,I had them two weeks and they broke!
3.0,"good helmet Xl was to small, sent back and order a different style, order full face that lifts up"
3.0,The stone is nice although the netting around it is blue not black like in the picture. The blue netting does not contrast well with the black necklace.
3.0,"This looks better on the picture than it does in, unfortunately. This was on the smaller size. Although its stretchy on top, overall it runs a bit small so take this into consideration. Just not super great as anticipated."
3.0,"I'm not sure how to explain. The leg openings down by the feet are only slit part way open. It looks in the picture that they are open completely, but the outer pointed areas are closed. This makes for a weird fit. They fit me in the waist and I'm an 18, so that's good. but I may have to cut open the leg holes because it makes me look like a pirate otherwise."
3.0,I have to return it cause it doesn't look good on me it is small
3.0,Was surprised how wrinkled it is considering how much polyester it contains. I would say that's the only negative part.
3.0,Since I am 75 years old I needed protection for my bald head and neck while outside.  The dermatologist told me to get a  hat to protect my bald head that he keeps freezing things off the top.  The only thing with this hat is that it has way too many flaps and snaps with a split back cover instead of a one piece.
3.0,Cute band but unable to put on samsung watch does not come with pins bummer need pins to be able put it on duh
3.0,My husband is a firefighter and wears this when he works out or is at work. We have noticed it leaves a weird funk on his finger from the sweat and moisture.
3.0,"I found these very unpleasant to handle, and a little larger than expected. They do function well though."
3.0,"I really like this cardigan - the color is beautiful and it keeps me warm all day. However, it sheds lint horribly. I have washed it three times and it is still leaving lint everywhere. I feel like I can’t wear it anymore because I leave a trail everywhere I go. Other than that, I love it."
3.0,Bust way too small even tho I ordered largest size too bad because I loved it
3.0,"I like the colors and texture, not a fan of the plastic like fabric that lines the inside. I like my fluffies wide at the bottom, and these are not that wide at all. Pretty much the same size as the top opening. I still wore them once. It would be great if sellers included measurements of the openings, rather than just the length of the product."
3.0,"I ordered a 2xl but would say this is closer to a size large that's meant to be oversized. My normal size is a 14-16. This ""fit"" but without the oversized look in the picture. Also, it didn't come in a washed out blue as shown. It was brand new dark navy. I'm scared to wash it for fear it will shrink."
3.0,"The color wasn't excatly as pictured, it's much lighter but I'll be keeping it's still cute and fits nice"
3.0,The very first time my grandson that was 2 at the time wore this jacket it tore under the arm so I fixed then the zipper broke
3.0,"Well I ordered these to wear at Christmas. It' Jan 16 and they just arrived from China.  Maybe I'll use them next year but, ladies, they're not spectacular."
3.0,"I love the face but, the band irritates my wrist."
3.0,Didn't  love the product. I found that the open back came down lower than what was shown in the picture
3.0,This pendant is really beautiful and well sized. However the one I go my wife arrived with a broken clasp. She loved it so much she even thought about just keeping it as a little remembrance piece. I sent it back and paid for a new one. The new one arrived in good shape and my wife hasn't taken it off her neck. Amazon has yet to give me a refund on the broken one and 2 weeks have gone by.
3.0,The bottoms are see-through.
3.0,"I’m 5’7. Ordered an XL, fits me above my knees. The waistline is right below my chest. Love the fabric. It would have been perfect if it was just like in the picture."
3.0,"Super cute however, runs very small in length."
3.0,"I do not have a prominent brow bone so my eyes and forehead are basically in line with each other and my eyes aren't covered/protected by my brow bone so wearing this mask is difficult for me/people like me. I think it's a cute mask though so I got some Styrofoam and hot glued it to the brow area.  Doing this created a brow bone and keeps the mask from resting painfully on my eyes.  Being that I had to do this, I now wish the mask had two extra pieces of string on the bottom of the mask to help secure it more, but I will make it work.  The mask itself is made from a hard plastic"
3.0,was good for my costume.  cheap though
3.0,"I would have loved it if weren't for the one inch vertical seems on the top and bottom in the center made to make it fitted. I ordered the ""Hangin' with my peeps"" mask and the bottom vertical seem makes it refreshment hard for people to read the word peeps and the top one makes it hard to see the peeps. It's not a flat mask like the pictures. Pretty disappointing and I wish I'd pulled it out of the bag earlier. I tried pulling out the bottom critically seem but that didn't work very well. If it weren't for those seems I would have loved it. The material is soft and it's sturdy. Great quality mask."
3.0,"A few pieces have fallen off. Still looks good, though."
3.0,"It's beautiful, so glad I received it as a gift. Packaging was fansy. I actually whore it to the family Christmas Party and the Paw print fell off but my family knew, it was mine and fixed quickly. Fortunately, I didn't loose it. Wish it was a bit sturdier, that's all."
3.0,"Aside from material is too thin for me, overall it's OK. It does shrink in the drier so you have to keep an eye on that."
3.0,I wanted to use this for the gym but it’s standard size is too big for my face. I had to give it to my husband
3.0,THe size is all wrong but they were rally nice looking pants. You just have to buy a size bigger then you are
3.0,"I normally wear a 10, but this heel is still a bit small (I ordered a 10.5). the front of the heel is very narrow so it punches your toes. The heel is not placed right and gives your arch a discomfort. These shoes are good for pictures, but nothing else."
3.0,"Nice shirt, but had a terrible smell when it was opened. Fabric is rather cheap."
3.0,"The swimsuit is cute and good quality. The sizing is way off, I am usually a small, but I ordered a medium after reading the reviews. The top fits me great, but the bottoms are way too small. Is there a way to return just the bottoms for a larger size?"
3.0,Would rip easily.
3.0,This ran smaller than was expected. Material was thin. Cute design.
3.0,I prefer the zero feel sports bra and the zero feel push up bra.
3.0,"If you like your sweaters to fit somewhat loose and not look like you're overweight, I would suggest ordering up a size or two on this one. I normally wear a large I ordered a 2x and I like the way it fits."
3.0,I don't care for the fabric. It feels very different than the other one I bought. It's kind of stiff and inflexible or something.
3.0,The dress was ok.  The material was kind of stiff and it ran very large.  Returned the dress.
3.0,I did not like the way the overlay was attached to the dress. It was sewn about 2-3 inches below the neckline giving a pooched appearance.
3.0,Color is not as rich as in the picture. But otherwise is as pictured. Great value.
3.0,"instructions for Referee time is missing some steps i had to figured out my self. Time should go up by increments of 5 minutes and not 1minute, since half starts at 20 minutes for U8. Also shy do minutes go up to 90 minutes? i do not know anyone that continue time for second half starting at 45 minutes.<br />Its ok for what I bought it for, my son needed a watch to ref games with me and this watch would do. I would not buy this watch if you have been refereeing for a long time, this is for beginners."
3.0,These shoes were too large.
3.0,Fabric was too shiny. Made it look cheap.
3.0,I was disappointed I bought the same exact shirt from a different vendor earlier during the year and absolutely loved it. I think this one's a knock off of it because it's a way thinner material and run smaller for the same size. But the shirt is still cute and inexpensive.
3.0,"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this purse.  My hubby got it for me for a mother's day gift from Macy's and paid $150.  I loved it instantly, I had been wanting a MK for a while, and it was my favorite shade of teal.  I'm not a big purse carrier. I have 3 children so I like to keep my arms and hands free so it's not like this thing was on my arm 24/7 but the leather straps started fraying within months!  They're hideous at this point and I am embarrassed that I'm still carrying the bag around.  I should probably have returned it right away but I didn't want to complain to my husband because it was a gift.<br /><br />Anyway, I still love that brand new bag but I am very leary of spending a dime on a MK bag in the future."
3.0,"Seem to be warm and waterproof.  They are not good for riding motorcycles like people said. They do not grip handles, kinda hard to get on and off, and you cant do much with them on. Wouldve sent back if i hadnt been so lazy about it"
3.0,"Tight fit, and I have very large breasts so it made the shirt seem a lot shorter. Definitely need to go a size up. I paired it with high waisted pants to prevent my love handles from showing at work lol. But the shirt was very cute and I got so many complements!"
3.0,This is a earring that I truly would have worn ! I want to try another pair .BUT One post was not made right and was ruff and tore my ear the other was thicker . It was most likely the mold or just a messed up pair ..The price is very good .gg
3.0,"The watch band is pretty, although I ordered the Champaign one and it defiantly looks Rose gold. The protection case was also rose gold and really had a peach hue."
3.0,"These are the most comfortable leggings. They stretch and fit like the sisterhood of the magical jeans. They looked so small out of package but fit perfect. Now thick thighs beware. Within a couple weeks they have all blown out their thighs. I also have been wearing them to work often. So I would say if you are to buy them, buy two packs and rotate often..or if you are looking for leggings for certain events these are great. Even though the thighs blew out I am planning on buying more."
3.0,The quality is fabulous. The sizing is off. I am always a small medium and had to size up to a large. The top and bottom were a tight fit. I am 5’2 and 125lbs.
3.0,"Super dang cute dress. It was more than 1 size too small.<br /><br />I’m 175lbs, 38DDD, slim-curvy build. And the large was no way going to fit me. And I like my clothing on the tighter side. But I had to give it to one of my daughters. She’s a size small and said it’s just a little big on her. So yeah… it’s runs pretty small.<br /><br />I purchased the black dress that has the high neckline. There’s also one in gray. I can’t tell you about the fit of the other style of dresses on here. In my experience all garments on Amazon fit different so maybe a large will actually fit like a large in the other styles.<br /><br />Super cute and great material. Really wish it would have fit me. Btw it does have some stretch.. but not 2 sizes worth haha"
3.0,Both clasps keep coming undone disappointed because they are lovely bracelets.
3.0,"I got the purple leopard color and received a slightly different style - long, wide-leg pants without an elastic cuff at the bottom. I’m tall and they’re ankle length on me, and personally I think ankle length wide-leg sweatpants look dumb. But the material is comfy, they are true to size, and the pattern is very cute. It’s made of that soft but cheep material that is white on the inside, so the color of the print gets lighter as the pants stretch. I’m not sure these would hold long term, but they seem to be fairly well made. If they were the right style I would definitely keep them. So over all, I’d rate these a “meh.”"
3.0,"You get what you pay for with these bootlegs. It looks nice, but it doesn’t stretch much and the material feels like a costume. it definitely isn’t meant to keep you warm. You can’t really roll up the sleeves because the cuff links are made of the same material and doesn’t stretch out, so you’d end up cutting off circulation to your forearms."
3.0,The person it was bought for likes unicorns. It was a good sized purse for what she wants to carry.
3.0,Awkward to put on and off. Doesn't really help a lot on flattening your belly. But enhances the chest.
3.0,"Too many sparles,overwhelming the black background."
3.0,Smaller bracelets look okay.  Largest one is not attractive and area where it is welded together is lumpy and sloppy looking.
3.0,"not a bad gloves. However, they didn't fit my hands"
3.0,One pair fit right and the other is significantly smaller and tight in a way that slips off my heels
3.0,"The view is nice, but the suport is not strong enough."
3.0,very nice quality just too small for me. i gave it to a friend
3.0,Flimsy fabric. Almost like paper. Took a long time to arrive.
3.0,"Took over a month to receive my order. When I got my order one was broken, the peices were not in the package for me to fix."
3.0,Too small. Nice but too small. Purchased as a gift for my husband. Had to return
3.0,Was smaller than I wanted.  Really can't use it.
3.0,Es muy pequeña...para el size que encargue esta muy pequeña
3.0,Xlarge fit more like a medium
3.0,Better than unpolarized ones
3.0,"Something about the fit was off. I also thought it was red, but more coral. I returned it"
3.0,The material was different than I expected. But it’s fine
3.0,Material is nylon costume material
3.0,A little  smaller
3.0,"I bought these when my daughter got her first period. She wasn’t sure about them but used for her second period and they are amazing. All the styles worked but she did had leakage with the blue one. It wasn’t horrible just a little and no one noticed but she will not use the blue one during the day or on her heavier days. The best one is the grey one (her opinion) she used in her heavier day, played basketball and still felt secure and had no accidents. The black one is good as well, no leaks but she still prefers the grey one if she had to pick. All and all she is happy with them and says they are super comfortable. They are very easy to clean as well. I will definitely order more. She used U by Kotex teen ultra thin on her first period and I bought more to have in case and that is what she chose once she passed the super heavy days. They are very absorbent and comfortable too. My daughter is 12, 105 pounds and we ordered size 12. You don’t want them to be too big or roomy because they can leak."
3.0,Unfortunately the chain was broken when it arrived......Cost too much to send it back.
3.0,"The quality of materials feels great, but on arrival half of the pieces of the mask had already come off. Nothing that some E6000 can't fix, I imagine, but good thing I need this in a couple of months and not tomorrow."
3.0,It's a beautiful bag !! But it's too small to fit clothes and ballet shoes !!
3.0,"These are amazing!  So pretty.  I hate stud earrings so these lever back ones are perfect!  They are so gorgeous and are light weight.  I'm so in love, I'm ordering as many other styles as I can find!<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  I dropped one of these when putting it on and the clasp has been damaged so now it will not stay closed.  Very pretty, but for anyone who has a little bit of a fumble- not good.  Very sad because I loved these so much and now I can't wear them.  :("
3.0,This charm is cute.but nothing like as shiny as the picture. As a matter of fact it's kind of dull. This charm should have been shined before shipped.
3.0,"Was really impressed with the looks of this bra.  Very disappointed in the size, I ordered size I always wear.  I agree with the poster that said she couldn't get it over her head!  Same here!"
3.0,"Perfect fit for me (their XL = US medium. )  Nice styling. But use/care instructions are in Chinese. Can this be machine washed? Will it shrink? Also, zipper pull is on the left side. Incorrect for a man's jacket."
3.0,They are comfortable but not much compression
3.0,"The quality of fabric and workmanship of the blouse is excellent, however it is a little larger than I expected.  It is longer than a top but shorter than a short dress."
3.0,They are good cheap shoes and work for in my kayak.. They wont last a long time but are good for what I got them for
3.0,Color was well-represented in photo. Drapes nicely. Length is as pictured. I really like this top just wish the sleeves were a bit more generous above the elbow. Note: this item cannot go into the dryer.
3.0,"I had to fiddle with the ring for a long time before I could successfully insert the bead, and then had to make sure it was tight enough not to fall out. Because it was far too small to fit in the cartilage piercing I had intended to put it in, I had to transfer the charm to a different earring. However, it fit another of my piercings."
3.0,The color and texture is very nice. Unfortunately the flap that covers your data does not stay closed. Bummer. That is the reason for 3 stars
3.0,"They broke after just a few weeks. The lens cracked in 2. I guess for the price, they are OK. Flying fisherman way better. They last."
3.0,Broke within 2days of wearing it.
3.0,This bra did hold up the tatas but the underwire pushed into my ribs so bad it hurt too much to wear. Probably great for smaller sizes but not large gals.
3.0,This is a cute dress and I have received compliments however it is very see through; which forces me to use it now as a house dress.
3.0,Cheap gray material<br />Already pilling<br />And only wore it once<br />Washed it once ..<br />looks like the material is poor quality...
3.0,Returned the dress.  Dress was not symetric.  Side seam on the left side of dress was tapered more than the right side.  Did not look balanced.  Otherwise it was a nice dress for the money.  I wear size 12 or 14 and ordered size xxl and the fit was good.  Just could not deal with the seam issue.
3.0,Ran too small.  Not true to size.  Get 1 size bigger if you need to buy these.  I just returned for a refund.
3.0,Tough to keep down when working out.
3.0,"Very very  cute, but I think the sizes r off, as far as the usual American woman! I should have ordered a Xlg... like most womens clothes these days (most made over seas)  it is on the small side.I should have checked the sellers line ahead so as to notice the demographic is more my 25 yr old daughters style. Collage age & younger!"
3.0,"Nice fabric and style, but  the sleeves and arm holes are super narrow, which is weird since the rest of the dress fits fine. Never had this sleeve problem before either. Oddly made dress."
3.0,That zipper makes it a challenge to close.
3.0,Earrings were well made and very pretty however the color of the morganite stones were lighter than expected
3.0,"They stay, but they do still show a bit with my ballet flats, and the band is so tight that they hurt my feet."
3.0,I love the style and the look. The only problem I have is with tightening it. The thing is very hard to open so I can make it fit. I have to have my husband do it.
3.0,Glasses and Hairbands are great but I did not receive tattoos!!! 3 days left to Valentines day!!!!
3.0,"I bought an XL since it has buttons and I always have issues in the bust area. The dress is huge, but cute with a belt. Nonetheless, even though I’m only a 36D, there is still a gap between the buttons around the bust. Also, the fabric is sheer and the threading around the buttons is already coming undone."
3.0,"It is not a loose fitting shirt like it looks. its a super plain extra long V-neck that is way too tight. And I sized up, as I always do. its not as the picture shows at all. Not worth what I paid. I can get this at the mall for 5 bucks, easily."
3.0,I ordered small and it fits like a medium
3.0,"Belt was too elastic for me. I bought the XL and it is true to size (41-45), but I had to stretch it pretty far to make it tight enough to act as a belt. If you like a loose fitting belt this could work."
3.0,Useful for work
3.0,Ordered a size small. When I received it it definitely looks just like the picture. Material is good but it runs large. If you are small in the chest area don't even spend the money. It's made for someone that is bigger in that area. The small fits like a small every Where except in the chest area!
3.0,"Cute and soft , but the fabric is slightly thinner than I expected.  Overall, not a bad garment."
3.0,"Not sure what man has this small of a wrist, but I guess coming from china, I'm not surprised.  The watch seems like good quality.  But I'm not sure how to read or set the time, and it came with no directions. Oh well, what's 10 bucks?"
3.0,It was short for some reason. I purchased the white and it was fine
3.0,the zipper was not made for big busted fitting
3.0,Received as promised in time(4weeks) pendant looks exactly like in the pic and is really pretty. The chain is dull and doesn't look new at all.
3.0,Pretty but they bend in the thinnest fabrics and pop open
3.0,"I like somewhat unusual hoodies. I like this hoodie, but would have loved it if it had a zipper and if the lining in the hood wasn't fake fur. I'm still keeping it, though. (By the way, I am a woman. I'm tall and frequently buy men's T-shirts and hoodies)."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this top.  It's just ok.  The fit is quite loose and the length is actually quite long -- could almost be a mini dress.  My biggest disappointment was the quality -- after one wear, even before the laundry, the ruffled hem was pulling away from the seam.  I can sew it to fix, but really would expect a brand new top to stay together!"
3.0,"Gorgeous top, a little lose, but I am also short"
3.0,These shorts feel super cheap. The spandex Bottom layer rides up.
3.0,"Incorrect straps were sent. I specifically got a different type because these don’t work for my application.<br /><br />Having said that, if these are what you’re looking for, general purpose, they will be fine. I’ll be trying to get the correct item."
3.0,Its just okay
3.0,The belt isn't black and brown. It's all black.
3.0,"I like the design and it looks good on. However, it clanks so loudly when you walk!!! I feel like people can hear me walking across the room when I walk with this thing on."
3.0,"I like the material and the way it would fit, but it was a lot smaller than I thought. I even bought a size up from my normal. Really tight around the chest."
3.0,Prongs catch on everything and the posts are very long.
3.0,It's a lot bigger than I expected and I didn't like that but it has a beautiful color that is just like the one online.  I don't like the fact that it only lights up for a split second. The watch is high-quality tho.
3.0,"I own both authentic and dupes; I’ve purchased nice dupes so I can use and not worry about damaging. This is a nice bag for the price; I was going to keep it until I opened it and looked at the lining. It’s an odd paper-fabric type material, pretty cheap; this diminished the experience for me so I returned. If the lining of a bag’s not important to you, this is a good buy."
3.0,Not a dark brown like the image more of a coffee. 😐
3.0,Not bad but be sure you choose a size bigger than your size or will be small! And...if you are more than 5.3 won't be a long dress. I'm 5.5. and the dress is above the ankles. Perfect for a 5.3 feet and under
3.0,"Large fit, according to the size chart provided and material was heavier and not as soft as it appeared in the picture. Otherwise will reorder in a medium. Ordered a large based on the size chart and it was huge even trying on over jeans.  I'm normally a size 4 or medium, but ordered a large due to the size chart."
3.0,Back broke after 2nd wear contacted seller for replacement no response
3.0,"We bought this product for my 11 year-old son for football. It fit as expected based on the size chart. He tried them out and after the first practice he said they were kind of itchy, and I do notice the seams are a bit rough. But if that isn’t an issue for you, these are durable and seem to be a sturdy material and would work well for sports. I do like the pocket feature."
3.0,Not American size chart.
3.0,"I really loved it, super cute with a leather belt. Obed the blue green color! Unfortunately was ripped so I sent it back."
3.0,I like this wallet. The only thing I don't like is I wish it had more places for cards. But overall I'm happy with it.
3.0,"It was fine for awhile.  I did not have the issues with reversing the buckle as others have mentioned.  However, the two layers (black and brown sides) have delaminated in less than a year."
3.0,"The charm broke off, but still a beauty"
3.0,"I purchased these for my 2.5 year old to wear to swim lessons. I needed something he could easily slip on and off. He refused to wear them and said they were “hard.” After feeling the material I can see how they might be uncomfortable to wear. Also, they run a little small so if you do decide to get some, size up."
3.0,Fades but soft and nice
3.0,"Yes hat is cute but those ear muffs sewed onto the side are really weird looking. My daughters say they look weird and would not wear a hat with them on..... so I guess we will see if this is the new fad this winter. The hat itself fits great, and keeps era warm and it is a nice color, and made well only reason it’s getting a 3 is because of the Pom on the side they make it look goofy. But if that’s your style ten I would definitely recommend this hat"
3.0,"This dress is beautiful! But it was way too big! The torso was very long and it did absolutely nothing for me. I gave it away as a gift to someone bigger than me, and it was slightly big on her."
3.0,The colors are brighter than what is shown.
3.0,They're very small and you can't really tell what color they are.  They are supper cheap so that's great.  I really just wanted the clear one so the other 6 where just nice to have as spares.
3.0,"I ordered 5 medium fedora hats at once, and all different brands. This one and another fits a bit smaller than the others.  The quality was good, just fit different. I gave it to my 11 year old son. He was very happy and it looked awesome on him.  Packaging was great, and delivery time was great."
3.0,There are different from other like a watch
3.0,"Maybe I didn't read them correctly. But the sizes aren't that different from each other. The largest isn't too large, but the smallest isn't as small as I was looking for, unfortunately."
3.0,"I haven’t the whole thing yet, my son said it’s easy reading! Plan on retaking my Real Estate exam next year!"
3.0,"I ordered this product last year and love it. I work in a high-paced environment and don't always have time to change. I went to order another to be able to switch out with. They sent the wrong item. It was the correct brand and whatnot, but the wrong style and size. I asked for a replacement, got it within 2 days, it was the wrong item, yet again. I got a 'cheeky' one for like a 13-14 and then a bikini 11-12. If it was the wrong style but fit, that would have been fine, but they were way too small to even do that. Check the item before packaging."
3.0,"Earrings themselves are fine, but I'm going to have to get new backs for them. My daughter is constantly complaining they're poking her and they're too tight."
3.0,Looks plastic instead of sterling silver.
3.0,The neck opening is a bit small. You won't be able to get the look as in the picture
3.0,"This is not a hand-dyed scarf, but it is a nice scarf of the general colors pictured. However mine is less colorful and if I wear it as shown, only the brown shows. So it is a beautiful scarf, but not what I thought I was getting. I'm a little disappointed."
3.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, but one arrived broken. In the return process now. Will be reordering"
3.0,Para la talla descrita viene muy ancho no queda como la publicación
3.0,I bought a small which was the smallest size available and it’s still too big. I will still wear it because I need it for tomorrow. But It’s possible that I may have to give this one away.
3.0,"Love these...... but, they shrank and don't fit now"
3.0,Beautiful but it is a bit heavy for a name tag and I don’t like the leathery texture.
3.0,"The material is soft, and super stretchy. Im plus size & the print of the skeleton hands do not compare to the photos. They just stay pretty small for plus size."
3.0,"Cute, lightweight, comfy. Not anti-fog. The moment I put them on to go for a bike ride in the snow I had to remove them. It was impossible to see pit of them in less than 15 seconds"
3.0,Love it but it broke already
3.0,Made very small... I can get them on and I love the concept but order a size bigger then what you are or maybe even two sizes bigger... I ordered a large I usually wear a medium and they are still small
3.0,You have to be really close. If I pull out of the driveway at all it does not work and my driveway is only a car length long. It has to be pointed right at it. Ok for price but would have chose another one if I knew.
3.0,The dress is beautiful but top part is way too thin and large. I expected it to be more fitted for the type of look and material. The lower part fits nice.
3.0,"What I liked is the size of the tag. What I did not like was on 1,  I ordered one side with capital letters for the name and lower case on the other side…..received both sides as capital letters.  A bit disappointed but the workmanship was good and the other tag was perfect."
3.0,Inferior band but watch works fine.
3.0,"I didn’t realize they were compression socks. They are way too tight for me to use. In the reviews, someone else was real happy with these socks and they said their calves were bigger size than mine. They do seem like good quality so I will donate."
3.0,Good looking shoe but way too small. Should have fit according to the size. The maker's website even says this should run 'large'. Oh well.
3.0,"These feel like tires strapped to my feet.  Very clunky, very little style.  The straps across the toes and ankle are adjustable, but the strap that connects them is a good inch too long on both shoes, so it sticks up and wiggles with every step.  Returned."
3.0,No place to insert collar stays. S*** looks nice but is not very soft and did come a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"The sizes run about one small. So, if you're looking for a XL, you'll need to get a 2X. Don't offer much support because the material is thin. So, if you're looking for something that will slim you, this probably won't do the trick."
3.0,They’re super cute but the came bent  had to fix them myself
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed because the individual  bangles are so thin, 5 in a row hardly shows up..."
3.0,Overall nice mask but one came in stained up.
3.0,It felt really light and wasn’t sturdy so I sent it back. I felt like it would get destroyed just from everyday use. It looked as pictured though. People who are more careful with their jewelry may consider this product but I am not one of those people.
3.0,Wore this for my bachelorette at a music festival. I was worried it would be see through but it wasn’t too bad. I’m 5’4 125 pounds and I got a size small. I still had some room and could’ve gotten an XS but didn’t want it to be too short.
3.0,I didn't like the colors.
3.0,I wore it for a day and my wrist broke out in a rash. Not sure if it’s the material or the friction
3.0,"This set is okay, but not as comfortable as others that I've purchased. It does not have much stretch in it and the shirt unbuttons when I'm asleep."
3.0,"I bought this dress for an ugly sweater Christmas party. Living in Florida, I personally thought it was too warm for an actual sweater so I figured this would be a good alternative to stay in the festive spirit. The dress arrived on time but it did have a weird smell to it. I washed it and it went away but I found that strange. The dress itself was very long and I'm 5'7&#34;. I purchased the pattern 8 that looked like a Christmas tree and actually ended up altering it so it had a scoop neckline and I cut off about 1.5 feet of fabric from the bottom so it hit just above my knees. Overall, it wasn't bad for the price I paid, especially since I altered it a bit to make it look more flattering but for those ladies with longer torsos, know that the waistline sits kind of high; it ended up coming in right about at the bottom of my bra than my actual waist so it definitely has more of an empire style than it looks in the picture and it kind of flares out a little in the front."
3.0,"to small, only complaint"
3.0,A lot bigger then expected :(
3.0,"I ordered these glasses, and they are nice"
3.0,Was big for me since it was small. It does look fancy dress as in pic.
3.0,"I ordered an XXL which would normally swamp me (anticipating expanding baby bump). These are tight. Very thin material, but not so thin you can see through. They are comfortable, however, so I will give them a shot."
3.0,"I don't understand why but arm area really hard to get on to shoulder . Hurt my arm doing it ,"
3.0,Item is not like the picture :(
3.0,The jacket seemed like it could have been decent. I ordered a 2xl (which is the largest they offer) but it fits more like 1xl. Return shipping costs more than the coat did. The company gave me a $20.00 rebate to keep it. So I have a brand new jacket I can't use. Oh and it has some random patches I don't remember seeing.
3.0,"It fit great, and looked good too but after a few hours of wear it ripped."
3.0,"The shoe quality is fine for the price and my son likes them but I would NOT purchase these again. The back strap seems a bit big or streatched out, resulting in the shoes slipping off frequently even when the other straps are tight (and the shoes are half to a full size smaller than he typically wears)!"
3.0,There's absolutely no stretch to these pants. Had me on my feelings lol. I ordered the size I normally wear and could barely button them.
3.0,"The material was nice,  but I sized up and still the bottoms were too small.  There was too much space for the slit area. Didn't look good"
3.0,"Nice for a ""first"" jersey really thin material, almost feels cheap for the price."
3.0,Not intended for people with small wrists
3.0,So I had not touched my Amazon in so long and this purchase was from like...a decade ago. I no longer own these gloves but when I did have them they were alright. They got the job done but could have been more comfortable.
3.0,"It’s ok. I’m usually a 2x in tops. I ordered 3x in this hoodie and it’s not tight but it’s not the fit I was hoping for. It’s an average length hoodie and fitted around the hips, while the sleeves are huge. The color (solid purple) is nice."
3.0,"These glasses fit well and fold without problem, and they are clear and look good. The frames are covered with a material that keeps them from slipping. The only problem is the case. They fold up compactly, but the case is twice as thick as necessary, making a bulge in your pocket, perhaps not a problem in a large purse, but in a pocket they are annoying. The case could have been much slimmer and still protect the glasses. I tried to return them, but was going to be charged half the cost of the glasses, so it wasn't worth it."
3.0,"I like the bracelet and I wear it a lot, but the clasp on the outside does not stay hooked. The inside clasp holds well though, so I haven't had a problem with it falling off."
3.0,Smaller than described. Sleeves not sherpa lined.
3.0,Tight in sleeves and bust
3.0,I got the right size. Fit loose on top and slightly loose on size. Although the washing directions say wash separately and Dry Clean. I washed and Dryed inside out (to protect design) on cold wash and low heat. So far it has not gotten smaller. It may turn out different if you have hard water. Then I would hand wash inside out and air dry.
3.0,Not sure If it was my mistake but the size I received were way too small for my son. They did look great though!
3.0,No front pockets. Booo!
3.0,I'm 5'2 129lbs and I purchased a small. This dress fits like a medium. It's a bit lose on me. In person it's just ok looking. But a good dress for the price.
3.0,"Bought as part of a costume for a fun underwear run. Fit well. But the fabric on the bottom flipped inside out while sitting and running so it rubbed my thighs, not a comfortable feeling!"
3.0,"I'm 5'2'' and fairly think (dress size 2). I thought I bought a small, but the jacket says &#34;M&#34; on it, but it doesn't fit how a medium would fit me. It fits how a small would fit me: too long for my liking, but I tend to like things to fit smaller/shorter since I'm short. I like this jacket, I wear it a lot, it's nice to have a black jacket to pair with different outfits. It is VERY thin though, provides no warmth at all (similar to a thin windbreaker). Definitely more of a spring jacket than a fall jacket."
3.0,"They are super cute, but I believe run small. They were wayyyyy to narrow and I could not even my foot in.<br />I wear size 10, all my shows are size 10~~~!! Super ad they didn't kit, but may give another try if they have 11's for sale as welll."
3.0,Good product but it's my fault for ordering the wrong size I'm a medium and I will be returning the product because I don't believe the XL will fit as the large did not. The skirt may fit you but I have Thicc legs so the skirt did not fit at all in comparison to the top kind of fitting. Would just recommend getting the ones with those with the bows not using a bow and make a red ribbon.
3.0,"We had lots of fun to used them in party and took lots of fun pictures with them. Some glitters came out, but didn't effect us at all."
3.0,"For the price of this dress, it is cute. The top seems to be a faded red, especially in comparison to the bright red of the tutu. The tutu began falling apart (fishing line coming out) after being washed once and several hours of wearing. If you can get the fishing line out it would probably last a few wears."
3.0,Somewhat small at the shoulders and upper arms.
3.0,Nice quality. Runs very small
3.0,"The actual dress is a bright coral color, much too flashy for my taste.  The product photos show a muted, pinkish-mauve.  The colors look cheap in person."
3.0,"My child says this is the &#34;best present ever.&#34;  Very happy he can charge them.  We have only had them a little while, but so far, very happy.<br /><br />UPDATE: He gets a lot of compliments on these sneakers, but sadly, one of them does not charge up.  I gave them to him a while after I purchased them, so, I do not think I could return them.  So, we only had a working pair for a brief while.  He liked them a lot though."
3.0,Socks were no easier to put on or take off than any other compression socks I own!
3.0,"I'm normally a size 6, so I read reviews and ordered the medium in the scalloped black. When I tried them on, the cutout detailing was higher than expected, and it was halfway up my butt cheek. They'll be okay to wear at the beach, but I definitely still need to find a pair of black shorts for everyday wear this summer"
3.0,It actually fits perfect but thought it would cover my ears. Also its less &#34;put together&#34; than the picture. Would have looked at others better.
3.0,"Really adorable dress. The wrap around leaves little to the imagination. If you are small chested, order a size down."
3.0,"ya le quedaron chicos, le aprietan, pues los usa con casco, hay forma de devolverlos?"
3.0,It's roomy and the letters are too far right.  I keep having to adjust them to be in the center of my chest.  But it's comfortable and a cute design.
3.0,Cute bathing suit style but the bottoms are a little small and the top is shorter than expected for a crop top. Seems like good quality material.
3.0,"I am learning that I have to really pay attention to how items look, size etc.  The picture looked like a heart but they actually look like triangles. I returned them."
3.0,I wanted to love the dress. I'm a size 8 (155lbs) normally fit medium/large sizes. I ordered this dress twice (Large & XL) both were too small for me. The dress doesn't wrap around all the way and the material is VERY thin (like see through). I returned both dresses. It's beautiful but I won't order again.
3.0,I like this shirt - the fabric falls well and the cut is flattering.  The only issue that I have is the thinness/sheerness of the fabric. The product description said that it was a casual work shirt and not too sheer.  I would only wear this with a camisole and would not wear it to work myself.
3.0,"Honestly a cute dress for the price, but if you have big boobs it’s probably a no go. I put it on and you could see the sides of my boobs. I’m also a 38DDD though, so maybe it be a lot cuter on someone with a smaller chest. Lol otherwise cute"
3.0,for the size I wish there was a different size for it because it is really big on my face and keep on slipping off my nose and going near my neck more. It is comfortable but it just way to big. Would buy it again if there was a different size.
3.0,These are not over the knee socks. They are over the calf socks!
3.0,Nice but big.
3.0,Didn’t think it was going to be as bulky as it was
3.0,"Sizes run small, I tore out the backside seam the 2nd day I wore them. Order a larger size than you need!"
3.0,I like the quality of the shirt but the men's version was more durable.
3.0,Should have gotten a size bigger fits small.
3.0,"Ordered a size up as others recommended, but the cup size is really what got me. They include a nice little extended for the back, but the straps are a little snug even when the loosened up to the most they can go. I do like the no-underwire, but with the cup size not being a bit bigger and the straps a little short, it feels like if I stretch my arms up the bra may slip up and over. Will continue to see how it does in my everyday activities"
3.0,the facing in the cut out is constantly creeping up.  Every time I look down it's showing.  Will not lay flat.
3.0,"The top on this swimsuit is very difficult to keep up.  There is no halter neck string and it is not at all supportive.  However, the bottoms are quite cute. I would give them a 5! For the price, this swimsuit is definitely worth the cost.  The seller is quite awesome to work with."
3.0,"The watch itself is attractive but the watch band clasp is a disaster. It releases at odd moments and since the watch is very light weight the wearer often will not realize that the watch is no longer on the wrist. So far I have lucky and noticed the issue early and am now somewhat paranoid so I keep checking, but this should not be necessary. In addition to the clasp release issue it is essentially impossible to move the mating part of the band to shorter or lengthen the effective size to accommodate larger or smaller wrists.<br /><br />UPDATE: The clasp again failed and this time after the watch hit the ground it no longer works. Strongly suggest you not purchase this product."
3.0,I wish it was a bit longer in the back.
3.0,"Only lasted about 1 1/2 months before the clasp broke. It was perfect for my 9yo daughter, but I spent just a few dollars more & bought an Armitron that has held up nicely."
3.0,"Holds well, the silicon stripping is a bit agressive and pulls hair pretty badly."
3.0,They shrunk considerably after washing.
3.0,I like the sweater but I ordered the recommended size and it’s tight around my mid section. Good quality material but order a size up for sure
3.0,Comfortable for my granddaughter
3.0,Cool looking very cool looking but very poorly made and the ends that sits on your ears where to different ends. I guess I was sent a pair that was placed in the defective pile of the warehouse
3.0,I tried the jacket on and was thrilled....but I didn't zip it up until I wore it out and that's when I realized the zipper was stuck and would only zip in one direction.
3.0,"Save your money, waaaay too big. Adorable but just too big, definitely not gonna wear them out in public I feel like people would make fun of me. They also don’t feel that great of quality for the price, but also not complete garbage. Just don’t buy them save your money I think most of the glasses this company makes are too big."
3.0,I ordered this top in pink which is actually more of a peach color. I liked the color and the fabric; it’s very light. I don’t like how this top fits as it’s tight in the sleeves and chest. I’d suggest ordering a size up to get a loose fit or order your usual size for fitted.
3.0,"Fits nicely, but the material is so cheap looking I was a little taken aback when I received my order, simply because A. The color isn’t the same as the photo and B. The quality looks a lot nicer in pictures lol. Overall it’s cute but eh. Thin material."
3.0,"I ordered two of these shirts a few months apart, same size and style and they are not even close to being the same product. Different fit, different material, the only thing that was the same was the tag."
3.0,Super warm but these wore put quickly and tore after a few weeks of use
3.0,Returning runs small
3.0,This bag is basic and cheaply made.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,Only the top was delivered even though the ad clearly says two-piece. It fits and is fine but half the product is missing!
3.0,"I loved this dress but the waist sat very high for me. As others have said, the fabric was pretty stiff as well."
3.0,Looks nice but definitely did not fit my Michael Kors Bradshaw Access watch like it advertises.
3.0,Both were broke first day very thin plastic .
3.0,"Cute bracelets, but they break easily.  I wish the clasp were more sturdy."
3.0,"Took extremely long to even start shipping. Make sure you know these things are about the size of a quarter - like guages; My GF can't really use them, but if you're okay with huge ear rings, then these are a nice, cute pair of ear rings"
3.0,"It's very pretty. The only problem is that the neck stretched out after about 4 months, and I had to get rid of it."
3.0,the numbers are just way too small to read
3.0,I like the jacket but two of the buttons were ripped out when I opened the box. Kinda disappointed about that.
3.0,"I was unsatisfied with the material, a nice blend of fine cotton, wool, and or cashmere - would have made this an awesome pullover sweater. The image makes this pullover look like a fine wear, but in the hand the material looks and feels like a sweat-shirt. I wanted a fine wear pullover sweater, not a sweat-shirt. Over all, its abit thick for my taste, but a nice cut pullover.<br /><br />Antonius"
3.0,I would go up a size or two
3.0,"The mask looks great not worn, but my only complain is that the mouth hole is too big for my chin, leaving a gap between the mask and my chin, the mask was hard to put on,and the eye holes you can barely see out of. I was expecting that the white eyes would be like one way white sun glasses, so that would be a great improvement. Thank you Narikiri for the wonderful sculpted facial features; that was my favorite part of the mask!"
3.0,Looks good on. Materials that it is made of are very inexpensive but it did not cost very much.
3.0,Way too large in all the wrong places. I love the feel and I would love the look I just have to exchange for a medium. Now mind you I am 5 foot 7 and I'm pregnant and weigh 170 pounds and I got the large it was too big on me.
3.0,These shorts are way too small. The X-LRG is actually a 30-32&#34; waist size. I wished they would make a larger size for big men. The only way I can wear them is to cut the waist band on the sides a little. My waist as 33-34&#34; and they fit better with the two sides notched.<br />The good part of my rating is they are very comfortable in the crouch and are very cool.
3.0,Not very breathable compared to other masks.
3.0,The face makes it a little hard to tell the time.  However I do like the design and the look of the watch over
3.0,"It's an expensive funny looking piece of paper!  If it works, I'll never know, but it's in my wallet now."
3.0,"Like these, but hella tight, hard to get on.  I ordered large, am size 10."
3.0,"I loved this when I saw it, and the reviews were so stunning I had to give it a try.  When it arrived, the first thing I noticed is that the buttons were round.  That was a bummer, but not a big deal.  I tried to put it on and...yikes.  It was so tight!  I went by the measurements in the description, as well as the reviews, and for me, it just didn't work.  I wasn't able to get it over my bust, and the shoulders were very tight.  I wished I'd known this before I bought, and I'd have purchased it in two sizes larger.  I bet then it would've been perfect.  I'm hoping the seller will decide to offer more sizes again soon."
3.0,Too tight by the big toe
3.0,Fit very tight could be a little more relaxed. I wish I could order a larger size.
3.0,The slits on the side are pretty high and the dress faded.
3.0,Legs are long and wide. Waist band is thin
3.0,However it's kind of short on the sleeves. And see through. Not 100% what I was expecting. But still looks nice.
3.0,"It's a super cute top, but I ordered a medium and it is still too small I normally am a small in US sizes. It's pretty though, was affordable so I'll probably give it to my daughter."
3.0,"Let's light in, otherwise good mask"
3.0,"The colors are not what they appear in the picture. 2 are pinks, 1 is a blue, NO browns. The shadow stays on really well and I like it but was not at all the colors I thought I was getting"
3.0,Shirt itself felt cheap after one wash
3.0,And looks cheap .. you  get what you pay for I guess …the robe and shorts fit but my breasts bust the top wide open when I tried it on 😂😅 order the next size up…I usually wear a large
3.0,The frames are very lightweight and thin and will have to be carefully cared for in order to not break. The heart lens are a good size.  I'm  doubtful that these will protect from sun or glare but I purchased these for a fashion statement only and for that reason I would recommend. My next purchase I will look for a  brand that has a sturdier frame and polarized lens.
3.0,"Very cute, feminine, Alittle tight on top"
3.0,The dress was a great shape and the color was amazing. Unfortunately for me the fit made me look heavy so in the end I returned the dress. The dress was made well and the price was great. I just wish it fit my body better.
3.0,first one i recieved was so small in the bust .. so i ordered the next size and returned the first . 2cnd one is very large and flowy but fits in the bust ... i kept it .. not sure it will be a favorite .. wouldnt purchase again ..
3.0,The dress is comfortable and not a cheap looking dress but I ordered a XXL and that’s the size a wear but was too small
3.0,"They are good for a one time use for a costume or something,  but they started ripping as soon as I took them off"
3.0,The quality was beautiful and was an amazing coat just way too small
3.0,Very tight around baby's head. 🙁
3.0,The charm is nice looking. The sizing is a little hard and doesn’t transfer when printed so you have to mess with it.
3.0,"Pretty ring really wanted a new moonstone, ordered a large size 9 for the finger I wanted and it was only a small 8. otherwise would have given 5 stars"
3.0,I love flying monkeys but these are not the color in the ad and oddly high waisted.
3.0,The sweater is so thin its almost see through and pants are thin also the best part is the denim shirt its thin but it's a nice button down for a child
3.0,"I ordered two of these so I could mimic the style shown in the picture. One of them came broken. I suspect it was packaged broken because one link had fallen off, but there was only one circle connector in the bag instead of the two needed to put it back on. It should be an easy fix, but it shouldn't have to be fixed. Also, it twists easily, so I'm not sure that it will hold up well.<br /><br />The reason I still decided to give it a 3 is because although I was underwhelmed when I took it out of the bag, once I put it in my hair, I LOVED it. It is very elegant with just enough sparkle to catch the eye. It also manages to be exactly the right size for my head. I'm able to do some really lovely headband styles I've been wanting to do, but other bands are too big or too small to work well. Obviously, that's a pretty personal thing, but the other nice thing is that if it's too big for your head, it's easy to remove a link.<br /><br />If it holds up, this will definitely be one of my favorites.<br /><br />Hopefully they will replace the broken one. I'll update here if they make that hard, otherwise you can assume they were on top of it. Still very frustrating given how long it has to take to ship in the first place."
3.0,Cheap material but I love the style.
3.0,material does not feel right.  too thin and too loose at the chest
3.0,"These work ok for close work, but the distance feature is worthless. They are pretty, though, and I carry them as my spare."
3.0,"I wanted to wear this to a (casual) wedding but the quality is not as good as I expected. I'll keep it for just casual outings. The color was a little brighter and less rich than I was hoping. I'm 5'6"" and the sinch on me is mid abdomen rather than waist, which for my body type doesn't look as good as I'd hoped but I still like the print and it was a good deal so I'm not going to return it."
3.0,handle stitching is poor
3.0,"It is a pretty dress and the size recommend was correct. Except the arm loops were so small!! They didn't look good at all!<br />I contemplated on keeping the dress and cutting the loops off. But I am barely 5foot tall and even with 3 inch wedges on the length of the back was entirely too long for me!<br />If you are tall and have either thin arms or cut the arm loops off..... this would be a nice dress, for summer."
3.0,Very stylish but lenses are not clear they should<br />Work ok quality of lense
3.0,Cute decently made but pretty see-through however less apparent when it’s on. I’m 5’5 135lbs and I bought the medium and it’s a little big but the small Would’ve been too small.....I like think it’s cute but need something more opaque so I’ll return it
3.0,"Big whale tail. I'd say near quarter sized. I actually like it, but the chain isn't up to par. Summary: I like the whale tail, but the chain has a real cheap look to it.  Works out for me, because I have a silver chain that needs a whale tale charm! ;) Chain was taken off long time ago, but whale tail did not fare so well. If your looking for costume jewelry you won't be disappointed. It's silver toned, definately not silver..."
3.0,I believe this product was meant for a child.  It was too small.
3.0,"I bought one of these for my mom as a gift and when I received it, it was SO soft that I decided to get one for myself as well! I've loved it, but after not having it for very long, one of the pockets started coming apart at the seam. As of now the pocket is hanging halfway off and it can't be used. I can't sew, so I plan to get someone in my family to hopefully sew it up for me and then hope it doesn't start falling apart in other areas! Other than that issue, it is very soft and comfy, it fits well, and it's a good weight...not too heavy/hot and not too lightweight. Just right!"
3.0,Chain is too small for wrist..... and looks pretty cheap.
3.0,"They serve their purpose, keeping my legs warm under my pants above my boots.<br />My calves are wide and they snapped as I pulled them up."
3.0,Nice shoes but too small
3.0,"So I wanted a pretty watch band for my smart watch. Thus is just that. However, I could t add or remove links enough to make the fit right for keeping the watch in place, and the sensor close enough to my wrist without moving all over the place. Thus would be a great swap out band for a nice occasion probably, but everyday wear I don't see this working out. Not to mention to get it as tight as I could, it was a two person job to secure the clasp because after 5 minutes of that whole game I was mad. So great concept, but I don't see how this would be functional for everyday wear. Overall I love the band. Seems fairly solid and secure. Just not happy that I couldn't get it to be tight enough on my wrist to not move around all over the place."
3.0,Stop is a little annoying but do able
3.0,I like the shirt but is not long like in the photo. It is a short fit. Does not cover my bottom with leggings on. Also has threads coming out on the sleeve.
3.0,it's a little &#34;frumpy&#34; on me....it's a cute top but I feel a little frumpy in it.
3.0,"Good bang-for-the-buck, quality-wise.  Very clear, non distorting plastic lenses.  I will keep these.<br /><br />However, the yellow tint is so subtle on these glasses, as to be almost ineffective for applications like night driving.  If you're looking for selective-yellow glasses for night driving, keep shopping.<br /><br />RayB"
3.0,Doesn’t fit properly. Too tight. I’m xl.
3.0,Thin shirt but with a tank underneath I was able to wear it in confidence.
3.0,Bought for the pool to prevent pool toe but they are hard to swim in and kept pulling my son down. He refused to wear them and would rather have the pool toe. Would be better if hiking or walking near the water.
3.0,Very nice belt but doesn't wrap around whole waist
3.0,"Received purse, its smaller than I thought. Don't get me wrong its cute, I love it but it made for just your wallet, keys, some make up, sunglasses, small items, If you carry a lot of things, then this is not for you."
3.0,"A little shorter on the thigh than I'd Iike, but they're an okay buy."
3.0,"The fabric is soft, which I like, but the product seems large. I was expecting something more elastic and thicker. I would have preferred that the bow was stitched. Also the elastic band is not wide enough and flips around. The boys seem to like the pattern."
3.0,Beautiful sandals run small so I ordered one size up.
3.0,"Fit true to size. One time use at water park tho, they started to fray really bad and will have a hole in toe of shoe by end of trip. Might work better for pool use only. Kids get very comfortable in them tho, fit like a sock"
3.0,"It is a pretty blouse in a good price. I love the color and fit perfectly for me . The only one reason it need to go back is the material. It is very thin and I think it will get crinkle easy , too sad ."
3.0,Cute but the large was really big
3.0,"This ring is okay.  The material looks cheap (black gives off a shiny plastic look).  The edges are rough and scrape against the side of my fingers quite a bit.  I can't wear it for long periods of time.<br /><br />I can't tell if it's comfort-fit or standard-fit.  The interior is curved as if it's comfort-fit, but not very much like other comfort-fit rings I have.<br /><br />The spinning part makes a screeching sound.  Makes me really want to spray some WD40 lubricant in there."
3.0,Pant is to poor quality for the price after two wash the pant color vanished and you can be able to see through it.I don’t recommended..
3.0,Small but nice bag .
3.0,It's smaller than I expected ! I would rather pay more money to have the shoes bigger!  Still cute though!
3.0,"Looks better online, the rhinestones are very cheap looking. They fit well."
3.0,"They do seem to run small, I ordered a large (I wear size 11/13) and they'll work but they are pretty tight.  The lining is strange to me, there is a panel of white fabric on the inside of the entire front half of the shorts. Over all they're just okay.<br /><br />I haven't worn them swimming yet, if there's anything noteworthy after I do, I'll update."
3.0,"I got a medium, and it was very baggy. Didn't mind the extra room but it looked saggy on me. If I got a size smaller, it might have shown my underwear lines. I don't like to wear pantyhose since it's hot weather where I live."
3.0,The shirt I ordered was a mens US XL but barely even fit my buddy who wear US Mens Smalls. Very small shirts. Not recommended for any one over 5' 10&#34; and ~180LBS+
3.0,its a little on the low quality side but its great for being in a hat collection
3.0,This face mask is a little cumbersome feeling.  I like the charcoal insert but does make mask feel heavier while wearing.
3.0,"You bought these because Fallout is awesome and you like quirky fun stuff- 4 stars<br />You bought socks to be comfy on your feet- 2 stars<br /><br />They're super thin, really tight and not stretchy, like cheap dress socks. The image on the socks isnt mirrored  per sock so it looks kinda weird. They are thin like the socks you've had for 4 years that are about to have a hole show  up. So, as far as socks performance go: they're doodoo, 2 stars. As far as neat socks go: 4 stars."
3.0,Very cute but tassel fell off one the first night I wore them.
3.0,"Runs very small. It's a super cute pattern, but the scarf was far too small as was the bath. The gloves were the only comfortable item. I returned."
3.0,Was very small.  Tail was very short.  It served its purpose for school but quality was disappointing.
3.0,Cheap looking.  Does not look like the ad at all. Would not buy again.
3.0,"The shoes come with no size markings anywhere.  Not on the inside, tongue, sole.  No tags.<br />The inside of one of the shoes is worn, with the writing rubbed away like someone wore them and returned them."
3.0,Powers way to low on it. Needs a much stronger output
3.0,was a little loose on my wrist but very pretty
3.0,"kind of narrow, otherwise would be cozy and cute on the foot."
3.0,This hat is cute but a little bit on the smaller<br />Side
3.0,Can't remove enough links to make it fit.
3.0,"Wrong size was sent. Said they were 44 waist but got 42s. Luckily they still fit, just a bit snug. I didnt want to go through the process of returning them though, the shorts are great, but wrong size sent thats why I'm leaving a 3 star review."
3.0,Not what I expected at all. Cut short and its made from tee shirt material not of great quality.<br />Shipped fast tho.
3.0,The colors shown are not the colors I recieved. I like the bandannas but disappointed about the color swap
3.0,"These pant are NOT “fleece lined” they are just a single layer of soft sweatpants material. I was anticipating them to be a double layer with the fleece inside for warmth. That being said, they’re super cute and pretty flattering but not what I was looking for."
3.0,These are nice but definitely size way up!!
3.0,The waist line is so high that it makes (even a size 2 like me) look chubby.
3.0,"The quality wasn’t bad but the tunic was more like a dress, past my knees, then a tunic! The material was different too! Like a nylon not cotton"
3.0,Only because my daughter likes it did I give you a 3. It does not fit like it looks on the model.
3.0,Would’ve been better quality if the skirt was adjustable. Super cute it just doesn’t fit.
3.0,"Item is not true to size as described in the details. Order at least one size larger, if not two."
3.0,"These masks are bright and cheerful. As cute as they are, they do not breathe whatsoever. I must wear masks at work, however, I am unable to wear these masks for very long because I sweat terribly. I will need to stick to masks that are 100% cotton."
3.0,These jeans are nice but there is one problem they are to tight around my knee and sinches above the knee area about mid thigh.  The waist line fits perfectly but they are tighter than expected in the mid thigh area to the point where I feel like if i move my leg or bend it the wrong way they will rip. They come longer than I expected and I am 6 ft 3 weighing 331 lbs but I wish there was a way to loosen the mat specific area. I will try wearing them  little more and see if they loosen up there.
3.0,"They kind of feel like it is a slip material... Like I need to be wearing these under a dress or something.  Because of this, I won't wear this in public, probably just around the house."
3.0,"These are cute but smaller than I thought, like for a little girl"
3.0,Would be rated higher but unpleasant odor is noticeable even after several days of airing out.  Some improvement being seen and hope that it will be gone soon.  Otherwise the sweater in nice. It did take a very long  time to be delivered and missed Christmas as a gift
3.0,I cannot recommend. lining wants to come out of fingers when removing. no warmer that thinsulate winter gloves i got for $7
3.0,"The ring is to bulky, but the necklace and earrings are good"
3.0,These were purchased over the summer to play in the pool with. My kids found that they fogged easily and filled with water. Glad I didn't pay much money for them. They are just OK.
3.0,"The torso was comfortable enough but the sleeves and length of the shirt are crazy long. I know I'm on the shorter side (5'2"") but this seems a tad excessive. Will be returning"
3.0,I bought a size medium and it was big on me
3.0,"So most of the cages that came in this pack were decent, however the one I really wanted to wear, the tree of life, you cant get on a chain, not unless it was just fishing line with no clasp which was very disappointing"
3.0,"These are cute and worked for what we needed them for. The problem is like other reviews have said that the jewel pops off, and the finger chain breaks."
3.0,"I ordered this as part of a costume and it went great with it. The issue is after I washed it, cold water hung to dry, it shrank a lot. It fit me to tight and the fabric does not stretch any and made it uncomfortable to move at times. Order a size big."
3.0,"The bottoms might be okay, not sure in the water if they would stay up but the top doesn't fit right, it's too big around and it would definitely come up in the water! Bummed"
3.0,"These seem to be good quality sunglassses overall. However, my specific interest was in improving vision at night. I did not notice that they lenses had any effect."
3.0,hard to put it on
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than I wear. Items fit but are VERY snug.
3.0,Apparently the granddaughter remains in one mood for great lengths of time.
3.0,I had this hat a while back and mine was stolen. I was looking to replace it but the fit doesn't seem the same  The stitched the 'hem' at the base is about 2 inches and the seam is visible on the forehead which is a bit awkward. Color is slightly off white and otherwise a good product.
3.0,The top is a cute style. I wear it for work in the summer. However it started to fade immediately once it washed washed.
3.0,Runs very small. I’m 5’-10” and 175 lbs. the xl was too small and short on the leg length. Should have bought the xxl. The reflective patches fell off after one wash.
3.0,"I ordered it sizing up as this is made in china, but the arm hols were too big. I  gave it to a friend that is broader in the shoulders. It also wasn't as long as in the picture."
3.0,"I have larger thighs, and so I figured by getting an extra large, I would be safe. Not the case. Literally every part of these pants fit except for the thighs. I could even close the waist but just couldn't get them over midthigh. I am so upset! These are super cute pants and are great quality so I was really excited about them. Really bummed, not everyone has flamingo legs!"
3.0,"The clarity is great, seems durable enough, and they fit onto most glasses. Thing to be concerned with is the clip... It's like a giant potato chip bag clip on your face. Don't know how long the flip-up mechanism will last, but they get the job done."
3.0,it is both too small and too bulky for me--probably better fit for a pre-teen
3.0,"I am 5'10 and about 150 pounds i ordered the large and they are the perfect tightness, but they are about 4 inches too short so i have to roll them up so they don't look nerdy. Besides that though they are pretty nice!"
3.0,They're good pants but they look super wide leg on me because my waist is too curvy for the medium. I'm not trying to discourage anybody from buying them but if you have bigger curves then size up probably.
3.0,The shirt is so cute but way too small. I ordered a size up and I still had to return it. It is very form fitting and snug. I prefer loose fitting clothes so this was awful on me.
3.0,"Cute dress but definetly need to size up so you dont feel squished...The scalloped part by the chest is white under, thin material but overall fun dress"
3.0,A fun addition to a party if it had lasted. The boys really liked and then it broke. Bummer
3.0,"I was looking for more installation, sent it back."
3.0,"I was super excited for this dress but when i tried it on it wasn’t very stretchy (a personal preference!) and if you have a big butt like me your cheeks will definitely show a bit due to the transparent top layer of the dress. It’s really cute though, I just wasn’t a big fan of the fit. :)"
3.0,"I love the ease of this oversized cotton dress. I thought I ordered a purple tone, what arrived is more neon pink. Still, it's comfy. I won't wear it as often because of the color. Not sheer or see-through."
3.0,Very pretty ring. Possibly even prettier in person. But the sizing is off. That is a big deal for me.
3.0,"Not true to size. I normally wear XL but this dress was too small and short. I’m 5’7 , 215lbs"
3.0,Fits well but not shiny like In the pic
3.0,"Watch band is of good quality and with the tools provided, it is easy to change the length of the band.  For some reason, whenever I am not bending my wrist, just walking along, the band will pop open and my fit bit almost falls off.  I have tried to replicate this by twisting my wrist all around, shaking my arm, everything and it stays on there.  But then, when I am not paying attention, it just pops open.  Very frustrating.  Over all, it is a nice watch band."
3.0,"It's cute for a knock off. I felt the lettering on the back was a little too low. Other than that, an easy shirt to just throw on."
3.0,Color and material not quality and it fits too smal
3.0,"They were hard to make fit, but were good for a laugh."
3.0,"The stitching of the green piping around the opening came loose almost immediately, and the fabric on the footbed peeled off after two uses.  The footbed is also not firmly attached, so it pulls halfway out of the shoe when I pull my feet out.<br /><br />All that being said, the rubber is great and the layers seem solidly bonded together.  They work for what they do despite the flaws.  The sole is thick enough but very flexible, so I would not feel comfortable using these on a ladder, etc, where you need solid footing.  Your feet shift and turn inside the shoe since it's so soft and flexible.  They get a bit hot after a while, but not as much as you'd think given they don't breathe (inherently).  Would still recommend to a friend."
3.0,"Its a decent hat, but the print on the hat is not good. The print is grainy and looks like it been through a dryer for years. Overall meh wouldn't recommend"
3.0,I love them! But some have weird places where its cut weird and on some quite a bit of hair came out when I tried brushing the kinda like it was shedding
3.0,"Ordered this for my 4 year old. The waist was teeny tiny and the hips were super baggy. It looked someone had just scaled down the the ""ideal woman"" figure with no regards to any real child's measurements. I ended up having to sew two gussets in the side so she can breathe while wearing it. She does love playing in it though."
3.0,"Not a huge fan of this necklace, as the chain is very uncomfortable to wear. The package also smelled a little funny when it came in, but I guess that's what you expect for the price."
3.0,"Im a solid 36” waist, maybe a 37”, and I have to have this belt fully out and it’s still a bit too tight. They should have two sizes. Good construction and it doesn’t chafe."
3.0,too short. had to return. but i am 5.10 so it will be better for someone a bit shorter
3.0,Although this bathing suit is awesome...it is way too small. I'm usually a Medium and ordered a Large but the bust area is too small for me. Some may like their boobs hanging out but for me I like to be fully covered. It fits everywhere else except the bust area. Will be ordering an XL and take in it.
3.0,It's decent quality. I would buy a size up if you plan on drying it. Runs small and shrinks quite a bit.
3.0,"the cape did not come in the color I picked, it was also somewhat small in the shoulders for the size i ordered."
3.0,"It's a really nice looking bag. Cheap material though so I don't expect it to last very long, but I shall enjoy it while I can."
3.0,"This jacket is much warmer than you'd expect.<br />However:<br />- You can tell it's a cheaply made overseas jacket. This jacket is sold by several names on amazon.<br />- It's not flattering at all. It looks very loose in the waist, has the fabric of a windbreaker (so it makes noise when it rubs against itself), and simply looks like the type of jacket a dad would wear with his light blue jeans and white New Balance shoes."
3.0,beautiful piece! but it was missing a stone and I have started the return process. I will order for the same thing again and hopefully the new piece is not missing any stones.
3.0,"Great for a ONE time ocasion, looks great once you get the tangles out. Then stays on a few minutes then breaks.... but low price"
3.0,Product runs small. i am 5'4 140lb 36 DD
3.0,"This sweater would work if you are looking for the look of a turtleneck without any bulk. The size is a tad restrictive for me not to mention short for my tastes on length. As an undergarment for layering it would be okay. The material is thin and requires hand washing which, I try not to buy garments that require extra care.. no care to on the garment which is not a good thing if others help with laundry. I would not gift this ."
3.0,tear after 1 time use
3.0,Quality was decent for the price. However the the item runs smaller than anticipated. Will have to return and purchase larger size.
3.0,clip difficult to make work
3.0,I don't like the writing all over it.
3.0,Love the price for the quantity however luckily there were more than one because the first one didn’t fit my glasses and snapped immediately. They fit certain glasses not all.
3.0,Cute but is wayyyyy too big. So I can’t use it.
3.0,"Order three pair, they may or may not fit. Of the three pair I received, to wear the same size and fit fine; the third pair was at least a full size smaller.  Take that into consideration when thinking you’re getting a deal."
3.0,The hand gloves were not the one shown in the photo.
3.0,"Not as cute as pictured, but it's alright."
3.0,"Nice dress, high quality, but runs very small. I read many of the ratings and ordered a size up just to have extra room, but the dress JUST fits and is even just a tad snug in the waist area. I didn't notice until after I tried the dress on that 50+% of the customers stated that it ran small."
3.0,Pretty to look at but many of the backs quickly slide off for no reason.  Often lose both the earring and the back within the first few hours wearing them. Disappointed.
3.0,"Very elegantly styled, well worth the price.  The only draw back is that necklace was too short.  I will have to get an extension in order to wear it."
3.0,The pants and shirt run a little small. Pants were too short for my guy (5yrsOld ) and the sleeves on the shirt were short as well.<br />My son is pretty average in build
3.0,gloves were to big hat to small
3.0,Comfortable and cute for a little girl.
3.0,"It's really cute and very well made but the top is waaay smaller than the bottom. If you're bottom heavy and small up top it should fit you perfect. But I had a lot, a lot of spillage. But I like it enough to buy another top maybe 2 sizes up"
3.0,"These were great socks, but definitely not comparable to shoe size. Way too small!"
3.0,"Love the print and size but the material of this bag is so thin,  specially at the back portion,  the front portion I think was reinforced by the fact that the printed part was painted on it, the back portion however is so flimsy that i feel like a book might actually start poking out of it after a few regular use."
3.0,"Super cute, but the XXL fits like a medium."
3.0,Really cute! Need one size smaller.
3.0,"I love this hat though my grand daughter will not be able to wear this until she is a toddler, maybe around 2 yrs of age.  It is adorable, I will just have to save it for later!"
3.0,"It’s a cute ring, however it does easily tarnish. :("
3.0,Don't like the feel of fabric
3.0,Hurts right toe. Fitting not as expected.
3.0,"My wife bought this for me for my birthday. She was looking for something sweet as well as functional. She got part of that right. While this is a cute, metal piece, it's clearly not made for functionality. At best, you might punch a hole in it and use it as jewelry."
3.0,"They do run a little small, but stretch to fit.  However the assorted colors thing is a lie!!! We got gray black and dark blue only!! So don't go into this thinking you will get better colors.  Thankfully here the boys are boring and wanted blah colors"
3.0,"I recently graduated from college and wanted to do something cute on my cap but didn’t want to put in hours and hours of time to never wear that cap again. So to Amazon I came. The design was just perfect and my favorite Bible verse of all time. However, the sticky side was not all that sticky and even when I lined it up there was still some excess that didn’t fit on the cap. I had a standard one size fits all cap from the school and I felt like if I tossed my cap up with the rest of my class, the sticker would come flying off. Definitely needs work on sticking to 100% polyester and measured better."
3.0,"Fit as expected per size chart. I normally wear L but bought XL. I am 5'5"", 150 lbs, chest 38C, waist 33. Material is light, not cotton.  No product tag stating material type.  It was a synthetic polyester type material and slick. Buttons just for show. Straps do not adjust. Around the back of the dress it is elastic,  so has stretch.  If you are well endowed, the waist line will sit right under your breast. It fit ok on me as I'm average chest, just had to pull down for it to look normal.  I will wear this on the beach. I do wish it were a cotton blend however. It's an ok dress for the price. It arrived sooner than the expected arrival date."
3.0,the sleeves are very narrow - otherwise the fit is okay
3.0,"My boyfriend says there just OK, just flip flops."
3.0,"The necklace itself was pretty. It certainly didn’t look real, but it has an interesting shape and sparkle and makes for a nice statement piece.  I think it will look nice up against high necklines of a solid color or a lower neckline just against your skin, check the length to make sure it will hang right.<br /><br />The reason I knocked off a few stars is that The one is received was broken. One of the smaller side chains that connected to the outter most chai was broken and hanging. I considered keeping it and fixing it (I probably could have re-attached it with glue), but it’s ridiculous to spend money on something that is broken. I’m not sure how durable the piece is, so that may become an issue down the road if you purchase this. If you happen to get one that is not broken, it’s quite pretty."
3.0,"I do like the fabric, it’s light weight but a little thin. I loved this top until my friends told me it made me look very large 😩"
3.0,"Love the print, and material. But this dress was way too big."
3.0,"Ordered a size larger, as recommended.<br />Was still way too small.<br />When you order think about a friend who is smaller than you who would like it.<br />Bought it for my daughter, who is thin. She gave it to a smaller friend who really loves it.<br />Very attractive. Great gift, tough to size. Great design.<br />Order 2 sizes larger than you are, unless you are extremely thin and petite."
3.0,"This bra seemed perfect when I took it out of the package. The material is really soft and product is true to size, however, before I even tried it on the ring that holds the bra strap together in the back broke (metal seems very flimsy). I tried it on anyway and it fit perfect and was very comfortable. I'm a 38ddd so it's hard finding a bra that isn't padded excessively, uncomfortable etc.  I'm going to exchange in the hopes this one was defective. Will update once the new one is received!"
3.0,"I think the item we received as mis-sized.  I ordered 2 size M... the other one being the one w/o the ruffles on the bottom.  The other one fit nicely, but this one was way big... looked like a sack.  Although I did like this one with the ruffles on the bottom better than the plain-bottom one, it went back."
3.0,"It looks exactly as in the pic and my customers was satisfied with her purchase , only the craftsmanship was a bit off but all in all ah good product"
3.0,These are not athletic sock quality. Very thin and small in size even before washing and drying.
3.0,"Very soft, cute jammies but top runs small and pants huge"
3.0,It was too small not long enough or full enough
3.0,"Way too small, like 2 sizes down small."
3.0,i thought they were cute online but i have them and i guess they are too tight on face they leave imprints on face. :-(
3.0,Shipped fast. So far so good. Fit my 15 month old perfect. These are definitely for a baby.
3.0,"I love this dress with a waist cincher over it.  Otherwise, it really doesn't have much of a shape."
3.0,"It’s a beautiful top. I love how soft the fabric is and how well my pearls have stayed on. HOWEVER,<br />this too was made more like a cropped sweater. I thought it was too small when I pulled it out of the box and was upset. I tried it on and it fit well width wise, but looked like it was actually made to be cropped. I thought the ad model was doing a front tuck, but it’s actually just short."
3.0,Some flowers came off but most did not. I had to hot glue them back on.
3.0,It was great for the one night I wore it out on Halloween for my Cruella Deville costume but wow were there a lot of feathers falling every which way! Definitely only good for wearing with a costume.
3.0,It came from China. Not the best quality. Also not sure if is real gold. But made wife happy.
3.0,I normally wear this brand and absolutely LOVE their dresses!! But this order was different. The green looked faded like it had been worn.  The green and black repackaged bag it came in is always a dead giveaway. I will order from this company again because I have literally ordered a bunch of other colors with no issues.<br /><br />I believe this was a random issue. Still a great company.
3.0,"I really like the concept and if someone would spend more on design and comfort, I think it would really sell better even at an additional 25-50% price increase. Great for going outside especially when it's raining."
3.0,The hat runs small and it gives me a headache
3.0,The double hooped one is a lot larger than expected but the heart one is amazing
3.0,"It is a dangle charm so why is it not coloured on both sides?  It looks great when you see the painted side but kinda cheap and odd (like, &#34;what is that supposed to be?) when you see the other side - which tends to happen w a dangly charm like this one.  Too bad because it is a pretty cool idea otherwise."
3.0,Not very sturdy.  But looks good as a decoration
3.0,"I bought two of these at the time of purchase. The case itself is fairly tough, but the plastic handle on one of them busted.  I was actually coming back to purchase another, but seen that the price had increased $70 since I purchased this roughly a year ago.  WOW! Seriously Pro-X?  I'm as Let's Go Brandon as the next guy when it comes to inflation, but a 40% increase scream Pro-X greed.  No thanks!"
3.0,I did receive this ring .<br />I feel thou it wasn’t what I thought it to be.<br />It was bigger than expected and not as pretty as the picture looked
3.0,"It puts my bottom way out there from the rest of my body, because waist is tight."
3.0,The chain is a little weak and flimsy. And the doll is a little flimsy herself. But she is very cute.
3.0,"They only fit around my ankles and once you stretched them out, they didn't look very good and they don't shrink back."
3.0,"These men's socks run small considering I'm a woman with slim legs. They feel nice though I don't believe I was expecting to find acrylic in the contents list.<br /><br />Lightweight and warm, they feel nice with my boots."
3.0,Did not like the chain it came  with
3.0,"I bought this top for my daughter. To be honest, she didn’t like the top but I thought it was cute on her. Her complaints were the material was thick and air could not flow through which made it very hot. Also the opening for the arms were large and it drooped on the sides a little...enough that her bra showed. It faded a little (not much) after washing. I think it pretty true to size."
3.0,good look but the quality is so so. You pay for what you get
3.0,Nice Dress had to return the arms do not have any give you can’t reach up
3.0,"Good value for what you get, just be prepared to resize them all. They are super duper large, which is better than too small!"
3.0,"A little long in the crotch but all in all, fit as was expected. The smell from the packaging was noxious though and everything was in Chinese even the care instructions."
3.0,"The strongest detail on these earrings is design. The dangling portion ends in a smoothly attached loop that is snuggles next to the earlobe comfortably. Not high on the sparkle category, still these are a fun addition to my costume jewelry collection."
3.0,A pretty color but the style for me was actually pretty funny.  I looked like a clown!.  Runs small
3.0,The top part is off centered makers The fit uncomfortable
3.0,I bought this to go with my bee keeper veil. I'm 6'4' and it doesn't fit my head very well. It's fine for the hour a week i wear it though. It's more costume wear than work wear.
3.0,Pretty but to heavy
3.0,"Too small.  Not made for American women.  Ordered a 3XL, still too small and short."
3.0,Buttons randomly snapped!
3.0,I absolutely love the necklace except the clasp  turned very very dark after the second time wearing. Turned the back of my neck green because it's not real. I was hoping you'd have something a little bit better quality!  As in metals that won't turn or turn your skin colors.
3.0,"I just wanted to ask the maker what I am suppose to do with the bow ., it doesn't have any sort of attachment to put on my daughters head. ???"
3.0,It's smaller than it looks on the picture but nice anyway
3.0,"if you are long waisted, don't purchase. For short waisted girls.  I really like the pattern and the colors!!!!"
3.0,Not true to size I had to give the two I bought to my teenager.
3.0,Fits more like a smallish Medium. I will be returning it.
3.0,Very cute. Easily tarnished.
3.0,ok. kinda flimsy
3.0,"This is from my 15 yo daughter....This zipper is poorly made. The zipper stay/crimped part at the bottom was not installed and we had to repair it (I, father, had to buy a zipper repair kit off Amazon). 5’ 6” 110. Lots of comfortable room, width, but lacking in a little leg length. I was afraid the next size would be way too huge. I still love it."
3.0,"The elastic waistband twists in the fabric. So after I wash them I have to move the wide waistband in the fabric back into its place. Other than that, the fabric is nice."
3.0,These are so cute and comfortable... but I've only worn the purple one for less than two weeks and it's already broken... Kind of disappointing.
3.0,"They fit fine, but I was looking for something in the seamless/covered elastic style and this elastic was definitely not that. The elastic is kinda scratchy, and actually got an unraveling run after only a few weeks. It's a shame because they are totally cute!"
3.0,"So I think it’s a cute necklace, but it was broken"
3.0,too big / too heavy
3.0,The necklace in the picture looks bigger.  It lays awkward and seems like the top portion is over crowded with beads; I am going to remove a few of them and hopefully it will fix how the necklace lays.  Other than that is a good piece to have to spruce up any outfit!  This can be worn with anything!
3.0,it is far away from XL but acceptable<br />i did go to tighten it but the material is good it self
3.0,"It works, but is a bit flimsy."
3.0,Runs about 2 sizes small
3.0,"I read the question and answer section and the reviews and chose these mask brackets because of the reviews and the multiple answers that said the notice in my package was in German. I have no notice in my package but on the outside, it clearly says Made in China.<br />I'm just trying to avoid purchasing items made in China as much as possible and while these brackets look to be something that will be helpful while wearing a mask, I would have continued looking had anywhere in the description said made in China.<br />I think it would be a welcome addition in product descriptions to have a dedicated ""Made in _____"" line."
3.0,Sadly these are too small and odd feeling material. Not sure they’d be comfortable to work out in even if they did fit properly. It’s unfortunate bc I like the design and who doesn’t love pockets?!
3.0,"Left my jewelry in a hot tangled mess...just because it has a lot of holes doesn't mean that u can fill it up because the jewelry overlaps and fall out and u can't really organize it in any meaningful way.<br /><br />However I like that u can use the back and front, and it looks pretty on your dresser. I use it for jewelry that I use frequently."
3.0,"The suit fit good but I couldn't manage to straighten the straps on my upper back by myself.  The first time I washed it, it was a tangled mess"
3.0,Not as big length ways as I thought - I had to tie it in a circle so it didn't fall off.
3.0,"My gripe is with the design, the way it hangs on a person- the simple addition of a drawstring at the bottom would cause its extremely wide waist to ride better on any human waist (thick or thin), especially with the horizontal white stripe. Remember the girl who ate the bubblegum in willy wonka? This will make the wearer look like they're blowing up like that.<br /><br />Otherwise the condition/seams/cloth texture were good, it was clean and delivered in a timely manner. Maybe if you wore it with a really wide belt or vest?"
3.0,"Overall the coat is amazing, but the biggest issue I had with it is that the jacket isn't leather, it's vinyl. It is still a great coat, and I enjoy it quite a bit, but be warned it isn't quite what you expect."
3.0,It would be nice if my cup size was a little smaller
3.0,It glowed very nice but it wasn't durable. I went to sleep in it and woke up with it broken.
3.0,this dress is super cute for the beach or running errands but i returned mostly because the horizontal lines don't meet at the sides where the stitching is - i personally hate that and it makes it look really cheap (yes i know it's cheap lol) but i've bought things before that were inexpensive but don't look cheap - was hoping for this to fall in that category unfortunately it didn't so i retunred..
3.0,"I loved the idea of this dress, but reality is short waisted and too tight (it said fits regular sizes) not true.<br /><br />Really sorry had to return it."
3.0,its not as red as it is suppose to be... its a really big scarf its like the size of a blanket its okay i guess but i wasn't expecting it to be such a huge scarf its suppose to be red not an light off red color....
3.0,"It's really cute, but I wish it came in adult sizes."
3.0,"Great quality, vibrant colors only problem one of the strap was stitched wrong so it can't sit flat keep twisting, so I now have to find money  to go by a professional to fix it because i am located  in the US. Would have returned if I was closer."
3.0,3 month or so bras. Don't hold up in the normal wash and dry cycle
3.0,Fit was tighter than expected. My boyfriend who normally wears a medium/large had some problems wearing it. Was a little too short.
3.0,The top was too small and the bottoms too lose..but it was cute looked like the picture. Gonna give it to my sister
3.0,"My daughter loves to wear these as shorts to bed, but they are definitely not underwear"
3.0,I purchased for my Monroe piercing (corner top lip) but the stone was really big and didn't look appealing at all. I went to put them in my ear but being that the screw on part was on the stone and not the stick it was hard to put in because the stick had no point. I had to pop it through which it kind of hurt for a week but other then that they are cute on my ears and not itchy like the cheap earrings you buy from stores. Upset that now I have to purchase different ones for my lip ring.
3.0,Not for big boobs. They will be flopping out all over the place. Cute swim suit if I had a smaller chest.
3.0,"I really like the pants and they were exactly what I was looking for...unfortunately the sewing wasn't too good and there was a hole in the pocket from day one and then a hole in the crotch after second wearing and they are not too small.  Just unfortunate and will likely not use this amazon thing again (it was my first experience).  AND, I didn't want to attempt to send them back to where they came from in another country.  I doubt this survey does any good, but it's my obligation to let you know."
3.0,Jacket looks good but don’t expect to be warm when it gets cold this winter without some kind of a layer underneath
3.0,They were for my son.
3.0,"I really love the bag. I bought it for work so that I can get in all my stuff including a few books and it has held up well so far. One thing, for the price I would have thought the bag would come with/in a protective pouch, instead it just came in the outer package. I hope the seller consider getting some bag pouches for future sales."
3.0,Brought a pair in the past so I knew what to expect fit right not too heavy for summer but not those lightweight pajama thin sweat pants excellent price so I ordered 3 more pairs only received 2...emailed the seller I was assured the mistake would be rectified however I'm still waiting a month later🤔
3.0,"I bought a waist belt with phone pocket a year ago.  It was very thick neoprene which doesn’t stretch very much (much less than shown in the picture).  After about a year, the Velcro stopped working, so I tried this brand instead.  As far as I can tell, it’s exactly the same as the one I bought last year from another company.  Due to lack of stretchiness and limited lifetime of the Velcro, I am rating this average."
3.0,"The belt is not perfect, belt buckle shows small pattern (damaged?), but compare quality with price somehow still acceptable. The shipment received was terrible, who's responsibility?"
3.0,It is fine but looks very cheap.
3.0,"The ring is very beautiful, what there is of it, that is. MUCH smaller than pictured."
3.0,Pretty but uncomfortable.
3.0,I’d like the pant leg to be wider. On the online picture it appears kind of wide but once I got it it’s rather tight at the bottom.
3.0,"These boots look a lot cuter in the picture. The pinks are not the same color- the fur area is a different color from the felt-like area. They look a little cheap. I'm going to keep them since my daughter likes them and will probably get them really dirt quickly. If I purchased again, I might go with the black since the color issue wouldn't be as noticeable. They seem pretty comfy- but not much support."
3.0,I work in healthcare and am on my feet sometimes 12+ hours in a day. I bought these socks to help with fatigue and swelling. They have great compression! They however aren’t true to size for plus in my opinion. I would order a size up. They were very tight and rolled down. The size up was more comfortable.
3.0,Stitching for the bottoms are not great and material can easily rip
3.0,"Pretty print and nice colors in the picture, but it just didn’t look the same when I opened it. The lace is attached with minimal stitching. I used Liquid Stitch to glue down some of the pink trim."
3.0,"Cute, but runs large. I ordered a small and it was baggy even after washing it. I'm 5'3&#34; and 110 lbs"
3.0,"i like this legging, fit well, but the stich right on my bottom is rip, but i fix that."
3.0,"I too, was bamboozled when I received 1 pair after a long wait for delivery.  I love bamboo fiber (rayon) for it's softness and ecological benefits, however this fabric does not last long before it pills, so the ""green"" aspect is negligible since the bamboo products require more frequent replacement.<br /><br />The briefs are decently stitched, however the darting of the 2 layers of the front pouch did not line up on the pair that I received, they were off by about 1/8 of an inch, not sure if this is on purpose to prevent rubbing, but the effect is ""bulgy camel toe"", lol.  I got used to the feeling quickly and then it was more sight than feel that was disturbing.  The pouch area is good and supportive without feeling binding.  After wearing all day, they were not as airy as I hoped and retained sweat moisture even though I was sitting most of the day.  The leg bands were also noticeably looser to the point of sagginess around the back.<br /><br />At $12 for 1 pair, these don't make sense to me when you can get better quality, better material from a known brand for the same amount or less.  These are not on par with higher end designer brands that I think they are imitating, more mass market multi-pack basic briefs that will have to be replaced much more often to remain comfortable enough to wear."
3.0,Cute but I wish the petal was more visable in the middle charm. Other then that is cute for the price.
3.0,Nice colors. Nice style but the fabric is so hard and scratchy even after washing and ironing. Disappointed in material.
3.0,Not that impressive. Size ran small.  But you do get what you pay for.
3.0,The outfit was good looking but was way to big and it took to long for shipping
3.0,Great little dress.
3.0,They are pretty but the quality is not that good !!
3.0,Pj are nice but top is a bit too small for my bust
3.0,Quality is lacking. A side seam is mismatched under the arm. The material of the liner under the skirt is stiff. I haven’t washed it yet so I don’t know how well it will hold up.
3.0,"First the positive side: Excellent product, fits as expected and delivery 5 ⭐. Now I only rated it a 3 because I only received 3 pink 2 light blue and I was really really hoping to get at least one black. But if you do not care about the colors this would be a perfect 5 star rating."
3.0,"I loved everything about this bracelet and it would’ve been the perfect gift for my daughter-in-law. Unfortunately, it’s too small to fit an adult wrist."
3.0,"I purchased three stones from this seller for an anniversary setting. Two are 6.0mm or 1 carat , the other is 7.7mm, or 1.5 carats. The two smaller stones are visibly, annoyingly yellow, one less so than the other. The larger has a lighter yellow hue and would be acceptable IF mounting as a solitaire.  As the stones are a poor match to each other AS WELL AS not being true to the color of the stones shown in the item descriptions, I recommend ONLY BUYING FROM a seller offering matched sets of stones."
3.0,"Nice design, sizing is off."
3.0,Liked the design but did not like the clingy material.
3.0,"The watch band is as pictured and works as expected. The fit and finish are a little rough, but not out of hand considering the price. I do like that they include the tool for removing links for sizing. Again, you get what you pay for, the tool is all plastic except for the actual pin that does the work. The clasp feels secure and hasn't come undone yet. This is one of the reasons I bought this band to begin with. Overall, not bad for the price, but I would have paid a little more if they had put a little more time in to the finished product and smoothed out all the hard edges."
3.0,"This jumpsuit could be really cute but there’s a couple of things that  are a little off with it... like the sleeves aren’t as loose as on the picture, the pant legs are quite long but that’s a quick fix by hemming, and the way the top is made it’s really really low cut... there’s no way you can wear it without something underneath or without Bobby pinning it. Also not very forgiving to any tummy pouches lol can still be cute on someone tall and lean"
3.0,nice piece but i feel little tight
3.0,"Fabric is thin, but dress is cute."
3.0,"I thought this dress was adorable and so comfortable. However, the strap was broken on it so I do have to return it but the material was so soft and forgiving!"
3.0,"I had a bit more hope for the mask due to the cost. I like that the straps are adjustable. The smell was rough, there were a few areas of the mask that were creased to a point I couldn't fix."
3.0,Product looks like the advertising until you put it on. Every bit of stretch distorts the images and thins the material.
3.0,Fits as expected but too long! I'm 5'2 (barely) and it's super long on me
3.0,Lovely product its a bit stiff of a fabric and very rough to the touch but its a really nice shawl to put over a strapless dress...
3.0,The style is very nice
3.0,"I really like this necklace, but boy is it tiny. I can barely see the stones. You will need a magnifying glass to see the stones. It looks more like a tiny bar. It is very dainty and feminine."
3.0,They are really cute just they change color after 2-3 uses so I honestly suggest buying better quality ones if you want then to last and not stain your ankle
3.0,"They’re fine, but they are very stiff. You get what you pay for I guess. I have gotten compliments with them though"
3.0,"I followed Amazon's suggestion and my typical ordering inclination to buy at least one size up, EPIC FAIL!  I hate clothes that make me feel fat.  I already know I have a huge butt and a mom-belly, I do NOT need a reminder like this dress.  RETURN!<br /><br />The material is see through, even with such a busy pattern in dark colors.  I love some boho-chic look and this has it with a great price to match.  That is where the great ends, too.  I would have needed two sizes larger to fit right and this generation may be shocked by this word, but a full SLIP (Spanks/Skims/body glove type thing) must be worn underneath because it is completely see through!"
3.0,The waist is higher up than I wanted. It fits more like a babydoll dress
3.0,Like the cloth. Colour is great just like in the picture.
3.0,"I am happy and unhappy at the same time. I am clearly a ""10"" shoe size and clearly these are not even though they are marked ""10"" on the box. When I first put them on, I was going to send them back and get a ""9"" instead. But being somewhat lazy, I decided I was NOT going to wear them as a daily around town shoe. They were bought as a house wearing sandal. So I kept them. Well, low and behold they are comfortable but still too big. If I bought them again, (which I would do because of the comfort) I would get a ""9"" instead of a ""10"".  Oh right, and they look pretty good too."
3.0,Love the bag and will keep it but disappointed that the cooler doesn't zip off like shown in pictures. In order to use the cooler you need to essentially dump out the contents of your bag unless you are able to zip it closed.
3.0,Very hard to get the post through the hole to complete the endless hoop.
3.0,"Decent product, but slightly too large for everyday wear."
3.0,This item is nice but arrived much too late for Halloween.
3.0,A little bit low on the nostrils.  It serves the purpose.
3.0,They are comfortable and sexy!
3.0,Got what I expected. Shorts are a little weird.
3.0,"shrunk in the wash, fit beautifully until it went through the wash once"
3.0,When I looked at product info before ordering it did not show me that these socks are only 65% cotton.  Years ago they were 90%  or more. I'm disappointed.
3.0,"The size is not fitted right, I still can use it but I am not happy."
3.0,"Overall ok, just not enough space for my cards."
3.0,"This is what’s expected for the price. It’s under cured and tough to chew. There are much better hams out there but you have to pay more. If you let it sit on your counter for a while, it will start to taste a little better and you have to slice it real thin. Adding a little olive oil on it before eating helps. Would probably not buy again."
3.0,I ordered two of these cute dresses  for my granddaughter only problem was I ordered them in small and was shipped two of them in a size large! I don’t understand how this mistake was made if they sold out I could have chosen a different color so I am dissatisfied customer
3.0,"Very thing material, but was fine for my Velma costume"
3.0,"It's a bit less than I expected, the only reason it didn't get 4 stars is that the design does not continue on the reverse side,....i.e. I had intended to wear the key on my re-inactor chatalain, hanging down from one of my Tortoise brooches,...with the design all one-sided it won't look real if it turns to reveal the back,....but as a 'starter-key' it's OK,....It was sent from the UK,....something I hadn't realized when I was ordering it,...but it arrived packed well and in a timely manner..... I would order from them again, as they appear to have cool items for my re-enactment needs"
3.0,Returned item. Sizing chart was incorrect. Too big. Scallops gapped.
3.0,"This purse is really cute. It has plenty space for me. When it came, it had melted and stuck together so there’s a piece of it broken by the zipper. The biggest negative is it STINKS. The inside smells like dead fish and I have sprayed it and everything. The smell remains."
3.0,These were 14/16 and they fit like 10/12or even smaller
3.0,"Nice and soft, comes with a shirt and pants."
3.0,"The material was actually a lot sturdier than I was anticipating, so that was great. However, the wings came folded into their tight packaging in a way that left them with permanent creases."
3.0,La calidad no es la mejor pero ajusta bien.
3.0,Very smooth and comfortable but ear rings Frey quickly making it a low quality item
3.0,Smaller then I thought that would be but ok
3.0,Disappointed- good name brand good sales pitch - very thin material
3.0,They are not quite what I expected
3.0,"I used this product for my job which requires to have a lot of keys in a specific order on a keychain. It was not good for this purpose. It may work for a few keys but definitely not 20+ keys. The cord frayed quickly and the ends that connect together broke causing me to have to reorganize the keys on another keychain, which was a pain. It's a good product and would reccomend, just not for a large quantity of keys"
3.0,"The skirt is a different material than the top making it not fit right even thou I order a 2xl, I normally wear an large or xlarge depending on brand, mostly due to large cup size and I couldn't get this on and when I could with zipper down, I couldn't zip it at all."
3.0,"I could not keep them because even in black they were see through! I expected a thinner material, as they are linen, but as my grandmother used to say “you could sip tea through them without changing the taste!” If you plan to wear with a dark bodysuit that would probably be fine, and if you just wanted to wear them for summer. But I don’t want to have to think that much and I wanted a more multi-season piece. I did find these to be a little on the short side-and I would definitely recommend sizing up if you want them to look anything like the picture.  I would 100% have kept them if the fabric hadn’t been see through."
3.0,"I ordered the star print Capri length twice. Both times I received full length capris. Item not as described, buyer beware!"
3.0,"Not very good quality, but good for the price. I didn’t are for the style at all."
3.0,"Fit it ok. Looks ok, but it’s Cheep. Thin material, flimsy bill, cheesy logo."
3.0,"Looks good, warm yet lightweight, but runs small/tight through the middle."
3.0,I have a 20's party coming up and I bought this dress because it would work perfect with the rest of my accessories. This dress was heavy and unflattering. I ended up trying a smaller size that fit a bit better and it still didn't really accentuate my curves. Hopefully I can find something else in time.
3.0,Bands around the ears are TERRIBLE! Looks like a high-end product until you get to those darn bands that cut your ears off
3.0,Fit is fine. The stretch fabric retains wrinkles.  OK for casual wear.
3.0,La falda no se ve mal. Solo que corren demasiado pequeñas. Ordené una L y parecía S. La voy a devolver.
3.0,It's okay by me !
3.0,Not for bigger belly’s and longer torsos
3.0,"Furry stuff everywhere, it was a mess, otherwise looks like the pic"
3.0,Cute dress but returning it. It fits great except in the chest. If you have boobs then size up. I’m planning to reorder but in a larger size.
3.0,"The color was beautiful, but it was far from the size advertised. I feel like the shoe was 2-3 sizes too small. I didn’t have time to order another pair due to needing them for an event, but I won’t be ordering these again in the future."
3.0,It's beautiful but it doesn't fit true to size and the size chart is way off. I usually wear a medium in everything but not this... the top fit but the bottom was a nightmare.. not worth sending it back so I guess my daughter will be getting it.. the medium top is fine but I would probably need a XL bottom and well they don't sell it that way... I suggest going up 2 sizes and maybe finding someone to alter the top for you ... or just stay away entirely.. it's beautiful in the picture though...
3.0,"I bought this for my mom as a gift.<br />This is a pretty necklace, but it start Irritating my mother neck."
3.0,Not quite long enough.  You still have to bend down.
3.0,"Light pink is more of, neon pink. I don't like the color, love the fit."
3.0,Did not care for the quality but the price was inexpensive
3.0,What I like the most is the package arrived on time. What I didn't like is no earrings came<br />with the necklace very disappointed. These was homes for thinning but want there. Sure wish you could send than separately to me I paid for a set.
3.0,The jacket is light weight and thin which was expected...but what wasn't expected is that the pattern is different than pictured and is upside down on the body of the jacket. The arms and pockets are correct. The jacket also runs small. I purchased an XL for my daughter.<br /><br />Three stars because she likes it.....but questioned why the pattern is upside down.
3.0,These are very comfortable pants but after a few washes they really start to look like regular leggings so I don’t feel comfortable wearing them to work any longer.
3.0,I don’t know why the crew sock doesn’t have that performance arch support but these do. I have wide feet and don’t like arch support on my socks. Very hard to find socks that don’t have arch support.
3.0,"You can’t compare this to original brand. However, price is good for kids."
3.0,"This really is quite cheaply made. It doesn't fit well and is not a flattering cut, but BUT it looks so damn good in selfies, so..."
3.0,Love the color but they slid down my first day wearing them. I have noticed that a lot with this brand.  If you've got time to pull them up then you'll love them!
3.0,"I love leggings from 90degrees, but these just missed the mark enough that I won't wear them.  They are well made, comfortable, love the side pockets... But they don't breathe. Like, at all. If u want wind proof leggings these are great but if you expect to wear these in warm  or hot weather, or workout outside of an air conditioned gym, don't do it! I tried them on, put stuff in the pockets for a few min, then tried them in the bike to see if they're flexible. spent barely a few minutes outside and had to come in and change out of these.  They don't breathe or wick at all.<br /><br />Pro- flattering, true to size, comfortable, pockets fit large cell phone or small wallet, keys and chapstick. Win!<br /><br />Con - unfortunately they do not breathe or wick. They are think, which is good for coverage or wine protection, but you will overheat. Can't use for running, hiking, def don't attempt hot yoga in these. Gonna have to return and find a version that breathe"
3.0,A little bigger than I expected.. but theyre really nice.
3.0,"This is a cute dress for a young lady during the summer. It almost looks like a slip, but it isn't. The back is lace and has buttons to secure it. It has a V neck with lace edging for decoration around the neck. The style is a princess dress and it is adorable."
3.0,"very thin silky nylon material.  it would be very cute on someone with a tiny silhouette, not my 5'4&#34; 170lb  apple frame.  if you have large thighs and a small waist and bust, this would be perfect for a spring party or wedding.  unfortunately, I am giving to my sister who is much skinnier than i am."
3.0,Doesn't look like picture. There was also no purse charm on it.
3.0,I misread the description so I got the bracelet and not the whole thing .
3.0,I like it works as a simple belt. Don’t like the feel of it.
3.0,"I ordered a medium which according to the size chart would be my size, but these were just too big. They were too long and very baggy. I guess I expected them to be tighter around the legs. The material is good quality though."
3.0,Not true to size.  I could barely get my head through the dress to put it on.  Dress was not really what I expected
3.0,"I bought these because I thought &#34;hey, no more hunting for a mate&#34;. Strange thing they are not all the same. Some are so small, some are thinner then others, and some do fit. It's hit or miss. The quality is not that great... I'm really disappointed."
3.0,I got the large size but the top was too small  and the bottom was too big.
3.0,"Expected a fuller sweep at hem, but ver good quality."
3.0,Pretty but to big for my face
3.0,Too small for my arm
3.0,"Don't cheap out, get the one that cost a little more. It is small, when wearing to protect face it exposes the bottom of my neck. I have several other buffs that can go up over my head and still cover my neck, this one can't even get close... that said, I am a big person, a smaller person would likely not have as much of an issue"
3.0,Material on sleeves is not what I expected
3.0,I bought these shoes for my toddler who’s just starting to try to walk. I thought these were considered “walking” shows so I expected the bottom of the shoes to be tougher but they aren’t. These shoes are nice if your toddler can already walk well but otherwise I’d go with something else. They are super cute though!
3.0,no se ve del mismo color
3.0,"Decent light weight sunglasses for bright sunlight.  I was expecting a more yellowish tint lense like a normal pair of driving lenses, but they just had a yellow mirror finish on a regular lens..  No driving at night with these on for sure."
3.0,"This dress looked really cute in the pictures, but didn't quite meet my expectations in real life.  It was just a little too small, so if you are unsure, size up.  It was also had a lot of static that I couldn't get rid of so it wasn't very flowie like it looks in the picture.  Instead it stuck to my legs.  I also wanted to wear it with the sleeves up, but it looked a little awkward. It looks much better with the sleeves on the shoulder, but I was going for a more modest look ."
3.0,"It did not fit my glasses, I will have to return it."
3.0,Too big for my wrist. Looks cheap.
3.0,Esta bonito pero se ve un poco diferente cua do llega
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:b9ffe28148f9a232c876365576dd593c]] Bought these because my 1.5yr old rooster was mating too much with some of our 1.5yr old hens to the point where their backs and wings were raw and featherless :( during feeding time they followed me into the coop to refill their food bowl and I locked them in so I wasn’t chasing them around the run one by one... they were a little big in the elastic and laid across their backs fine. So with a little knot in the elastic they were fine.<br /><br />24hrs later one hen lost hers due to a tangle with a thorned vine. There were a few hens that had theirs flipped up or pulled over to one side, most likely because the rooster sucks with balance when trying to mate.<br /><br />The jackets are a 7/10 with sturdiness and how well they are put together. They would be too big for breeds such as bantams or young hens. My 1.5yr old folk consist of Wyandotte, red sexlink, barred rock, and Asian black. (Video and pics provided, the brighter light exposure picture where the next day)"
3.0,It was Kind of dirty when i got them. I ordered to wear for work. I wear i size 14 in pants and shorts so i ordered a size 16. They were still kind of tight and could barely close them. My suggestion is definitely order 2 sizes up from your regular size so they will fit<br />comfortably. But otherwise nice shorts
3.0,"I saw these online and fell in love with the color, I received them and tried them on and they are too loose, they won't stay up on my face. The arms have a spring on them and it can't be adjusted. I'm going to keep them as a back up pair."
3.0,"I like the quality if the fabric here, but they were too tight for me.  When I took them off at the end of the day I had really deep indentations in my ankles that took a really long time to go away.  My guess is that my feet are too small and my calves too big to get these to fit properly.  Really a shame because they are good quality (thus the three stars)."
3.0,Are usually wear a size large so that’s what I ordered. This jacket feels like an extra large. The material is not as soft as I expected it to be.
3.0,Had problem with the zipper feet little big
3.0,After a few days parts of it started to fall apart but nothing a hot glue gun can't fix. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!
3.0,"Waited too long for this, I was getting worried it won’t fit my daughter by the time it gets here, size is too big, I guess she will have this for a long time."
3.0,"I was hoping for the material to be a bit thicker but it is on the thin side. If you get hot easily and don't mind it being thin or prefer to layer, then it won't be a problem. Overall satisified."
3.0,"I just received this in the mail. I purchased it as a gift for my 15 year old neice. It looks much nicer in the picture. The quality is much different in person than it appears online. I guess that's photo enhancing for you. I'm sure she'll like it, it's still nice. But it definitely represents itself as better quality than it is."
3.0,"Didn’t fit well, not the best quality."
3.0,Very nice watch winder but didn't last long. Died after 2 yrs.
3.0,Doesn’t fit right. Rolls up when working out
3.0,Love Martin Guitars and wanted to promote the brand by wearing it out but this is just going to have find a wall in the music room as it is waaay too small of a fit.
3.0,Didn't love the style.
3.0,"Left fuzzies allover my daughters feet every time she wore them, large clumps all on the carpets. Somewhat durable but only lasted a month over constant use, she wears slippers all day. Inexpensive enough compared to others thankfully."
3.0,It’s nice but the clamp broke already
3.0,"The product does look like the picture, but runs small. I’m usually a medium in pants and shirts, but know I have a long torso. I order this in a large and it was still too short. Might work better if you’re shorter or have a short torso. The material is also light and thin. It’s not see through, but I’m not sure how well it would hold up over time. I think this might work best as a swimsuit cover."
3.0,These are fine. I'd order these again nice colors. Quality Nd quantify are good. Good thing cuz rest of order was a disappointment
3.0,"The socks are overly thick, very warm.<br />Too thick to fit in shoes, or open toe Birkenstocks and no good<br />in my Ugg Boots either. I'm sorry I got them."
3.0,Nice colors but very small and not much stretch! I bought an XXL which usually has a loose fit on me but it fits like a large which is snug. I was looking for a loose fit but unfortunately got a tight one
3.0,"I wore this for the first time last Saturday. I was so excited when it arrived. I’m a 6 foot lady and this is the only jump suit I found that fit my long legs. I planned a whole day around wearing this beautiful jumpsuit only to find out the hard way when I was on the date that the zipper is no good. As I was zipping it, probably for the third time the zipper came off the track, quickly a team of ladies came to my rescue trying to get it back down so the zipper would get back on the track. No luck, they saved me with safety pins. Then my date very heroicly tried to also fix the zipper for me, once again no luck. I had to have him take it completely off the track just so I can go to the bathroom and try and fix it. Que the next team of ladies trying to help me get it back on the track so I can continue my night of fun. No luck. I was safety pinned back up and went on my way.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this jumpsuit so I’m going to try and get the zipper fixed. But it was quite the event of the evening which left me shamelessly holding my tatas while my back was fully exposed. For reference I’m 6 foot and 170 pounds and it fit PERFECT before the zipper broke. Such a shame."
3.0,Very disappointed that they are made in China Miss lead by designed in Australia
3.0,"This dress is to short for me, it looks beautiful online, when I got it looks different. I didn't like it, and I don't know what to with it.<br />Unusable for"
3.0,"Band was too small and leather looks nice, but feels cheap. Not worth the money to return with the shipping fee."
3.0,I love the alignmed shirts. First time that I ordered the black one. It's almost like the Neuro bands are broken. Not sure if I should order another white one or order a black one in a smaller size.
3.0,Just cute... thought it was a sweater from the picture. But all in all nice fabric and a comfy shirt
3.0,Pretty wallet with good storage! but the metal button part on the strap broke after 3 weeks of use so I can't secure it shut- not entirely happy about that.
3.0,"They don't clip on very tightly, they are loose on the glasses."
3.0,Was a gift. He didn't like it. Said it was too small
3.0,Nice product but unfortunately too long for Petites
3.0,"I was hoping this could be worn like a tunic over leggings but the wrap portion did not camouflage my middle as well as I'd hoped. When it was tied in front, it made me look bigger up top instead, but it seems to look really nice on many others in the reviews. The color was a lovely light brown and would be great for fall."
3.0,Smaller than I would have liked I just hope he can wear it
3.0,"These are cute and soft, but the inseams started coming apart in the first week."
3.0,Unless you like it tight order a size up. Material is not super stretchy or soft. Thin and rides up. Ok for the price though.
3.0,Color was way off from what is pictured. More of a neon look. Very thin and boxy looking.
3.0,"The pants fit alright, the other reviews mentioned them being small in the calf area and they were right! I don't have extremely large legs and I had a hard time getting them to come all the way up to button because they were stuck on my calf! Other than that they are really nice jeans, and they are high waisted."
3.0,"Fits great and the shorts don't ride up. However, after one wear the material already started to become worn down and fuzzy"
3.0,Not 16g but nce looking for the price.
3.0,"It cracked the first day I wore it.  So, I'm just going to keep it put up for safe keeping."
3.0,Material around the waist is more elastic and hugs your hips. It does not fall loosely.
3.0,The bands twice together causing the necklace to turn into a choker
3.0,bought this for halloween custom but end up not using it. the size is too small and doesn't stand out.
3.0,I really like the purse.  Very soft but the picture looks like a camel color and I received a very dark brown.  Not really what I needed but I kept it because I might need a dark brown purse in the future.
3.0,"These seemed fantastic, but unfortunately lost a stone prior to my first wear! Luckily I was able to cover one ear with my hair..."
3.0,"I did not notice that the package says &#34;slightly imperfect&#34; in the lower R/H corner, but I do not see any major imperfections. What I was disappointed with however is the lack of padding on the soles. I have purchased Gildan low cut socks before and they were two toned and had padding and I thought I was purchasing the same."
3.0,Material doesn’t hold shape and looks frumpy. Not attractive.
3.0,Kids size runs good but the Female size runs small. Order a size larger.
3.0,"I felt like this skirt did not fit with my body. I have wide hips and I couldn't get the skirt up. It's nice, seemed a bit short though. It was not what I hoped for but not the fault of the skirt."
3.0,It was fine for a pj but started fading after a few washes.
3.0,Ordered for daughter for camp.  It is Cute and served the purpose it was needed for but hard to keep on head with the attached comb. I just took comb off and attached to a headband instead.
3.0,After two months this is what happened to the frames and the return window is now closed!
3.0,I ordered a size 8 in this jacket (I typically wear size 2 / small). It is almost too tight for comfort. Very cute though. Would still recommend the jacket but definitely size up even more than you think you need to.
3.0,This is ONLY decrotive but nice u can use a small mask behind it or make & glue or sew in cloth mask & Wash
3.0,Material is rough in texture....my your typical cotton soft as I expected
3.0,"It’s great for the price, the only bad thing about it is really thin but other than that it’s perfect!"
3.0,Cute and soft but super tight at the waist
3.0,"Not because of support or construction quality, but more so design itself. The soft cup insert is always causing a prominent 'line' on the bust. Would rather a pocket for a removeable one."
3.0,Great tanks for layering. Only bad thing is after a few washing the lace starts to come off. Wasn’t happy about that.
3.0,Pretty earrings but the pearls have no back/forward stops so they move around on the wire. They are lightweight and not to heavy.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, these are pretty cheap, and some of the sayings engraved are barely legible. But it'll do."
3.0,"These glasse--IF, and only if, you order the correct magnification--are great for viewing your computer screen; they make it easier to see and reduce the blue &#34;glare.&#34;  But I wish they were &#34;half-glasses&#34; so I could see above the computer screen without having to drop my head and look up over the top of the glasses, which is very annoying."
3.0,"Length and colors are perfect; I love the pockets. I wish it was loose in the middle, but that might just be me being overweight. If you’re thinner than me, you will look AMAZING"
3.0,Didn’t like weight or feel of the ribbbed top
3.0,I loved this bracelet i order another
3.0,Ring material turns green
3.0,When you wear it it does look like it’s a cheap sweater.
3.0,I bought this gift as a birthday present for my husband. The weight was way too light for him because he has bigger wrist.
3.0,I do like the way the shirt fits the chest however the neck thing needed to be cut off it tries to strangle you.  The material is not the best and if you get a light color you better wear pasties or a bra is a MUST unless you want your nipples to be showing.  Overall I will make it work and it was ok for the price. I wish I would have waited to get one before ordering it in three colors. I will keep them but I do not think they will last many washings.
3.0,Fabric is an inexpensive knit
3.0,The jacket was very soft. I thought the construction of the jacket was a little off. Basically if there were more of the fur it wouldn’t look so bare in places
3.0,"So far, I’m generally happy w the investment. Compared to other options and brands, it’s fairly priced, has adequate and ample space, and appears to be decent quality material (time will tell).<br />PROs:<br />*With the expanding zippers at the top, there is potential for ample room; I was capable of fitting all my gear inside.<br />*I love the dedicated wetsuit compartment in the base separating dry/ clean from the wet/ dirty clothing<br />*comfortable to wear and/ or bike with. Tons of adjustability w the chest, hip and arm straps<br />*side elastic pouch can easily hold two bike bottles securely, and it doesn’t take away from the main compartment<br /><br />CONs:<br />*The dedicated helmet compartment could use improvement. I like the separate compartment, however it’s basically a mesh screen that separates it from the main compartment (good for circulating air) but bad because it takes away from the main pack space. Additionally, I question if larger/ longer helmets will fit. It would be much nicer if the helmet pocket expanded out, as opposed to taking away from main compartment. If so, I could potentially see this as taking away from fitting as a plane carry-on. As is, this should fit as carry-on luggage.<br />*The side pockets are more like inserts and not pockets. If you have the bag packed out, it’s difficult to navigate in and out of the side pockets or remove/ add items without first relieving stress from the main compartment.<br />*More a personal issue, I have larger feet (12.5 US or 46.5 EUR) which makes fitting shoes in any luggage a challenge. Plan your shoes orientation well, and keep in mind, anything near the helmet opening will take away from being able to fit your helmet. I ended up aligning shoes vertically single stacked as close to the straps side of the pack as possible (as opposed to horizontally double stacked at the base like I prefer) this forced me to pack clothing towards the bottom or maybe on top of the shoes to allow my helmet to fit in it’s dedicated pocket.<br />*Many other packs allow you to open the whole pack up, similar to a book. This doesn’t have that option (again more a personal preference and not a performance defect).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This pack has served its purpose. It has allowed me to pack all my gear, nutrition and extra goodies. Do I have buyers remorse, the answer is no. Would I recommend this pack, or buy it again, yes I would."
3.0,"Recieved my order in three days, sooner than expected.  I wear an 8.5-9 but usually a 9 in heels.  I ordered a 8.5 as the reviews said they ran big. They are a snug fit. I probably could have ordered a 9, but they may have slipped.  Its a cute shoe, there was a small scuff on the front of one."
3.0,"Didn't stay on the ear all that well, I did Love the Item, just not how it fit!"
3.0,"It’s a cute, soft shirt, but I bought it in size XXL for my friend who normally wears that size, and instead, it fits tightly on my partner who usually wears a size L.  Well made, but buy a couple sizes up."
3.0,"Not what I was expecting, it looks great on the model, not so much in person.  I was going to return it but the company said to keep in in exchange for a small refund which was nice of them."
3.0,This dress is beautiful however the pockets were both ripped on the inside.  The top of the dress was a little small compared to the fit of the rest of the dress.
3.0,"They're a slick material, not what I was expecting"
3.0,Received my necklaces completely tangled. I have been trying to untangle it but it is a head ache. Looks cute though : /
3.0,Love everything about this blouse except that it is too tight in the bust.  I'm going to try to have it altered but I'm not too hopeful otherwise I'll wear it as a coverup.  Word of caution:  sheer.  Very loose knit.  Good for extremely hot climates.
3.0,I like the material patterns and it doesn't smash my nose.  I only gave it 3 starts though because it is not a breathable fabric and it caused a rash on my face.
3.0,"Made me sweat in 60° F weather, which was a bummer. Decent fit, though."
3.0,"lenses are OK, nose clip is hardly working, but for third of the price of Thin Optics I shouldn't complain. Where Thin Optics grabs my nose gently and securely, these are both hard and slip off. will have to falter them somehow."
3.0,"Recently I have been looking for a wedding band for myself and I tend to like sparkly but not so much flashy rings . I like this ring and it is really pretty and just what I was looking for ,however it is way to small for me ! I orderd a size which usually a size 5 ring can fit me snug but not tight . When I received this ring I was very excited because it looks just like the picture but it was small . I went ahead and tried it on and had to push it over my knuckle . While I was able to get it on I was scared that it was going to get stuck and I had to pull hard to get it off . I am disappointing that I can't actually wear it so I can't really give it a full review, because I do not know what  it is like to wear it . I would suggest buying it up a size perhaps because I can wear size 5 rings normally but this one is way to snug .<br /><br />Disclaimer : I received this ring at a discount for my honest review ."
3.0,"It's difficult to know what to do when some reviews say an item fits too small and others say it's too large. I decided to gamble on ordering my usual size (8-10) but boy was I wrong.  It felt 2 sizes too big!  If you'd also been able to see a side view of the model as well as the front and back pictured, you would see that the material in the top goes straight up from the waist and barely covers the breast area, so if you're bigger than a B cup, there's likely to be significant risk of a &#34;wardrobe malfunction&#34; with movement. (I guess some double sided tape might help!)<br /><br />Also be aware although the title says &#34;beautyin Women's Halter Fringed One Piece Swimsuit Padded Bathing Suit Swimwear&#34;, it is only the fringed ones that have the removable padding. The white one has no padding at all (my fault...I should have read the details on the different suits more carefully). The material is also very thin and even though it is double layered in the top,  I would imagine the white might still be transparent when wet. It however was a pretty looking suit with the fabric detail in front and I could perhaps have modified it to insert some padding were it not for the fact that this one was way too big and didn't fit me properly.  I'm still debating whether to return or exchange for a smaller size as while I liked the neckline and the front,  I wasn't comfortable with how little coverage there was at the sides (and I imagine this would get worse with a smaller size.)"
3.0,I thought it looked cute and fit fine but my 2.5 year old was not happy with the fit. She cried and almost immediately tried to take it off.
3.0,It's smaller then the size.  It's also a little shorter then expected.  It can lay nicely if you get the right fit.  Not the best jacket but for sure not bad.
3.0,wish they made it where you can tight the loop strings around your arms
3.0,gave it away to grant grandaughter ran too small for me
3.0,it was a little large for my wrist i wish it was adjustible
3.0,"Runs very small and short. It’s a cute dress, just order up a couple sizes.."
3.0,"It do the job but , I think this would work better for someone with a little bit of smaller thighs I have big thighs and everytime I would bend down the whole thing for the legs just rips off . I would suggest a different one for us big girls"
3.0,"It looks like a sturdy belt, but it was short and I bought a 50inch belt.  Also, learn how to disengage the belt before putting it on. It will save you some added stress of figuring it out when it is on and just a little tight.  I would go up a couple sizes if possible when buying this belt."
3.0,buttons do not button right
3.0,Ok for work!!!
3.0,oddly long in the thigh.  not quite long enough to cover the quad so they roll up if you don't pull your pants and the boxers in unison.
3.0,"In my collection, I have a variety of latex and pvc catsuits. For future photo-shoots with other models, I thought this would be a nice addition in case a girl had an allergy to latex or could not get comfortable in PVC. Sadly, this material doesn't really come close to looking like it does in the picture.<br />It actually looks like your wearing a shiny spandex zentai body suit. My model is 5 foot 1, with short arms and legs, yet this suit did not go down to her ankles or wrists. I would say this might fit a 12 year old child (which a 12 year old child should never wear in the first place!!!)<br />After adding long latex gloves over the hands and wrists, as well as an under-bust leather corset, this outfit works. But if you are into actual latex, leather and pvc, don't count on the quality of this product."
3.0,Took a long time to arrive and was supposed to be XXL. Not even .
3.0,They're nice shoes but not much support. I was walking the track with my friend for an hour and I was really feeling it all over which was odd since I didn't feel anything when walking to classes and such but continuously walking killed my feet. Definitely need to get insoles if I ever want to wear these shoes when I run and the size was ehh. It fit but it wasn't narrow enough anytime I walked they felt like they wanted to slip off but never did and I can live with it but still not a nice feeling
3.0,"The shirt is cute but runs WAYYYYY too big. I bought a small which is the normal size I wear in many brands, and it was extremely big. Fit almost like a size large around the mid section and a medium uptop"
3.0,Not all mask had wire for nose as advertised
3.0,"I wanted to like them, but the one I received were cloudy and unfortunately the mounts and post also had a “tarnished” look."
3.0,"It wasn’t a good fit for long braids, but I can’t take away from the quality of the item."
3.0,"Not as long as it looks on the model, and quite snug in the bus area.  Not real happy with the hem."
3.0,"Got a size two, should of got it in zero. It runs big in the bust area. Pretty color but wasn't the color it was in the picture. I got Dark Purple but it was darker and more wine colored than expected. The beads look kind of fake and tacky."
3.0,Love the fit of these pants but they are poor material quality. I have only worn them twice and both times was for just a few hours and they have already developed nits and pulls in the fabric. Not sure how long these will last. Disappointed.
3.0,"Band broke first time putting on watch, but luckily I had an extra.  The watch looks pretty sharp."
3.0,"I normally wear a large 10-12, I am 5’2, 165 and purchased a large and this fits like a bodycon dress. The length is perfect...just above my knees but tight through out the entire dress. I will reorder in XL because that’s the only bigger size they have and hopefully it fits better because I think it’s a really cute dress...if not I will return.<br />***UPDATE*** I received XL...it fits in the body a little loose but the underarms are now  way too big. I returned. 🙁"
3.0,"These were ok, but my mother found nicer ones someplace else."
3.0,I am ordering a large medium was too small so yes bathing suit does run small
3.0,"The pins seemed really cheap to me and not quality enough to be able to trade them.  They did have the Disney stamp on the back, but I ended up returning them because they were really... well... ugly.  I'd rather pay full price and get good ones."
3.0,"I selected that this bra “fit as expected” - but I really mean that it wasn’t necessarily too big or too small,  but there is absolutely NO support.  I didn’t purchase to go jogging or to seriously work out in, but I don’t think there’s enough support to do light activities like walking the dog or housework.  Little bummed - I didn’t even look in the mirror, packed back up immediately."
3.0,"I got these on a sale, and they're okay.<br /><br />Pros: trendy, soft material, variety in style<br /><br />Cons: the clasp weighs more than the fabric, so unless you are literally choking yourself, it slides around to the front. Who doesn't love the front clasp look?<br /><br />I think  they are fine for the price, but I would not buy them at full cost."
3.0,This is exactly the kind of clip I wanted for my keys. I like carabiners but I don’t like how the key rings would slide around on it. I loved that this had a hole to attach the key ring to without having them slide around.<br /><br />It’s just too small and the clip is hard to use. I like to clip my keys to the strap of my backpack while I’m running errands instead of putting them in my bag and the clip is really hard to push down and then it’s just too small to clip it onto the strap. I end up having to put them in my bag anyway because the clip can’t do its job.<br /><br />I used to be able to just slap down on the strap with my carabiner to clip my keys to it before it broke and I’ve been trying to find the right clip ever since.<br /><br />This one comes really close but it’s just too dang small. I’ll keep using it until I find something better (or if they ever come out with a larger size).<br /><br />It’s well made and I love the design it just needs to be much bigger
3.0,"I wore the ears for Halloween.  They were quite nice.  I chose not to wear the bow tie and the tail looked like a short, furry, black penis, so I skipped that one as well.  It was well worth the price for the ears alone."
3.0,"Disappointed that ""women's"" shirts are now boxy like a men's shirt and not tapered at the waist or capped at the sleeve. The graphics are cute, but they look like tents. I am shaped like a female, not a linebacker. The fabrics are soft, the graphics are fine. Good thing I plan to just wear these around the house. I prefer my clothes fitted, not hanging on me like I stole my husband shirt. I am 5'5"" and about 140 lbs and the medium is huge on me. Restrictions in my state make shopping in person a chore, but shopping online has become one, also."
3.0,"These are beautiful, but the backs fall off causing me to lose the earring. I've tried different backs and nothing seems to work."
3.0,"The fabric is somewhat flimsy.  For activewear, it is probably okay for the warm weather months.  Not sure how it will hold up after being laundered."
3.0,"very thin material, a lot of extra string on each seam."
3.0,"It look nice on my daughter . Nothing special ,pretty colors .  We thought the waste was higher than it actually is ."
3.0,"Looks like a garbage bag, but it works for cos play"
3.0,"Nice. I bought the gold tone weeks ago and loved it immediately. I guess I am compararing this one with the gold tone; also antique in nature but very well done not brassy. The silver also antique in nature, seemed a little to dull at first appearance. But it is growing on me and you have to mind what you wear it against."
3.0,They stretch out fast. Like a half days wear and they are baggy and look awful. I like them and all. They are comfy but... Just loose shape fast.
3.0,"Would like it to be a little thicker, for my climate."
3.0,"I liked it for about the first five minutes I wore it, but it is just too bulky for me. The top prong sticks way out and the bottom jewel rubs my skin. I have an average medium build, not skinny but definitely not large, and when i sit down the size of the jewels causes it to push against my stomach and put strain on the belly button piercing. Someone who is thinner that doesn't have a little roll when they sit might have better luck with this jewelry. It has never caused me any skin irritation, which is saying something because I am very sensitive to certain cheaper metals. It also appears to be well made and, to the right person, I am sure would hold up pretty well."
3.0,"The sleeves are too short on me, by like 3-4 inches, they look better pushed up to my elbow. The fabric isn’t super thick, but does keep me warm. I was beyond the return window otherwise I would have returned it."
3.0,Very heavy and Not shinny. Looks like a dog leash. Not what I expected at all. Recommend 10 mm.
3.0,"I was really looking forward to wearing this bracelet when it came in the mail today. But one of the charms was missing, so it will be going back. I must say though, that it is a well made leather bracelet, and the charms are a nice stainless steel and not too heavy. I just wish the quality control was a little better with this company before the bracelet was mailed to a customer."
3.0,"Overall great fabric, has front lining but it was too small to my 8th  year old (she wears size 8 usually), especially in the leg opening, to tight."
3.0,"The item looks much bigger on the picture. I got them on a discount so I’m not complaining, yet if I paid full price, I would be highly upset over the size. Overall they’re some cute earrings for a baby or a toddler."
3.0,"I searched maturity dress and this showed up. I ordered it because it looked good on the model, however, when I received it .... lets just say it looked better on the model."
3.0,It’s very heavy
3.0,"zipper stitching failed after second wash which led to additional cost for repair, lightweight,comfortable but, lost it's value after the zipper issue. toss up for you"
3.0,"The outfit is nice, but the hood is a different shade of yellow than the stripes.  The hood is more gold than yellow and it is quite obvious that the shading is wrong.  The sleeves on the top are too short. The top needs about 2 inches on the sleeves.  Otherwise it's a nice outfit.  Not too heavy and not too thin."
3.0,The color is navy ... not blue!<br />It fits good. I am 5’9 C 36bust waist 28 hips 38<br />I went by the chart size and it was true to size!  The color was off... little mad about that!
3.0,"This belt fit perfectly and is good quality. However, the LV does not look real. The real one looks almost like fake gold. This one (IMO) looks a lot nicer but you can tell it’s fake bc LV has that gaudy shiny yellow gold and this is more of a textured gold. Anyone who buys actual LV can spot the difference a mile away."
3.0,I had previoiusly bought some Wilson headbands at Walmart.  The quality is much thicker than these headbands.  Wilson is more expensive but the quality is well worth it.  Sorry.
3.0,"I was disappointed because my heavy sleeper couldn't even wake up to the alarm.  It did work good as a watch, but wouldn't e er buy again."
3.0,"i've been looking for rhombus shape earrings for a while now, and when i found these i thought this is the pair i've been looking for, but when i got them was a bit disappointed because they are so light weight and kind of flimsy, the bottom attachment keeps getting stuck in a weird position. they look very nice, but they should have more than tinfoil weight"
3.0,"Nice shirt, but very small. Order 2x bigger than your normal size.<br />Shirt is very short compared to other tops sold in other colors."
3.0,"I was fooling myself when purchasing these for cycling in cold weather. They are a little on the small side, not very flexible, and the touchscreen compatibility is pretty poor. However, they do look nice and would go with my leather jacket (on the rare occasion its worn here in FL)."
3.0,Looked good but wasn't what I was expecting.
3.0,I’ve stopped using this band- it wouldn’t stay put on my wrist.
3.0,Very warm but a little bit small for me and my wife. Also a little bit big for my 7-year-old son.
3.0,Ordered it for a Halloween costume but runs small wish there was a little bit bigger size.
3.0,"This dress was cute but the fit didn't work for me. It came just to my knees and I'm almost 5'8&#34;.  The fabric of the floral print was a heavy - stretchy polyester and it's a hot summer where I live, so I returned it with no problem. Grateful for lots of shopping options and good return policies."
3.0,"Advertized as a compression tank, however, nothing more than a stretch tank. Otherwise, likes that it stretched, goes over head and shoulders with easy.  I like the feel of compression, and this is not an embracing tight compression fit.  Maybe purchasing a small would give me a tighter, smaller fit?"
3.0,You pay for what you get. The shell is very thin which helps keep the weight down however it is very flimsy. The side handle broke off on our first flight. Stores really well which is good for us since we only travel once a year.
3.0,after only a few weeks it already split apart in the band so will have to re glue it
3.0,"The boot isn’t bad besides being uncomfortable the steel plates dig into the top my feet, and they run big. Got my actually size and they’re to big.<br /><br />Other than that they do everything else they claim to, stylish, waterproof, slip resistant, etc<br /><br />I just can’t wear them comfortably"
3.0,"They are okay for gags. They do look like they are fake though because they don't want to stay on straight, they kind of go at an angle."
3.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, the picture does not make any justice it is more elegant and vibrant.The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the glass charm caught humidity I was disappointed, otherwise I was happy with it."
3.0,Not the material I was expecting.  And the tag left a sizeable hole in the pocket.
3.0,"These rings are beautiful and well crafted! However, i could not find any large size rings out of the 64PCS!!! (I mean sizes 10-11) for those with smaller fingers this shouldn’t be an issue! But i just thought I’d mention it.<br />They come in many different styles so i am sure you will be able to find a few rings that suit your taste!<br />Overall, i would recommend this product!"
3.0,Very stylish but not polarized( I usually buy Ray Ban)
3.0,"They will shrink, so I would recommend ordering a size larger."
3.0,I bought these in January and only wear them on occasion. They fit at the waist but are slightly too snug in the legs. (I have xs which is what I always get in the brand) One of the seams on the right leg was slightly messed up.l by the ankle.  They aren’t exactly breathable and show sweat. I had worn them for a little bit today and the seam on the left thigh had ripped and was coming undone until I changed.<br />I love the brand and have many great pieces but these were a disappointment.
3.0,The creases from being folded did not come out with wash and dry.  Had to iron them out.  Wrinkles during washing and don’t come out in dryer.
3.0,"For the price not bad. Pads do have some noise to them as they seem to be more of a styrofoam then a fabric. but I don't hear anything while working out. Fabric is not as breathable, but overall this is comfortable.  Best for low impact sports - i've used them for daily wear and crossfit."
3.0,Doesn't look quite as good as pictures but still cool design.. I do wish the coating they used didn't stay a blurry look tho. I've tried cleaning them many many times but there's always some kind of... well something that makes it blurry
3.0,These glasses sit on my nose heavy!
3.0,"Alright first the item fit...however busty ladies be where! When I first tried on the dress the empire hem went right under my jubblies, when I lifted my arms it ""popped"" right up onto them. I changed bras and the second time (modeling for my hubby) the hem stayed down. Its long enough for a dress on me (5'5'') I could see the pockets being a problem for some ladies depending on how they carry their weight, but again nice....<br />However...Im returning it...other then the tricky hem, it did have a weird lemony dirt smell, as I was modeling it for my hubby the ""elastic"" started to itch a bit on my skin and he noticed my skin was turning red! Im sure if you try it on, like it, then wash it, it should be fine but it was a deal killer for me. So good luck ladies!"
3.0,Tight fit seen small  ordered my normal shoe size!  Though I had ordered sketches the good shoes not Chinese junk
3.0,the material is very light weight - as in thin - as in you could make a shirt out of it. not what I look for in a jacket. but having said that it works. am keeping it. but doubt it will be a durable item in my work wardrobe.
3.0,The quality of the product is very good but it runs very small. My grandson is 33 months and I ordered a size 4 which is too small. I will be exchanging it.
3.0,"very wide, and while its nice that the arms can be snapped back on. they seem to come off too often."
3.0,"The fabric and garment as a whole is very nice but it runs short in the crotch.  I got one size larger to allow for shrinkage but even the bigger size was short in the crotch, although otherwise it would have been perfect."
3.0,"The shirt fabric is thin, and I bought it larger than I needed, the medium fits like a large."
3.0,"Little small at waiste and the length is like a cropped pant. It sits above my ankles. I am 5'5"" and it's like lounge flood pants. Its ok, but wish it advertised these were shorter."
3.0,This is a nice pair of shorts if you like them a little on the short size. I wish I had a model's thighs because they are a little baggy there. I guess it's an incentive to do some squats.
3.0,"When these collars arrived, I was excited, they looked so crisp and seemed very sturdy. There are no labels in these collars with washing instructions or even telling you what fabric they are made from. I decided to wash them in cold water on delicate and, not knowing how to dry them I dried them on a clothes rack. I was so disappointed when they dried terribly wrinkled. I ironed one using a handkerchief over the collar and pressed out most of the wrinkles, but it no longer looks as it did when they arrived. When I wear it the tips of the collar flip out and it looks very cheap. I suppose if I had starched it before pressing it might look better but that's a lot of work. Very disappointed!"
3.0,It’s fits great! The pockets are too small. The material was not the best quality. Shipping time was too long
3.0,It's cute but impossible to shape. The brim is no problem but the cap part is a wrinkly mess. Runs a little smallish but should stay on in the wind.
3.0,Not quite what I expected fit was a little off what I expected.
3.0,Not a bad product but runs small. I ordered 38C thinking I would have a little wiggle room but found it to barely fit around.
3.0,"Fits great, look OK. I thought I was buying wine red/burgundy, instead what I got is a vivid bright red. I may have to return it. According to the description here on this website and the color does not equal what I receive in the mail."
3.0,Cozy but lettering is cheap.
3.0,Love the Dress. Looked amazing for the holidays. Only down side is the pearls have been coming off.
3.0,These tank tops fit somewhat small.
3.0,Love the purse but zipper broke after a month.  It makes me sick.
3.0,Wrong color delivered day of my Xmas pics
3.0,"This crinoline was perfect for my granddaughters flower girl dress.  It is made nice, 3 layers (top smooth, middle the netting, and another smooth layer next to the skin),  and gave the flower girl dress the fullness it needed.  I gave it 3 stars because the smell of the material was horrible.  I had to spray it with Philosophy Pure Grace...like saturate it and then hang it outside for a few hours.  Also it was a little longer but that was an easy fix as I rolled the waistband over."
3.0,Nice top. Fits loose and comfortable. A little disappointed with the V Neck length because the pic shows a deep v neck and the shirt doesn't seem to be the exact shirt as shown
3.0,"These are nice earrings, but I have not worn them yet because I haven't figured out how to put them in. Strange hook and clasp. Would be very nice if able to get them in my ears. Maybe someone can help me out?"
3.0,"Unfortunately,  my world keeps dropping of the chain. Otherwise it is fantastic. My 15 yr old keeps trying to &#34;borrow&#34; it"
3.0,Warm jacket but to wear only at home or around...not for going out because it look cheap enough.
3.0,I remember these being a little heavier and thicker it seemed like they were just a little bit lighter maybe I'm mistaken but there they seemed a little lighter in material as far as what it feels like
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YWPSMS6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8
3.0,For my sister
3.0,I ordered a large because I like my bottoms a little bigger but it fit like a medium.
3.0,"This was smaller than what I imagined... more so on the short side. I have a long torso though and I am 5'8"" and this shirt was at my waist...if I raised my arms, it would but a little much. Also, the material is pretty thin. You will have to wear a tank-top or camisole under."
3.0,"The original boot laces from my Chippewa boots were really durable and strong and lasted two years, Wow. I just got these laces, waxed and the package said waxed but they felt and looked like Walmart boot laces and they come untied at least twice a day which really irritates me. I really wish I could find those original laces because I work in a giant production warehouse on cement standing 95% of the time. Working on my third year with my Chippewa boots and they still feel like steel toed warm fuzzy slippers!!"
3.0,This is beautiful but a stone fellout in the package.  Havn't decided what to do with it yet.
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture. They are cheaper.
3.0,Cute but not swim trunks as they lack the built in underwear. My son can wear them as regular shorts though.
3.0,Almost a women's watch. the face is very small. P.S. Nothing is wrong with a women's watch. It's just too feminine for my taste.
3.0,Bit of a tight squeeze getting the cargo through
3.0,It wasn’t breathable. Would return but don’t want to go through the trouble.
3.0,"Too big for a 5' 1"" 110lb girl to wear under a scooter helmet without it falling into her eyes."
3.0,OK bag.  Bigger than it looks.  Not a comfortable cross body.
3.0,"The pendant is nice but the chain is a box chain and it is too thick and overwhelms the size of the pendant.  The box chain is choker length.  Upon removing it from the bag, it was knotted.  It was relatively easy to untangle, but several of the links were kinked.  Again, it was easy to straighten, but a little annoying.  You cannot remove the pendant from this chain."
3.0,Paint chips easily
3.0,"If you are looking for a thick ring they are good, but they are too thick for my liking."
3.0,These were really cute. Passed them out as party favors. About four of them have come apart. The little unicorn falls off kind of easily. Probably not glued on good enough. Other than that are cute and change colors. :)
3.0,This shirt may have been ok in a solid color but the floral print looks really badly. Nowhere near as nice as in the pictures.<br /><br />Edit: after wearing this shirt I also realized what people were talking about with the right sleeves. I did some digging through the review pictures and realized that there was a huge difference with the cut/neck line of the shirt I received and the ones others received. I would guess that the different experiences with the sleeves were due to people receiving different style shirts.
3.0,"From a distance they looked more like plastic circles that a third grader would wear, which is why I ultimately returned them."
3.0,"comfortable, but shows alot of cleavage and my bra too. Will have to put a modesty stitch in it"
3.0,"cute style, nice brim size and fold, but just too big.  Too bad, It was cute. Returned."
3.0,These shoes are cute but we are returning because the soles are not rubber and don't seem to have much traction.
3.0,"I am 5’9, 135 lbs and size 34D. I usually wear a small or size 6. Bought a medium in green and was surprised at how snug this sweater fits in the bust and arms. Love the long length and quality of fabric.  Have to return because there are streaks across the front as if the dye did not color the fabric smoothly."
3.0,"I like the way the hat looks, but being a woman on the small side, it was a little larger than I expected. I did buy hat sizers and will try that to snug up the fit.  Other than that is is a great hat, good quality fabric."
3.0,"works as described, nice, however, the closure mechanism wore out after 3 months, won't stay closed."
3.0,Run's Small..
3.0,It is nice but way to big. But cheap enough so i took it to be altered
3.0,"Literally opened the package and the seams on the shorts and shirt were coming apart. Cheaply made. Thankfully I can fix them, but I’m disappointed."
3.0,"Nice. It is simple watch, just waterproof and nice look. Nothing special."
3.0,I absolutely love the charm.. It's so beautiful and sparkles and is a nice solid weight. The chain on the other hand is so thin and made of the thinnest weakest material and can't be used with this charm. It gets tangled and breaks immediately. I had to switch to a chain I already owned. But the price is so amazing I am not complaining... It was worth the charm.
3.0,A little large on the face but comfortable to wear. Easy to change lenses once watched on YouTube.
3.0,Good glasses but came with a bent frame and a scratch across the lenses
3.0,They were pretty..flimsy
3.0,"As soon as I pulled them out of the box, I saw them and thought they looked small. When I tried them on, they were. I returned and replaced with a bigger size. I did not know they'd have EUR shoe size markings on them. They are nice shoes though."
3.0,Gave as a gift.  Person liked it a lot.
3.0,It fit everywhere but across the bust line it tends to pull at the buttons and look to tight.
3.0,"I think this might be my third purchase of this watch. I only gave it three stars because it is so cute. However it always falls apart and the pieces separate.  So as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Nice patterns, ok quality. Threads become loose easily."
3.0,I accidentally ordered 2 of them. Pretty to look at but tarnishes in a couple days where the skin meets flesh.  I've had my piercing for about 2 years now so it's not a matter of a healing wound damaging metal. Still wearable you just have to keep it turned to keep the tarnished part (about 4 millimeters) hidden. Had to hold onto one as I was travelling and needed something urgently. We'll see how it holds up in a few weeks of wear. Maybe the tarnish will spread in which case it will be a waste of money.
3.0,If you have a belly that sticks out this will not be flattering because at the waist is a sheer part u can see clearly through. Cute dress but it rides up and it's seven shorter then it looks. Bought it for my daughter. She didn't care for the way it looked on her either
3.0,This dress fit great. I got the navy and just wasn’t a fan of the color for what I needed it for.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:6896ff52a3d9bd47ecb025da6861af88]] Too big. Slides off face. Question thinness. However, style bound for compliments."
3.0,crystal was out when i got it.
3.0,Nice parka length but no pockets
3.0,I was not happy with my order. when the package got here I was happy to get it but then I was really disappointed that the ring in the set was broken upon opening
3.0,I like the looks and comfort of it but the strap keeps getting loose .
3.0,"Nothing special, but and OK price."
3.0,"It's mostly the sleeves.  I'm 5'3"" and an extra large size fits a bit short in the sleeves"
3.0,I needed these to take on vacation so though not the best quality they fit my needs at the time.
3.0,"I’m so sad because I genuinely like this bathing suit cut and silhouette. Granted, the pattern of swimming women is bizarre, but it’s easy for the eye to treat it as an abstract pattern from a small distance. The asymmetrical cut and ruching at the waist is a great design for comfort and coverage. Unfortunately, the cups do not fit me: 5’1, 34DD, 33, 40. I do love this suit from below the cups down, but a size 10 is too small for my DD chest. Straps are detachable and slide adjustable.  I still love the style enough to buy this again at a bigger size for better fit on chest so only three stars due to odd print."
3.0,It's no carthart that's for sure. Thinner than expected for the money. You're basically paying for the label. Graphics are nice ......would shown up better if they were embroidered.
3.0,Cup size is horribly wrong but still a good material
3.0,"REALLY cute shoes!! Fit is great and true to size. The only negative that I can say about these shoes is that it takes a while to get to you being that it comes from China. Also, one of the metal rings that hold the shoe laces broke within the first hr or so of wearing them.. my daughters rough on shoes but she loves these and was trying her best to be careful. Highly doubt it had anything to do with the west so much as the make.."
3.0,"I haven't noticed polarization effect with these glasses. Neither  they make other objects more visible like it is shown on the pictures.<br />All they do - make the light from the other cars a little bit dimmer and make the world around yellosh. That reduces eyes  strain, that is true, but I expected more from them. At least I won't order the second pair for my wife, like I did with daylight polarized sunglasses. The daylight ones work better."
3.0,"Sweater runs a little small, and the head hole is tiny so if you have a big head BEWARE! I guess my head is huge because I struggle getting this one over my head lol"
3.0,I've had these for a few months now and they're still off gassing pretty bad. My dog buries them in the couch and sneezes a lot when shes around them. I bought them to use at the gym sauna but thinking about all the chemicals in the rubber potentially leaching into my skin freaks me out to much to wear them longer than it takes to let my dog into the yard.
3.0,It's very pretty but not as long as I'd have liked.
3.0,Material  not cotton look like satin African print always cotton would return  it too much trouble
3.0,most of these tops are so paper thin....it's difficult to find good quality tops
3.0,"Perhaps it’s my problem, but I sweated right through it the second time I wore it."
3.0,Good quality but if you have anything other than skinny legs you will find these close fitting in the thighs. My heavy squatting days are well behind me but these are still tight. The fabrics moves well so it doesn't constrict but I would personally prefer more width.  The length is good however.
3.0,I do not like the bumpy texture.
3.0,"Fit great and is a pretty good quality, but just wore it a second time and the stitches below the zipper came apart while I was out!"
3.0,Used as casual wear but was surprised it was that shortu
3.0,"Colors are ok. Sizing is ok. I am long waisted, and these are not."
3.0,You can’t compare this to your Lululemon or other namebrand that is A+ plus quality but these are pretty great for just wearing around the house or outside to work in and you shouldn’t expect a plus quality for this price.
3.0,Disappointed in quality of printing. Looks like it's flaking or wasn't printed well.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress and it was beautiful, but it was so big! and the length was ridiculous! I am small, 5'2"" and 102 pounds, but this just hung on me and you'd have to be at least 5'7"" for the length to be right.<br /><br />If you have boobs and are taller, it would be a lovely dress. I had planned to wear to a music festival."
3.0,"The pants are good, long enough and the waist fits my husband who has a 32 waist but the shirt was too small for him. The sleeves were not long enough they were only 3/4 on him. The thermal does keep him warm just wish the shirt was full length."
3.0,"Basic packaging.  Intuitive to set, not fancy, but works well.  The watch is kind of bulky, be ready to wear a huge watch!"
3.0,Very very wide.
3.0,product to wide
3.0,"Runs extremely small, no zip up but looks great"
3.0,doesn't feel like good quality as expect
3.0,Kind of big and don't fit all that great but very pretty to look at
3.0,"These were slightly smaller than expected, but that worked for us. My biggest issue was that I ordered the army green and instead was given Navy blue. The grip on the bottom isn't the best. Overall though, these are good looking shoes that I expect to last a while."
3.0,This is very pretty but I was expecting a cotton type t-shirt.  It's made of some type of polyester or nylon.. it looks like a nurse's top.  I gave it away to someone...
3.0,"Body contour,  nice"
3.0,"5'2"" 135 pounds. Size Medium. If you are chesty, like me, this dress will look blocky. Fabric is nice."
3.0,These are SUPER CUTE but the post are super cheap and bend ver easily.
3.0,It’s a good band but just don’t wear it often and make sure to clean it. It irritated my skin to the point where it burned.
3.0,Nice watch but the face isn’t blue at all like the picture shows.
3.0,"I bought this set of three after falling in love with two similar ones. They are just what I wanted!<br /><br />But I am deducting two full stars because of the excessive plastic packaging. Each tank top was in a plastic bag, the three tops were grouped in another plastic bag, and that bag was shipped in another plastic mailer with no recycling label on it. Was all of this really necessary, especially for a product labeled organic?"
3.0,Overpriced for what it is.  Basically a strap with two metal plates.  If i knew then what I know now I would have purchased something else for less or a better designed product.
3.0,"2 sizes to large, order down. :)"
3.0,Quality hat but the style is not to my sons liking. The dome part of the hat is really tall.
3.0,"Kind of big and roomy (I should have gotten a medium...I think the size info is wrong on this item), but since I am using it as a dressing gown/bathrobe, I will probably keep it."
3.0,"I actually bought this for a costume, but ended up not using it. While it is soft and comfortable,  the white is sheer and it was not a flattering look. You would do better with a darker color. Quality is good, just not a great look for me"
3.0,They are cute but noticeably fake
3.0,"This dress is boxy and very mumu like (which I actually like, being as the mumu look is in, and I also recently gave birth to twins). But the length was odd. It was way too Long on me. I’m 5-3 and it was more like a maxi. I had to alter it. Also because it is shapeless and Long, it isn’t very sexy, also another reason why I shortened it. After shortening it, it is very cute. It you are tall, it may look better without altering. Also  wish the material wasn’t polyester, or material that feels like polyester. It would be nicer is made from cotton or a silk blend or linen blend. I hate polyester because it looks kinda cheap and isn’t comfortable in the tropics (where I live)."
3.0,Not the most attractive chain. Doesn't want to lay flat. Disappointing...
3.0,This was so cute and bought this for my daughter in law and after a while it tarnished not really worth the money
3.0,The material is good quality. Looks like it will hold up to washing and regular wear quite well. As some else mentioned the pockets sort of stick up and makes it look funny at the hips. It is more noticable because of the cinched waist.
3.0,"Looks like, fits like a vet tech shirt... probably do to its cut and material."
3.0,It served the purpose. Not my favorite
3.0,Snags easily. But it's cute.
3.0,NOT short sleeved. More like a tank top with ruffled arm hole seams.
3.0,"These are cute drawstring shorts, but boy are they sheer! The fabric is very thin and practically see-through. I like the look of them-- the polka dots are lots of fun and the pink is a pretty shade. They're definitely something I would use as pajamas vs lounge wear. They seem to wash well, though I don't know if trust these lasting a long time, due to the thin material used."
3.0,"These are really pretty booties, but I had to give them to my wife after washing.  Very soft too.  They shrank from large to small.  Small enough that my sized 10 feet actually went numb from wearing them for a few minutes."
3.0,Cool earrings. Be careful to test them out first they broke me out.
3.0,2 headbands ok 1 the white headband had someone's blood on. It was small dot of blood but threw away unacceptable to receive a product with blood on it
3.0,Pretty and as expected.
3.0,moc needs insole
3.0,Fit is big. I need 2 sizes smaller. I like the material and length so will have to return and reorder
3.0,The material is soft to touch and expands to suit your body. The size is somewhat small. Need one size larger if you like this dress.
3.0,"It's a really cute dress I love the fabric and style. I gave it 3 star rating because the bust area is to small. I ordered an XL, I am a 38D. It is high wasted and I'm short waisted."
3.0,"LOVE these! I bought a Large because it was suggested by Amazon and according to the size scale it looked like a Large would be best. I wish I got a medium; they are too big in the crotch and not tight enough around my waist they keep slipping down..not cute hiking my pants up in the parking lot once I get out of the car. Or in the middle of the grocery store! But they are lightweight, comfortable, and most importantly: POCKETS!"
3.0,Emblem press on
3.0,Suppose to be able to return without problem. Im contacting them next. runs too small-china
3.0,Bought a size larger but fits like the size she is growing out of. Looks better in person then in photographs!
3.0,"I ordered a medium because that is my shirt size. However, it did seem to be somewhat small, but still wearable. Also, it is a very thick sweatshirt, so I am not sure if getting the larger size will be the right fit."
3.0,"It’s ok, side slits are a little long and shirt is shorter than you would expect. Especially when I ordered a size bigger in hopes it would be longer."
3.0,"No Santa Hair,  missing hair, ordered twice.  The Picts show Hair & Beard  Did get Beard but none for head🙃. No head hair in either order🙃"
3.0,"Nice shirt, but size L fit smaller than typical M"
3.0,Not a big fan of the skinny jeans but they fit good and cute
3.0,"After reading all the reviews, I ordered one size up. It came still smaller than I expected. I did see someone said you need order two size up and I believe it is true.  The material is ok. The sleeves are too long. The dress is in mid calf, too long as well. I will have to find a tailor to make some adjustments."
3.0,"The only problem I have with it (I bought this for an Among us costume) and the crotch was SOOOOO long for no reason. Mind you I am rather short, however now I’m stuck and don’t know what to do :/"
3.0,"I returned the shirt I purchased. My main problems are 1- the 'sleeves' aren't really sleeves.  There is barely anything that falls over the shoulder.  Less than a cap sleeve even.  2- It's much like a dolman fit, where the arm hole falls very low. Just doesn't work on my figure.  3- The front isn't quite long enough for me. I'm 5'11'' and I like to have extra coverage in the front region.  This falls a little too short for my torso/hip/area. ;)  The color was beautiful (teal) and the material felt comfortable and, though it arrived incredibly wrinkled, seemed like it would fall nicely after some ironing."
3.0,Larger than I though
3.0,"It felt uncomfortable and awkward and made my breasts look like pancakes and not round and flattering as expected. However, since I purchased this bra to wear underneath a backless, unlined summer cotton blouse, the one positive aspect was that it provided adequate coverage and was not see-through."
3.0,The inside of these gloves were wet after a few hours of skiing.
3.0,"These leggings are SO soft. However I do think they are too warm for inside use. They would be great for walking arou d outside in the winter. That being said, I won't keep them because there is a double sewn line all the way down the crotch and down the back to the butt. So I would have to wear an extra long shirt or dress to hide that, otherwise it looks very goofy."
3.0,"According to your measurements I ordered the size slightly smaller than my measurements but the item, even after shrinking in the dryer, is at least 2 sizes too big."
3.0,Fit only a little girl arm.
3.0,"The shorts fit pretty true to size. There is no give to the material, order accordingly. The material in the advertised picture looks soft, the shorts I got were definitely not. I did keep them as they fit well, but I was disappointed in the material."
3.0,The price was excellent and it shipped out quickly  The only drawback was the quality was not the best but I am still satisfied
3.0,"My son asked me to order this for him.  The hands are bigger than they appear, too big.  I think with the size being larger than expected, my son does not often wear this necklace.  Just be aware it is big.  Maybe some young people will like the bigger size, but for my son I think it was overkill."
3.0,it looks nice but it is not adjustable as they said.  It has something inside for smaller fingers so they will not fall off.  Unless you have very small fingers this will not work.  Very disappointed...
3.0,"Just as you'd expect for Asian sizing; i bought the largest size available but fit like a US large, maybe even a medium. Other than the sizing, it's good quality and the osomatsu symbol is painted on perfectly. Very soft on the inside"
3.0,"I really just the design, but it just too big for my daughter, had to return it."
3.0,"Don't know if I can accurately review this product since I ordered a medium and received a large. I didn't want to return, so I tried the large. It has a good shape to it. Didn't get the lower tummy flat as I had hoped (having had a baby recently) but that might be because of the incorrect size. The fabric isn't very stretchy, so it would have been a struggle to get into the medium for sure."
3.0,"It claims to be a 12 mm length bar but when I got it, it was 11 mm! I could still wear it because I have a 12 mm bar to put the ends on, but it was an inconvenience especially since it was supposed to be 12 mm."
3.0,"The graphic is great but for a Husky size, the pants run small. They were tight on my grandson."
3.0,"Very beautiful Dress . However , the bow fell off and had a weird smell when I received . Somehow it smelled like fish not sure why"
3.0,Beautiful bathing suit! And well made material. You definitely need two sizes up though. I normally wear an XL and then 2X was too small.
3.0,"Overall, very cheaply made BUT for the price it is worth it. My three year old loves it and that’s all that matters"
3.0,The fabric was thinner and coarser than I would have liked.
3.0,I wish the stomach area was tighter. It hangs like a bag around the opening. But overall the dress is gorgeous and if that part was fixed it would be an amazing item.
3.0,Love the style and fit. Disappointed in the quality of the outer material. Ours have already lost a lot of the brown on the toes. And he has only worn them a couple of times.
3.0,Nice top.  Sleeves are tight since I have thicker arms.
3.0,The outfit had a hole where the belt is connected to the waist. Not a big concern for me. I just used my handy needle and thread. The fit is perfect. Overall a good buy.
3.0,Me agrada que son tres piezas en una. Muy buen material. No me agrada que la argolla de enganche es demasiada pequeña y no logra entrar con facilidad al agujero de la oreja.
3.0,My daughter liked it .. But it broke just after she put it on :(
3.0,Smaller than the photos
3.0,I wouldn’t call it a blazer. More like an open shirt. The fabric is similar to any thinner button up shirt but kinda sounds like a wind breaker when it rubs together. Hope that makes sense. It won’t sit on me like it looks in the picture. The “collar” isn’t really there. It isn’t bad. Can wear it but its not a blazer replacement at all.
3.0,"Mask looks exactly like its picture.  It does not have a nose wire and leaves a slight gap under the eyes and on the sides. There is a nice pocket for a filter. The filter holder is a bit large so there's extra fabric on the inside that tickles my nose and lips. The mask is fairly comfortable cotton material on the inside, doesn't make my face sweat as much as other masks. The elastic band is adjustable with a little rubber band clamp you can slide, not quite so easily, but once it's moved, it stays in place. The mask doesn't go below my chin front. I think they should use less material on the inside and more material on the outside, make the outside larger to better cover the chin and nose area. Add a nose wire so it conforms to the face better. As far as looks, the material is sturdy. The color is excellent. It's well sewn. The fit is poor."
3.0,"Looks kind of cheap but, it was cheap so...."
3.0,"The quality of these is wonderful. Flowers are ceramic & screwed in firmly. I was very pleased with the quality, however, they are so heavy on my nose they give me a headache. It was highly disappointing because they're so beautiful."
3.0,"These glasses are very wide for my head. They are also flimsy. Would probably look good with some type of futuristic costume. They make you look crazy instead of cool. If you have a big head, they may be okay for you."
3.0,"Pendant is much bigger than expected! I was hoping for a smaller size. Is nice, just too big!"
3.0,I like it but it doesn't fit around my face :(
3.0,Too big (gaudy)for my taste.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. I bought these for my son so he can have a collection of ties for occasional use. They tie ok, the knot is ok but you can’t get that dimple you get with higher quality ties. A little stiff, not sure what kind of silk but it must be a high poly blend. Just so so. Patterns are very nice tho, but one feel and you can tell they are cheap."
3.0,Not as comfy as shown.
3.0,Showed up in a baggy and looked like someone  wore them before. To late to return needed them for Halloween. Washed them first of course
3.0,Cute at first but lasted a month would not buy again
3.0,"The cammo print on the second wash, washes away"
3.0,"I ordered these in large for my son who is 5' 11"" & they are atleast 6 inches too long. Also, I ordered Gray & they came in black, no biggie. Wish they weren't so long but he likes them!"
3.0,Not meant for petite individuals. It looks very similar to a potato sack.
3.0,Very cute but pretty small
3.0,They were nice but too big for me. I returned them
3.0,"It's a nice hat over all. The emblem doesn't look professional and looks like it'll fall off with use but it's okay. It glows very little and can barely be seen. Nothing like the picture. If I were to have seen this in the store, I would've passed on getting it. Not much FF merch out there so i decided to keep it."
3.0,"Seems like good quality. Nice organization of interior pockets for money and documents.<br /><br />However, this is incredibly thick. Perhaps the thickness of the leather is necessary to block RFID, but this is way too thick to carry in a pocket. It should do well to protect your passport in a backpack or luggage, but don't expect to carry this on a pocket like a wallet."
3.0,"It's okay<br />I have a white and blue trim that I love, but not on Amazon"
3.0,Very cheap. Already falling apart.
3.0,Not a bad looking product. I mainly bought them because of the white and black camo pattern on the right leg but it’s actually black and flat gray. These are my second pair of compression pants. I got a Medium based on the chart. The waist fits nice but they’re not very tight on the legs. It’s a nice comfortable fit but I wonder if they’ll even benefit at the lack of compression. I’m 5’11 and 150 pounds. I saw a question on whether they are see-thru when you bend and they are. These feel and look like women’s yoga pants rebranded for men’s compression pants. I know because I wore women’s yoga pants before I bought my first pair of men’s compression pants. On the other hand they are very comfortable and breath well. I’m also certain they’ll help with sweat wicking. But I’m giving it a 3 star because they aren’t that tight on the legs and look like female yoga pants. I was hoping for a nice tight fit for thigh and calf compression but I feel more like Peter Pan at the gym.
3.0,I thought I was ordering Sketchers. I was deceived.
3.0,Pretty necklace but the back is hollow so if the small circle flips you see the hollow backside. I returned the necklace for this reason.
3.0,"I really like the design of this shirt. I bought it for breast cancer surgery. The problem is the material. Everything sticks to the knit material. Dust, lint, hair...it's  almost like it attracts every particle within 6 feet. I had to carry a lint roller everytime I wore it. My least favorite shirt. It's  going to goodwill."
3.0,I measured and went based on the size chart but it was much too large. Quality seemed good though.
3.0,"I bought a 1xfor my teen daughter who will be in a production of Wizard of Oz. This is larger than she usually needs but I read the reviews and sized up. It was still too small. especially in the bust, and the arms were too tight.<br /><br />Other than that, it is nice and a more authentic design than other plus sized Dorothy costumes."
3.0,"These took me by surprise,they actually were not as bad as the reviews stated but,whoever tried them before must have a much larger head/face? They slipped down without any help from me and they fit so large I was just uncomfortable, and that was just a quick try on.Imagine if I had to wear something on your face that drove you nuts all day? No thank you.One other reason I returned them,the seller put them in a box,no protection at all,just a couple of crumbled up wax paper pieces? WTH? And to really add insult to injury;he’s trying to keep the 7$ for shipping?? They came in a cheap box delivered  by the postal service,plus I did the work to send them back.He did nothing.I should mention,no eyeglass case either,since when do people sell glasses without one??"
3.0,"The pants fit true to size,  but the material over the padded knee is very thin.  They got a hole within a week. If your kid is aggressive on the court,  these won't last."
3.0,Nose piece doesn’t fit this lens
3.0,"Super cute boot! My 6yr old loved them, my only complaint is they do not hold up well at all. They Crack and the black starts peeling off , wierd. But true to size and very cute just wish they lasted longer."
3.0,Looks just like the picture. Wish it had a little bit more stretch to it. Probably should go up a size to make up for that.
3.0,Comfortable and lightweight but do not absorb as much of my sweat for a heavy workout. Perfect for a light workout.
3.0,"Very  small. I would love the dress if it fit anywhere near the dress as presented in the photo.  Really nice fabric, but much too tight in the arms and chest, and shorter than expected."
3.0,"Llegó antes de lo esperado. Es de fantasía, muy lijero. El empaque no fue el adecuado, pues al abrirlo venía roto uno de los aretes. Lo tendré que devolver."
3.0,I was disappointed the dress came with the wrong belt. I had bought shoes to match the belt. I was very upset because I had bought my grand baby the outfit for a party.
3.0,"These fit really nicely, and the quality seems fine, but when I first got them, I had a hard time opening all of them (I almost thought they were a bad batch and didn't even have an opening until my husband finally got one apart and I could see where it separated) I finally got one in and it's REALLY cute, but getting it out is more work than I think it should be worth lol. All in all, for the price, it's worth it for how many you get, but, I was a little disappointed with how hard they are to open and close."
3.0,Ok quality very skimpy
